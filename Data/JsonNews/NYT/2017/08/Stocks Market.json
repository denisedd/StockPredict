{"Headline": "Wall Street\u2019s Patience With Retailers\u2019 Turnaround Efforts Runs Thin", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time Macy\u2019s increased its sales, Donald J. Trump had not started running for president and the Chicago Cubs still had not won a World Series in more than a century.Traditional department stores like Macy\u2019s have been trying to reinvent themselves, shedding stores and expanding their e-commerce operations to try to compete with Amazon and other online retailers. But this week, Wall Street\u2019s patience with such turnaround efforts wore thin, amid a string of unsettling earning reports by brick-and-mortar retailers.After Macy\u2019s reported another sales decline in the second quarter on Thursday, its share price fell more than 10 percent.On Friday, J. C. Penney shares hit their lowest price in a decade, falling 16 percent after the company said its profit margins had softened more than analysts had expected. Kohl\u2019s also fell on Friday after it reported earnings. And some analysts expect Sears to report a third consecutive double-digit decline in same-store sales for the second quarter.Before releasing second-quarter earnings this week, the retailers had raised Wall Street\u2019s hopes that the industry was showing signs of a comeback.\u201cThe expectations were getting higher that maybe things were starting to improve,\u201d said Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst at Citigroup. \u201cBut the results didn\u2019t meet those expectations.\u201dWhen J. C. Penney announced on July 10 that its chief financial officer was leaving, the company said that it expected to report \u201csignificantly improved top line results this quarter versus the first quarter.\u201dOther glimmers of improvement appeared across the department store industry. Foot traffic in malls was still down, but not as much as in previous quarters. Credit card data, which investors scour for clues about the retail sector, showed more people shopping in big department stores.That brightening outlook put pressure on a group of investors \u2014 mostly hedge funds \u2014 that have been shorting retail stocks, or betting that the share prices will fall.The retail sector is the second most actively shorted industry in the stock market behind the software and internet sector, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. And short bets on retailers have increased 18 percent since Jan. 1.Other investors and industry specialists have dismissed such apocalyptic warnings as overblown. While some of the weaker companies with large debt loads may collapse, stronger brick-and-mortar retailers \u2014 not just Amazon \u2014 will take market share, these people say.\u201cThis is going to be the best of times for retailers that are well capitalized,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm.Then came the actual second-quarter results this week. J. C. Penney said its sales rose in the quarter, but its gross profit margins were far lower than what analysts had predicted.The company was hit particularly hard because it is more indebted than many retailers and has been losing money.Like Macy\u2019s, J. C. Penney has been selling many of its stores. But analysts say the quality of its real estate is not as high as that of Macy\u2019s, which has prime locations in New York and San Francisco.The results announced by Macy\u2019s were slightly better than expected, but analysts noted that challenges in the company\u2019s fundamental retail business of selling clothing and home goods were being masked by profits it was generating through the sale of stores and from the income it collects on Macy\u2019s credit cards.Morgan Stanley\u2019s retail analyst described the Macy\u2019s results in a research note Friday as \u201cless bad, but not enough.\u201dNordstrom\u2019s, which also reported results this week, has been able to win over more investors to its strategies for integrating its stores and e-commerce sites.Nordstrom\u2019s, which is based in Seattle, said on Thursday that it was expanding the number of cities where shoppers can reserve clothing item online and try it on in a store \u2014 a service that few other retailers offer.On Wall Street, the reality is setting in that reinventing a business model that dates back generations will be time-consuming and expensive at best, and may not work.Retailers are gaining from finding new uses for unprofitable stores. But the costs of creating a network of e-commerce warehouses and top-flight digital capabilities are eating into precious profit margins.\u201cA big challenge changing from one channel to another,\u201d said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, \u201cis the expense.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Stocks Reach New Heights, What\u2019s Trump Got to Do With It?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dIt was, all things considered, a factually accurate statement. Business is looking better. The stock market is at a high. And, yes, it did not happen by itself.The question, however, is this: Has anything that has happened at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had anything to do with it?Putting aside the administration\u2019s inability to successfully pass any meaningful legislation thus far \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot to put aside \u2014 can Mr. Trump fairly take any credit for the market\u2019s trajectory? After all, when I and others talk to C.E.O.s and investors, one constant refrain we hear is that they actually expect little to get done on the legislative front.Where they repeatedly said they were expecting big changes \u2014 that will translate into higher profits \u2014 was in Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to lower regulatory burdens and costs, something that he could accomplish, in part, through executive orders and the appointment of regulators who are less inclined to enforce the rules aggressively.But that\u2019s not right. Listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks \u2014 which are the real reason the stock market has soared \u2014 and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations.The only time the word \u201cregulation\u201d was even used on Apple\u2019s earnings call \u2014 during which the company described how it beat analysts\u2019 estimates by a wide margin \u2014 was in reference to China. The word did not get a mention on Amazon\u2019s earnings call, nor was there any reference to Washington at all, despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth.Even on Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings call, which included several questions and answers related to regulations, not once did any official suggest that the firm\u2019s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens. Indeed, the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses.\u201cThe administration is, at a minimum, telling a one-sided story \u2014 it\u2019s a bit disingenuous,\u201d Charles Campbell, managing director at MKM Partners, said about Mr. Trump and his team\u2019s taking credit for the rising stock market. \u201cFor the average American who is uninformed, it probably passes\u201d as sounding correct, he lamented.But Mr. Campbell said it was \u201ca little early\u201d for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts. \u201cThis is the first full reporting period, quite honestly,\u201d since Mr. Trump took office, he noted.In industries like finance, Mr. Campbell said, stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be business-friendly changes in the regulatory environment. \u201cIt is the anticipation that there will be an effect,\u201d he said.It is very true that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of United States companies, but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch.The larger issue is, when it does happen, how much can deregulation really help juice the economy?The answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy.According to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume.But here\u2019s the rub: It isn\u2019t that simple, in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like $225 billion.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market\u2019s Surge Meets Dollar\u2019s Swoon", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix months into the Trump presidency, two symbols of American financial might \u2014 the Dow and the dollar \u2014 have taken divergent paths, highlighting the complexities that investors face as the global economy hums, while Washington is enmeshed in political turmoil.Over this same period, the United States dollar has lost about 10 percent of its value against a basket of six major currencies.The near-mirror image fall in the dollar has been especially pronounced in recent weeks, stemming in part from concerns that President Trump\u2019s political problems will hamper his ability to pass a major tax reduction or an infrastructure bill.Yet those concerns have yet to halt the stock market\u2019s seemingly unstoppable advance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to record highs in the Dow as a validation of his administration, posting on Twitter on Tuesday morning:\u201cStock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d\u201cWhether you like the administration, the people, the rhetoric or not, there is no overstating just how powerful the animal spirits have been,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer for Deltec International Group, an investment firm based in Nassau, Bahamas. \u201cYou are seeing it in the data and it is evident in the financial markets as well.\u201dWhile there is no doubt that the animal spirits have done their work, just as important to the market\u2019s recent rally has been the significant fall in the dollar \u2014 not just against the euro and the yen, but against more volatile currencies like the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.Even the Chinese renminbi, once criticized by Mr. Trump as artificially low, has gained value against the dollar, climbing more than 3 percent for the year.A dollar in retreat means that trillions more dollars are sloshing around the global economy, ending up in 100-year Argentine bonds, Turkish airline stocks, junk bonds with stripped down investor protections and, of course, Dow stalwarts like Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\u201cDollar weakness means that there is increased liquidity all around the world,\u201d said Mr. Lele, the investment officer. \u201cAnd all that is flowing into carry trades.\u201dThe carry trade is financial jargon that describes the flow of money from low return assets to those with a higher return \u2014 not least when investors use a cheaper asset (dollars) to pay for riskier assets that promise better performance.When central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, intervened aggressively in global markets after the financial crisis, the immediate effect was rock bottom interest rates, a weak dollar and a search for \u201ccarry\u201d by global investors.Yet this trade lost some of its urgency in recent years as investors bet that the Fed would raise rates and that Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive fiscal policies would give a boost to the United States economy and the dollar.Instead, Trump administration officials have veered from the standard practice of talking up the dollar by pretty much doing the opposite. This approach was spurred largely by the administration\u2019s tough talk on trade and support for American manufacturers whose exports benefit from a less robust dollar.But it is also true that Mr. Trump, both from within his cabinet and his outside panel of economic advisers, has heard the view from Wall Street that an overly strong dollar would not help American financial markets.Edward Yardeni, an independent investment strategist, refers to the recent run-up in stocks, after what has already been one of the longest bull markets in financial history, as a \u201cmarket melt-up.\u201dThink of it as a rush of perhaps less discerning money into stocks, propelling stock market indexes past one historical milestone after another.For example, as of Monday, the Dow had reached 30 record highs this year, according to research by Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm.In a recent strategy note, Mr. Yardeni highlighted the effect of investor money pouring into exchange traded funds, which are easily traded, low-cost funds that track all varieties of indexes and investment themes.Over the last year, $232 billion has flowed into E.T.F.s that invest in domestic equities. In recent months, as the dollar has softened, global E.T.F.s that invest in Europe and emerging markets have been deluged with money and have taken in $121 billion for the year.Leading the way have been E.T.F.s that invest in higher-yielding, harder-to-trade securities like emerging market bonds, leveraged loans and bonds issued by low-rated corporations.Institutional and retail investors use the funds to make quick and longer term investment bets. But much of the flows, of late, seem to be coming from retail investors, many of whom were sitting on the sidelines in the last few years, analysts say.\u201cRight now, the market thinks the future looks good,\u201d said Peter Mallouk, the founder of Creative Planning, an independent investment adviser managing more than $26 billion out of Leawood, Kan. \u201cCorporate earnings are up, corporate taxes are expected to drop and most importantly, unemployment continues to trend lower.\u201dBeyond the stimulative effect that a struggling dollar has on global investment flows, some analysts point to another, more specific reason that might explain the near perfect correlation between the dollar\u2019s fall and the Dow\u2019s rise.The Dow, much more so than the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, has a weightier concentration in multinationals that rely on exporting their goods overseas, like Caterpillar, Boeing and Coca-Cola, to name a few.The weak dollar and strong growth in Asia, Europe and many emerging markets will be a boon for these companies, a number of which suffered in past years when the dollar was ascendant and worries about Europe and developing nations abounded.\u201cThere is no doubt that the big news \u2014 a drop in the dollar \u2014 is benefiting the Dow more than other indices,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis.\u201cIt has multinationals, and it benefits from improved trade flows. So dollar weakness may propel the Dow to 22,000 and beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Travis Kalanick", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravis Kalanick may no longer be Uber\u2019s chief executive, but he\u2019s still a major figure at the ride-hailing company.The lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court is the latest flare-up over the fate of Uber, the privately held company founded eight years ago by Mr. Kalanick that is valued at nearly $70 billion.The litigation is focused on how Mr. Kalanick gained control of several Uber board seats in 2016. Benchmark asserts that he did so through \u201cmaterial misstatements and fraudulent concealment\u201d of information and his \u201coverarching objective is to pack Uber\u2019s board with loyal allies in an effort to insulate his prior conduct from scrutiny and clear the path for his eventual return as C.E.O. \u2014 all to the detriment of Uber\u2019s stockholders, employees, driver-partners, and customers.\u201dThe lawsuit says Mr. Kalanick deliberately hid problems at Uber and fraudulently obtained the right to select three new board seats when the board expanded to 11 directors in 2016.After he stepped down, Mr. Kalanick left the board seat designated for the chief executive, but immediately reappointed himself to one of the three seats he controlled, the lawsuit asserts. He has since refused to give up control of the other two board seats, according to the lawsuit.A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.\u201d The spokesman said Benchmark was acting in \u201cits own best interests\u201d instead of in those of Uber, and added that Mr. Kalanick \u201cis confident that these entirely baseless claims will be rejected.\u201dRelated ReadingAn index known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d surged from historically low levels on Thursday as markets declined.The VIX stayed in single-digit territory for many weeks this year, unusual for an index that had long traded around 20.\u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201d asked Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo.The company, which has become a bellwether for the struggling retail industry, saw its shares fall more than 10 percent as investors worried about traditional brick-and-mortar stores.The rise in e-commerce has hurt Macy\u2019s and other traditional retailers.

{"Headline": "Car Owners Inundate Insurers With Claims After Hurricane Harvey", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuto insurers were already bracing for another bad year when the downpour started in Texas, producing potentially hundreds of thousands of new claims.\u201cWe do know that approximately 100,000 claims have come in\u201d as of Thursday, said Matt Stillwell, manager of governmental and regulatory communications at the Insurance Council of Texas, a trade association. He said the number was expected to climb as high as 500,000.\u201cIt is looking to be a huge impact on the auto insurance market,\u201d he said.That means few people moved their cars out of harm\u2019s way before the flooding started. Texas drivers are not required to have comprehensive auto insurance \u2014 the type that covers flood and other types of damage. People holding only the legally required insurance \u2014 liability coverage for damage done to other people\u2019s cars \u2014 will not have valid claims, Mr. Stillwell said.Those who have comprehensive insurance should get a payment based on replacement value minus depreciation, if their car is a total loss.For insurers, the losses will affect some more than others. The big, household-name auto insurers \u201chave sufficient geographic and product diversification to absorb the losses,\u201d S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a report on the impact of the storm and flooding on various parts of the insurance industry.But \u201csome of the regional and local players could face significant hits to their earnings, and possibly their capital,\u201d the ratings firm added.As a possible example, it cited Hochheim Prairie Insurance, a mutual insurer that does business solely in Texas, offering auto insurance and other personal lines. Mutual insurers are owned by their policyholders and do not issue stock in the public markets, so they cannot raise fresh capital by selling new shares.Pam Lahodney, a vice president of marketing and underwriting at Hochheim, said in an email that it was too early for the company to assess the financial effects of the storm on its business. \u201cAt this time, our focus is to provide assistance to those members impacted by Hurricane Harvey,\u201d she said.State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, Allstate Insurance, Farmers Insurance Exchange, National Indemnity Company (an affiliate of Geico), the Progressive Group, and Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance (a unit of MetLife) are among the big companies that write a large portion of their auto insurance business in Texas.Representatives of Allstate, Progressive and MetLife said they were busy dealing with policyholders in the flooded region and it was too early to estimate the magnitude of the disaster.Many auto insurers have been troubled in recent years by underwriting losses caused by factors unrelated to floods: texting and otherwise distracted drivers who cause accidents; increasingly complicated car components that cost more to repair; more miles driven, thanks to lower gasoline prices; and increasingly severe crashes that are raising the cost of treating the injured.A few large insurers, including Geico, Allstate and Progressive, have managed to avoid losses on underwriting in recent years. But in March, Fitch Ratings said auto insurers in the aggregate were reporting their weakest performance in 15 years.State Farm, the nation\u2019s largest property and casualty insurer, is also the leading example of the negative underwriting trend. It reported in February that its 2016 underwriting losses on auto insurance had increased to $7 billion, from $4.4 billion in 2015. Its other lines of business were generally profitable.State Farm is a mutual insurer, and therefore does not have any shares whose price would swing in response to the news. Nor does it have shareholders to pressure it to turn around its financial performance quickly. Like the other insurers, State Farm seeks to earn investment income that would offset its underwriting losses.Fitch\u2019s analyst, James B. Auden, said the auto insurers were already increasing their rates last year in response to their rising claim costs. He cited a 7.6 percent annual increase as of February, significantly higher than the overall rate of inflation. But state regulators often limit rate increases in a given year, so more increases are likely.Mr. Auden said the losses in Texas could drive up rates in the state, but were unlikely to affect insurance premiums elsewhere, because rate-setting is handled state by state.Kai Pan, an insurance equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, noted that insurance stocks generally decline immediately after a natural disaster, reflecting the possibility of big losses, then bounce back three to six months later \u201cas losses become more defined and rates respond positively.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street, Climbing Sharply, Skips Washington\u2019s \u2018Soap Opera\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the disorder in Washington \u2014 with a revolving door at the White House and roadblocks on Capitol Hill \u2014 Wall Street and corporate America are booming.\u201cNone of the soap opera in Washington matters,\u201d said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. \u201cNobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia.\u201dWhat does matter, Mr. Sullivan said, is stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining and oil and gas, a weaker dollar that helps exporters, and a lighter regulatory touch by the new administration.The initial stock market rally that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November \u2014 the so-called Trump bump \u2014 was fueled by optimism among investors that long-sought action on tax reform and infrastructure spending might finally be at hand.Few analysts are so sanguine now, especially after Republicans could not agree last month on how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after years of promising to do so. If anything, simplifying the tax code or investing in new roads and bridges seems farther out of reach than ever.But a market surge based on political hopes has been replaced by one more firmly grounded in the financial realm.Besides steady economic growth or less regulation, investors also have been encouraged by the loose reins of central banks like the Federal Reserve, which have helped keep interest rates not far above their historic lows. Inflation, too, remains tame, with price increases in recent months actually falling short of the Fed\u2019s targets.At the same time, with yields on safe assets like government bonds so minuscule, there are few appealing alternatives to stocks for investors, according to Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.\u201cNo matter how you look at valuations, they are high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as money flows into pension funds every month and needs to be invested, why would I put it in bonds?\u201cCorporations in America and Europe are still inventing new products and finding ways of doing things more efficiently,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThis is separate from the political theater around the world.\u201dMoreover, corporate earnings \u2014 the fundamental driver of individual stock performance \u2014 have been robust.\u201cThe first six months of the year have been the best period for earnings growth since 2011,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.Still, many Wall Street investors who are bullish over the longer-term, including Mr. Orlando, concede that the risk of a stock market correction was rising.\u201cWe\u2019ve had this fabulous run since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut could we see an air pocket in the next few months? Absolutely. Our best guess is that the next 5 percent move is more likely to be down than up.\u201dBut for now, whichever way the stock market goes, most economic metrics like hiring, consumer sentiment and home prices continue to point in the right direction.\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of it in Cleveland, and small businesses are looking forward instead of over their shoulder,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, who is the older brother of Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican.\u201cWhen Washington practices the Hippocratic oath toward business \u2014 first, do no harm \u2014 it\u2019s amazing what the American economy can do,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the prior administration, you had a very, very aggressive regulatory environment in which businesses felt under attack.\u201dEasing regulation is also something Mr. Trump can do with the stroke of a pen or with appointments to agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve, which require confirmation but not legislation.To be sure, the glow from Wall Street extends only so far. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, less than 15 percent of American households owned individual stocks and only half had any exposure to the broader market, including through mutual funds or retirement plans.\u201cOnly people with assets like stocks and houses are benefiting, and that\u2019s why this recovery has been weak,\u201d Mr. Slok said.The contradictory signals between the markets and the political world are hardly unique to the United States. \u201cMost investors in Europe are rolling their eyes at the U.S., but what\u2019s ironic is that it\u2019s similar to the European situation,\u201d Mr. Slok said.As in Washington, Mr. Slok said, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Brussels and other capitals over major issues, including Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union, the economic drag from the continent\u2019s restrictive labor laws and Greece\u2019s fiscal problems.If the stock market\u2019s prospects are unclear, then the outlook in Washington six months into the Trump administration is downright gloomy.The year began with Mr. Trump promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act; pass the most significant overhaul to the tax code since 1986; and get Congress to pass legislation to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. None of that has been accomplished, as Republicans have struggled to shift from being an opposition party to one that governs.Beyond those disappointments, fiscal land mines lie ahead that could rattle the economy if Republicans and Democrats cannot cooperate.By the end of September, Congress must reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling and fund the government for the coming fiscal year. Republicans remain divided over whether conditions such as spending cuts should be attached to raising the statutory borrowing limit. A standoff with Democrats over Mr. Trump\u2019s request to finance a border wall could lead to a partial government shutdown.The lack of progress has only led to more sniping among Republicans. This week Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cI think what\u2019s hurting the legislative agenda is Congress\u2019s inability to get things passed.\u201dMr. Trump has pointed to the growing economy and strong employment figures as evidence that his agenda is thriving. The data is indeed encouraging, but not very different from the figures he used as a candidate to paint a picture of economic despair.Still, the stock market\u2019s gains were likely to hold up as long as earnings remained buoyant, said Laszlo Birinyi, a longtime stock market analyst.\u201cWhile people may have strong feelings in other areas, the stock market is predicated on dollars and cents,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking the Addiction Out of Smoking", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe new F.D.A. chief, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, didn\u2019t mince words in making the announcement. He noted that tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, resulting in nearly half a million annual fatalities. And he pointed out that the cigarette is the only consumer product that kills when used as directed \u2014 half of its long-term users, in fact \u2014 and that nicotine is the root cause of cigarette addiction.Reducing nicotine in cigarettes so that they are \u201cminimally or nonaddictive,\u201d he asserted, \u201cis a cornerstone of our new and more comprehensive approach to effective tobacco regulation.\u201dCigarettes with nonaddictive nicotine levels would be radically different from what used to be known as \u201clow tar\u201d or \u201clight\u201d cigarettes, marketing gimmicks now barred by law. Those cigarettes were advertised as delivering less nicotine and tar into the lungs, even though there was no actual reduction.Under the F.D.A. proposal, nicotine in cigarettes would be set at a level so low that smokers would not be able to extract enough to create or sustain addiction. Cigarette makers today keep the nicotine at between 1 and 2 percent by weight, having found this to be the Goldilocks optimum, neither too harsh nor too mild. Reducing this percentage by a factor of 10 would make it very difficult for cigarettes to become addictive. Reducing it even further would make addiction virtually impossible. Kids might start smoking, but they wouldn\u2019t have trouble quitting.Nicotine is water-soluble and easy to remove by simply soaking the tobacco leaf. Nicotine-free cigarettes date from the 19th century, and sophisticated techniques developed after World War II allow the manufacture of cigarettes with any nicotine level desired in the finished leaf.In the 1980s, genetic engineering produced tobacco plants that were entirely free of nicotine. Philip Morris even rolled out three brands of cigarettes from which 97 percent of the nicotine had been removed \u2014 Merit De-Nic, Benson & Hedges De-Nic and Next. But sales were disappointing, in part because high-nicotine cigarettes remained on the market, and the industry\u2019s campaign to deny all evidence of harm precluded an advertising campaign highlighting the benefits of these new products.Of course, we can expect the industry to fight this new proposal, which threatens the historical mainstay of their business. It will claim that lowering the nicotine in cigarettes to such a low level amounts to a de facto ban, which is prohibited by the F.D.A.\u2019s charter. Tobacco companies no doubt will warn of the rise of a bootleg-era black market for high-nicotine cigarettes.The industry would still be able to sell nicotine in other forms, like e-cigarettes, nicotine orbs, sticks and lozenges, for example, and gums and patches. And people would still be able to buy cigarettes. But the important point is that they would also be able to quit at will. Smoking would return to being a matter of free choice.How quickly will the F.D.A. move to establish a nicotine standard? One worrisome sign is that the plan is part of a \u201cmultiyear road map.\u201d But there is an urgency here that should not be forgotten. Dr. Gottlieb himself warned that if present consumption rates continue into the 2050s, 17 million more Americans will lose their lives to tobacco.If the industry is serious about what it claims to want, maybe cigarette makers should sit down with the F.D.A. and hammer out a plan to end this catastrophic and entirely preventable epidemic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wine War in Southern France Has Streets Running Red", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVigilante vignerons had previously raided two big wine distributors nearby, in the Languedoc wine-producing region, smashing offices and dumping a river of red wine into the streets.The businesses had one thing in common: They had struck deals to import inexpensive wine from Spain, prompting a backlash among local winemakers who feared their livelihoods were under attack.\u201cI was stupefied,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Vergnes, a native of Languedoc who has run the Passerieux Vergnes wine brokerage business for 35 years. \u201cEverything was destroyed.\u201dMr. Vergnes was the latest target in a wine war across France\u2019s largest winegrowing area, pitting independent wine producers against imports from other European Union countries, and the businesses that deal in them.Wine rebels have executed dozens of attacks in protest since last summer, including ambushing Spanish wine trucks at the border and dumping the payload on highways.The most aggressive rebels are part of a secret commando organization that targeted businesses like Mr. Vergnes\u2019s, which had brokered a handful of Spanish wine contracts for French clients.\u201cMany people are just scraping by, but no one is listening,\u201d said Lionel Puech, a co-president of the Young Farmers Association, a union that has admitted to joining some of the militant actions, none of which have yet resulted in prosecutions.France has sought to calm nerves. Last month, the government held a meeting of French and Spanish wine representatives and ministers. They condemned the violence and agreed to strengthen relations.In Languedoc territory, where vineyards stretch from the Rh\u00f4ne Valley to the Spanish border, such statements make little difference.While some local wineries have invested in higher-quality products, many vignerons still produce inexpensive table wine for the budget-conscious market.But with labor costs and taxes nearly twice as high as those in Spain, French producers struggle to compete on price. France also imposes strict grape growing regulations that are more costly to follow than rules in Spain and other European countries.\u201cSpanish wine doesn\u2019t conform to our rules, but the E.U. requires us to accept it,\u201d said Mr. Puech, who owns a small vineyard in La Rouvi\u00e8re, a village north of N\u00eemes. \u201cThe E.U. is proving to be a hollow shell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates competitive disadvantages within the single market.\u201dSpanish wine producers see that argument as an excuse for protectionism. \u201cWe can produce the wine at lower cost because salaries are less,\u201d said Juan Corbal\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, who represents the Agri-Food Cooperatives in Brussels. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re doing unfair competition.\u201dYet when everything is tallied, small Languedoc vignerons take home little more than France\u2019s monthly minimum wage. Even that can quickly turn negative if a harvest is poor or retailers cut orders.This time, wine merchants and brokers like Mr. Vergnes turned to Spain to fill the shortfall. When the harvest rebounded, Languedoc producers were stuck with vast amounts of unsold wine.Languedoc vintners revolted.Thousands demonstrated, petitioning the government to even the playing field by reducing taxes and regulatory costs. Unions met with retailers to demand more-visible country-of-origin labeling.When the meetings produced no results, vignerons took matters into their own hands.Mr. Puech and other activists smashed thousands of bottles at retailers like Carrefour, which carried cheap Spanish wines made to look French, with pictures of chateaus and lavender fields, and selling them at the same price as the competing Languedoc fare, creating sizable margins for the retailers.The Comit\u00e9 R\u00e9gional d\u2019Action Viticole, a radical group that goes by the acronym CRAV, also sprang into action. Known for violent actions that have included dynamiting some targets, it has operated underground in Languedoc for over a century, resurfacing when fresh financial hardship hits winegrowers.One CRAV vigilante, a Languedoc winegrower who insisted on anonymity, citing the police investigation, said people had been pushed to their limits. He added that activists were halting their actions for now, but could resume if things didn\u2019t improve.The winegrower said he had seen his father and other Languedoc families fall into a debilitating debt spiral during earlier wine crises, and wanted to head off new hardship.\u201cI\u2019m not doing this for pleasure,\u201d he said of his participation in the raids. \u201cBut in the global system, it\u2019s always those at the bottom of the ladder who suffer. We want to be heard.\u201dMr. Vergnes was still reeling from the impact that message had on his business. But as a native of the area, he admitted it resonated.\u201cLanguedoc has always been a hot-blooded place,\u201d Mr. Vergnes said.\u201cBut I can understand that they are in a crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t done all this, would things really change?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s Adviser, Said to Have Drafted Resignation Letter After Charlottesville", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cohn ultimately changed his mind and decided in recent days to remain on as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said one person familiar with his thinking.Mr. Cohn is an architect of a broad set of tax reforms that the White House hopes will deliver the first legislative victory of Mr. Trump\u2019s tumultuous administration. The president next week will travel to Springfield, Mo., in a push to sell the tax reform package.But Mr. Cohn was anguished, according to a friend and two other people familiar with his thinking, by Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks after the Aug. 12 violence that resulted in the death of a 32-year-old woman who was protesting neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan demonstrators in Charlottesville.On Aug. 15, Mr. Cohn stood nearby in the lobby of Trump Tower, where the president told reporters there also were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the Charlottesville rally. After Mr. Trump left, Mr. Cohn stood uncomfortably fielding questions about the president\u2019s statements, and he repeatedly declined to comment.He debated for over a week with his wife and friends on whether to quit, according to the people familiar with his thinking. This week, Mr. Cohn decided to remain in his job, believing he could be more effective as a public servant inside the White House than out of it.As Mr. Trump stood by his equivocal comments on Charlottesville and business leaders left presidential advisory panels in protest, Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, he felt \u201cenormous pressure\u201d to step down. Various friends, and Mr. Cohn\u2019s wife, were at one point among those who were urging him to resign, said several people familiar with their advice.A senior administration official said the president was not surprised by Mr. Cohn\u2019s remarks to The Financial Times. Another official said the sentiments had been relayed clearly to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Cohn had said that if asked, he would say how he felt.But on Friday, Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, tweeted that Mr. Cohn \u201cshould be fired immediately for his public attack on the president.\u201d In his tweet, Mr. Stone misspelled the name of Mr. Cohn, whom he has aggressively criticized, and said the economic adviser was \u201crecommended for his White House job by Jared Kushner.\u201dIt is highly unusual for a senior member of any presidential administration to publicly discuss the possibility of stepping down. Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said even though Mr. Cohn did not criticize Mr. Trump by name in the Financial Times interview, \u201cthe comments are still very tough and very blunt, including his comments about the push-and-pull whether to stay and whether to go.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no effort to conceal the fact that what Trump said was wrong and troubling,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to think of very many precedents for somebody like that who is a high-ranking presidential adviser.\u201dMr. Cohn told The Financial Times that \u201cas a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 to cause this Jew to leave his job.\u201dBut the job has not been easy. For Mr. Cohn, said two people familiar with his thinking, every day at the White House requires a different calculus over how best to spend his political capital. Right now, these people said, he will focus on economic policies that he believes are essential to the stability of the markets and the United States work force \u2014 even when other issues worry him.Nudging Mr. Trump toward a more free-trade stance that avoids harsh steps toward China and other economic partners is paramount, these people said. Part of that, they added, is opposing tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods that might damage relationships with American allies.But using political capital on those fights means avoiding others, even when the president espouses policies that run contrary to Mr. Cohn\u2019s own principles, the two people said. Among other things, they said, Mr. Cohn disagrees with the president\u2019s directive banning transgender people from joining the military, but will leave that fight to others.On Aug. 17, with word of Mr. Cohn\u2019s unhappiness percolating on Wall Street, some traders and investors got jittery. Seeing Mr. Cohn as a key player in pushing forward the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, some sold American stocks, pushing prices down.Mr. Cohn, a onetime silver trader who eventually became president of Goldman Sachs, was struck by the market move, said two people familiar with his thinking. He continued to huddle with friends and family over what steps to take, attending meetings in Washington during the process.At some point during the past 10 days, Mr. Cohn penned a tentative resignation letter, said the three people familiar with the draft. It was not immediately clear what day the letter was written, or if Mr. Trump was ever made aware of it.But during a private Aug. 18 meeting with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Cohn relayed his concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Charlottesville, said people with knowledge of the gathering. The exact details of the talk are not clear, but the president urged Mr. Cohn to stay.\u201cI have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic,\u201d Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, adding that \u201cI have not been bashful saying what I think.\u201dOne possible part of Mr. Cohn\u2019s calculus is the chance that he could be named Federal Reserve chairman early next year, a move Mr. Trump has said he is considering. Mr. Cohn has in the past expressed interest in the job, said two people close to him. But unlike past Fed chairmen, Mr. Cohn is not an economist, and some of his friends have said it is hard to imagine him in the more reserved, less dynamic environment of the Fed, which would be a huge contrast to the pace of Goldman Sachs or the White House.Eileen Sullivan and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

The nearly magical stock market that has persisted so valiantly this year is one of them.The stock market has been so placid that declines of a mere 1.5 percent have been treated like real news. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped that much on Thursday. Days like that can be unsettling, but in the span of market history, they amount to the slightest of headaches.The deeper news isn\u2019t immediately visible day to day, but it is this: The stock market has been operating in an extremely rarefied world of heightened calm, one that is unlikely to continue. It is as if, after the election in November, Wall Street entered an enchanted zone. That is bound to end.Several statistical measurements demonstrate how unusual this market environment has been.The most obvious is the bull market\u2019s longevity, fueled largely by the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultralow interest rates and voracious bond buying. The upward trend in stocks already ranks as the second longest in American history since 1900 and the third highest in percentage gains, according to a tally by Bespoke Investment Group. From the trend\u2019s start, in 2009, through its latest high, on Aug. 7, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has risen 267 percent.\u201cIt is difficult to appreciate how unusual 2017 is,\u201d Mr. Mehta said, \u201cor to use the distant past to draw lessons about it.\u201d Clearly, though, neither then nor now, political turmoil had little or no effect on the pervasive calm in the stock market.Mr. Mehta, the former director of research and analytics for the Treasury\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, pointed to several other indicators of uncanny market placidity this year.And despite occasional bursts of market-driven angst, the downturns so far in 2017 have been paltry. Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial, has found that the S.&P. 500 through Friday has not had a 5 percent decline, from peak to trough, since June 28, 2016. That sell-off, 6.1 percent over several days, occurred after Britain\u2019s surprise vote on June 23, 2016, to leave the European Union.Other measurements show the same pattern. For the three weeks through Aug. 10, the closing levels of the S.&P. 500 never had a daily swing of more than 0.3 percent, Mr. Detrick said: \u201cThat never happened before in the history of the S.&P. 500.\u201d And for 2017 so far, the average daily trading range has been 0.55 percent, the lowest ever.\u201cWe have been living in a very unusual world,\u201d Mr. Detrick said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think we are going to stay here for very long.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Mehta said that this stretch of smooth sailing has gone on for so long that it has become statistically improbable. That isn\u2019t a firm prediction of a decline because the future is uncertain. But, he said, it is quite likely that a stock market decline of at least 5 percent \u2014 from peak to trough \u2014 will be coming in the not-too-distant future.\u201cMere reversion to the mean is likely,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. \u201cFrom a probability standpoint, the run we\u2019ve been on is very rare, and it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll return to something more normal relatively soon.\u201dWill there be a downturn big enough to derail the bull market? Of course. But, alas, no one knows when it will happen.In traditional Wall Street parlance, a bull market ends and a bear begins with a drop of 20 percent from the market\u2019s last peak, which happens to have occurred on Aug. 7, when the S.&.P. closed at 2,480.91. The market has dropped 1.9 percent since then. It hasn\u2019t had a 3 percent decline since before the November election, in the longest such streak since 1995, Mr. Detrick said.We are long overdue, he said, adding that he expected \u201ca very healthy decline of 5 percent or more,\u201d which would be \u201ca buying opportunity for people who have stayed out of the stock market.\u201d Stock valuations are stretched, he said, but when you factor in low interest rates and low inflation, current prices are reasonable, in his view.\u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age, they die of excesses,\u201d Mr. Detrick said. And there is no indication, he added, that an end to the market\u2019s long-term rising trend is imminent.One of these days, these various streaks will end. A big stock market decline could well precede and predict a recession. But barring a disastrous geopolitical, economic or financial shock \u2014 there are plenty of possibilities, take your pick \u2014 it is likely that both the bull market and the economic recovery will keep grinding on for a while.But don\u2019t count on it. We are pushing our luck. Even if you believe in magic, the markets rarely stay calm and buoyant for such an exceedingly long time.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Tower, a Home for Celebrities and Charlatans", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Clinton slept here.The year was 2000. Mrs. Clinton was in the middle of her first political campaign, running to be New York\u2019s junior senator.Donald J. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were on good terms back then. He donated money to her candidacy and called her \u201ctough and smart.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Trump was skilled in the art of spinning his associations with celebrities into publicity.This was particularly true at Trump Tower.Johnny Carson, Liberace and Paul Anka had condominiums there in the 1980s, and Michael Jackson rented one in the 1990s. In 2000, Bruce Willis closed on a place too.Pre-opening reports of Prince Charles and Princess Diana moving in turned out to be false, but that didn\u2019t stop Mr. Trump from using them to his advantage. The \u201csale that never occurred,\u201d as Mr. Trump called it in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d was \u201cthe one that most helped Trump Tower.\u201dThe completion of a grand tower in Midtown\u2019s high-end retail district cemented Mr. Trump\u2019s status as a force to be reckoned with in New York while also setting him apart from his father, the developer Fred C. Trump, who made his fortune with an empire of middle-class housing units in boroughs outside Manhattan.Then Mr. Trump went to the nearby Olympic Tower for a dinner held by the Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, encountered a living room bigger than his own and decided to remodel.By the time Trump Tower opened, more than half the building\u2019s condominium units had been sold, and all but a small percentage would be gone within the next few years. Paul Goldberger, then The Times\u2019s architecture critic, whom Mr. Trump had once called \u201can idiot,\u201d sounded amazed by how much he actually liked it.\u201cIf overbearing publicity and overdressed guards do not a good building make, neither do they a good building deny,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTrump Tower,\u201d he added, \u201cis turning out to be a much more positive addition to the cityscape than the architectural oddsmakers would have had it.\u201dFew residents garnered as much publicity for the building as Michael Jackson, who for 10 months around 1994 rented a duplex apartment near the top and turned one of the bedrooms into a mirrored dance studio.Mr. Trump made Mr. Jackson\u2019s acquaintance in 1988, when he attended a Madison Square Garden concert that was part of the singer\u2019s tour in support of his \u201cBad\u201d album. After the show, he made a backstage visit.In 1990, Mr. Trump persuaded Mr. Jackson to show up at the opening of the Trump Taj Majal in Atlantic City, parading him in front of camera crews and reporters. The next day, Mr. Jackson\u2019s friend Ryan White died of AIDS, and the developer accompanied him on a visit to the grieving family in Indianapolis, bringing along a journalist to document the deed.After Mr. Jackson moved into his Trump Tower apartment, Mr. Trump took him to a low-key dinner at Le Cirque. \u201cThere was no entourage, no posse,\u201d said Mario Wainer, the restaurant\u2019s longtime ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel. \u201cHe came as a guest of Mr. Trump, and that was it.\u201dMr. Jackson barely touched his risotto, Mr. Wainer recalled, and Mr. Trump had fish and drank no alcohol.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s feuds with celebrities such as Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Snoop Dogg, it may not come as a surprise that some of his relationships with well-known tenants ended poorly.A few years later, Mr. Trump traded insults with the singer and actress Pia Zadora during a dispute with her husband, the dime-store magnate Meshulam Riklis, who rented office space in the building.Later, when Ms. Zadora heard Mr. Trump using similar language in his feuds with Megyn Kelly and Ms. O\u2019Donnell, she realized \u2014 as she said in an interview last week \u2014 \u201cI was a pioneer!\u201dAs Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987 best seller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d \u201cthe cycles of buyers at Trump Tower were always something of a barometer of what was going on in the international economy.\u201dThe first group, Mr. Trump wrote in the book, included many people hailing from the Middle East, some of them from nations the newly elected president would later seek to put on a travel ban list. There have also been residents of Mexico, a country Mr. Trump targeted through his candidacy. Juan Beckmann Vidal, who has a majority stake in Jose Cuervo Tequila, purchased and combined three units on the 31st floor in 2007.Although Mr. Trump called himself \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d in 2016, his namesake tower has been welcoming to those who have run afoul of the law.\u201cCriminals got to go somewhere,\u201d said Robby Browne, a broker at the Corcoran Group.After being charged with drug trafficking, Mr. Weichselbaum rented an apartment owned by Mr. Trump himself at the Trump Plaza building on East 61st Street. Mr. Trump wrote a letter on his behalf to the presiding judge in the case, calling him a \u201ccredit to the community\u201d shortly before Mr. Weichselbaum pleaded guilty and was given a three-year sentence.In 1988, Jay Weinberg, a New York-bred career criminal, moved into Unit 63-A while under indictment for running what prosecutors said was the largest Medicaid fraud in history. After being convicted of using his low-cost, Brooklyn-based medical clinic to improperly bill Medicaid for $16 million in fees from 381,000 appointments that never took place, he was sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison. As prosecutors noted, he was literally robbing the poor to feed the rich.At least Mr. Nahmad and Mr. Trincher have not been charged in connection with anyone\u2019s death, a dubious distinction held by Isaac Chehebar, a real estate investor and scion of the 1,300-store Rainbow retail chain.Mr. Chehebar served a four-and-a-half-month sentence for criminally negligent homicide. In 2006, Mr. Chehebar spent $4.3 million for a 2,200-square-foot apartment on the 42nd floor of Trump Tower, property records show.Steven Hoffenberg, who was convicted in 1997 of bilking investors of Towers Financial Corporation of $462 million, leased office space on the 16th floor shortly after his legal difficulties began.Asked last year by Bloomberg why Mr. Trump rented to him when he was facing charges of running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history, Mr. Hoffenberg said: \u201cHe\u2019s very objective. Renting space has nothing to do with color or race \u2014 or indictment. It has to do with if you can pay the rent.\u201dSince Mr. Trump\u2019s political career took off, there have been questions about his possible ties to Russia. In January 2017, he took to Twitter saying, \u201cI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA \u2014 NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201dBut in 2002, the Bayrock Group, a real estate investment fund run by two Russian-born entrepreneurs, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater, moved into office space on the 24th floor of Trump Tower, where they began work on the future Trump SoHo and used their connections to explore a possible Trump building in Moscow.He avoided jail time by becoming a government informant who, according to the former attorney general Loretta Lynch, provided crucial intelligence about a variety of international crime syndicates.Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to play down his involvement with Mr. Sater.In 2007, he told The Times that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know [Mr. Sater] very well.\u201d In 2015, he told a reporter from The Associated Press that he was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d with him.In 2017, Mr. Sater met with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, at the Loews Regency on Park Avenue. There, Mr. Sater gave him a letter proposing the lifting of sanctions against Russia.The letter, The Times later reported, was delivered to Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser at the time. The next week, Mr. Flynn was fired.Of late, Mr. Trump has also been distancing himself from another Trump Tower resident with ties to Russian interests. In addition to holding the deed to an apartment on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower since 2015, he was for several months last year the manager of his landlord\u2019s presidential campaign.His name: Paul Manafort.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bumpy Times in Brazil, but Hedge Funds Boom", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 After more than a decade as an asset manager for large multinational banks, a Brazilian, M\u00e1rcio Appel, wanted to make it on his own. The political and economic upheaval in his country was not going to deter him.Even on the heels of a new scandal erupting in May that rocked the markets, the hedge fund firm he co-founded here, Adam Capital, started raising money for its newest fund. It is expected to be a $6.1 billion macro global fund, or one that invests based largely on the political and economic prospects of various countries.If it succeeds, the firm could become one of the top independent asset managers in Latin America, based on total assets under management, and among the largest worldwide of its vintage.Mr. Appel is going solo as Brazil\u2019s hedge fund sector is growing even though the short-term prospects of the economy remain uncertain.Total assets under management in June increased to $85 billion, a jump of 15 percent from the $74 billion in June 2016, according to data provided by the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association, known by its Portuguese acronym Anbima.Brazilian macro funds had a total under management of $30.79 billion (or 97 billion reais) in June, a 51 percent increase from the same month one year earlier. Just in the first six months of this year, that figure grew by 18 percent.Such funds are more and more sought after out here. They received a net increase of $5.3 billion (or 16.7 billion reais) in the first half of this year, a turnaround from the net outflow of $412.7 million (or 1.3 billion reais) over the same period last year, according to Anbima.Even with all that money going into hedge funds, it is still an unusual time to form a new investment vehicle here and court investors.Brazil\u2019s president continues to be investigated for corruption, his low popularity has eroded even further, and his ability to shepherd unpopular reform measures considered by bankers as essential to turn around the economy has diminished.Yet Adam Capital\u2019s founding partners, Mr. Appel and his longtime colleague Andr\u00e9 Salgado, are no strangers to crisis.\u201cBrazil is a very good place to make money. It always has been,\u201d said Mr. Appel in a recent interview at the firm\u2019s office in the upscale Leblon neighborhood near the beach.From 2001 to 2008, Mr. Appel led asset management at the Spanish banking giant Santander\u2019s Brazil subsidiary. Then he did that for Banco Safra from 2008 to October 2015. There he gained acclaim for his performance with their Galileo fund, which gained 199.43 percent during his tenure, according to the brokerage firm XP Investimentos.But, he said, \u201cI always dreamt of opening my own firm.\u201dThe two founding partners met while at Santander \u2014 Mr. Salgado headed its brokerage house from 2003 to 2010 and later held a similar role at Safra.Adam Capital opened its initial funds in April last year. Two weeks earlier, Brazil\u2019s lower house had voted to move forward the impeachment process of Dilma Rousseff, then president.Still, the firm ended up raising $2.9 billion for its flagship macro fund and accumulated a total of about $3.3 billion in under nine months. That was in part because several private banks, including Itau Unibanco and Safra, agreed to be distributors, providing access to their private banking clients.Adam Capital \u201chas had very strong success in raising funds,\u201d said Michael Viriato Araujo, a professor of finance at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based business school Insper. \u201cFor Brazil, the speed at which they raised was impressive,\u201d he said.The firm\u2019s performance has been well above benchmarks. As of July 31, the flagship fund is up 27 percent since inception. That is about 1.65 times the return of the CDI, a type of certificate of deposit common among Brazilians and considered risk-free as it is tied to local interest rates, which have long been sky-high.The firm currently holds about $4.51 billion in assets under management, according to Mr. Salgado.That ranks it first globally among hedge fund managers established in 2016 or later and based on total assets under management, according to the research firm Preqin.Black and White Capital in the United States is in second place with $2.8 billion. Only two others have surpassed the $1 billion threshold in assets under management. Those are the Holocene Advisors and Sagewood in the United States.Adam Capital so far has focused on investing in equities, mostly indexes, foreign exchange and interest rates. It has done so in the United States, Japan, and Europe as well as in emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and Mexico.Until May, the firm kept about a 50/50 split between investments in Brazil and overseas, its founders said. The leak of a taped conversation between Joesley Batista, chief executive of J & F Investments, the parent of the meatpacking giant JBS, and Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, who seemed to endorse Mr. Batista\u2019s bribery, resulted in a market panic.Immediately afterward, Adam reduced everything related to Brazil: stocks, local interest rates and the real. Its flagship fund fell 3.52 percent that month.Yet the firm\u2019s funds have since rebounded, as has their exposure to Brazil, including even betting on the real over the dollar. \u201cAs of today, we\u2019re just back to pre-Batista levels,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back to 50/50.\u201dThey also feel like they passed an important test during that episode. \u201cGenerally I think it was bad because nobody likes to lose money,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cBut we managed to prove to the market that our size was manageable even with an event of this proportion.\u201dIn Brazil, several factors have buoyed independent asset managers. Interest rates falling significantly in the past year forced normally conservative Brazilian investors to start taking more risks. The emergence of new brokerage firms, some online, has also cut into the dominance banks used to have in controlling hedge funds.Large banks are starting to sell to independent managers, said Mr. Appel. \u201cThat is what allowed us to get that big that fast,\u201d Mr. Salgado noted.That bodes well for other firms, too. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely the industry will continue to grow,\u201d said Professor Viriato, the hedge fund expert at Insper.The minimum amount needed to invest has also fallen, making the funds more accessible.\u201cHedge funds in the past were for the ultrarich in Brazil,\u201d said Mr. Salgado. Now a hedge fund investor needs only a minimum investment of $3,175 and can make that through his bank or other firms.Reflecting that change, Adam Capital already has about 18,000 individual investors in its funds.Mr. Salgado said that to put money in hedge funds in Brazil today, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a millionaire anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P. Morgan) and $275 (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).As for other large multinationals and the broader market indexes, Mr. Arone sees no immediate threat to further gains. None of the warning signs he looks for \u2014 more-frequent market corrections, higher interest rates and widening credit spreads \u2014 have yet materialized. \u201cNone is flashing red,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even yellow.\u201d While conceding the bull market \u201cis getting long in the tooth,\u201d he said, \u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Market Is High. Beware of Portfolio Drift.", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesInvest at the bottom of the market and sell at the top. That\u2019s solid advice, but it\u2019s not easy to follow.Consider the stock market right now, for example. Is this the top of the market? Is it time to sell?What\u2019s more, the market has been so placid this year \u2014 despite the turmoil emanating from Washington \u2014 that the calm on Wall Street has been almost supernatural. By some measures, stocks haven\u2019t been this steady in more than 50 years. Furthermore, the economic expansion now underway is already the third longest since 1854. It takes little imagination to envision a sudden rout.Those observations unnerved some readers who asked what they, as investors, should do now. Simply put, my answer is this: If you\u2019re a stock investor, be prepared for a major decline, not because one is necessarily coming soon but because no one can predict where the markets are heading.I spoke to Fran Kinniry, principal in Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group. \u201cI always tell people to be consistent in their thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think they are O.K. with their portfolios now, and why not? They\u2019re probably sitting on big gains.\u201cBut then I ask, imagine that you have a $1 million portfolio and you lose 30 percent, because that can happen, and that\u2019s $300,000. Now you\u2019ve got just $700,000. How do you feel now? Would you be willing to stay in the stock market \u2014 and even sell some bonds, which have held on to their value, and use the money to buy more stocks, which are relatively cheap now? If the answer is no, it\u2019s important to know that now and to act on it.\u201dThat said, there is no reason to conclude that a big stock market decline is starting tomorrow. That might happen, but stocks may well rise for quite a while. Some astute analysts, like Laszlo Birinyi, an independent stock analyst in Westport, Conn., believe they probably will.\u201cWe are in a bull market,\u201d he declared in an email, adding that there are plenty of opportunities in individual stocks which continue to gyrate, even if the overall market is surprisingly stable. Valuation concerns and technical indicators like market breadth and investor sentiment are worth considering, he said, but \u201cnone of them end up with a SELL\u201d signal for the entire market. Mr. Birinyi says there is still money to be made by buying stocks. He may be right.Still, after so many years of gains, there are hidden dangers.Many investors are suffering from portfolio drift. As Mr. Kinniry of Vanguard says, even if your long-term strategy is well thought out, the colossal gains in the stock market could mean that you hold far more stock than you ever intended. In that case, you have taken on unintended risk because your portfolio has drifted far from its original moorings.\u201cIf you have not looked at your portfolio for a long time,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said, \u201cthe chances are very high that you should rebalance.\u201dRebalancing implies returning to the mix of assets that is appropriate for you. What that mix should be is a personal question. Major mutual fund and brokerage companies and individual financial advisers offer counsel. And there are standard guidelines, though no one-size-fits all solutions. The financial quizzes I\u2019ve taken all suggest that my holdings should be 60 to 70 percent stock, offset by 30 to 40 percent bonds, and I have remained within those parameters for 20 years. I\u2019m closer to 70 percent stocks right now. I probably should rebalance.Why hold stocks at all? It is because over periods of 20 years or more, stocks have almost always outperformed bonds, although stocks swing more wildly. That\u2019s why it is generally thought that people with a long horizon should hold a bigger proportion of stocks than those who are living off their investments, or will soon do so.\u201cRebalancing is more a risk-control measure than a return-generator,\u201d said Dougal Williams, an independent financial adviser.The problem, however, is that maintaining the right mix takes work. Someone else can do it for you, or you can do it yourself. If you have been letting things slide, it is time to rebalance.Consider what would have happened if you were fortunate enough to hold a $1 million portfolio at the end of 2008, containing 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds (a 60-40 portfolio). Recall that the United States stock market fell a whopping 37 percent in 2008. Holding as much as 60 percent stock after that debacle required some fortitude, along with a belief that the stock market would eventually rise. And it did. But look at what the market has also done:That\u2019s why it may be time to take some money off the table, even if, by doing so, you will be giving up some of the gains that will come when the stock market rises.\u201cBe capable of sticking with your strategy in the best of times and the worst of times,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to think clearly now than in the middle of a big market downturn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(He also lamented, incorrectly, that the press was downplaying that fact: \u201cMainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d)And on Thursday, Mr. Trump made clear that he thinks he deserves credit for the latest record high, tweeting, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!The Dow Jones average closed at another record high Thursday. But it was not long ago that Mr. Trump, as a presidential candidate bent on casting the economy as a disaster, said that the stock market was a bubble that should make investors wary.In the early days of his candidacy, Mr. Trump assailed the economic recovery as a mirage and mused about a potential conspiracy that was being plotted between Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, and President Barack Obama. The theory was that she was keeping interest rates low so that the president would not leave office as another recession began.Before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump decided to dispense some financial advice. The recent dip in stocks was a harbinger of worse things to come, he warned, and he hoped that the coming crash did not happen after Mr. Obama left office.Although he was feeling confident about locking up the Republican nomination in April 2016, Mr. Trump was feeling increasingly bearish about stocks. He told The Washington Post that they were overvalued and that the strong data that showed a healthy economy were essentially phony.By September, he was arguing that the Federal Reserve was propping up a \u201cfalse economy\u201d that is actually weak.Mr. Trump saved his most brutal assessment of the stock market, and the economy, for his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton.

{"Headline": "Investing Short-Term When Stocks Are High? Imagine a Painful Drop", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyEvery week brings a new worry, something or another that could finally, truly, end our eight-year-plus bull market in American stocks.If it\u2019s not conflict with North Korea, then it\u2019s concern over a damaging showdown in Congress over the federal debt. And if it\u2019s not debt, it\u2019s the possibility of a trade war or a hurricane season to end all hurricane seasons.Given how little anyone can know about what will end the bull market and when, most people should try to avoid making predictions, let alone investing based on them. But there is one group of people who deserve to worry at any particular moment: those who will need most or all of their investment money soon.Consider the people who are trying to scrape together a down payment but who also want their savings to keep up with the rise in real estate prices, if possible. Or the parent \u2014 say, me \u2014 who hopes to send a firstborn child off to college in seven years. How much money should any of us have in stocks right now?If you poll investment experts, there is no consensus about a perfect mix of stock, bonds and cash. There never is. But there is probably an answer that is right for you, as long as you know how comfortable you are with the possibility of losing some money and have thought through every detail of what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice if you do.Figuring out how low your portfolio\u2019s value might drop ought to be much easier than it is. In a perfect world, every brokerage firm and 529 college savings account administrator would have two buttons on their web pages.The first, a \u201cWhat if?\u201d button, would let you see how much portfolio pain you\u2019d be in for if your stock investments fell by 10 or 20 percent \u2014 or some more apocalyptic amount \u2014 and if bonds earned nothing over some period. The second, a \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d button, would let you input the portfolio percentage decline of your choosing and then set the site to work estimating the odds of anything like that happening based on what has happened in the past.If you don\u2019t have access to anything like that, you can at least approximate the \u201cwhat if\u201d math yourself if you know what\u2019s in your portfolio. (With the age-based funds that some people put their 529 money into, it can take a little digging to figure out what percentage of the investments are in stocks.)A good financial adviser will put the numbers in front of you and demand that you reckon with them. Paul V. Sydlansky, a financial planner in Binghamton, N.Y., recently went through this exercise with a couple who hope to buy a home in Spain in two to four years. And because it could indeed take 48 months, they don\u2019t want to leave their money in cash, earning very little, for that long.So Mr. Sydlansky put it to them this way: If they have $180,000 split equally between stocks and bonds, a 30 percent stock market decline would leave them with $153,000. How would that feel if the perfect house came along? Not good, they decided, and they elected to have just 30 percent of their money in stocks.This conversation probably gets harder if you\u2019re a first-time homeowner. Sure, you could hope that housing prices in your area would fall as much as your portfolio, but there is rarely precise alignment in the choreography of market corrections and crashes.So, would you be comfortable passing up the perfect property if your down payment account had fallen by 10 or 20 percent? How would it feel to sacrifice the dream of buying your \u201cforever\u201d home and settle for a starter one? What about buying the bigger house in the second-choice suburb? And let\u2019s say you have a spouse. Better be sure that you two are on the same page. Have you asked?Or perhaps you would just borrow more. Easy, right? But could you afford it, if interest rates are a point or two higher then? That could happen. And how much would all that extra interest cost you over time? Or would the bank even lend you that much?And don\u2019t forget this possibility either: How much would you kick yourself over the lost stock market gains if the market continues to rise? If you have all of your down payment money in cash for years while the housing market outruns you, as it has for many people in expensive coastal markets this decade, it wouldn\u2019t feel so good.Now, consider a college savings account, perhaps for a middle-school student. You\u2019re reasonably sure that there will be some kind of stock market calamity between now and when the kiddo leaves home. How bad might things get?It\u2019s tempting to consider how you reacted to the stock market declines at the end of the last decade in figuring out how you might react in the future. If you had decent nerves back then when your child was in preschool, perhaps you were betting that you were buying stocks on sale.How bad could things get over the next 10 years? Given how rough things got last time, I asked Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Dow Jones Indices, to calculate what people might have seen if they\u2019d been looking back at total S.&P. 500 returns (including reinvested dividends) over a previous 10-year period. Any decade ending between January 2009 and September 2010 would have been negative, he said. In the first four months of 2009, you would have been facing a decade-long decline between 21 and 29 percent.You\u2019d hope that few with children about to start college were invested entirely in large United States stocks then. One benefit of diversification, as Preeti Shah, an accountant and financial planner in Matawan, N.J., reminded me this week, is that even over the four years of college, you can pull from the investments that aren\u2019t hurting as much (say, the bond or cash portion of your portfolio) during the first year or two. Then, you cross your fingers that the stocks will recover during the latter part of your child\u2019s undergraduate years. Indeed, stocks nearly doubled from their March 2009 lows within two years.But something more conservative may be better for you. Again come the pressing questions, perhaps even more emotion-laden since they involve your son or daughter: How much more could you pay out of pocket if your college savings portfolio suffered a big loss? What if your employer cast your aging self off during the recession that might come with a big stock market decline?Perhaps you attended a private college and hope to give your child a shot at the same thing. Would you insist upon the state university where you live \u2014 and nothing else more expensive \u2014 if your aggressive portfolio took a big dive? Or have you made a promise to your overachieving teenager about ye olde alma mater that you couldn\u2019t bear to break? Would you want to borrow? What could you do now to limit the debt in that event?Again, none of the answers dictate a precise asset allocation. And sure, some people could address any potential losses by earning more, saving more or spending less.But many of us aren\u2019t that lucky. An untimely stock market decline could hurt, badly. A bear market will emerge eventually, so imagining the pain of its severe bite is one of the healthiest things you can do for your finances when the stock market continues to seem so sunny.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tesla Motors Is Fueling Up on Debt", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElon Musk is an entrepreneur in a bubble.Forced to choose between issuing a bit more of Tesla\u2019s turbocharged stock or tapping the overheated junk-bond market to finance the Model 3 ramp-up, Mr. Musk, the company\u2019s founder, opted for the latter. It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel.Tesla has just over $3 billion in cash, but it is burning through roughly $1 billion a quarter as it embarks on one of the most daunting gambits in automotive history: taking production of its mass-market vehicle from zero to 400,000 or more a year in just 18 months.Fortunately for Mr. Musk, investors can\u2019t seem to shower his ambitions with too much money. Tesla\u2019s stock has risen by 67 percent this year. The company is valued at some 27 times 2020 earnings, implying the kind of growth that even the most bullish of analysts don\u2019t expect, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations.The textbook financing solution would be to issue more of that high-priced paper. Selling five million shares at a 15 percent discount to market would raise the same $1.5 billion and dilute Mr. Musk\u2019s 20.4 percent stake by only 3 percent, assuming he didn\u2019t pitch in more himself.But he doesn\u2019t have to when the high-yield bond market is on a tear. Investors desperate for income have depressed the yield gap between single-B-rated junk bonds and United States Treasury bonds by nearly 2 percentage points over the past year, to 3.59 points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings affirmed its B-minus rating on Tesla, saying the boost to liquidity should offset the company\u2019s \u201csignificant execution risks.\u201dThe bond sale will raise debt to a lofty 5.5 times forecast 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. But Ebitda is set to more than double next year to $2.2 billion and then almost triple by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Even if Mr. Musk is not as successful as Wall Street estimates, he should sell more than enough cars to make the leverage, and the additional interest bill, easy for bondholders to swallow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Are Markets Due for a Reckoning?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a decade after the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, concerns are rising that euphoric markets may be headed for a hard fall.Technology companies have been an important driver behind the increase in financial markets in recent years, with seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies now coming from that sector.The so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and the Google parent Alphabet \u2014 have had some of the biggest gains in the past 12 months.And a stunning amount of money (more than $60 billion a year for the past three years) has flowed into the tech sector through venture capitalists and private equity funds.\u2022 Many of the gains have been concentrated around a small number of stocks, rather than resulting in a broader rise.\u2022 Tech companies may face increasing scrutiny from regulators.Google was fined a record $2.7 billion this summer by European Union antitrust officials for unfairly favoring some of its own services over rivals. The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bannon Was Set for a Graceful Exit. Then Came Charlottesville.", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, told Stephen K. Bannon in late July that he needed to go: No need for it to get messy, Mr. Kelly told Mr. Bannon, according to several people with firsthand knowledge of the exchange. The two worked out a mutually amicable departure date for mid-August, with President Trump\u2019s blessing.At the same time, New York real estate investor friends told Mr. Trump that the situation with Mr. Bannon was untenable: Steve Roth on Monday, Tom Barrack on Tuesday and Richard LeFrak on Wednesday.By Thursday, after Mr. Bannon undercut American policy toward North Korea in an interview published by a left-leaning magazine, Mr. Trump himself had concluded that Mr. Bannon was too much of a liability.By Friday, when he was forced from his job as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Mr. Bannon had found himself wholly isolated inside a White House where he once operated with such autonomy that he reported only to the president himself.This account is based on interviews with a dozen White House aides, associates of the president\u2019s and friends of Mr. Bannon\u2019s.A former Naval officer, Mr. Bannon speaks often in the language of combat \u2014 of escalating conflict to \u201cnuclear\u201d levels and driving his enemies \u201cballistic.\u201d But in the end, he had lost the war against a list of enemies that included nearly everyone in the West Wing. They included not just the adversaries whose conflicts with Mr. Bannon were widely aired \u2014 Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter; and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.Even the market tumbled on the prospect that Mr. Bannon could come out on top. Blue chip stocks slid last week after an erroneous report said that Mr. Cohn\u2019s resignation was imminent because of his disgust with Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to more forcefully denounce the racist Charlottesville, Va., demonstrators. Friends and former colleagues of Mr. Cohn\u2019s said the economic adviser criticized Mr. Trump in such strong terms that at least one wondered how he could possibly remain in his position.As soon as Mr. Bannon arrived at the White House on Inauguration Day, he seemed to realize that he would not be long for the job. He felt that Mr. Trump had treated him as a peer during the presidential campaign, but, he often complained to friends, \u201cwhen I got to the White House, all of a sudden I was just a staffer.\u201dOpponents\u2019 mythology around Mr. Bannon often held that he was the evil genius who pushed the president to make some of his more audacious decisions. And Mr. Bannon\u2019s political opponents believe his departure has removed one of the biggest impediments to stability inside the White House.\u201cMy view is that the president has his own mind,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and a former White House political director under George W. Bush. \u201cPeople make too much of the idea that he\u2019s some kind of blank slate that advisers can push one way or the other.\u201dSteve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008 and is a critic of the president, said: \u201cWe are seeing all of the personal qualities and character of the president on a daily basis. It\u2019s not restrainable or controllable because he is who he is.\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s opponents had long argued that he inflated his importance in White House debates and took more than his fair share of credit in plotting Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. But he was someone with whom the president, for the most part, had long enjoyed spending time.The two men, whose friendship was cemented during the two and a half months in which Mr. Bannon helped rescue Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, reinforced each other\u2019s rough-around-the-edges tendencies. Both could be gratuitously foul-mouthed, viciously cutting to their enemies and unapologetically politically incorrect. \u201cDude, he\u2019s Archie Bunker,\u201d Mr. Bannon would say with fondness when talking about Mr. Trump.Mr. Bannon fed Mr. Trump\u2019s paranoid streak and shared the president\u2019s penchant for believing in conspiracies. He viewed not just intelligence agencies but most of government as stocked with a devious bureaucratic underbelly, the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Mr. Trump, who has never worked in government, eagerly adopted that view.Mr. Bannon was notorious for maintaining his own, shadowy presence within the White House. He would frequently skip meetings where policy was discussed, injecting his views into the process in other ways, according to two administration officials. He did not use a computer, preferring to have paper printed and handed to his assistant to stay outside the formal decision-making process.Mr. Bannon favored a culture similar to the one Mr. Trump brought with him from the business world to the White House \u2014 a flat structure with blurred lines of responsibility and competing power centers. And early on Mr. Bannon benefited from that structure, sitting at the top, free to slip unvetted materials to the president without a gatekeeper to get past.\u201cTheoretically, a more coherent staff should produce a more coherent policy,\u201d said David Axelrod, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s senior adviser and the person in a comparable role to Mr. Bannon in the White House. \u201cBut that presupposes a president who embraces the process and the policy.\u201dWith little process to speak of, tensions over policy swelled. Ideological differences devolved into caustic personality clashes. Perhaps nowhere was the mutual disgust thicker than between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law.Mr. Bannon openly complained to White House colleagues that he resented how Ms. Trump would try to undo some of the major policy initiatives that he and Mr. Trump agreed were important to the president\u2019s economic nationalist agenda, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accords. In this sense, he was relieved when Mr. Kelly took over and put in place a structure that kept other aides from freelancing.\u201cThose days are over when Ivanka can run in and lay her head on the desk and cry,\u201d he told multiple people.Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who had helped oust Mr. Kelly\u2019s predecessor, whom they saw as ineffective, also told people that they wanted a new system for the same reason.Mr. Bannon made little secret of the fact that he believed \u201cJavanka,\u201d as he referred to the couple behind their backs, had na\u00efve political instincts and were going to alienate Mr. Trump\u2019s core coalition of white working-class voters.He told White House colleagues including the president that too many conservative Republicans in Congress would balk if Mr. Trump took their advice and showed more flexibility on immigration, particularly toward young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.He also advised that ideological softening would buy the president no good will from Democrats or independent voters, whom Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump believe Mr. Trump still has a chance of reaching.\u201cThey hate the very mention of his name,\u201d Mr. Bannon told them. \u201cThere is no constituency for this.\u201dHis advice for the president: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the base. And you grow the base by getting\u201d things done.Mr. Bannon\u2019s disdain for General McMaster also accelerated his demise. The war veteran has never quite clicked with the president, but other West Wing staff members recoiled at a series of smears against General McMaster by internet allies of Mr. Bannon. The strategist denied involvement, but he also did not speak out against them.By the time Charlottesville erupted, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump had a powerful ally in Mr. Kelly, who shared their belief that Mr. Trump\u2019s first statement blaming \u201cmany sides\u201d for the deadly violence needed to be amended.Mr. Bannon vigorously objected. He told Mr. Kelly that if Mr. Trump delivered a second, more contrite statement it would do him no good, with either the public or the Washington press corps, which he denigrated as a \u201cPretorian guard\u201d protecting the Democrats\u2019 consensus that Mr. Trump is a race-baiting demagogue. Mr. Trump could grovel, beg for forgiveness, even get down on his knees; it would never work, Mr. Bannon maintained.\u201cThey\u2019re going to say two things: It\u2019s too late and it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Mr. Bannon told Mr. Kelly.In truth, long before Charlottesville, Mr. Trump had begun losing patience. The arrival of Mr. Kelly to play precisely the gatekeeping role that would stymie aides like Mr. Bannon hastened his departure.The president believed that Mr. Bannon had been leaking unauthorized stories about infighting in the administration for months before he ultimately took action.Mr. Trump was irritated by a book, \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d that portrayed Mr. Bannon as a brilliant political Svengali but put Mr. Trump in a supporting role.When one Trump ally noted to him recently that Mr. Bannon did help him at the end of the race, Mr. Trump interrupted, \u201cYou know, he came very late.\u201dThe week of Aug. 7, Mr. Bannon suggested timing the departure to Aug. 14, which was a day after his one-year anniversary working for Mr. Trump on the campaign. It made sense to everyone.Mr. Bannon\u2019s physical appearance was crumbling, and his mood swings had become pronounced.In late July, after a weekend with Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who finances some of his projects, Mr. Bannon told him, \u201cI dread going back\u201d to the White House.But after Charlottesville, Mr. Bannon maintained that an Aug. 14 exit would look like part of the president\u2019s response to the violence. He did not want that, and others were understanding. So they discussed moving the date to around Labor Day weekend, although two administration officials said Mr. Bannon sought to entirely renegotiate the terms of his departure.Then came Mr. Bannon\u2019s unguarded comments to The American Prospect, published on Wednesday evening. He denigrated some colleagues, specifically identified one that he was going to see fired and said of striking North Korea, \u201cThere\u2019s no military solution here, they got us\u201d \u2014 a direct contradiction to the message Mr. Trump had been sending. Mr. Bannon could buy no more time.Kate Kelly contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beneath Markets\u2019 Calm Are Signs of Growing Investor Caution", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump threatened nuclear war with North Korea, and the markets yawned.While stocks in Asia sold off initially, the main market measures in the United States fell less than half a percent on Wednesday and ended the day nearly unchanged, as investors stuck to focusing on buoyant economic fundamentals and ignoring the chaos of American politics.But beneath the calm there were signs that investors \u2014 who have been conditioned since the presidential election in November to embrace risk instead of running from it \u2014 are becoming more cautious.The price of gold, a traditional safe investment, has been rising, and on Wednesday it continued its march, increasing more than 1 percent on the day.Gold\u2019s strong move pushed it just barely ahead of the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for the year \u2014 up 10.75 percent, compared with 10.69 percent for the S.&P., according to Y Charts, a data-gathering company.On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 and the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended the day virtually flat.Earlier, the Nikkei index in Japan closed down 1.29 percent, while the Kospi index in South Korea ended down 1.10 percent. European stocks were also lower, with London down 0.56 percent and Frankfurt down 1.12 percent.Prices of United States Treasury securities \u2014 often in demand in times of turmoil \u2014 rose early in the day, driving their yields, which move in the opposite direction, lower. But Treasury prices gave up ground in the afternoon, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.25 percent, from 2.26 percent on Tuesday.Gold futures rose 1.59 percent, to $1,282.40 an ounce.Gold tends to outperform stocks when the markets are sliding, so it is unusual for such a conservative investment to beat equities when they have been on a tear as has been the case this year.What is driving this anomaly, some say, is a recognition that eventually investors will not be able to ignore recent headline risks \u2014 whether nuclear tensions with North Korea, a trade war with China or a debt ceiling crisis in Washington.\u201cThere has been a Pavlovian response by investors to disregard any piece of bad news or any spike in volatility, and that has been a very profitable strategy,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, a portfolio manager for BlackRock\u2019s $39 billion Global Allocation Fund. \u201cBut we do think that there are risks in the world that are not being priced in.\u201dThe VIX rose nearly 9 percent on Wednesday after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about North Korea, before settling up just 1.37 percent, at 11.11 for the day. The index has been trading at historically low levels, and many investors continue to wager that lots of money pouring into markets and an improving global economy will keep the index quiescent.Mr. Koesterich, however, has been taking the opposite side of that trade. Since the beginning of the year, he has been adding to his gold position, and it is now the Global Allocation Fund\u2019s second-largest position, according to Y Charts.Mr. Koesterich is not alone in adopting a wary stance, especially now in August, when trading desks on Wall Street empty out and lower levels of buying and selling can result in sharper downward moves in the market.While few people are predicting an actual crash, a growing number of stock market specialists are warning that in the coming months, markets are likely to start reacting more to so-called macro events such as political volatility and the realization that central bankers in Europe and the United States are moving toward a more restrictive stance on interest rates and intervening in markets.That is because the benign market conditions of recent months have been spurred by better economic news, and, in particular, by a very good spate of second-quarter earnings.Once investors return from vacation, the theory goes, and with no good earnings news to inspire them, they will be more sensitive to headline events.That could result in sharper moves downward in stock market indexes.\u201cThere are risks,\u201d said Marko Kolanovic a market strategist and derivatives specialist at JPMorgan Chase, who warned in a recent report about an increase in trading volatility this fall. \u201cChina, North Korea and the normalization of policies by central banks, which has been underappreciated by the market.\u201dBut while many investors have shaken off scares such as Britain exiting the European Union or political unrest in Washington, the view is taking hold that gold can be a very good hedge against more serious threats like nuclear confrontation in Asia.\u201cThere has been a wall of money supporting markets so far,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, a market strategist at Exotix Capital in London. \u201cBut this time we are not just talking about a macro surprise \u2014 we are talking about full-on military action.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street\u2019s \u2018Fear Gauge\u2019 Skyrockets as Tensions Rise With North Korea", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExit greed, enter fear.The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index closed the day down 2.13 percent, and the broader Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell by 1.45 percent as investors sold out of such high-flying stocks as Amazon, Facebook and Netflix. It was the sharpest daily decline in the benchmark S.&P. 500 since May 17.Gold held at $1,283.70 an ounce after its strong run of late, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan steadied from its fall on Wednesday, closing at 19,730. The relative safety of United States Treasury securities continued to appeal, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 2.20 percent from 2.25 percent on Wednesday. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions from each other.)At the root of investors\u2019 nervousness was a jump in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the index measures investor expectations that stocks will experience sharp moves in the future.On Thursday, the VIX surged 44 percent from its historically low levels to close the day at 16.04, its highest close since Election Day in November.For many weeks this year, the VIX hovered persistently in single-digit territory, unusual for a barometer that historically trades around 20.The index\u2019s long period of placidity amid constant upheaval in Washington has posed a persistent riddle for Wall Street prognosticators.Some analysts warned that expectations of low volatility had lured a rush of recent investment, particularly from retail investors piling into exchange traded funds tied to the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and other indexes and strategies.A sharp upward trend in the VIX could well prompt many of those newcomers to flee at the same time, which could turn a market downturn into something more severe.The potential risks extend beyond those who are new to the party. In recent years, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into risk parity and other machine-driven funds that are programmed to start selling stocks and bonds once volatility rises sharply.In a period of investment calm and artificially low interest rates, automated funds, which churn out consistent if unspectacular returns, have become very popular among yield-hungry investors.\u201cBy definition, investors tend to be long the most risk when volatility is at its lowest levels,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investments. \u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201dAfter many years in which investors made a mint by betting against the VIX, a number of investors have begun to argue that the time has come to wager on the VIX \u2014 not against it.Of course, it may be too early to predict the end of one of the longest bull markets in financial history. The global economy continues to grow, and companies in the United States remain highly profitable, with earnings and sales in the quarter that ended in June handily beating expectations.The VIX\u2019s sharp move could also simply be a reversion to its mean and not a sign of panic in the markets.Analysts noted that a long period of stock market calm is highly unusual and that a correction should not come as a shock.Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm, said that before today\u2019s sell-off, the S.&P. 500 had experienced only two down days of more than 1 percent this year; the last similarly long period of financial calm was in 1964.That reserve of buying power, be it retail or institutional, has cushioned stock market drops in the past, and optimists are hoping that it will do so again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shut Down the Government, and This Time, Investors Will Care", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair Game\u201cIf we have to close down our government, we\u2019re building that wall.\u201dAnd with those words, the president managed to rattle investors in two big financial markets \u2014 United States Treasuries and stocks.In recent years, government shutdowns have become so common that markets have either embraced them or shrugged them off. But as investors absorb the possibility of a closure this fall, market tremors are likely to intensify, experts say. The past will not necessarily be prologue this time around.Investors are grappling with two matters right now: the need to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling in September so the government can pay its obligations, and the desire to have a federal budget in place by Oct. 1 to avoid a shutdown.But the next day Mr. Trump invoked the government shutdown, spooking Treasury investors. Faced with the possibility of problems with both the debt ceiling and a shutdown, investors holding T-bills maturing in early October began selling. Short-term Treasury investors, like the institutions that oversee money market funds, can\u2019t afford to wait around to see if they\u2019ll be paid on time. It\u2019s easier to bail out of the holdings that could be affected.Stocks also weakened on the prospect of a shutdown \u2014 a very different investor response than has been seen during recent government closures.Mr. Boltansky looked back at the stock market\u2019s performance during all 18 government shutdowns, starting in 1976. He found that the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index averaged just a 0.6 percent loss over the course of those closures.Early on in shutdown history, investors reacted very negatively. Closures in 1976 and 1977 coincided with 3 percent declines in the S. & P. 500.As investors grew more accustomed to shutdowns, they seemed to become more blas\u00e9 about them. During the mid-1990s and the 2013 closure, for instance, stocks actually rose. They gained 3.1 percent during the 2013 stoppage.Although stocks rose on Friday, investors should not expect such a performance this time, Mr. Boltansky said. One reason is that a government closure would raise serious doubts about the ability of the Republicans in Congress to get anything done.\u201cIt will confirm one of the market\u2019s fears that the Republicans are not a political party but a government coalition made up of leadership loyalists, conservatives and moderates,\u201d Mr. Boltansky said. \u201cIf you have that dynamic, how can you get anything done legislatively?\u201dRemember that investors have been propelling stocks to record highs in part because of their expectations for pro-business action in Washington. A government shutdown could douse those hopes and drag down shares.Plans among Republicans for broad-based tax reform may also be hurt by a government shutdown. Investors looking for big increases in corporate earnings as a result of lower tax rates may be in for a disappointment.Here\u2019s another question: How can the Federal Reserve Board begin to normalize monetary policy, as it has said it would, amid a government closure?Then there\u2019s the real disruption that government closures bring. Federal employees are furloughed, national parks closed and loans to small businesses halted. These shutdowns can result in real downturns in economic activity.The report\u2019s list of negative effects from the shutdown is long. It said the stoppage delayed Food and Drug Administration approvals of medical devices and drugs, stalled almost $4 billion in refunds to taxpayers, halted or curtailed services for veterans, and cost the National Park Service $500 million. Some 700 small businesses that had applied for roughly $140 million in loans during the shutdown had to wait until it ended to gain approval.In short, the ripple effects resulting from a government shutdown are likely to be significant. Investors who have grown used to stock prices that only go up might want to strap themselves in for a bumpy ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanks to a Shopping Spree, Japan Is Looking Up. It May Not Last.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s long-sluggish economy has found its spark. To keep it flickering, Japan needs to find more big spenders like Sayaka Sakata.Ms. Sakata, a 49-year-old mother of four, recently moved to a rented house from an apartment in the city of Yokohama after her husband got a new job. That meant buying new stuff: a washing machine, a refrigerator, some appliances and even a used car. Saving, she said, was no longer her top priority.\u201cI\u2019m an optimistic person,\u201d she said. \u201cI think spending money on my family is more important.\u201dThe unexpected surge in economic growth reported in Japan this week was thanks in large part to an unexpected source: Japanese consumers.Long known as aging penny pinchers, Japanese shoppers in recent months have decided to spend. Data showed they bought more cars, air-conditioners, television sets and other appliances during the three months that ended in June, fueling an unusually high annualized growth rate of 4 percent.But the June quarter results have left many economists scratching their heads. Despite low unemployment figures and a year and a half of slow-but-steady economic growth, worker pay in Japan has been mostly stagnant. Overall wages fell in June compared with a year ago, according to official data.This week\u2019s figures could suggest paychecks will start to rise and Japan\u2019s consumers are feeling better. Or, economists say, the figures could be a fluke, leaving Japan to keep looking for ways to escape its slow-growth rut.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is permanent consumption,\u201d said Kozo Ueda, a professor of political science and economics at Waseda University in Tokyo. \u201cI think it\u2019ll decrease in the next quarter because the figures in this quarter are too strong.\u201dWhen workers retire, Japanese companies often replace them with temporary workers, who make less than regular hires, depressing wages even more. Temporary workers, like freelance or contract workers, make up about one-third of the country\u2019s work force.\u201cThere\u2019s still question marks all over wages,\u201d said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research for the Asia-Pacific region at ING, the Dutch bank.That has left some workers feeling confident. Jimmy Yoon, for example, just bought his dream car: a Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicle.The Jeep will not be cheap. Mr. Yoon, a 26-year-old South Korean living in Japan, has committed to paying $1,000 a month for the next three years. But he just got a job in logistics in Tokyo at an e-commerce company and his stock investments are beginning to pay off.\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my stocks since university, and I\u2019ve actually been aiming to get a car since when I was 21 years old,\u201d Mr. Yoon said. \u201cThat was the final goal, to get the money.\u201dA new job also gave Mika Funaba, 26, new confidence. Last year, while working in hospitality, she was reluctant to spend. But then she got a position in a Yokohama salon as a beauty therapist specializing in eyelash extensions. Feeling more secure, she recently spent about $3,000 on improving her teeth and took a trip to the Philippines.Of her new, $4,500-a-month income, Ms. Funaba said, \u201cI know that it will never go down, but it won\u2019t necessarily go up.\u201dStill, economists say the consumer sales rise could be explained by more temporary factors.For one, several different kinds of durable goods have reached the end of their life cycles, said Professor Ueda of Waseda University. Six years ago, Japan ended analog TV service, prompting demand for flat-screen TVs. And the government has encouraged the purchase of environmentally friendly appliances.The key to wage growth may be productivity. Franz Waldenberger, director and chief economist of the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, says low unemployment will not result in significant wage increases by itself.Wages could rise if productivity does, he said, and \u201cthat would be an excellent performance given the demographic condition of an aging population.\u201dStill, Ms. Sakata of Yokohama said that she has reason to believe the good times will stick.\u201cI remember four years ago reading a lot about young graduates finding it hard to get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t really see that anymore. I\u2019ve encouraged my 21-year-old son, who\u2019s studying in Australia, to come back to Japan because the job market looks good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jobs, Factories and Stocks Provide Economic Lift for Trump", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA stock market hitting record highs. Foreign corporations announcing big new plants in the United States. And robust hiring that has brought the unemployment rate to a 16-year low.That convergence added up to a solid economic report card on Friday that President Trump was happy to present to the nation as a sign of good work.On the hiring front, the Labor Department reported that 209,000 jobs were added in July, somewhat above Wall Street economists\u2019 expectations, with the unemployment rate matching May\u2019s 4.3 percent, the lowest since early 2001.And while the stock market had a relatively quiet day, the Dow Jones industrial average reached another high, two days after it closed above 22,000 for the first time.As all that positive economic news ricocheted through Wall Street, on social media and around office cubicles, conversation inevitably turned to one question: How much credit does Mr. Trump deserve?President Trump has taken to Twitter to celebrate his handling of the economy. But how much credit can he really claim?In a series of early-morning tweets, the president claimed quite a bit.On the hiring news, he declared, \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released \u2014 and I have only just begun.\u201d Earlier, in addition to saluting the \u201cgreat investment\u201d by Toyota and Mazda, he noted, \u201cConsumer confidence is at a 16 year high .... and for good reason.\u201d Both tweets pointed to a looser regulatory environment as a factor.Of course, as economists are fond of saying, correlation is not causation. Many of the trends Mr. Trump is benefiting from \u2014 falling unemployment, steady hiring, a rising stock market \u2014 were firmly in place under his predecessor, Barack Obama.And in the case of Friday\u2019s jobs data, Mr. Trump is citing figures he called phony not long ago on the campaign trail.In the end, there is no way to quantify exactly how much credit the president is due for attracting foreign investment or encouraging the creation of jobs here instead of overseas.But even some skeptics of his overall approach concede that Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of tax reform and higher infrastructure spending, as well as pressure to increase domestic manufacturing, are resonating in boardrooms in the United States and abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s still 80 percent lip service in the corporate world, but there are some executives who want to support Trump\u2019s initiatives,\u201d said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies who covers aerospace and defense giants like Boeing and United Technologies.Ravin Gandhi, founder and chief executive of GMM Nonstick Coatings in Chicago, is a case in point.The son of immigrants from India, Mr. Gandhi fiercely opposed Mr. Trump before the election, even appearing on CNBC to denounce the candidate\u2019s proposals on trade, immigration and health care.After Mr. Trump was elected, however, \u201cI bought into the economic growth rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said. \u201cI was hearing stories about 4 percent growth, about tax reform and my health care costs going down.\u201dNone of that has come to pass, of course.But this year Mr. Gandhi has invested $3 million to expand domestically and hired more than 20 employees, even though sales are flat compared with 2016, when they were up by double digits.\u201cIt\u2019s nuanced,\u201d he said, noting that his company was recently purchased by a Japanese conglomerate and that the American houseware firms he supplies make their pots and pans mostly overseas.\u201cA lot of us who were against Trump are still rooting for him to succeed because as citizens we want the economy to do well,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said. \u201cBut so far, it\u2019s been all hat and no cattle.\u201dDespite generally strong earnings, many manufacturers continue to shed jobs.In December, Mr. Trump persuaded United Technologies, parent of Carrier, not to proceed with a shutdown of an Indianapolis plant, but the company did go ahead with several hundred previously announced layoffs last month.\u201cWhen it matches the market, companies are still establishing production outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Rubel said.\u201cIf it\u2019s a tossup, though, companies seem more willing to keep the work here,\u201d he added. \u201cThe optics are better, especially if it will help them in their pitch for tax reform, infrastructure or to get defense contracts.\u201dPerhaps even more than outsourcing, the real threat to job growth for Mr. Trump\u2019s blue-collar base comes from automation and other efforts to improve productivity on the factory floor. In Mr. Obama\u2019s final year in office, Boeing\u2019s work force fell to 148,138 from 159,469, according to Mr. Rubel.Boeing reported stellar earnings recently, lifting its stock to record levels, but it has cut another 4,500 positions since Mr. Trump moved into the White House.The factory sector has been showing signs of life this year, although experts said that has more to do with improving economies overseas and a weaker dollar that benefits exporters than with any specific White House policies. Still, manufacturers added 16,000 jobs in July, lifting employment in the sector to its highest level since January 2009.On the other hand, wage growth, the missing ingredient throughout the recovery, has remained tepid. The Labor Department said wages grew by 0.3 percent last month, bringing the 12-month gain to 2.5 percent, down from 2.8 percent a year ago.It is not such good news for American workers, but moderate salary gains are just fine with Wall Street. The lack of upward pressure on wages gives the Federal Reserve ample room to maneuver before its next rate increase.\u201cThis is a Goldilocks report for the markets,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, meaning it was not too hot or too cold, but just right for investors and Fed policy makers. The Dow closed up 66.71 to finish the week at 22,092.81.Mr. Gapen said the latest jobs figures suggested the central bank would stick with the plan Wall Street has been anticipating: a reduction in its bond holdings in September as the central bank gradually reduces its stimulus efforts, followed by a rate increase in December.For Mr. Trump and leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill, business owners say the key is to requite their increased optimism and hiring with actual accomplishments.\u201cWe may not agree in corporate America with the president on social issues like global warming or transgender people serving in the military,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company.But Mr. Gimbel, who opened a new office in Nashville on Monday and plans to add 100 workers this year, said he remained confident that the president and Congress would deliver on their promise of business-friendly legislation in the next year or two.\u201cTrump hasn\u2019t done anything tangible yet, but he has injected hope for corporate growth, tax reform and deregulation among business leaders, and that\u2019s driving hiring,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said.An earlier version of this article misstated the increase in average hourly earnings in July. It was 0.3 percent, not 0.4 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Threats on Health Law Hide an Upside: Gains Made by Some Insurers", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has not been a market for the faint of heart.Supporters of the Affordable Care Act achieved a major victory this past week when, thanks to cajoling and arm-twisting by state regulators, the last \u201cbare\u201d county in America \u2014 in rural Ohio \u2014 found an insurer willing to sell health coverage through the law\u2019s marketplace there. So despite earlier indications that insurance companies would stop offering coverage under the law in large parts of the country, insurers have now agreed to sell policies everywhere.But a moment of truth still looms for the industry in the coming weeks under the law known as Obamacare. Companies must set their final plans and premiums by late September, even as the Trump administration continues to threaten to cut off billions of dollars in government subsidies promised by the legislation. Insurers are also awaiting Senate hearings set to start on Sept. 6 for a hint of what steps, if any, lawmakers may take to stabilize the market.With congressional Republicans\u2019 yearslong quest to dismantle the Affordable Care Act dead for now, the fate of the landmark law depends in large part on the health of the insurance marketplaces and the ability of insurers to make a viable business out of selling coverage to individuals. When the law passed seven years ago, insurers saw a potential bonanza: tens of millions of brand-new paying customers, many backed by generous government subsidies and required by the new law to have health coverage. Now, about four years after the law\u2019s marketplaces opened for business, most of the industry\u2019s biggest players have pulled out.\u201cOutside of the noise,\u201d the surviving companies \u201care seeing a path forward in this marketplace,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s who has examined the financial results of more than two dozen Blue Cross insurers.\u201cIt is still a new market,\u201d he added, \u201cand everyone is adjusting to it.\u201dThe healthier business outlook has been achieved at a big cost to consumers. To stanch their losses, many companies raised their prices substantially for this year while narrowing their networks of providers to hold down costs. In Phoenix, for example, a typical plan\u2019s monthly premiums more than doubled. Although people with incomes low enough to qualify for federal subsidies were shielded from the brunt of the steep increases, the higher prices prompted Republicans to blame the law for plans that were out of many people\u2019s reach.In some cases, companies will seek even higher rates for 2018; the lone insurer left in Iowa is asking for a nearly 60 percent increase, on average.A New York Times analysis of insurance market data.Under the health law, in exchange for the wellspring of new customers, insurers agreed to operate using a fundamentally different business model. As the law required, they offered coverage to everyone, including people with existing medical conditions, and no longer charged people in poor health sharply higher prices.But the industry\u2019s enthusiasm gave way to misgivings as insurers lost billions of dollars in the law\u2019s first years. Eager to enroll as many people as possible, many companies set prices too low because they had no experience covering these new customers. Some people, especially if they were young and healthy, complained about higher premiums, even though the prices were often below the actual cost of providing medical care. Insurers had a hard time managing people with the biggest medical expenses, and fewer healthier people than expected signed up.Some of the nation\u2019s largest and best-known companies, including Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group, lost tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars each. Aetna said it has lost roughly $900 million since 2014.\u201cThis market proved to be quite cutthroat,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cSome of the big, old-time, insurers couldn\u2019t compete on cost.\u201d The companies modeled their plans on those they offered in the employer market, where there were broad, and expensive, networks of hospitals and doctors.Most of the insurance start-ups inspired by the Affordable Care Act, including Northwell\u2019s CareConnect and the so-called co-ops created under the law, could not survive.Pointing to what he described as the failures of the federal government and Congress, Michael J. Dowling, Northwell\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that it had become \u201cincreasingly clear that continuing the CareConnect health plan is financially unsustainable.\u201dThe individual market is estimated to encompass around 20 million people, including those who buy coverage directly from a broker or insurance company and do not qualify for a subsidy. In contrast, about 155 million Americans get coverage through their jobs. The large insurers abandoned the individual market under the health law because it was not worth the energy required to make it work, said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners. \u201cThey were losing money, and they have other businesses that are very profitable.\u201d Those businesses have helped push many insurers\u2019 stocks to record highs.But among the insurers that are still in the game, Centene, a for-profit company, is now making money in the individual market and expanding. Some of the Blue Cross insurers, including Health Care Service Corp., which operates plans in multiple states, including Texas and Illinois, and Independence Blue Cross, which has 300,000 customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, began to turn a profit in the market this year.\u201cIt does take a couple of years, and our membership has climbed steadily,\u201d said Daniel J. Hilferty, the chief executive of Independence Blue Cross. The company is currently seeking to raise rates around 8.5 percent next year but the increases could be sharply higher, especially if the administration decides to effectively end the penalty people face for not enrolling, Mr. Hilferty said. He worries about what could happen next in Washington.The company is \u201cmoving in the right direction,\u201d said Joel Klein, a senior executive with Oscar, one of whose founders is Joshua Kushner, the brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.The health law has also provided insurers, including major players, with another opportunity to make money: the expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal government program for low-income people that now covers nearly 75 million people, according to the Kaiser foundation. About 14 million people enrolled in the program in states that accepted federal funding.The insurers that stayed in the individual market have come to realize that the individual market was more like Medicaid than the employer business. Some customers have chronic conditions that have been poorly treated in the past, and insurers need to manage their care more closely. People shopping for a plan are very concerned about price, making it essential for insurers to find hospitals and doctors that provide care at the lowest cost.Companies in a position to offer low-cost plans have thrived. Centene made use of its experience, including setting up networks of hospitals and doctors that care for Medicaid patients, to sell coverage. The company now insures about 1.1 million people in the individual market, and almost half of the counties left bare by its competitors. \u201cFor 2018, we intend to grow this profitable segment of our business,\u201d Michael Neidorff, the company\u2019s chief executive, told investors last month.The lack of clarity over both the market\u2019s future and the efforts to stabilize it could also lead to much higher prices next year. Some insurers are requesting rate increases of 20 to 30 percent or more. \u201cJust as they\u2019re getting their footing, they have the worst thing that can happen to an insurance company: uncertainty about the business model,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ondra, a former insurance executive who worked in the Obama administration.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to stop reimbursing insurers for plans that waive deductibles and co-payments for low-income people are particularly worrisome. Under the law, insurers must offer these more generous plans, and they priced their policies assuming they would receive about $7 billion from the government this year to cover the costs. The companies are paid monthly, and Congress has not appropriated the money. Mr. Trump could stop the checks.Insurers can still choose to leave in the coming weeks if they decide there is too much confusion about what will happen next year, especially if they are asked to lock in prices that assume government funding without a guarantee, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThere are so many unknowns,\u201d she said.Follow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}

Officials are pursuing banks and corporations for violating foreign exchange regulations, and investigations are reportedly underway into big offshore investments by private companies. There are signs that capital is still sneaking out of China through disguised channels like tourism spending. Thus the only currency liberalization under consideration is a widening of the yuan\u2019s trading band, a move that would make no practical difference.But conservatism is not costless. China wants more overseas money in the debt markets, to lift the pressure on domestic banks, introduce more market discipline and push the internationalization of its currency. Capital controls deter otherwise enthusiastic foreign institutions from investing. Lifting them would help convince skeptics that Beijing is ready to resume reform. It would also serve as a sign of confidence that might dissuade Chinese onlookers from rushing for the exits before they close even tighter.To be sure, some caution is warranted. If the United States economy keeps heating up, the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates aggressively, and the dollar could rise again. Alternatively, a disaster \u2014 like a war with North Korea \u2014 could set off a flight to dollar safety.But even if the dollar were to strengthen again, that would not necessarily result in another round of panicked outflows. Many of the worries that aggravated capital flight in 2016 have since eased.

{"Headline": "Why the Dow Isn\u2019t Really the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesDespite a few rocky days recently, the stock market is having a great year. But exactly how great depends on what you mean by \u201cthe stock market.\u201dAre you talking about the Dow Jones industrial average, the oldest and best-known measuring stick for the American stock market? If so, that one has risen more than 18 percent over the last 12 months, a spectacular return.Or are you referring to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the benchmark for large companies used by many stock professionals? If so, that market has been far less impressive, with a gain in the last 12 months of a little over 12 percent.Or do you mean something else entirely?The divergence between the two big indexes began in November, when the Dow started to surge ahead of the S.&P. 500. Though the shift in the indexes was little noticed at the time, the Dow has gained more than 20 percent since then, while the S.&P. is up about 15 percent. A gap of this magnitude is unusual: The two indexes usually move within a percentage point or two of one another. Why has this happened? To a surprising extent, the divergence depends on just two stocks, Apple and Boeing, and on the ways in which the two indexes are constructed.Both companies have had outstanding performances recently. Boeing stock, which trades at about $235, is up roughly 50 percent for the calendar year. Apple, which trades at roughly $157, has risen about 36 percent. But what may appear puzzling is that while Boeing has had a barely noticeable impact on the S.&P. 500, it has provided a gigantic lift to the Dow.According to data supplied by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, Boeing accounts for one quarter of the Dow\u2019s entire increase for 2017. That\u2019s almost double Apple\u2019s contribution.Yet Apple is the most valuable company in the entire stock market; its market capitalization is more than $800 billion. Boeing, while hardly small, has a market capitalization of only about $135 billion. Such considerations are critical in the S.&P. 500. Stocks with a bigger market cap have a proportionately bigger impact on the index. That\u2019s why it is known as a \u201cmarket-weighted index,\u201d and why professionals use it much more widely than the Dow.\u201cThe S.&P. tells you much more about how the market is really doing,\u201d said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor and market historian at the Wharton School. \u201cModern indexes that track stock markets are generally market weighted.\u201dThe Dow is not a modern index. It is old and simple, created more than a century ago by Charles Dow, who was the co-founder of Dow Jones and the first editor of The Wall Street Journal. For many , the Dow is synonymous with the American stock market. \u201cIf you say, how many points did the market move today, you\u2019re talking about the Dow,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a crazy way to measure the market.\u201dOnly 30 stocks are included in the index, which uses a measuring system so simple that it seems arbitrary: Stocks are weighted by price. That means that the highest-priced share of a stock \u2014 which happens to be Boeing at the moment \u2014 has the greatest sway in the index.Consider the implications of using that kind of index. Imagine that you are creating a food index based on all of the items you have bought in the last year.You purchased one jar of caviar and 1,000 cans of tuna fish. In a price-weighted index, caviar will have the biggest overall impact because it\u2019s the most expensive item you\u2019ve bought, even though you spent far more money on tuna. The rise and fall of caviar is the powerhouse that controls your price-weighted food index, even if you never buy caviar again in your life.\u201cNo one would build a stock market index that way today,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut remember, Charles Dow did it without computers, and it basically works. It tells you how the market performed and it requires relatively little calculation.\u201d It has some idiosyncrasies, though. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a $1,000 stock in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a stock like Amazon in it without all kinds of adjustments because its price is too high and it will change the index too much.\u201dConsider what the Dow looks like now. Through Thursday, Boeing\u2019s weighting in the index \u2014 based entirely on the price of a single share of Boeing stock \u2014 was 7.3 percent, Mr. Silverblatt said. Close behind were Goldman Sachs at a 7.07 percent weighting; 3M, with a 6.47 percent weighting; United Health, at 6.04 percent; and McDonald\u2019s, at 4.91 percent. Apple was only in sixth place in the Dow, with a weighting of 4.85 percent.Because of this price-weighting system, Boeing has more than nine times the stature in the Dow as General Electric. Yet G.E.\u2019s total value \u2014 its market capitalization \u2014 is much greater than Boeing\u2019s. No matter. Boeing has a far bigger impact on the Dow, and on \u201cthe market,\u201d if we are using the Dow as a shorthand way of talking about all stocks, than G.E. does.Is there a better way of defining the stock market? Absolutely. There are many other indexes. The S.&P. 500 does a good job of measuring large-capitalization stocks but it misses thousands of smaller ones.By that broader and no less precise definition, the market is not doing quite as well as either the Dow or the S.&P. would have you believe. The CRSP index is trailing the Dow by more than 2 percentage points this year, and is behind the S.&P. by more than three quarters of a percentage point. That may be why your stock portfolio, if it is diversified enough to capture the entire market, isn\u2019t turning in a performance as spectacular as the daily news reports may suggest.The problem may just be that everybody is talking about the Dow. They are not really talking about the stock market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

It would also put experienced managers in boardrooms and spur more professional practices.Since the plan was announced, under the firm guidance of Beijing, some state-run companies have sought out investments from private firms as well as state-run companies from other industries.In the case of China Unicom, the country\u2019s three biggest internet companies are investing: Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant; Tencent Holdings, which runs China\u2019s most popular social-messaging service; and Baidu, the online search company that is sometimes called the Google of China. The biggest new shareholder would be China Life Insurance, a state-run firm, which would have about a 10 percent stake, China Unicom said.\u201cThere is an immediate, serious problem with this initiative in that the best outcome is more competition, not cooperation\u201d between state companies and private firms, said Derek Scissors, a China-focused resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.\u201cIt still could be an improvement over the current situation, if private firms are permitted to genuinely change S.O.E. practices,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. He added, however, \u201cThere\u2019s been no evidence of this yet.\u201d\u201cIt seems for the last two-and-a-half years the tide has been moving toward state capital at the expense of private capital,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a partner at Gavekal, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not very encouraging.\u201dStill, China Unicom\u2019s deal has the potential to be different because some successful private companies are involved, Mr. Kroeber said.\u201cThis can be fairly interpreted as a signal that there\u2019s a fairly serious effort to restart this mixed ownership reform in more or less the format that was originally planned,\u201d he said.China\u2019s technology firms have quickly outmaneuvered state-run telecom businesses, with social-messaging apps that replaced text messaging and by building their own e-commerce networks. While state-owned firms have built the highways, private companies have learned how to go the fastest.Martin Lau, president of Tencent, told investors on an earnings call on Wednesday that the deal represents a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in China\u2019s economic overhaul effort, and added that Tencent does not expect the deal to result in more regulatory pressure on the company. An Alibaba spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other companies involved include JD.com, which like Tencent is an Alibaba rival, suggesting the new shareholders may not always have the same agenda.Under Wednesday\u2019s deal, the company that is China Unicom\u2019s immediate shareholder will sell new and existing shares to the new owners. The largest shareholder of that company will remain China United Network Communications Group, China Unicom\u2019s state-controlled ultimate parent.Paul Mozur contributed reporting in Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.Now, a new generation of day traders, deploying an expanding array of opaque, high-risk, high-return trading vehicles concocted by Wall Street, are pouring into one of the market\u2019s most arcane corners, making bets on whether the VIX \u2014 otherwise known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 will rise or fall.Wagering on the fear gauge, a measure of how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead, has traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors with the cash and financial relationships to purchase the derivatives that facilitate these trades.In the years after the financial crisis, however, investment banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse came out with VIX-linked investments that investors could purchase on the stock exchange, just as if they were buying shares of IBM or Microsoft.Called exchange traded notes, they were a racier version of the exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that track every variety of index and investment strategy and now have more than $4 trillion in investor assets.Led by Barclays iPath S&P 500 Short Term Futures ETN (VXX), these investments have attracted over $14 billion in investor flows since 2012, according to FactSet, a data-gathering firm.There are now more than 30 different VIX-themed investment choices (including some that use leverage, amplifying gains and losses) that investors can snap up on a public exchange.Because they are so easy to trade and because the question driving the trade \u2014 Will the markets succumb to fear or won\u2019t they? \u2014 borders on the existential, a new wave of millennial day traders has been at the forefront of this trade.And many are using Stock Twits, the social media investing website embraced by stay-at-home investors, as well as Twitter and Facebook to passionately promote their strategies.But this explosion in interest is prompting concerns that investors may not be truly aware of what they are getting into.In theory, the murky nomenclature of these investments ought to be warning enough for amateur investors to tread with caution. And it is also true that the fund prospectuses warn bluntly that investors can lose large sums of money if they buy and hold these investments.\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d Mr. Whaley said. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201dIndeed, the most popular of the funds, the Barclays iPath fund, known broadly by its ticker symbol VXX, has since its inception averaged a yearly return of negative 58 percent, according to FactSet.While many professionals will purchase these securities to hedge their exposure to the stock market, analysts say that day traders are now using them to gamble on a sharp spike in the VIX.\u201cYou have seen this infusion of millennials coming in and buying VXX and UVXY,\u201d Mr. Moadel said, referring to the main VIX product and its leveraged cousin. \u201cBut most of the time they just get killed.\u201dDoing the killing, so to speak, have been investors like Mr. Golden, who consistently shorts VXX and UVXY whenever they spike upward.His bet is founded on two principles: one being that VXX and UVXY, because they track a basket of VIX futures, not the index itself, will decline in value over time as the contracts expire.He describes it as a heavy anvil weighing down on the value of each security.Mr. Golden also believes that in the decades since the VIX was introduced in 1993, its long-term trend has been to push consistently downward. Yes, there will be spikes as during major cataclysms (9/11, the 2008 financial crisis) and other less tumultuous events (a devaluation in China, a North Korea crisis or even a presidential tweet).But after every spike of fear must follow a longer period of calm, Mr. Golden contends, which, he argues, is a perfect scenario if your bias is to always bet against fear.\u201cThe nature of volatility is that it desensitizes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why the index has been tracking down for so long.\u201dJust as the frenetic buying of tech stocks by day traders in 1999 and 2000 came to be seen as a major factor behind the boom and bust, market experts say that traders like Mr. Golden who persistently short the VIX have distorted the market.\u201cThe VIX spikes have become more extreme \u2014 on the upside and the downside,\u201d said Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist at Deutsche Bank.Mr. Golden, who is 40, lives in a suburb of Ocala, Fla. Since he has been shorting VIX, he says his net worth has gone to $12 million from $500,000 in about five years.But, as with any trader on a roll, he likes to keep score, and he is quick to spar on Twitter with the traders who appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d program.Now, he is starting a hedge fund dedicated to wagering against the VIX. Investors, he says, have been pounding on his door to get in early, offering him $100 million for starters.That is a lot of money for a onetime Target manager.\u201cYes, it is a crowded trade,\u201d Mr. Golden acknowledged. \u201cBut I don\u2019t worry about crowds \u2014 I just worry what the next existential shock might be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated where Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist, works. It is Deutsche Bank, not Barclays. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Incredible Shrinking Sears", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "How a financial wizard took over a giant of American retailing, and presided over its epic decline.Supported byImagine a retailer that began by specializing in just one product, then grew into a mammoth that redefined the American shopping experience.Among its innovations: No matter where you lived, it shipped your order directly to you, whether you were looking for cast-iron cookware, a mandolin, the newest technological marvel, or the latest in petticoats.Amazon, right? Actually, it was Sears \u2014 a century ago.The brainchild of a pocket-watch salesman, Sears navigated retailing through the end of the stagecoach era, the rise (and fall) of downtown department stores and the malling of suburban America. Recently it has been battling to stay relevant with the advance of online retailers \u2014 like Amazon.For many, the story of Sears is a reflection of the carnage occurring throughout much of retail right now. In recent days, the stocks of J.C. Penney, Macy\u2019s and Dillard\u2019s all tumbled after they reported another round of quarterly sales declines. Some analysts expect Sears to report a third consecutive double-digit decline in same-store sales in the second quarter.But what may ultimately lead to the collapse of the once-great retailer is a dose of Wall Street financial engineering.Under the direction of the hedge-fund moneyman Edward S. Lampert, Sears has borrowed to the hilt. Many of its most valuable assets have been sold off. Its stores have been starved for cash and attention. An early shift in the organizational structure designed to create competition among store departments \u2014 a strategy used by some hedge funds to allocate company resources \u2014 instead led to infighting.It was all done in search of a profit that, for Mr. Lampert and his investors, has not materialized.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was inevitable that Sears would find itself in the position it is in today,\u201d said Arthur Martinez, who orchestrated a turnaround of Sears as its chief executive in the late 1990s. \u201cThe Sears brand has become largely irrelevant,\u201d he said, \u201cand it breaks my heart to say that.\u201dToday, Sears Holdings, the publicly traded entity that is the result of the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart, coordinated by Mr. Lampert, is on analysts\u2019 short list of most-likely-to-go-bankrupt retailers.Over the past decade at Sears, more than $26 billion of market value has disappeared. Revenue has been halved, as has its work force, with 175,000 people losing their jobs.This year, Sears has sued two vendors to force them to continue supplying goods even as many others reduce shipments to the retailer, concerned they could wind up empty-handed if Sears files for bankruptcy protection. One suit was settled; the other is in progress.Mr. Lampert declined to be interviewed. Responding to questions through emails, the company said it continued to work on its transformation in a difficult retail environment and that it had no plans to file for bankruptcy.The company also disputed the idea that Mr. Lampert had focused on financial engineering, noting that many retailers rely heavily on integration of financial and operational structures. The company also said Mr. Lampert began responding to the e-commerce shift more than a decade ago, well before many retailers did. Just last month, shortly after announcing additional store closings (so far this year, 155 Sears and Kmarts around the country have been shuttered) Sears announced a deal to sell its Kenmore appliances through Amazon.Mr. Lampert said on the company blog this summer that Sears was continuing a strategic transformation that would return it to profitability. \u201cWhile there is still work to do,\u201d Mr. Lampert wrote, \u201cwe are determined to do what is necessary to remain a competitive retailer in a challenging environment.\u201dAt the turn of the 20th century, as Americans established roots across the nation, they turned to Sears. Through its robust mail-order business \u2014 some catalogs were more than 500 pages \u2014 Sears shipped groceries, rifles, corsets, cream separators, davenports, stoves and entire prefab houses to some of the most remote regions of the country.For decades, as Americans shifted the ways they shopped, Sears deftly evolved. In fact, it was often at the forefront of changing demands as it moved from catalogs featuring pages of saddles and bridles, to showrooms full of glistening home appliances, to auto-repair shops outside the mall.As Americans moved from rural communities to larger cities, many no longer needed to shop by thumbing through the catalog; they preferred to visit dazzling department stores. Sears began opening hundreds of stand-alone retail stores, some with soda fountains, dentist\u2019s offices and pet shops alongside tombstones and farm tractors.The set of \u201cThe Donna Reed Show\u201d in the 1960s featured a Kenmore stove, dishwasher and washer and dryer, all must-have appliances in American homes. And as TV culture grew in the \u201960s, Sears ramped up its advertising campaigns and signed licensing agreements with celebrities like the baseball player Ted Williams, the golfer Arnold Palmer and the model Cheryl Tiegs.In the 1980s, as Americans\u2019 fondness for credit grew, Sears introduced its wildly popular Discover card, which was the first to offer cash rewards to customers based on the volume of their purchases. Within four years, 20 million people had the card. Within a decade, credit operations accounted for a big chunk of Sears\u2019s revenues.When malls became the meeting place of American youth, Sears moved with them. Its stores anchored shopping centers all over the country.By the 1990s, however, Sears\u2019s dominance of the retail landscape had ended. It was surpassed by the discount shopping retailers Walmart and Kmart, the so-called big-box stores. By 2001, Walmart\u2019s revenues were about five times that of Sears.The new players were nimble, able to change inventory and prices quickly. Sears\u2019s overhead costs were higher, and catalog prices were usually set months in advance in order to meet printing and mailing schedules.But big-box stores were only one threat. Online shopping would soon emerge as an even more powerful force, one that Sears, with its hundreds of brick-and-mortar stores needing constant face-lifts and upkeep, was also ill prepared to compete with.That\u2019s when the hedge-fund titan came knocking.In late 2004, newspapers were still running articles about the coming $11 billion takeover of Sears by the discount giant Kmart when Arthur Martinez\u2019s phone rang. Mr. Martinez had been the chief executive and president of Sears in the late 1990s.On the line, he said, was Edward Lampert.A financial wizard who started his career on the vaunted risk arbitrage desk at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Lampert had just arranged the megadeal that created the nation\u2019s third-largest retailer. Among the new members of its board were Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert\u2019s former roommate at Yale and the current Treasury secretary.\u201cHe asked me if he had just done the stupidest thing in the world by buying Sears,\u201d Mr. Martinez recalled.Over a 90-minute meeting in Greenwich, Conn., where they both had offices, Mr. Martinez advised Mr. Lampert to focus on high-value businesses like appliance sales, Sears\u2019s crown jewel. He also noted that Sears was a capital-intensive business, requiring steady investments not only in the stores, but also in training and retaining employees.\u201cHe appears to have roundly ignored everything I told him to do,\u201d Mr. Martinez said.Sears disputed Mr. Martinez\u2019s recollections, saying it was Mr. Martinez who requested the meeting, and denied that Mr. Lampert had made the comment about buying Sears. The company also said Mr. Lampert had not ignored Mr. Martinez\u2019s advice.At Sears, Mr. Lampert typically led from afar. As the largest shareholder through his hedge fund and, since 2013, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Lampert has overseen the company\u2019s operations via videoconference from his home in Miami. He sets foot inside Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., roughly once a year for the annual meeting, according to interviews with several former executives.In the early days of the merger, when times were better, Sears used its cash to buy back shares, a move businesses often use to try to drive share prices higher. From 2005 to 2012, the company spent $6 billion buying back its own shares at prices as high as $174 a share.Today, Sears Holdings stock trades at $9.30 a share, a decline of 95 percent from its highs.Besides the share buybacks, one of the earliest moves by Mr. Lampert was to decentralize the managements of Sears and Kmart, effectively creating more than three dozen silos of business lines such as men\u2019s wear, shoes and home furnishings, each with its own management team and board of directors.It is similar to a strategy sometimes used at hedge funds, where different teams compete with one another for scarce company resources. At Sears, though, the design led to infighting between divisions for everything from space in the weekly advertising circulars to floor shelving.One former executive described how the clashes played out in Sears showrooms, whether in the jewelry or the tools departments. Managers would tell their sales staff not to help customers in adjacent sections, even if someone asked for help. Mr. Lampert would praise policies like these, said the executive, who asked not to be named because he still works in retail.The company said the descriptions by former employees presented an \u201cincomplete perspective\u201d and that the company had adopted different organizational models. It noted that it had recently consolidated its management structure to speed up decision making.Mr. Lampert\u2019s grand vision for Sears, many former executives said, was to position it to compete with Amazon. Instead of spending on store upkeep, he plowed investment, new talent and marketing into Sears\u2019s website and a customer loyalty program called Shop Your Way. The program allows customers to earn points, for purchases not only at Sears but at partnering businesses including Burger King, Under Armour and Uber, that can be redeemed for Sears merchandise.Sears, Mr. Lampert argued, had a big edge: Its hundreds of stores nationwide could act as distribution centers. People could order things online and have them delivered locally.The problem, former executives and employees said, was that the bulk of Sears\u2019s revenue still came from its stores. And they were rapidly losing traffic.\u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret has a $1 billion online business selling $25 bras and such because customers are totally comfortable going to victoriassecret.com, because they felt connected to the brand and the store experience,\u201d said Gary Schettino, a former vice president of merchandising at Sears Holdings. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret understood the overlap of the store and the online customer in a way that Sears never did.\u201dKmart and Sears stores around the country became dilapidated, their personnel demoralized. Employees at some Kmarts didn\u2019t receive raises for several years. Some salespeople who worked solely on commission said that they had been slashed to nearly nothing about three years ago.Customers walking into a Sears store in Kokomo, Ind., were greeted by stained carpets, broken mannequins and cracked display tables, recalled Amanda Marquand Householder, an assistant manager there before she left in 2014. The Kokomo store closed this spring.The problems extended to Kmart stores as well. Kristin Hamm, an assistant manager at a branch in Lancaster, Pa., from 2011 to 2014, said managers knew exactly where to put the buckets they kept handy \u2014 all 10 of them \u2014 to catch water from the leaky roof when it rained.Ms. Hamm also said inventory was hit and miss. On Black Friday one year, Kmart heavily promoted a particular television to drive traffic into its store. She said the Lancaster Kmart was given only one to sell.The store did receive plenty of items, however, from the body-conscious clothing line by the hip-hop star Nicki Minaj. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sell well,\u201d Ms. Hamm said. \u201cI mean, our store was located in the middle of one of the largest Mennonite populations in the country.\u201dKmart ended its partnership with Ms. Minaj late last year. The Kmart store in Lancaster, which opened in 1970, closed in March.In a statement, Sears said that the execution of Mr. Lampert\u2019s strategy has had its challenges, but that the company was making progress \u201cin a very difficult retail environment where many retailers, including Victoria\u2019s Secret, have also been challenged.\u201dRegarding pay and commissions, Sears said that rather than increase compensation in some outlets, it chose to keep people employed, and stores open, as long as possible. As for upkeep, Sears noted that at the end of last year it had 1,400 operating stores and that it spent a \u201csignificant amount\u201d on store appearance and \u201cnever wants a store\u2019s appearance to disappoint its customers.\u201dThe company also noted that other retailers have gone under even after investing in store renovation. Regarding inventory control, Sears said that given the scale of its business, there would be \u201csituations where the company doesn\u2019t always get this right.\u201dThe fallout from Sears\u2019s mistakes have hit its work force hard.\u201cSears was the greatest job ever. A1. No doubt,\u201d said Edd Oliver, who, for the past decade worked as a salesman at a Sears in Columbus, Ga. \u201cPeople were raising families and sending children to college off of this company.\u201dA member of the Sears \u201cmillion-dollar club\u201d for three consecutive years in which he sold more than $1 million of appliances, Mr. Oliver said his job started to take a downward turn around 2014. That was when commissions, which had once been as high as 6 percent for some items, were cut to around 1.3 percent, he recalled.Paid solely on commission, Mr. Oliver\u2019s take-home pay, which topped out at around $60,000 in 2014, fell sharply in 2015 and then fell some more in 2016. The store also cut back on local advertising, Mr. Oliver said, hurting foot traffic.In April, Mr. Oliver lost his job when his store closed.\u201cI still today would tell anyone to go to Sears and buy the appliances and get the warranty. It is the best,\u201d Mr. Oliver said. \u201cBut after working there all of those years and then losing my job, it hurts. I\u2019ve taken a big emotional hit from this.\u201dIn recent years, Sears has been kept afloat largely by selling off its most valuable assets. At the same time, Mr. Lampert has taken steps to protect his investment in the company.Since 2012, Sears has been raising cash through a series of spinoffs or sales of entities including Sears Hometown and Outlet, a national retailer that focused on appliances and lawn and garden equipment, as well as Lands\u2019 End and Sears Canada. More recently, the company sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker, for $900 million.In many of the spinoffs, Mr. Lampert, through his hedge funds and other entities, invested significantly. Those stakes appear to be under water.But one move that could yet prove profitable for Mr. Lampert and others was the 2015 sale of more than 266 Sears and Kmart properties for $3 billion to a publicly traded real-estate investment pool called Seritage Growth Properties.The sale drew intense scrutiny on the pricing of the properties as well as a shareholder lawsuit, which argued that there had not been an independent, fair valuation of the properties and that there were myriad conflicts of interest. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage. The lawsuit was settled this year for $40 million.Cutting companies into two pieces \u2014 a real estate side and an operations side \u2014 is a move hedge funds and private-equity investors have been performing for years. This can sometimes strain the operations side as it uses its cash to make rental payments.For Sears Holdings, the Seritage deal meant it now had to pay rent on properties it once owned. Sears Holdings paid an additional $200 million in rent and other expenses to Seritage in 2016.In its statement, the company said rent payments would decline as Sears Holdings reduces the size of its stores, as more customers shop online. This year, it expects rent payments to total $160 million.But as Sears Holdings exits those leases, higher-paying tenants are coming in, which benefits Seritage shareholders, including Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge funds. \u201cIn properties where Sears has given up the lease,\u201d said Wes Golladay, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, \u201cSeritage has moved in restaurants, small grocers, gym chains, a pretty broad-based group of new lessees who are paying more than $18 a square foot, from the $4 that Sears was paying.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Lampert has played the role of Sears Holdings\u2019s primary banker, collecting fees while providing loans to the operations side of the company. As a result, Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund and other entities hold a significant portion of Sears Holdings\u2019s debt, in effect making him one of the company\u2019s biggest lenders. The bulk of that debt is secured by property or inventory.The debt ensures that even if Sears Holdings goes into bankruptcy, Mr. Lampert has a prominent seat at the table \u2014 and a voice in its future course \u2014 since debt-holders come before shareholders in working out a corporate restructuring through the courts.Some observers say it is difficult for them to imagine a scenario in which Sears doesn\u2019t go into bankruptcy. \u201cThere has been a long, steady sale of assets to the point where the cupboard is pretty bare,\u201d said Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, which provides independent research to institutional investors. \u201cIt has been a long, slow bleed to keep the company afloat.\u201d\u201cIt is a shame,\u201d Mr. Perkins added, \u201cbecause this was such an iconic retailer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Efforts to increase the representation of women in the industry were discriminatory in a way, he said, that was \u201cunfair, divisive and bad for business.\u201dThe memo was rebuked by other employees, but it has become a rallying cry for others outside the company, particularly conservatives and the alt-right, who are concerned about a stifling of debate in Silicon Valley.Eric Weinstein, a managing director at Thiel Capital, an investment firm run by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and supporter of President Trump, said Google was sending the wrong message to women.It also has threatened Fox\u2019s $15 billion bid to acquire full ownership of Sky, a European satellite giant.At a mediation proceeding last month, the lawyer Douglas H.
