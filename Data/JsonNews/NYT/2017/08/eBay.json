{"Headline": "Rachel Zabar, Scion of Saul, Eschews Lox for Vintage Couture", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScene StealersRachel Zabar, looking summery in a star-print Valentino day dress, was on a love seat in her living room here. I had already spilled Diet Coke on her Italian coffee table and asked a lot of clueless questions about her flourishing career as a vintage couture dealer. Now, just to be extra-irritating, I was poking through her childhood memories, with a particular focus on Zabar\u2019s, her family\u2019s famed food emporium in New York.\u201cJewish delis, fashion, pouring soda \u2014 you don\u2019t know very much about any of these things, do you?\u201d Ms. Zabar said. She laughed, kicked off her navy Newbark loafers and took up a cross-legged position on the sofa. \u201cNo problem! I\u2019ll teach you everything. Let\u2019s start at the beginning.\u201dYes, let us. Ms. Zabar, 45, worked at Zabar\u2019s as a teenager (in the bread department before the caviar counter) and then spent nearly two decades, to Papa Zabar\u2019s occasional irritation, hopping from one potential career to another \u2014 photography, documentary films, screenplays. By 2010 she was selling furniture at a flea market.Maybe it was finally time to make a life at Zabar\u2019s, as her older sister and younger brother had successfully done?In the early 2000s, vintage went wide, fueled by nostalgia for pre-Y2K times and the popularity of eBay. Julia Roberts wore vintage black-and-white Valentino to pick up her Oscar in 2001. Rachel Zoe, often draped in vintage Chlo\u00e9 and Yves Saint Laurent, became a reality TV star and then a designer drawing unapologetically from the past. What Goes Around Comes Around, a New York boutique, became a chainlet, expanding to Miami Beach and Los Angeles.By the time Ms. Zabar got serious about her vintage business about five years ago, there was very little room for a newcomer. The Los Angeles retail landscape was clogged with competitors (Resurrection, the Way We Wore) and already showing signs of an internet-driven downturn.Some areas of the market (vintage Pucci garments) had been exhausted. Vintage was becoming less of a force on red carpets, in part because fashion houses became more willing to make deals with actresses, even C-listers.But Ms. Zabar persisted.Racks of clothes take up almost all of the floor space. There are eight in the living room, holding some 1,500 pieces that range in price from $125 to $15,000. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just have rich clients,\u201d Ms. Zabar said. \u201cTo me that would be a bit of a bummer.\u201d\u201cThere is nothing in here that hasn\u2019t been meticulously considered,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see something, throw it on a hanger and up the price.\u201dShe shooed away one of her two cats, Bengals named Leo-Wilbur and Taz, and plucked an Alexander McQueen strapless number from a rack. \u201cFeel that satin interior,\u201d she said, running the back of her hand across its cream-colored bodice. She pointed to layers of gauzelike tulle and copper-hued sequins forming tree branches and birds. \u201cWhat you are looking at is not a dress but an idea,\u201d she said. \u201cIt leaves me breathless.\u201dFull disclosure: I\u2019m a fashion philistine who tends to find people who coo over couture to be utterly insufferable. In fact, I had feared Ms. Zabar would be just that before I met her.Saul Zabar, 89, remembers it slightly differently.\u201cWe let her make her own choices,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cThe store was never part of her. We knew that from a very early age.\u201d He added, \u201cShe was artistic. Even as a child, she had a natural talent for color and style.\u201dWhatever the situation, Ms. Zabar resented working at the store as a teenager. \u201cIt was rebelliousness and brattiness,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I was also slightly embarrassed by his immigrant mentality of \u2018the kids are going to help out.\u2019 I wanted to be free to pursue my own interests.\u201dOne of her hobbies was fashion \u2014 in particular, vintage fashion.\u201cWe had a family friend who was a designer, and she used to take me to the flea markets when I was 9 or 10,\u201d Ms. Zabar said. \u201cI started wearing the treasures I found. I\u2019m talking stripes and flowers and rows of pearls and a weird hat. If my mom told me I couldn\u2019t wear anything to school, there would be tantrums and screaming.\u201d (She attended Dalton.)The family friend was Donna Karan, who was then leading the design team at Anne Klein. Ms. Karan and the Zabars had neighboring vacation homes on Fire Island in the early 1980s.\u201cI\u2019ve known her through every career move, and there have been a lot of moves \u2014 I got dizzy at one point,\u201d said Ilene Chazanof, a New York decorative arts dealer and family friend. \u201cI love her, and she has developed a sophisticated eye. But getting there \u2014 oof.\u201dMs. Zabar said she just hadn\u2019t found her niche.\u201cFor some reason, I was avoiding fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe because it was so obvious? Instead, I just let my curiosity guide me.\u201dShe decided to study screenwriting, for instance, after becoming interested in television pilots. \u201cBut very quickly the writer\u2019s life didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that solitude and alone time in your head wasn\u2019t for me. I got up one day and saw my computer across the room, and thought to myself, \u2018If I take one more step toward that thing, my soul will die.\u2019\u201d (Tell me about it, sister.)But she loved California.It was at the California flea markets, where she first started selling vintage clothes and accessories (after switching from furniture), that Ms. Zabar said her future finally came into focus.\u201cI don\u2019t do them anymore, but selling at the flea markets taught me so much,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was where I learned how to merchandise.\u201dWait. Hadn\u2019t she picked up any of that from Zabar\u2019s?After pausing for a minute, she added, \u201cI guess in that way I have come full circle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Fifty Inventions\u2019 Falls Short of Its Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBook EntryTim Harford\u2019s Undercover Economist persona has been dissecting the economics of everyday life for over a decade.His efforts, initially through a column that continues at The Financial Times, provide a trans-Atlantic parallel to those of the wildly successful Freakonomics franchise established by the University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt and the journalist Stephen J. Dubner.Both \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d became best-selling books in 2005 and both spawned successful sequels and multimedia spinoffs. Mr. Leavitt and Mr. Dubner have an NPR podcast and even a \u201cFreakonomics\u201d movie, and Mr. Harford\u2019s podcast and video appearances have been sponsored by the BBC.In this era of increasing global acrimony, I am happy to report that far from producing another intercontinental rivalry, the Freakonomists and Undercover Economist have developed something of a mutual admiration society. They contribute to each others\u2019 blogs and favorably review each other\u2019s books.The effective interpretation of complex economic research for a general reader is an important journalistic function. The decision-makers who apply research results in ways that have significant social impact are far more likely to be general readers than academics. Mr. Harford\u2019s achievements over this period are all the more impressive by virtue of the fact that he is both the economist and the journalist producing the translation of the technical ideas.Mr. Harford\u2019s latest book (his sixth follow-up to \u201cThe Undercover Economist\u201d) is a different kind of translation: a reimagining of his popular 2016 podcast from the BBC World Service, \u201cFifty Things That Made the Modern Economy,\u201d as a book.The subtle name change from podcast to book \u2014 \u201cFifty Inventions That Shaped the Modern Economy (Riverhead: 2017)\u201d \u2014 reflects an emphasis on humility. Mr. Harford repeatedly emphasizes that he is not trying \u201cto identify the 50 most economically significant inventions.\u201dUnfortunately, Mr. Harford\u2019s clarity about what the book isn\u2019t is not matched by comparable clarity about what the book is.This is not to say that there isn\u2019t plenty to savor in \u201cFifty Inventions.\u201d After all, the podcast was popular for a reason, and much of the book is a verbatim transcription of that series. The issue is that the insistence on making the book be about something more than the individual tales often becomes a distraction instead of a benefit. Organizing the podcasts by theme is sometimes forced, the cross-referencing of the stories uneven and the promised payoff \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to draw these lessons together and ask how we should think about innovation today\u201d\u2014 never really comes.Take the first invention grouped under the first theme: the gramophone as an example of the phenomenon that \u201cnew technologies almost always create winners and losers.\u201d Mr. Harford argues that the availability of recorded music \u201cled the way toward a winner-take-all dynamic in the performing industry.\u201dHe provides an engrossing account of the English soprano Elizabeth Billington, who prompted a mad bidding war among opera houses and was the highest paid solo singer of the early 19th century. Yet those financial spoils represented, in today\u2019s dollars, less than 1 percent of what Elton John pulls in. The availability of recorded music, Mr. Harford argues, has not only enriched the handful of Elton Johns but has been costly to those who fail to achieve superstardom because \u201cwhen you can listen at home to the best performers in the world, why pay to hear a merely competent tribute act in person?\u201dCiting an influential 1981 article on superstar economics, Mr. Harford then asserts that across many industries in which technology has radically expanded the market, the result has been that \u201cthe only-slightly-less-good went from making a comfortable living to struggling to pay their bills.\u201d He particularly argues that satellite television \u201chas been to athletes what the gramophone was to musicians.\u201dThe trouble with this narrative, as any American sports fan knows, is that it is false. Even the weakest players in any of the major sports leagues should have few challenges in obtaining life\u2019s necessities. For example, during the 50 years since Marvin Miller negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement for the Major League Baseball Players Association \u2014 precisely the period over which Mr. Harford predicts that slightly-less-good athletes should have been financially devastated \u2014 the minimum salary has grown 20,000 percent. The average player currently makes over $4 million and the minimum is over half a million.Part of the challenge faced by Mr. Harford is simply one of space. The economics is right, but the complexities of the industry structures often require a more nuanced story line. Fifty compelling stand-alone yarns in under 300 pages would challenge the most accomplished economic journalist. Adding a discussion of seven overarching themes (not to mention the need to compare and contrast and deliver on the anticipated concluding lessons) and the burden of integrating these into the individual narratives is more than can be reasonably achieved.The less than five pages devoted to Google search highlight both the structural challenge and the need for nuance. In pressing the theme of winners and losers Mr. Harford emphasizes that, with the rise of Google, newspaper advertising \u201chas fallen off a cliff.\u201d This is an unsatisfying on two fronts. First, the more fundamental challenge to newspaper advertising predated Google, with the introduction of Monster, Craigslist, eBay and the slew of other online marketplace businesses that eviscerated the core newspaper classified profit engine. Second, the bigger impact of the Google advertising monolith is the extent to which it has swallowed a disproportionate slice of the growth in digital advertising generally, relegating many once promising and highly popular ad-based online businesses to the dustbin of history.More troubling is the perfunctory history of AdWords, the core monetization engine that underpins Google\u2019s financial success. Mr. Harford correctly points out that the brilliant search algorithm in itself, although wildly useful, was not financially viable on its own. Mr. Harford, however, gives no context for how the pay-per-click advertising lifeline represented by the auction-based AdWords product came to be.Some of the most interesting parts of \u201cFifty Inventions\u201d are Mr. Harford\u2019s discussion of the complex role of government generally and intellectual property rights particularly in both fostering and hindering innovation. Yet he fails to mention that Google paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit by the originator of pay-for-click technology. An interested reader might expect, at a minimum, some perspective on whether this key episode in digital history reflected an example of intellectual property overreach or the value of government protection of ideas.Early on in \u201cFifty Inventions,\u201d Mr. Harford notes he has studiously avoided producing \u201ca book-length listicle.\u201d But given Mr. Harford\u2019s prodigious skills as an economic storyteller, there are few as well positioned to produce precisely that. There are, after all, reasons that listicles are so popular \u2014 indeed those reasons would make a great \u201cUndercover Economist\u201d column.If Mr. Harford had simply embraced our love of listicles rather than set himself an inherently unachievable task, the resulting book would have yielded more pleasures and fewer frustrations.Jonathan A.

{"Headline": "How I Rebuilt My Childhood Library, Book by Book", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEssayI was a year into my marriage, three years into my thirties, and thinking a lot about children \u2014 whether we would have them, how they would alter our life \u2014 when my parents called to say they were selling the house I grew up in. My sister and I were summoned home to clear out our belongings.Having spent my entire adulthood living in New York apartments, I\u2019ve learned not to be sentimental about objects. So I didn\u2019t dig deep. Didn\u2019t search through the cluttered attic or the basement. I only looked as far as my bedroom closet. The things I kept filled one small box. I knew there was no in-between. If I didn\u2019t return to Brooklyn with just that one small box, my husband Kevin and I would currently be sitting in a two-bedroom apartment full of Madame Alexander dolls and My Little Ponies, with a New Kids on the Block poster on the living room wall.My parents were downsizing. My father said the only things he was sad to part with were his books. Kevin and I tried to put him at ease. We explained that book lovers who live in small spaces must be ruthless. Every few months, when we notice our shelves overflowing, we make a trip to Goodwill.Of course, there are some books we will never discard. When I went to college, I brought along the ones I had loved as a teenager. They stayed with me when I moved to New York, even though I changed addresses three times before I had enough space to unpack them.The books I loved as a child weren\u2019t important to me when I moved away at 18. They got left behind at my parents\u2019 house. When they moved, those books were donated with the rest. I didn\u2019t miss anything else. But the ache for the books of my childhood came on fast once they were gone, a sudden flood of regret. At the time, I made no connection between the sensation and my preoccupation with potential parenthood. I just felt as if I\u2019d made a horrible mistake.Then a gift from my father arrived in the mail. He had rescued a few of my favorites. Robert McCloskey\u2019s \u201cBlueberries for Sal.\u201d \u201cThe Polar Express.\u201d \u201cKatie and the Smallest Bear,\u201d inscribed with a note in my mother\u2019s handwriting, marking its purchase in Camden, Me. on May 4, 1986, three months before my fifth birthday. I was overjoyed to be reunited with those books. But they made me long for the ones I hadn\u2019t saved.Slowly, without giving much thought as to why, I started rebuilding my collection. I bought \u201cThe Blue-Nosed Witch\u201d by Margaret Embry online for a penny. On vacation, I found a dusty old Trixie Belden mystery at a junk store. I ordered a copy of \u201cIvy Cottage,\u201d apparently quite rare now, and expensive. (When the internet bookseller saw I was interested, he sent a note quadrupling the price.) One night, I purchased \u201cTiggy and the Giant Wave\u201d for $19 and imagined the people who sell such things convening somewhere, talking shop: \u201cHave you noticed the sudden interest in picture books from the 1980s that no one has thought about in ages?\u201dEach book had to be the same version I had owned. Most were around 30 years old. When you\u2019re dealing with used books that once belonged to children, even those listed as \u201clike new\u201d are worn. A stray crayon mark or a torn page is not a sign of neglect, but of love.With the arrival of every volume, I\u2019d get a thrill, remembering. Not just the book itself, but what it meant to read it under the covers with a flashlight, or on the back porch of our house, which wasn\u2019t ours anymore. When I received the \u201cStickybear\u201d books by Richard Hefter and saw the familiar endpapers covered in strawberries, I recalled how my dad would read the strawberries as part of the text. Example: \u201cThe end. Strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry strawberry.\u201dI realized then that the collection I was reassembling wasn\u2019t for me. Would I ever have children? Did I want to? The colorful books piling up everywhere on an otherwise tidy bookcase were the answer.Not long after, a friend\u2019s daughter, Ella, invited me to speak to her second grade class about my work as a writer. Questions included: Did you write \u201cThe Magic School Bus\u201d? How much money do you make? Are you famous? When Ella showed the cover of my book \u201cMaine,\u201d a picture of a barelegged woman reclining on a beach, two boys shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate!\u201d\u201cDid you draw that cover?\u201d they asked.And: \u201cDid you make the binding? Did you make the pages?\u201dWhen I explained that no, I only wrote the words inside, they seemed a bit embarrassed for me. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dI understood completely. Childhood is where a love of reading is forged through the tactile. The stories themselves matter, of course. Sometimes I think about Beverly Cleary\u2019s \u201cRamona,\u201d with her tubes of toothpaste, her bites of apple. Nothing I\u2019ve read since, no single image, stands out as these do. But in adulthood, it\u2019s always the text I admire. In childhood, the book as object matters most.I found out I was having a baby last October. For months, my home office was in transition to becoming a nursery, a chaotic mishmash of paperwork and drafts of my latest novel, mixed in with a crib, a mattress still in its box, bags of hand-me-downs. The only pristine thing was the long row of children\u2019s books on the mantle, held together by a pair of elephant bookends.When you are pregnant, it\u2019s hard to believe sometimes that there\u2019s a life inside of you. The books were the proof. I could so clearly see myself sitting on the edge of a single bed in the lamplight someday, reading \u201cMr. Popper\u2019s Penguins\u201d to my son, even if I couldn\u2019t yet imagine his face.J.

The selection capped a contentious search process as the ride-hailing company seeks to move past a turbulent period.Mr. Khosrowshahi emerged as the leading candidate from a field of three finalists over a weekend of Uber board meetings, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were confidential.The board of directors and executives inside of Uber had instead been leaning toward Meg Whitman, the chief of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the people said. But matters changed quickly over the course of Sunday afternoon, as directors and Ms. Whitman could not agree on terms in which she would take over as chief executive, the people said. Ultimately, the board decided on the third candidate, Mr. Khosrowshahi.Uber, the company\u2019s board and Expedia did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Khosrowshahi, who has been president and chief executive of Expedia since 2005, has experience in a digital industry that, like Uber, affects offline life and the logistics and movement of people. Based in Bellevue, Wash., Expedia has travel brands including Hotels.com and Orbitz. The publicly traded company is smaller than the privately held Uber, with a market capitalization of around $23 billion compared with Uber\u2019s private valuation of nearly $70 billion.Mr. Khosrowshahi also joined the board of The New York Times Company in 2015, and previously worked at IAC/InterActive Corp.At Expedia, Mr. Khosrowshahi has been an outspoken chief executive. His family emigrated to the United States from Iran because of the revolution in that country in the late 1970s, so Mr. Khosrowshahi had a personal perspective on the executive order that President Trump signed restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries this year.Expedia, along with Amazon, became one of two technology companies to contribute early declarations to a lawsuit filed by Washington State\u2019s attorney general objecting to the travel ban. Mr. Khosrowshahi described his early experience as an immigrant to the United States in an email to employees at that time.\u201cWe sure didn\u2019t feel like refugees, but in hindsight I guess we were \u2014 my father and mother left everything behind to come here \u2014 to be safe and give their boys a chance to re-build a life,\u201d he wrote.He expressed other pointed concerns in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s coming to office. In February, he raised eyebrows when he concluded a conference call with Wall Street analysts by saying, \u201cHopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Kalanick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Benchmark declined to comment.But in reality, Ms. Whitman was in touch with members of Uber\u2019s board in recent days about the chief executive role, said the people with knowledge of the process. Mr. Immelt, who recently left his job as chief executive of G.E., also had emerged as a candidate in recent weeks. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s candidacy was kept under wraps.As recently as late last week, Uber\u2019s board was deadlocked on candidates, the people said. On Friday, the board met in San Francisco, with Mr. Immelt and Mr. Khosrowshahi talking to the directors. Ms. Whitman spoke with directors on Friday and Saturday.G.E. declined to comment on behalf of Mr. Immelt. A spokesman for Ms. Whitman also declined to comment.At that point, the board was leaning toward Ms. Whitman, said two people with knowledge of the process. Ms. Whitman, who had previously also led eBay, had a wealth of management experience. As a female leader, she also offered the opportunity for Uber to improve its workplace image.Ms. Whitman asked Uber\u2019s board about some issues, including what role Mr. Kalanick would play in Uber\u2019s future, the people said. Another point of discussion was the current legal battle over board control between Mr. Kalanick and Benchmark.By late Sunday, Ms. Whitman and the board could not agree on some of those matters, the people said. Soon, Uber\u2019s board had settled on Mr. Khosrowshahi.Nick Wingfield and Steve Lohr contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Weary and angular with lank blond hair, elegantly sheathed in black, yet still casually paint-flecked: She was exactly how I\u2019d imagined a Real Artist.My boyfriend pointed out the fresh graffiti scratched in the beige paint, chuckling. \u2018\u2018They got to it already.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Mmm, yes,\u2019\u2019 said the Real Artist, slow and sardonic. \u2018\u2018Those who can\u2019t find canvas find walls.\u2019\u2019 She stretched out this last word in a way that struck me as both ludicrous and terribly sophisticated.WE HAVE BEEN TALKING about walls a lot lately. The chants at our president\u2019s rallies (\u2018\u2018Build a wall!\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Lock her up!\u2019\u2019); the discussions about sanctuary cities; the argument over what counts as a wall and what is merely a fence \u2014 all this political rhetoric forces us to consider what walls keep in, what they keep out, whom they shelter, where they are permeable. And so we must consider, too, what art is hung \u2014 or scratched \u2014 upon them. These days, I think about walls in relation to a number of Latin American and Latino artists who are engaging with our current moment, and in doing so, are challenging what an art space is and who belongs in it.But this is slowly changing \u2014 MoMA\u2019s holdings of Latin American art increased substantially after a donation last fall of works from the collection of philanthropist Patricia Phelps de Cisneros, who has collected art from the region for 40 years. Then there\u2019s the latest installment of Pacific Standard Time, an occasional survey of art from Southern California spearheaded by the Getty Foundation. This year\u2019s exhibition, which begins in September and is on view through January of next year, will focus entirely on Latino and Latin American art, in over 70 exhibitions and programs across Los Angeles and elsewhere in the state, offering something akin to an official acknowledgement of the Latin American diaspora\u2019s artistic influence and legacy in the United States and the vibrancy and range of contemporary Latino art.What characterizes it is a sense of shared history, of shared contradictions. To be Latino is, in many cases, to have descended from both the colonizer and the colonized, to be between languages or to mourn the loss of a language. People who identify as Latino might be recent arrivals to the United States, or might have a centuries-long history with land now known as the United States. Latino culture isn\u2019t monolithic. There isn\u2019t a single artistic or political philosophy. And there certainly isn\u2019t one story, one Latino identity. Primarily, however, Latino art is American art, and much like feminist art in the 1970s, or queer art in the 1980s, Latino art in 2017 says as much about the country at large as it does about any single group; the work is both predictive of and a response to the current political moment.Esparza made the adobe blocks using methods he learned from his father, who built a home from adobe in Mexico before immigrating to the United States, and who helped the artist install the piece in the museum. The L.A. River has been a frequent site of inspiration for Esparza. In 2014, he performed with Sebastian Hernandez, an artist and Aztec dancer, under a viaduct in the working-class, largely Mexican-American neighborhood of Boyle Heights, which abuts the river.Also creating sanctuaries is Ra\u00fal de Nieves, who was born in Mexico and now lives in New York. In contrast to Esparza's contained space, de Nieves\u2019s 2016 installation \u2018\u2018beginning & the end neither & the otherwise betwixt & between the end is the beginning & the end,\u2019\u2019 is all openness, light and extravagant color. Marvelous glittery stalagmites and figures elaborately costumed in pontifical vestments and Marie Antoinette-like wigs are arranged before a massive allegorical faux stained glass window made of plastic and tape that depicts love and sex and violence and death.BORDERS OF ALL KINDS have become recurring touchstones among Latino artists. Postcommodity, an art collective based in New Mexico and Arizona and made up of Raven Chacon, Crist\u00f3bal Mart\u00ednez and Kade Twist, indigenous artists with roots in Mexico and the Cherokee Nation, looks directly at the physical boundary of the U.S.-Mexico border. Their video \u2018\u2018A Very Long Line,\u2019\u2019 2016, documents the fence between Agua Prieta, Sonora and Douglas, Ariz. The work was filmed from a car, and we\u2019re moving too fast to take in the whole landscape \u2014 mesquite and green-trunked palo verde, yucca and prickly pear, bleed into residential neighborhoods and telephone wires. As the camera sweeps around, we hear wind and passing vehicles, clanking as though we\u2019re crossing over a cattle guard. Because the projection gives the sense of space beyond the gallery wall \u2014 and beyond the fence that\u2019s being filmed \u2014 there\u2019s simultaneously a sense of entrapment and expansiveness, of possibility and limitation.The title evokes the very long line of the U.S.-Mexico border, of course, and the linear journey of driving that border, but also the long and tangled lineages of the people who populate the borderlands. Without ever seeing people, without ever hearing human voices, we\u2019re reminded that the fence splits the tightly bound communities of Agua Prieta and Douglas. We\u2019re forced to consider the arbitrary nature of borders, the ways that communities and individuals and ecosystems can become casualties of political forces.The piece was destabilizing, but there was something remarkable about the flash of recognition I felt while viewing this work. As I watched, I was flooded with associations from my own trips to the Sonora-Arizona border. The smell of creosote and soil. Big white border-control trucks, speeding from behind, passing smoothly in a blast of hot, dusty air. Hiking on a trail scattered with traces left by people making their long journeys: cast-off clothing and crushed plastic water bottles, a stuffed dog, everything that isn\u2019t essential and can\u2019t be carried.The militarization of the border and America\u2019s shifting immigration policies are increasingly urgent themes as well. Yoshua Ok\u00f3n, born in Mexico, where he currently lives, and educated at U.C.L.A., has made a quasi-fictional documentary video about Oracle, Ariz., the location of the largest-ever protest against child immigrants from Central America. The video includes a re-enactment of the protest, staged by members of an organization called Arizona Border Protectors, alongside footage of nine immigrant children performing the U.S. Marines\u2019 Hymn. (The video will screen as part of Pacific Standard Time.)But though the experiences of Latinos are diverse, the narratives that dominate popular culture tend to be lazy: harrowing journeys across the border; undocumented criminals robbing and raping; children torn from their parents\u2019 arms by ICE agents; drugs flooding northward. And then there are the stock characters: the wicked coyote, the ruthless trafficker, the bright-eyed abuelita with her folk wisdom and unshakable Catholicism, the hardworking and/or exploited housekeeper or fieldworker who is either taking jobs from Real Americans or doing jobs Real Americans won\u2019t do.Part of the power of Nisenbaum\u2019s paintings is that they make visible people and moments that are usually overlooked. In \u2018\u2018La Talaverita, Sunday Morning NY Times,\u2019\u2019 2016, a father and daughter read a newspaper against a backdrop of exuberantly painted Talavera tiles. They are undocumented, but it is their relationship that animates the picture, not their immigration or employment status. There\u2019s a lovely ease in their postures, an intimacy in the way the father rests his hand on his daughter\u2019s leg. The daughter stretches along the length of the couch, her hair spilling, the newspapers drifting to the floor. In the slightly skewed perspective, there\u2019s a sense of instability, of precariousness; perhaps the couch is too narrow and the daughter will fall off. Yet in this moment are beauty and pause.The piece is a reminder that if there is a commonality in Latino art, it\u2019s the emphasis on community, on connections as both a source of solace and as a necessary means of change. Through witnessing one another\u2019s stories, in all their nuance and complication, history can be rewritten, and walls, no matter how forbidding, might even be scaled.Advertisement"}

Not much. Though upmarket streetwear \u2014 hoodies, sneakers, skateboards, ball caps, sanitation-worker boiler suits \u2014 is the ostensible lure for these hunter-gatherers, the wares are just part of the draw.\u201cThe line is the new community,\u201d Mr. Carvalho said. \u201cWhen 200 to 300 kids are lining up outside of a store, it\u2019s because they want to be part of something.\u201dOn this day, they had offered themselves as field guides to what promised be a highly engaging hybrid of tribal rite and street theater, a latter-day alterative to the once-ubiquitous bands of adolescents raucously swarming malls.\u201cCome get your number \u2014 hurry before they pass you over,\u201d a gangly guy in a tank top yelled to a companion. \u201cYou only have a certain amount of grace period.\u201dHis shouts and those of companions volleying from one end of the street to the other pricked up the ears of hypervigilant store personnel ready to pounce on infractions.Glancing at them furtively, one petitioner stammered: \u201cI can\u2019t talk to you. I\u2019m going to get thrown off the line.\u201dBut overbearing security and a building sense of pressure did not seem to ruffle the mood. For many of these strivers, the chance to swap insider intelligence and bask in camaraderie was, after all, the point.Yet the line persists, a global trend stretching these days from Tokyo to Tucson and Berlin to the Bronx. Its members, millennials and their younger Gen Z kin, share a mind-set, making common cause of a yen for authenticity. What\u2019s more, they defy facile stereotyping.\u201cOne time I saw a guy with a three-piece suit,\u201d Mr. DeLeon said. \u201cHe was wearing immaculate Moscot tortoiseshell glasses. He told me, \u2018I\u2019m a lawyer meeting with a client, but I want first to get a sweatshirt here.\u2019\u201dA mere half-dozen years ago, a shared lust for skateboard and locker-room gear sustained the community. \u201cA limited-edition sneaker was so rare that when two people were wearing it, you knew something connected them \u2014 certain music, certain art, certain fashion,\u201d said David Fischer, Highsnobiety\u2019s Berlin-based chief executive. But time, as he noted, wrought changes.Today, the queue is partly a resellers\u2019 market: energetic young entrepreneurs snapping up wares in multiples, then flipping them at soaring markups on eBay or selling them for pocket change to finance their own buys. On this day, the spirit of commerce was lively on Lafayette Street, with vans lining the far side of the block, the trunks popped to display boxes and bags packed with limited-edition inventory from Nike, Supreme and other vendors \u2014 a lure for passers-by.\u201cReselling, it\u2019s an easy way to make money,\u201d said a tank-top-garbed youth who goes by the street name Young Sin. \u201cI do this every Thursday. You can\u2019t get locked up for it.\u201d Young Sin, Y S to his friends, planned to pick up a cap for himself and offer additional, marked-up items to all comers.\u201cI like Supreme,\u201d he said, shrugging, \u201cbut they could be Old Navy as long as it helps pay my rent.\u201dProfessed connoisseurs, plenty of these queuers like the kick of the chase. \u201cYou can\u2019t find this stuff at Bloomingdale\u2019s or Macy\u2019s,\u201d said a 40-something, suede-clad man at Supreme, too press-shy to provide his name. \u201cI like the exclusiveness of people always seeing me and saying, \u2018Wow.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like being a movie star.\u201d\u201cWe become a little band of survivors, with a grim gallows humor to match,\u201d Mr. Andrews wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201dWill Gamble, a student at the University of Exeter, is a regular at Supreme\u2019s weekly drops in London. \u201cThe line,\u201d he said, \u201cis quite a sociable thing.

{"Headline": "Aging Parents With Lots of Stuff, and Children Who Don\u2019t Want It", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringMothers and daughters talk about all kinds of things. But there is one conversation Susan Beauregard, 49, of Hampton, Conn., is reluctant to have with her 89-year-old mother, Anita Shear: What to do \u2014 eventually \u2014 with Mrs. Shear\u2019s beloved set of Lenox china?Ms. Beauregard said she never uses her own fine china, which she received as a wedding gift long ago. \u201cI feel obligated to take my mom\u2019s Lenox, but it\u2019s just going to sit in the cupboard next to my stuff,\u201d she said.The only heirlooms she wants from her mother, who lives about an hour away, in the home where Ms. Beauregard was raised, are a few pictures and her mother\u2019s wedding band and engagement ring, which she plans to pass along to her son.So, in a quandary familiar to many adults who must soon dispose of the beloved stuff their parents would love them to inherit, Ms. Beauregard has to break it to her mother that she does not intend to keep the Hitchcock dining room set or the buffet full of matching Lenox dinnerware, saucers and gravy boats.\u201cWe went from a 3,000-square-foot colonial with three floors to a single-story, 1,400-square-foot living space,\u201d said Tena Bluhm, 76, formerly of Fairfax, Va. She and her 77-year-old husband, Ray Bluhm, moved this month to a retirement community in Lake Ridge, Va.Before the move, their two adult children took a handful of items, including a new bed and a dining table and chairs. But Mrs. Bluhm could not interest them in \u201cthe china and the silver and the crystal,\u201d her own generation\u2019s hallmarks of a properly furnished, middle-class home.The competitive accumulation of material goods, a cornerstone of the American dream, dates to the post-World War II economy, when returning veterans fled the cities to establish homes and status in the suburbs. Couples married when they were young, and wedding gifts were meant to be used \u2014 and treasured \u2014 for life.But for a variety of social, cultural, and economic reasons, this is no longer the case. Today\u2019s young adults tend to acquire household goods that they consider temporary or disposable, from online retailers or stores like Ikea and Target, instead of inheriting them from parents or grandparents.\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re seeing a kink in the chain of passing down mementos from one generation to another,\u201d Ms. Buysse said in a telephone interview from the group\u2019s headquarters in Hinsdale, Ill.Accordingly, the senior move management industry has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, Ms. Buysse said. These move managers usually charge an hourly rate, typically $50 to $125. They spend time with clients, helping them sort through years of accumulated possessions and make decisions about what to dispose, what to donate to charities and what to try to fit into their new living spaces.Final costs of the service, which may also involve an estate sale, can be $2,500 to $5,000 or more, depending on the size of the home and the density of its contents.\u201cWe found that seniors have more needs than just the sale of their estates,\u201d said Tracy Niro, a managing partner of Wise Moves, a move management company in Gaithersburg, Md.Once the children have picked over what they want, and the items slated for the next home have been boxed up, the question is, what becomes of the rest?\u201cSome goes to auction, some goes to eBay, and some goes to our retail shop,\u201d said Chris Fultz, an owner of Nova Liquidations, an estate liquidation company in Luray, Va., that works closely with companies like Wise Moves.Ms. Niro said her company also works with nonprofits, like Habitat for Humanity, to find new homes for discarded items. Yet even these operations are feeling overwhelmed by the growing inventory of household goods delivered at their doorsteps.\u201cWe are definitely getting overrun with furniture, and about 20 percent more donations of everything than in previous years,\u201d said Michael Frohm, chief operating officer of Goodwill of Greater Washington, in a telephone interview.Changing aesthetic tastes are also responsible for the overflow.\u201cThe whole \u201990s were the English country look, collections, chintz,\u201d said Jennifer Lacker, an antiques appraiser in Mystic, Conn., who cited the influence of the interior designer Mario Buatta (known as the \u201cPrince of Chintz\u201d). The look, she added, was decidedly \u201crich and lavish.\u201dMillennials are also less inclined to want their parents\u2019 household goods simply because they have no place to put them.As his parents begin to contemplate moving from their two-story colonial home in Annandale, N.J., to a smaller living space, Travis Miscia, a 30-year-old lawyer, would like to lay claim to a good number of his family\u2019s belongings. But he and his wife live in a two-bedroom apartment in Jersey City that is too small to hold them.\u201cI am very interested in family history, and I would like a lot of my parents\u2019 things on some level,\u201d Mr. Miscia said, \u201cbut I have had to limit myself to taking what I would call primary-source documents, like books and some pictures.\u201dYet often this strategy only postpones the inevitable.\u201cSome children take the objects just to keep Mom and Dad quiet,\u201d said Roger Schrenk, Mr. Fultz\u2019s business partner at Nova Liquidations. \u201cThey\u2019ll take them and store them until Mom\u2019s dead, and then they can\u2019t wait to get rid of them.\u201dWith this in mind, Mrs. Bluhm, whose adult children only wanted the new bed and dining set, recommends a philosophical approach to the process of letting go of possessions that children may not cherish but others may.\u201cBy donating them to charity, I knew they weren\u2019t going to go into a Dumpster and that someone who really wanted them would purchase them,\u201d she said. Though the items are no longer hers, she said, many of her familiar household objects are not altogether gone.\u201cWhat I had left were the memories attached to them, in my heart and in my head,\u201d Mrs. Bluhm said.An article last Sunday about heirs who do not want all of their parents\u2019 belongings misstated the job held by Jennifer Lacker. She is an antiques appraiser, not an antiques dealer.Advertisement"}

Benchmark lawyers, who had argued for trying the case in open court, said the company was willing to arbitrate parts of its complaint.Judge Glasscock said he was concerned that stockholders excluded from the arbitration process might still be able to seek legal recourse and said he would revisit the issue if any came forward.In its suit, Benchmark has accused Mr. Kalanick of fraudulently obtaining control over board seats in 2016 by withholding information about internal company operations.The judge said there was \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that Uber\u2019s voting agreement had been drawn up with the intention that an arbitrator weigh whether disputes should continue in arbitration, rather than taking controversies straight to court.\u201cMr. Kalanick is pleased that the court has ruled in his favor today and remains confident that he will prevail in the arbitration process,\u201d a spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said. \u201cBenchmark\u2019s false allegations are wholly without merit and have unnecessarily harmed Uber and its shareholders.\u201dA Benchmark spokeswoman said: \u201cWe look forward to presenting the facts as the case proceeds. This case is fundamentally a question of integrity and values, and the facts will fully support Benchmark\u2019s position.\u201dThe battle over Uber \u2014 the world\u2019s most valuable privately held company, at $68.5 billion \u2014 is being closely watched in Silicon Valley and beyond. In a cozy courtroom in this small city in southern Delaware, lawyers for both sides overflowed into the gallery. Shervin Pishevar and Stephen Russell, early investors in Uber, were on hand as well.Mr. Kalanick was not in the courtroom on Wednesday. Instead, he was at Uber\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, introducing Mr. Khosrowshahi to a staff meeting.Mr. Khosrowshahi, who plans to move into his new job on Tuesday, told the group that Uber should go public in the next 18 to 36 months. He also alluded to Uber\u2019s recent scandals, saying: \u201cThis company has to change. What got us here is not what\u2019s going to get us to the next level.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi, who is also on the board of The New York Times Company, was accompanied by Mr. Kalanick, who introduced his successor. Mr. Kalanick \u201cchoked up,\u201d according to the company; he had released a statement on Tuesday signaling his support of the new leadership.\u201cCasting a vote for the next chief executive of Uber was a big moment for me,\u201d Mr. Kalanick wrote. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t be happier to pass the torch to such an inspiring leader.\u201dThe Benchmark suit, filed on Aug. 10, accuses Mr. Kalanick of failing to inform investors about mismanagement at Uber. The venture capital firm argues that special powers Mr. Kalanick negotiated in 2016 \u2014 which gave him control over three board seats, including one he occupies \u2014 were bestowed under false pretenses and should be nullified.Mr. Kalanick responded on Aug. 18 with a motion to dismiss the case or move it to arbitration, where he can avoid being forced to go on the record.In court, Benchmark lawyers raised the possibility of a so-called status quo order, which would have prevented Mr. Kalanick for now from filling the two empty board seats.But Donald J. Wolfe Jr., one of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s lawyers, argued that Benchmark should not be able to prevent Mr. Kalanick from performing his current duties.\u201cIf the status quo order is intended to maintain the status quo, the status quo is that Mr. Kalanick is a director,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have here is a political battle that belongs in the boardroom, not the courtroom.\u201dThe judge did not grant the order.On Aug. 24, Mr. Pishevar and Mr. Russell filed a motion to intervene in Benchmark\u2019s complaint against Mr. Kalanick. They claimed that the venture capital firm was trying \u201cto unscrupulously gain control of Uber\u2019s board of directors and the Company at the expense of other investors for little more than the cost of a lawsuit.\u201dBenchmark, the motion said, has \u201cbenefited spectacularly\u201d from its involvement in Uber, with its stake ballooning to $8.4 billion from $27 million under Mr. Kalanick\u2019s leadership.

{"Headline": "For Uber, a Quiet Investor Becomes a Sudden Thorn", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 For the past week, Uber\u2019s board members have been embroiled in conversations over a thorny question: what to do about Benchmark, the venture capital firm that is one of the ride-hailing company\u2019s largest shareholders.Uber\u2019s board was blindsided by Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit, according to three people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. News of the suit led to a flurry of emails and phone calls between directors in recent days over what to do. Benchmark owns a 13 percent stake in Uber and also holds a board seat.Benchmark\u2019s influence on Uber\u2019s board, however, is now diminished. Benchmark\u2019s board representative, Matt Cohler, recused himself from a board committee that discusses litigation issues until the lawsuit is resolved, the people with knowledge of the matter said. The change means that for the time being, Benchmark will have restricted access to information about legal battles that are set to shape Uber\u2019s future.Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights, a research firm that tracks the venture capital industry, said that litigation between founders and venture capitalists had never been seen \u201cat this scale or in as public a way.\u201dRepresentatives for Uber and Uber\u2019s board declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Benchmark declined to comment beyond a statement earlier this week on the litigation. \u201cResorting to litigation was an extremely difficult step for Benchmark,\u201d the statement said. \u201cFailing to act now would mean endorsing behavior that is utterly unacceptable in any company.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Kalanick filed his opposition to Benchmark\u2019s lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court, saying in the filing that the case should be subject to arbitration and that there would be a pending motion to dismiss it.Mr. Kalanick argued that Benchmark\u2019s suit stemmed from a \u201cpublic and personal attack\u201d on him. He said that Benchmark \u201coutwardly supported\u201d him through May before executing a secret plan to oust him \u201cat the most shameful of times,\u201d less than two weeks after the funeral of his mother, who had died in a boating accident. Benchmark could not \u201cdemonstrate a threat of imminent irreparable harm\u201d to Uber if he stayed on the company\u2019s board, Mr. Kalanick said in the filing.Benchmark, which was founded in 1995, has developed a reputation for prescient start-up investments. It rode the late 1990s dot-com boom by backing companies like eBay and Palm. The company is also known for its network of influential tech executives, including Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.But Benchmark has been involved in disputes with entrepreneurs, sometimes leading to legal trouble. In 2005, most of the founders of a start-up called Epinions, which Benchmark had invested in, sued the firm and one of its partners, Bill Gurley, among others, accusing them of withholding information in an ownership deal. The suit was eventually settled.Silicon Valley\u2019s memory of such episodes was often short because of Benchmark\u2019s success. The firm, which invested $5 million in the e-commerce company eBay, reaped a 50,000 percent return when it went public in 1998. Twitter, Zillow and New Relic were also lucrative investments. More recently, a $21 million investment that Benchmark made in Snap became worth more than $2 billion when the social media company went public in March.Thanks in part to such fretting, Mr. Kalanick would sometimes reference the character Chicken Little, who always claimed the sky was falling, when speaking of Mr. Gurley, according to a person who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the conversations.Benchmark\u2019s ability to work with Uber became strained. This year, Mr. Gurley became worried that he did not get the full results of an internal Uber study that examined the reputation of the company and Mr. Kalanick, according to two people with knowledge of those conversations.Eventually, the relationship disintegrated. Benchmark spearheaded the effort to push Mr. Kalanick out as chief executive in June. That same month, Mr. Gurley left Uber\u2019s board, and Mr. Cohler replaced him.A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said that Mr. Gurley and Mr. Kalanick were never close, that Mr. Kalanick never called Mr. Gurley Chicken Little and that Mr. Gurley received the entire report about the reputation that Mr. Kalanick and Uber had among consumers.Until Benchmark sued Mr. Kalanick, the venture firm had not publicly admonished Uber\u2019s executive team. In its lawsuit against Mr. Kalanick, Benchmark claimed that it had no inkling until this year that Mr. Kalanick was mismanaging the company or that Uber\u2019s culture was deeply troubled. The ride-hailing company had made headlines for years in its clashes with legislators and regulators, among other issues.Now Benchmark must prove that there was fraud at Uber that it had no way of knowing about, said Bart Friedman, senior counsel at the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.\u201cIf they didn\u2019t know, they created this monster by looking the other way,\u201d Mr. Friedman said.Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

This opportunity may not seem significant to the cellphone-toting masses who think of mechanical wristwatches as anachronistic devices once used by their grandparents to tell time. But to the swelling legions of watch geeks worldwide who think of vintage timepieces as fine art, a so-called Paul Newman Daytona is the one watch that seemingly every self-respecting collector needs to own.And Paul Newman\u2019s \u201cPaul Newman\u201d? It is basically the Mona Lisa, perhaps the most famous timepiece in the world, coveted all the more because for decades, no one outside the Newman family seemed to know where it was.Judging by the frothy response so far, you would think the lost ark of the covenant had just been listed on eBay.A Regift of a Gift From His WifeNo one would be more baffled by the commotion than Butch Cassidy himself. Newman may have been a marquee-topping Oscar winner and global sex symbol, but in his daily life, he was the antithesis of Hollywood, said his daughter Nell Newman in a recent interview from her California home.For decades, he lived a quiet life with his family in leafy Westport, Conn., often driving a Volkswagen Beetle (albeit with a Porsche engine), and wearing a three-piece patchwork denim ensemble when circumstances forced him to dress up.Newman\u2019s 1968 model was a gift from Joanne Woodward, his wife of 50 years, when the actor became consumed with auto racing. The back was engraved, \u201cDrive Carefully Me.\u201dEven so, the 6239 model that Newman would make famous (he owned at least one other version later) was distinctive and relatively rare, featuring an exotic dial containing a number of stylish design tweaks including, most notably, the Art Deco-style numerals on the subdials that any true watch connoisseur can spot from 10 paces. There may be only a few thousand in the world today, dealers said.Regardless, Newman apparently thought so little of this horological treasure that he gave his away on a whim. In a story that is quickly becoming a watch nerd\u2019s version of Genesis, Newman casually handed over the watch to James Cox, Nell\u2019s college boyfriend at the time, one muggy summer afternoon in 1984.\u201cAs far as he was concerned, it was a tool,\u201d Ms. Newman said. \u201cHe definitely didn\u2019t have a strong attachment to things.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Cox said he was helping repair a treehouse on the Newman property when the blue-eyed actor approached and asked the time. \u201cI said, you know, \u2018a hair past a freckle,\u2019 or some comment meaning \u2018I don\u2019t have a watch,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cox, now 52, said. \u201cTo which he replied: \u2018Well, here, here\u2019s this watch. If you remember to wind it, it tells pretty good time.\u2019\u201dAnd it did, for the next decade or so, as Mr. Cox wore it daily, whether gardening or doing light construction jobs, thinking it was really valuable only to him, for sentimental reasons.His first inkling that his watch was valuable to others came at a trade show in 1993, when a Japanese man who spoke very little English approached Mr. Cox and excitedly blurted out, \u201cPaul Newman watch!\u201d\u201cI looked at him like, \u2018Oh, my God, how does this guy know that this is Paul Newman\u2019s watch?\u2019\u201d Mr. Cox recalled.Daytona in the Pinterest AgeUnbeknown to Mr. Cox, the aura of the Paul Newman Daytona had been building since the early 1980s, when Mr. Newman, according to watch lore, started flashing it in glamour shots for European fashion magazines.The legend continued to grow with the rise of the internet, when vintage shots of Newman, with his rugged good looks, no-nonsense air and, yes, really cool watch, became a staple of style blogs and Pinterest boards, where the actor was hailed an all-American king of cool to rival Steve McQueen.\u201cI kept thinking, \u2018I know the answers to these questions,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cox said. But, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve always erred on the side of trying to keep the family as private as possible, and that was just the classy thing to do, keep quiet about it.\u201d\u201cI told James, \u2018Just keep it, man, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d Ms. Newman said, joking about the potential windfall from the sale.The likelihood of a huge payday increases with the building media attention. \u201cWe\u2019ve received absentee bids already,\u201d said Paul Boutros, the head of the Phillips watch division in the Americas. \u201cOur best clients have been asking, \u2018Please reserve me a seat at the auction.\u2019 That immediate response, so many months in advance, has just not happened with any property we\u2019ve offered.\u201dWhile Mr. Cox plans to keep some of the proceeds (perhaps to buy a new Daytona?), he has little doubt what Newman, the philanthropist behind the charitable Newman\u2019s Own brand of salad dressing and popcorn, would say if he were alive.\u201cIf Paul was alive,\u201d Mr. Cox said, \u201cand I went to him and said, \u2018Hey, Paul, that watch you gave me, it turns out that it\u2019s super-valuable, super-iconic,\u2019 I think the first thing he would say would be: \u2018Well, kid, what are you going to do with it? You know, you\u2019re not going to keep it, are you? You\u2019re going to do something important.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Is Why a Trump Chicken Was Near the White House", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs political protest stunts go, this one was hard to miss.A giant inflatable chicken appeared outside the White House on Wednesday morning. Onlookers who saw the 10-foot-by-30-foot bird with the golden coif on the Ellipse, a park directly south of the White House, had no trouble identifying its human doppelg\u00e4nger: President Trump.The chicken was the brainchild of Taran Singh Brar, an artist and documentary filmmaker who lives in Ladera Ranch, Calif.He said by phone on Thursday that it took four months of planning before he could get permits from the National Park Service to bring his plan to fruition. But it was so worth it, he said.He added, \u201cHe\u2019s too afraid to release his tax returns, too afraid to stand up to Vladimir Putin, and playing chicken with North Korea.\u201dBut Mr. Brar said he knew that the president, with his ardent use of Twitter, was likely to get wind of the protest through social media.An email seeking comment from the White House was not immediately returned on Thursday.Mr. Brar said he had the idea in March to haul that chicken to the Ellipse. It took several trips to the District of Columbia to get the permit, he said.\u201cI just kept calling, kept showing up in person and kept emailing,\u201d he said.He learned there was a height limit for any structure to be erected where he wanted to place the chicken: 25 feet. But because his project was seen as an exercise in free speech, he said, \u201cI got a waiver for the First Amendment.\u201dThe images of the chicken were designed by the Seattle artist Casey Latiolais, according to Mr. Brar. Those images were sent to China and turned into a cold-air water balloon that Mr. Brar purchased and shipped to D.C. He took the balloon \u2014 along with four ropes and four sandbags totaling 600 pounds \u2014 to the site near the White House in a U-Haul truck.He said he did most of the work, though he had help from a few volunteers. He studied camera angles to plant the chicken in just the right spot so that the White House was in the foreground and the Washington Monument in the rear. His aim: \u201cTo go viral.\u201dThen he inflated the chicken. Time: 30 to 45 minutes. \u201cIt was a very strenuous day out there yesterday,\u201d he said.When the rooster stood tall, tourists could see its golden brows furrowed in anger. Its bright red wattle echoed the president\u2019s favorite color of necktie. The chicken had (golden) legs.But why, pray tell, a chicken? And especially one that comes with a name, Chicken Don or Donny?By Wednesday evening, Mr. Brar had deflated the giant chicken with a power vacuum (time: 30 minutes). But not before tourists to the nation\u2019s capital had gawked and taken many photos of his bird.\u201cThe image lives on,\u201d he said.He\u2019s not worried about getting a permit for that one. \u201cFree speech,\u201d he said.An article last Friday about an inflatable chicken that was displayed near the White House misidentified the city where Taran Singh Brar, the artist who installed the chicken, lives.

{"Headline": "EBay\u2019s Founder Has a New Idea: Build a Dairy in Hawaii", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKAUAI, Hawaii \u2014 If Pierre Omidyar gets his way, 699 dairy cows will soon enjoy a glorious view of the Pacific Ocean, framed by a pristine beach.Mr. Omidyar, the founder of eBay, wants to build a dairy farm on the island of Kauai.He is one of many tech billionaires who have established a presence in Hawaii, which is only a five-hour flight from Silicon Valley. Others include Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder, who bought all but a tiny amount of the island of Lanai and turned it into a resort \u2014 investing millions, but frustrating some islanders by driving up rents \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who was called a \u201cneocolonialist\u201d after he sued some locals over beachfront land he bought. (He dropped the suits.)Some residents, though, object. They and the owners of the major resorts that line this island\u2019s famous beaches, just a little over one mile down the coastline from the dairy site, have worked to block the project.\u201cWe are concerned with odors and flies from the dairy,\u201d said Lisa Munger, a lawyer who represents the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa, which successfully sued to force the dairy to do an environmental assessment. \u201cEach dairy cow will produce 90.8 pounds of manure per day \u2014 whether there are 699 cows or 2,000 cows, that is a lot of manure.\u201dMs. Munger said biting flies can reach the Grand Hyatt, along with \u201coffensive dairy odors.\u201dSo far, courts have sided with opponents of the dairy. In a case brought by the Friends group, contending that the dairy would violate the federal Clean Water Act, a judge ruled that it had violated the law by failing to get the permits it needed for the construction it had already done on the site.Another lawsuit, brought by the owners of the Grand Hyatt, contended the dairy would have a negative effect on businesses and resorts along the coast. This year, Judge Randal G. B. Valenciano revoked all permits that had been granted to Hawaii Dairy Farms and ordered it to complete an environmental assessment before going further.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from an economy here that grew sugar cane and pineapples and had a large agricultural industry to one based largely on tourism and real estate development,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said. \u201cAll these interests are competing for the same resources and opportunities, and if we\u2019re not careful, agriculture is going to lose out and Hawaii will be without a safety net \u2014 not being able to grow our own food is a significant issue.\u201dResidents point out that one drinking-water well supplying the neighborhoods of Poipu and Koloa is within 700 feet of the pastures where the cows will graze, and other wells are within 1,200 feet.The dairy\u2019s representatives contend that the soil at the site can absorb and filter the manure runoff from 699 milk cows.The chosen number of cows is significant: If Hawaii Dairy\u2019s plans included one more cow \u2014 bumping the total to 700 \u2014 it would meet the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s definition of a \u201clarge concentrated animal feeding operation,\u201d or CAFO.That designation initiates the need for a permit under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Because the dairy drew the line at 699 cows, avoiding the need for the discharge permit, it originally was able to describe itself as \u201czero discharge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be zero discharge from the E.P.A.\u2019s perspective,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said. \u201cThere will be very little discharge, but I think it was a little confusing for some people in the community, so we\u2019ve stopped saying that,\u201d she said.The dairy plans to eventually have 2,000 cows on the property.Given Hawaii\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley, it is little surprise that the islands have attracted many of America\u2019s new billionaires. Like everyone else, they appreciate the state\u2019s natural beauty. And they appreciate its generally laid-back approach to fame and fortune.Plus, it is easier to move around by boat and helicopter \u2014 avoiding paparazzi stakeouts. Marc Benioff, Paul Allen and Michael Dell, whose 18,500-square-foot hideaway there is known as the Raptor Residence, have homes here.While his improvements have driven up rents, displacing some residents \u2014 only about 3,200 people live there full time \u2014 Mr. Ellison has also paid for a new water filtration system for the island, a public pool and a movie theater.The suits touched on a particularly sensitive issue for native Hawaiians having to do with land that traditionally belonged to Hawaii\u2019s kings. Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan said in a letter printed in the local newspaper that they had been unaware of some of the issues involving such parcels and pledged to learn more.The Omidyars have lived in Honolulu more or less full time since the mid-2000s, and it is not the eBay billionaire\u2019s first run-in with the Kauai community. He previously planned to open a resort on the island\u2019s north shore on a property that was home to a Club Med. But he had to give up after about a tenth of the island\u2019s population signed a petition against the project, claiming its impact on the environment would be detrimental.He lived in Hawaii for two years when he was a teenager, and his wife, Pam, attended \u2019Iolani School in Honolulu. Today, he tends to keep a low profile. The couple has a private security staff that includes former Secret Service and State Department officers, and they keep a private plane at the ready at Honolulu Airport, which Mr. Omidyar has said is so that the family can escape a disaster quickly.He has also devoted $250 million to building a media business that includes online publications like The Intercept and Civil Beat, based in Honolulu, which tend to keep a weather eye on government and its secrets.Hawaii has at least three commercial dairies already \u2014 and making money is \u201can uphill battle,\u201d said Steve Whitesides, the owner of one of them, Big Island Dairy. Permits are hard to get, expenses are high and he has had to import more feed than he expected, he said. Mr. Whitesides, an Idaho-based dairy farmer, bought Big Island Dairy in 2012, when it was flirting with bankruptcy.Last September, heavy rains led to flooding in O\u2019okala, and some residents found themselves up to their ankles in wastewater carried down the mountain. They posted videos to YouTube documenting the experience and wrote letters to state officials. \u201cOlder people have told me they have a hard time eating dinner because of the smell, and homeowners have gotten E. coli and staph infections,\u201d said Valerie Poindexter, who represents the neighborhood on the Hawai\u2019i County Council.Mr. Whitesides said Big Island Dairy was built to \u201cproper specs\u201d and that he had continued to invest in its infrastructure to improve it. He said he did not believe manure was escaping from the two effluent ponds on the property, or the milking building. But the dairy does have some animals in pastures, he said, \u201cAnd that manure has to go somewhere.\u201dTo avoid any problems like that at Mr. Omidyar\u2019s dairy, Ms. Hennessey said, Hawaii Dairy will establish 35-foot setbacks, planted with dense vegetation, along a stream that runs through the property to prevent contamination of the waterway running through the property to the sea. The company also plans to introduce dung beetles to the property, Hawaii Dairy said, to help process manure.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Lanai. At least two of the Hawaiian archipelago\u2019s eight main islands \u2014 Niihau and Kahoolawe \u2014 are smaller, along with many other islands and atolls in the chain; it is not the smallest Hawaiian island.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Harriet Beecher Stowe House Is for Sale Online", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the most part, the houses that Harriet Beecher Stowe lived in have been carefully preserved and protected \u2014 from the Brunswick, Me., residence where she wrote \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d to the Hartford house where she spent her last years. But if you have a few hundred thousand dollars lying around, you can log on to eBay and buy the house where she was born.That house \u2014 built in Litchfield, Conn., in 1774 and purchased by the Rev. Lyman Beecher, the author\u2019s father, in 1810 \u2014 has been the subject of much dispute in recent years. Stowe lived there until she was 13, when she became a student at the Hartford Female Seminary.Mr. Pappas said he hoped the house would be restored and made open to the public. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say, \u2018We\u2019ll take the house,\u2019 but with no proof that they can do anything with it,\u201d Mr. Pappas said. \u201cOur goal is for someone to do a proper restoration job.\u201dHow did the birthplace of such a hallowed American writer fall to an online public auction? Much of the hesitation over buying and restoring it has to do with the house\u2019s heavy use over the years. Pete Seeger lived there in the 1920s; it served as a sanitarium, and then a school dormitory for half a century.The Harriet Beecher Stowe Center \u201chas emotional and intellectual interest, but we don\u2019t have the resources, of all kinds, to take that project on,\u201d Katherine Kane, the center\u2019s executive director, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad to have it in this condition. It\u2019s disrespectful and irresponsible, on the part of all of its owners.\u201dMr. Pappas, however, disputed the characterization of the house as in disrepair. \u201cWhen it was taken down, it was in mint condition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still as sound as it can be.\u201dMr. Pappas said he had received \u201cserious\u201d interest from potential buyers. However, he said he would not rule out the possibility of eventually selling off pieces of the house as antiques and building material. \u201cAt some point, the house is going to start rotting,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Today: A Dial-a-Rep Phone Booth", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this cheery Thursday.But last Thursday, our city got a new one, with a catch.When you enter the bright red phone booth on West 13th Street in the Meatpacking District and pick up the receiver, you are connected to the switchboard of the Capitol in Washington. You are then asked to enter your ZIP code and choose the Senate or House of Representatives member you wish to speak to. Then you are connected to his or her office.Want to talk about health care? Go ahead. Have ideas to improve education? Share them.The idea for the phone booth sprang from a group of employees \u2014 from marketing, public relations and corporate culture \u2014 at the Standard Hotel. It was designed as a tool for staff members and customers who were searching for ways to be more politically engaged after last year\u2019s election.The employees found a 1970s Sprint booth available from an auction house on eBay for less than $300, picked it up in Port Royal, Pa., and had it refurbished. Then, they placed it on the sidewalk, watched and waited.We waited, too, on Wednesday afternoon for about three hours. We mostly saw curious passers-by who squinted to read a sign at the top, or fixed their hair using the booth\u2019s reflective doors. No one made a call.So we did.We connected with the office of Representative Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat, who represents New York\u2019s 13th Congressional District, but we couldn\u2019t hear the person who answered the phone. (A representative at the Standard Hotel said it planned to replace the phone part that is causing the bad reception.)So we tried again, this time from our cellphone.We spoke to David Kimelman, a staff assistant and legislative correspondent who fields calls for Mr. Espaillat\u2019s office.The staff there answers from 50 to a few hundred calls from constituents on any given day, Mr. Kimelman said.When citizens call their representative, Mr. Kimelman said, a staff member will usually tally complaints and listen for patterns for or against pieces of legislation. Those concerns are then shared with the representative.His tips for getting your voice heard? It\u2019s fine to be brief if you just want your opinion counted as a \u201cyea\u201d or \u201cnay\u201d on a specific bill. But you can also discuss how an issue personally affects you, your family or community.And be nice, Mr. Kimelman said.\u201cA lot of people who answer phones are interns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know why you\u2019re yelling a them.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Eighty-something degrees for most of the day and 60-something degrees by night, with clear skies throughout.The weekend is looking iffy, though, so use this beautiful morning commute as an opportunity to do a no-rain dance.The arrest ended a monthslong search for the man who killed six people and wounded seven others. New Yorkers across the city breathed a sigh of relief.We recently asked readers who were residents then what the city was like during the summer of 1977.Here\u2019s what a few remembered:\u201cI cut my hair in April that year, because it appeared that Son of Sam targeted women with long hair. It was a long, hot summer.\u201d\u2014 Casey Quinlan, 65, Richmond, Va.\u201cMy husband and I lived near Parkchester in the Bronx, and late every Saturday night we walked to get the Sunday papers. One night was really beautiful, and we were surprised at how few people were out. Normally the streets would be filled with people. Then we remembered: Son of Sam. A car pulled up nearby, and we were terrified and almost ran home. The whole area was on edge until he was caught.\u201d\u2014 Sandy Dubinsky, 68, Westchester\u201cIn general the city was more dangerous, and the Son of Sam was the icing on the cake. Both petty and violent crime was numerous. Residents on Fifth Avenue parked their cars on the east side in view of the doorman, as on the park side guaranteed that it would be broken into. Being mugged was not an anomaly.\u201d\u2014 Joseph Sobin, 51, Denver\u201cI was an occupational therapy student at N.Y.U. and participating in a fieldwork internship in the summer of 1977. My position was in the psychiatric unit of what was then Cabrini Hospital. There was a young man who was admitted to this psychiatric ward who claimed to be the Son of Sam. It was very scary as no one could be sure if it was true. It was a dark summer in N.Y.C.

Their cargo was unwrapped inside the hangar high bay, a gleaming silo stocked with tool racks and ladder trucks. Engineers began to assemble the various pieces. Gradually, two identical spacecraft took shape. They were dubbed Voyager I and II, and their mission was to make the first color photographs and close-up measurements of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons. Then, if all went well, they might press onward \u2014 into uncharted territory.It took six months, working in shifts around the clock, for the NASA crew to reassemble and test the spacecraft. As the first launch date, Aug. 20, drew near, they folded the camera and instrument boom down against the spacecraft\u2019s spindly body like a bird\u2019s wing; gingerly they pushed it, satellite dish first, up inside a metal capsule hanging from the high bay ceiling.

Shielding their eyes, they peered across a flat expanse at smoke billowing on the horizon. Slowly and silently, the capsule rose out of the cloud, its rockets trailing flames. In an instant, there came a terrific boom as the sound waves from blastoff hit the hangar like a gong, ringing it as the spacecraft disappeared.Two weeks later, after the second launch, everyone headed home. The show was over \u2014 both spacecraft were performing flawlessly \u2014 but behind the scenes, the mission, on a tight budget, lagged in hiring the more than 200 computer engineers needed to shepherd the spacecraft through a planetary encounter. Many of those on the flight team were fresh out of college, running the most sophisticated electronics systems in the world. They had barely had a chance to jell, when, in April 1978, not yet halfway to Jupiter, Voyager 1 experienced a problem. Its scan platform, where the cameras and instruments are mounted, got stuck.As the engineers scrambled to figure out what they could do from more than 100 million miles away, someone forgot to send a weekly command to reset a timer on the other spacecraft. When it ran down without hearing from Earth, it triggered so-called fault-protection software, 600 lines of code that respond to malfunctions automatically. In this instance, fault protection assumed the radio receiver was broken and switched to the backup. On the mission-control monitors in a situation like this, the crawl of numbers reporting the status of the receivers would have turned crimson: a \u2018\u2018red alarm.\u2019\u2019Realizing their mistake, the engineers tried to stop the fault-protection routine, but the newly awakened backup receiver would not register their command. Helpless, they waited for the spacecraft to reason its way back to the original receiver; when it did, and the command went through normally, they were giddy with relief. They were still high-fiving when the working receiver shorted out like a blown fuse. Now it really was dead.Today the Voyagers are 10 billion and 13 billion miles away, the farthest man-made objects from Earth. The 40th anniversary of their launch will be celebrated next month. We tend to think of space as vacant, but it is actually matter, created, as everything in the universe is, by the explosions of ancient stars. Within our planetary neighborhood, this \u2018\u2018space\u2019\u2019 is made up of different particles than the space outside is, because of supersonic wind that blows out from the surface of our sun at a million miles per hour. The wind generates a bubble around our solar system called the heliosphere. Five years ago, Voyager 1 reached the boundary where the heliosphere gives way to interstellar space, a region as novel to us \u2014 and potentially relevant \u2014 as the Pacific was to Europeans 500 years ago. The data the probes are collecting are challenging fundamental physics and will provide clues to the biggest of questions: Why did our sun give birth to life only here? Where else, within our solar system or others, are we most likely to find evidence that we are not alone?The mission quite possibly represents the end of an era of space exploration in which the main goal is observation rather than commercialization. In internal memos, Trump-administration advisers have referred to NASA\u2019s traditional contractors as \u2018\u2018Old Space\u2019\u2019 and proposed refocusing its budget on supporting the growth of the private \u2018\u2018New Space\u2019\u2019 industry, Politico reported in February. \u2018\u2018Economic development of space\u2019\u2019 will begin in near-Earth orbit and on the moon, according to the president\u2019s transition team, with \u2018\u2018private lunar landers staking out de facto \u2018property rights\u2019 for Americans on the moon, by 2020.\u2019\u2019All explorations demand sacrifices in exchange for uncertain outcomes. Some of those sacrifices are social: how many resources we collectively devote to a given pursuit of knowledge. But another portion is borne by the explorer alone, who used to be rewarded with adventure and fame if not fortune. For the foreseeable future, Voyager seems destined to remain in the running for the title of Mankind\u2019s Greatest Journey, which might just make its nine flight-team engineers \u2014 most of whom have been with the mission since the Reagan administration \u2014 our greatest living explorers. They also may be the last people left on the planet who can operate the spacecraft\u2019s onboard computers, which have 235,000 times less memory and 175,000 times less speed than a 16-gigabyte smartphone. And while it\u2019s true that these pioneers haven\u2019t gone anywhere themselves, they are arguably every bit as dauntless as more celebrated predecessors. Magellan never had to steer a vessel from the confines of a dun-colored rental office, let alone stay at the helm long enough to qualify for a senior discount at the McDonald\u2019s next door.Their fluency in archaic programming languages will become only more crucial as the years go on, because even as the probes harvest priceless information from the cosmos, they are running out of fuel. (Decaying plutonium supplies their power.) By 2030 at the latest, they will not have enough juice left to run a single experiment. And even that best case comes with a major caveat: that the flight-team members forgo retirement to squeeze the most out of every last watt.The Voyagers carried cameras and instruments for analyzing atmospheric temperatures, moon masses, gravitational and magnetic fields and radiation levels. Reaching Jupiter in 1979, they captured images of lightning in its cloud tops and astounded scientists \u2014 who had assumed all moons were as barren as our own \u2014 with pictures of eight active volcanoes on its satellite Io; Europa, another Jovian moon, was encased in a shell of water ice, cracked in places by what appeared to be the tides of an ocean below. The photographs revealed themselves on control-room monitors pixel by pixel, row by row. \u2018\u2018I would be sitting in here at night sometimes when the Voyager mission was flying,\u2019\u2019 Esker Davis, project manager for the Saturn encounter, told David W. Swift, who published an oral history of the mission in 1997, after Davis\u2019s death. \u2018\u2018And my wife would call up and ask what I was doing. I said, \u2018Just watching pictures come in, being the first person to see this picture.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019The mission would have ended there, but President Ronald Reagan bestowed an extension, possibly swayed by the real-time briefings hosted by Ed Stone, the project\u2019s lead scientist, on the occasion of every planetary encounter. Hundreds of reporters, as well as politicians and celebrities, attended, packing into a cramped JPL auditorium for the debuts of Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.The final flyby, of Neptune\u2019s moon Triton, took place on a hot August night. Afterward, everyone celebrated with Champagne, cold cuts and drunken singing; on the JPL lawn, Chuck Berry performed \u2018\u2018Johnny B. Goode,\u2019\u2019 one of the tracks included on gold-plated records of human sights and sounds attached to the spacecraft for any intelligent life that might find them. Then, gradually, the hallways grew quiet. Stone and his colleagues moved on to new projects while analyzing Voyager data part time; the flight team laid off 150 engineers (many of whom went on to staff subsequent missions). The probes\u2019 new goal was to reach interstellar space. But though scientists had measured the speed of the solar wind that forms the heliosphere, the properties of the matter beyond it had never been analyzed. How much pressure it exerted on the bubble, and thus the size of the bubble, were a mystery. So, too, was how long \u2014 years? decades? \u2014 it might take a craft to escape it.At the mission\u2019s outset, the flight-team members were mischievous kids. They relieved stress with games and pranks: bowling in the hallway, using soda cans as pins; filling desk drawers with plastic bags of live goldfish; making scientists compete in disco-pose contests. Now, by 1990, they were older, with kids of their own. They had experienced the deaths of colleagues and watched others\u2019 marriages falter as a result of long hours at the lab. With no planets to explore, they spent the decade doing routine spacecraft maintenance with a fraction of their bygone manpower. Six of the current nine engineers were on the team then. Sun Kang Matsumoto, who joined the mission in \u201985, studied so diligently to master the new roles pressed upon her that her sons learned the spacecraft contours by osmosis. When her eldest was 8, he surprised her with a perfect Lego model; now in college, \u2018\u2018he calls and asks, \u2018How is Voyager?\u2019 Like, \u2018How is Grandma?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto says.The mission originally occupied three floors of Building 264 on the JPL campus, home to many of the lab\u2019s highest-profile projects. But soon after Neptune, says Jefferson Hall, who joined the project in 1978, \u2018\u2018we were booted out.\u2019\u2019 Their first move was into the former offices of a mainframe-computer company in Sierra Madre. In 2002, after more staff cuts, they moved to a rental suite in Altadena. NASA reviewed the mission to determine if it should be canceled altogether.The scientists\u2019 models, meanwhile, began to reveal subtle changes in the raw data. By late 2004, it was clear that Voyager 1\u2019s magnetometer had detected an abrupt increase in the strength of the surrounding magnetic field, suggesting the probe had entered the outermost layer of the heliospheric bubble, the \u2018\u2018heliosheath.\u2019\u2019 This is where the solar wind ions abruptly slow as they press outward against the surrounding interstellar matter and swerve to create a cometlike tail. A wind of interstellar ions flows around the outside of the bubble like water around the bow of a ship. Finally, on Aug. 25, 2012, the density of particles around the spacecraft precipitously increased, as though it had plunged from sky to sea. It had crossed the threshold of interstellar space.Last autumn, I drove through the San Gabriel Valley to a squat concrete building beside Scott-Fox Puppy Preschool. Suzanne Dodd, 56, the mission\u2019s project manager, answered the door. She wore red-framed glasses over sharp blue eyes, and her fair hair was cut short. She escorted me past the vestibule to a common room ringed by office doors. Hanging over the cubicle partitions in the center was a shingle that read \u2018\u2018Mission Control.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You can see where we are in the culture,\u2019\u2019 she said, with a mild sweep of her palm. Voyager was her first job. She pointed out a used microfiche reader that Tom Weeks, a hardware engineer and the self-described mission librarian, purchased on eBay to read old diagnostics reports. To conserve power on the spacecraft, the engineers must decide what to turn off when, and for how long \u2014 which means estimating how cold they can let each component get. (On Voyager 2, because of the broken oscillator, any change in temperature also tweaks the receiver frequency.) Turning the heaters off for a while is the safest way to get enough power to run the instruments, but the lower the overall wattage drops, the faster parts will freeze. One of the team\u2019s most valuable insights so far: Spinning the wheels of an eight-track tape recorder \u2014 the spacecrafts\u2019 only data-storage option \u2014 generates a bit of additional heat.Enrique Medina, the power subsystem expert, was preparing to implement a \u2018\u2018patch,\u2019\u2019 an update that would turn off a heater on Voyager 2 in order to run the gyroscope, roll the spacecraft and calibrate the magnetometer. Even though they simulate every patch with software, there is plenty of room for human error. Far more often, hardware fails for no evident reason. In 1998, Voyager 2 reacted to a command by going silent. For 64 hours straight, the flight team studied the specific instruction \u2014 consisting of 18 bits, or 1s and 0s \u2014 that preceded the blackout. Bits have been known to \u2018\u2018flip\u2019\u2019 to the opposite value, changing the instruction the same way that swapping a single letter turns \u2018\u2018cat\u2019\u2019 into \u2018\u2018cut.\u2019\u2019 The question was: What instruction had they accidentally given and how could they undo it? At last, modeling the outcome of each possible bit, they discovered one that turned off the exciter, which generates the spacecraft\u2019s radio signal; when they turned it back on, the transmissions resumed. A similar scare took place in 2010, when a bit involved in formatting telemetry flipped, turning the transmissions to gibberish. \u2018\u2018A lot of our anomalies we\u2019ve come up with workarounds for, and at the time we didn\u2019t know why it happened,\u2019\u2019 Weeks explained. Dodd added, \u2018\u2018The No. 1 rule with spacecraft is: Don\u2019t change it if you don\u2019t have to.\u2019\u2019In the mission-control cubby, Medina, who is 68 and a grandfather of four, with a husky voice and a Tom Selleck mustache, rolled a chair over to two pairs of monitors labeled with construction-paper signs that read: \u2018\u2018Voyager Mission Control Hardware, PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH.\u2019\u2019 He jiggled a mouse, and one of the screens woke to a stream of numbers and letters describing the health of Voyager 1.Because they have only four kilobytes of computer storage, the spacecraft transmit data 24/7, but the radio signals take 19 hours and 12 hours to reach Earth. The three antenna dishes big enough to register them are shared, so Voyager gets only four to six hours of reception time per spacecraft per day; outside these often odd windows, their data dissipate into the ether. Medina gestured to another computer in the corner that monitors the telemetry that comes in when the office is empty and, if it detects an anomaly, phones an on-call engineer: the Voyager Alarm Monitor Processor Including Remote Examination tool. \u2018\u2018We call it Vampire,\u2019\u2019 Medina said, \u2018\u2018because it works in the middle of the night.\u2019\u2019In March 2014, after news broke that Voyager 1 had crossed into interstellar space, I spoke with Medina over the phone. \u2018\u2018I would not leave my wife to go with Angelina Jolie, as exciting as that sounds,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018And I would not leave Voyager to go to the new Mars missions. I will not leave Voyager until it ceases to exist. Or until I cease to exist.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018If the pressure outside got high enough, and there are some areas in the Milky Way galaxy where it would be high enough, it could compress the heliosphere down to where in fact the boundary is almost to where we are. And that would change the radiation environment of the planets, which is important when you want to try to understand anything about the origin of life,\u2019\u2019 Ed Stone, the science-team leader, told me when I visited him at Caltech last fall. \u2018\u2018Here on Earth, wherever there\u2019s liquid water, whether it\u2019s boiling water coming out of the vents or frozen water, there are microbes there. So life is remarkably robust where there\u2019s water.\u2019\u2019He went on: \u2018\u2018I think that one of the biggest questions is, Can we find a spot here in the solar system where there\u2019s microbial life? If there\u2019s no microbial life anywhere else, that would be surprising, given here on Earth it appeared fairly quickly after the end of the bombardment,\u2019\u2019 an epic rain of asteroids some four billion years ago. \u2018\u2018If one could ever find some evidence of it here in the solar system where we could get a sample, then one could look at the DNA. All life on Earth has a related DNA. Is that true for everywhere? Either answer would be amazing. Either there\u2019s only one way that life evolves, or no, there\u2019s more than one way.\u2019\u2019In his office, Stone stood on tiptoe to lift an intricate model of Voyager from the top of a bookcase. At 81, he moves more stiffly than the Stone of NASA archival footage. Otherwise, he is remarkably unchanged. On a bulletin board behind his computer, he pins the latest graphs of the rate of charged particles that each spacecraft has detected. A drastic dip in low-energy ones is what convinced him that Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere, and he is eager for Voyager 2, which entered the heliosheath from a different angle in 2007, to see a comparable drop before it goes quiet.\u2018\u2018When we started this, I realized we were on a mission of discovery,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I just had no idea how much discovery there was going to be. And I certainly had no idea that it would last as long as it has.\u2019\u2019 After we lose contact with them, the spacecraft will continue to orbit the galaxy for billions of years, never striking another star. \u2018\u2018Space,\u2019\u2019 Stone said, \u2018\u2018is really empty.\u2019\u2019Astrophysicists who study the heliosphere wage a constant battle against apathy when it comes to invisible substances nearly 100 times farther away from us than the sun is. \u2018\u2018I hear a lot of people saying, \u2018So what?\u2019 I try to explain: \u2018It\u2019s like your home,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Merav Opher, a professor of astrophysics at Boston University and a member of the Voyager science team, told me. \u2018\u2018You just found out the walls aren\u2019t walls. They\u2019re porous. I think it\u2019s existential.\u2019\u2019 In 2006, Opher and Stone published a landmark paper in The Astrophysical Journal predicting that Voyager 2 would encounter the heliosphere boundary closer to the sun than its twin had, pointing to a startling contradiction: The heliosphere must be asymmetrical; it is not a \u2018\u2018sphere\u2019\u2019 after all.There is passionate disagreement about what its exact shape is. (The Voyager scientists argue over practically every scrap of data; a few holdouts insist that Voyager 1 has yet to reach interstellar space.) In 1961, Eugene Parker, the renowned astrophysicist who first predicted the existence of a heliosphere, hypothesized that it might look like a comet \u2014 compressed in front with a tail in back. Earlier this year, Tom Krimigis, the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and the principal investigator for Voyager\u2019s Low-Energy Charged Particle Experiment, published a paper in Nature Astronomy showing that the heliosphere has a very short tail and \u2018\u2018kind of moves through space like a clenched fist.\u2019\u2019 His instrument has also shown that cosmic rays \u2014 expected to flow toward the heliosphere uniformly from across interstellar space \u2014 actually move quite differently depending on their orientation to the interstellar magnetic field. \u2018\u2018Every once in a while, a tsunami passes Voyager,\u2019\u2019 Krimigis told me, referring to these waves. \u2018\u2018The galaxy was supposed to be a calm sea, and that\u2019s not what we find.\u2019\u2019Opher believes that the influence of the sun\u2019s magnetic field may warp the heliosphere into the shape of a \u2018\u2018croissant.\u2019\u2019 At its plump center, interstellar matter presses in closer than previously thought \u2014 which would mean we are less isolated from the rest of the galaxy than we believe.Later that morning, when Zottarelli entered the conference room to attend his last daily flight-team briefing, his colleague Adans Ko, 58, was arranging takeout containers of dim sum on the table for a celebration. He threw an arm around his shoulders and said, \u2018\u2018Larry is going to give me a kiss today!\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto, who was holding a camera, said, \u2018\u2018O.K., look at me.\u2019\u2019 She was making a photo album for him. When the party broke up, I found Zottarelli\u2019s replacement, Lu Yang, at her desk. I asked her if he had given her any specific advice. \u2018\u2018Whatever the problem, you go there and solve it,\u2019\u2019 she said, and laughed.In retirement, Zottarelli told me, he would like to see Florida again. He wonders how it has changed. In his garage is a 1954 Swallow Doretti, a fixer-upper. \u2018\u2018It probably needs new brakes,\u2019\u2019 he said. I asked him if there was anywhere he liked to drive for fun. \u2018\u2018No,\u2019\u2019 he replied. \u2018\u2018Not anymore.\u2019\u2019I had stopped by his office to say goodbye and ask him what he planned to do with his newfound freedom. I pictured him in the Doretti, flying down the Pacific Coast Highway, wind in his hair. But he seemed to be in no mood for talking. I wished him well and turned to go. Then he spoke. \u2018\u2018I expect my second stroke will be on the 17th of November,\u2019\u2019 he said ruefully, gesturing toward his empty wall calendar. \u2018\u2018Life expectancy is five to seven years at my age on retiring, so \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018That was humor, I guess. I\u2019m not looking forward to being even older. Got no choice in the matter.\u2019\u2019I asked if he ever found himself thinking about the billions of years that the Voyagers will circle the center of the galaxy, long after our sun has exploded, scattering more stardust throughout the universe. \u2018\u2018Of course,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I was raised in the Roman Rite. I\u2019m pretty much an atheist. But what is the meaning of life? It\u2019s not Monty Python, O.K.?\u2019\u2019Had he reached any conclusions about what it is? \u2018\u2018Well, on Earth, yeah,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018One species always prepares the way for the next generation \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u2019\u2019An article on Aug. 6 about the Voyager space probes misstated the title of Tom Krimigis. He is the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, not the emeritus head of the entire laboratory.Advertisement"}
