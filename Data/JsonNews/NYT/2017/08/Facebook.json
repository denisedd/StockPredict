Readers were as opinionated as the writers. Marginal tastes in the arts or ideology flourished, often in language that readers armed only with graduate degrees could understand. No pun was too convoluted, no cross-cultural reference too obscure. One measure of the paper\u2019s contrarian vitality was the certitude with which diehard readers of any era could say exactly when its quality went downhill. For Voice devotees, the golden age was always the one just past.But the printed paper was also an artifact of a downtown world that no longer exists.The newspaper business has moved online, Mr. Barbey noted, and so has The Voice\u2019s audience, \u201cwhich expects us to do what we do not just once a week, but every day, across a range of media,\u201d he wrote.This summer, The Voice redesigned its website and has since reported an increase in audience traffic.\u201cThe most powerful thing about The Voice wasn\u2019t that it was printed on newsprint or that it came out every week,\u201d Mr. Barbey said in a statement. \u201cIt was that The Village Voice was alive, and that it changed in step with and reflected the times and the ever-evolving world around it.

{"Headline": "Explosions and Black Smoke Reported at Chemical Plant", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs water began to recede in some parts of flood-ravaged Houston and as Harvey, now a tropical depression, shifted its wrath to the Beaumont-Port Arthur area of Texas, there were reports early Thursday that a chemical plant at risk of exploding had done just that.It said there was a risk of further explosions at the site.\u201cWe want local residents to be aware that the product is stored in multiple locations on the site, and a threat of additional explosion remains,\u201d Arkema said.CBS19, the Houston affiliate, reported the two explosions at the plant and showed photos of black smoke. The blasts were also reported by Fox 26.Richard Rowe, the chief executive of Arkema\u2019s North American division, told Reuters that the company had expected the chemicals to catch fire.The Arkema plant manufactures organic peroxides, which are used in making plastic and other materials. When the chemicals warm, they start to decompose, which creates more heat and can quickly lead to a rapid, explosive reaction. Some organic peroxides also produce flammable vapors as they decompose.The plant was shut down last Friday in anticipation of the storm, and a skeleton crew of 11 was left behind to ensure that the chemicals, which are kept in cold storage, remained safe.But Arkema said the plant had been without power since Sunday, and the torrential rains and flooding had damaged backup generators. With the storage warehouse warming up, the crew transferred the chemicals to diesel-powered refrigerated trailers, but some of those stopped working as well.Read the words of people who requested rescue online.Here is the latest:\u2022 The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression on Wednesday night. It is expected move through central Louisiana on Wednesday night, then move through northeastern Louisiana and northwestern Mississippi on Thursday.\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence is expected to visit four locations around Corpus Christi, Tex., on Thursday, to meet with storm survivors, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details of the trip were still being worked out.\u2022 Officials have reported at least 38 deaths that were related or suspected to be related to the storm. The victims include a police officer who died on his way to work; a mother who was swept into a canal while her child survived by clinging to her; a woman who died when a tree fell on her mobile home; and a family that is believed to have drowned while trying to escape floodwaters in a van.\u2022 More than 32,000 people were in shelters in Texas, and 30,000 shelter beds were available, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said. Houston officials said the city\u2019s largest shelter at the George R. Brown Convention Center had 8,000 and was no longer accepting evacuees. New evacuees would be taken to NRG Center, a conference hall in Houston.\u2022 Houston\u2019s two airports reopened, and airport officials said on Wednesday night that United Airlines had boarded a flight from Los Angeles bound for Houston. Five more flights were on their way and three aircrafts were scheduled to leave the Houston area. International flights are expected to resume Thursday.\u2022 The governor said 210,000 people have registered with FEMA for assistance.\u2022 The National Guard has conducted 8,500 rescues since the storm began, Mr. Abbott said, and the police and firefighters in the Houston area have done a similar number. About 24,000 National Guard troops will soon be deployed for disaster recovery in Texas.Water filled homes and submerged roads, evacuees crowded shelters, local officials urged people who needed rescue to hang sheets or towels from windows, forecasters warned that the storm could spawn tornadoes, and the Louisiana State Police closed Interstate 10 heading toward Beaumont, just a few miles from the state line. The rain was expected to continue until Friday.In Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner reiterated on Wednesday evening that he was pressing for the city to return to normal as quickly as possible. Several public safety officials said the city was beginning its transition from focusing on rescues to instead focusing on recovery.Those cities and other places in Jefferson County, Tex., east of Houston, were desperate for help after heavy rain caused floodwaters to rise precipitously.\u201cThe town looks like a lake, it really does. It\u2019s like the whole town got dropped into Lake Sabine,\u201d said Michael LeBouef, a retired surgical assistant who lives in Port Arthur. \u201cThe houses that are under water, it\u2019s unreal.\u201dIn Beaumont, emergency workers rescued a young girl who was floating in the floodwaters, suffering from hypothermia and clinging to her mother\u2019s body. The mother died, but the girl was in stable condition, the police said.The mother, identified by the police as Colette Sulcer, 41, had been driving down a service road when she pulled into a parking lot and got stuck. Ms. Sulcer and her daughter left the car, but were swept away, floating about half a mile, the police said. A group of emergency officials found the pair just before they were swept under a trestle. Had they floated under it, the workers would not have been able to save the child, the police said.Rain fell with astonishing intensity in the county, which is home to about 254,000 people. Between 2 p.m. Tuesday and 1 a.m. Wednesday local time, almost 19 inches of rain hit Jack Brooks Regional Airport, between Beaumont and Port Arthur.\u201cWater\u2019s still rising in most locations,\u201d said Jonathan Brazzell, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say, it\u2019s just bad. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201dThe rainfall total since the storm began reached more than 47 inches on Wednesday, and will climb. Rain was forecast to continue steadily through Wednesday and Thursday, before easing off on Friday.The cities of Austin and Dallas were expecting to absorb thousands of schoolchildren displaced by the storm, said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of 68 large urban school districts. In both cities, school officials were waiving certain paperwork requirements, including immunization records and birth certificates, in order to quickly enroll displaced children, he said.Robyn L. Harris, a spokeswoman for the Dallas Independent School District, said that the students would be classified as homeless and that the district was ready to provide psychological counseling and health services.Mr. Casserly has been working with urban districts in Texas over the last week and also assisted school officials after past disasters, including Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York. He said he expected Congress to pass special disaster relief legislation, but that after previous catastrophes, the federal funding provided for schools did not come close to covering the costs associated with getting classes back up and running.Mr. Turner, the Houston mayor, said Wednesday evening that a citywide curfew would take effect again from midnight until 5 a.m. He said heavy debris pick up began Wednesday and regular trash collection would resume on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our very best to push the pace,\u201d he said.Mr. Turner said he wanted the Astros baseball team to play a scheduled home game on Friday.But thousands of people remained in shelters, still seeking information about their families and friends, and about the state of their homes and their city.Officials also said that about 75,000 CenterPoint Energy customers remained without power as of late Wednesday \u2014 down from about 100,000.Though the inundation from days of record rainfall has begun to recede, swollen rivers still have not crested in some places. Art Acevedo, the police chief, said that 20 people who had been reported missing since the start of the storm remained unaccounted for.Pounding rains and rapidly rising floodwaters caused by Hurricane Harvey pummeled the city of Houston, a metropolitan area of 6.6 million.Max Tribble, an owner of the MaxBowl in Port Arthur, received a call from the fire department on Tuesday night: A shelter was taking on water, and emergency officials needed a dry place to bring evacuees. The bowling alley, which had been spared the flooding, fit the bill.\u201cThey just started dropping off people \u2014 I think there were about 500 people there,\u201d Mr. Tribble said.Mr. Tribble\u2019s bowling alley was quickly transformed into an ad hoc shelter. Evacuees arrived in boats and on dump trucks, and slept on the floor near the bowling alleys, in the hallways, in the bar and in a dance area. One person found a spot on a pool table.\u201cThey couldn\u2019t sleep in the laser tag room because there was a leak in the roof and it was kind of wet over there,\u201d said Mr. Tribble, who spoke by phone from Houston. He was unable to travel to Port Arthur because of the flooded highways and watched on security cameras.\u201cIn our birthday party rooms, they set up a medical triage unit to treat people there,\u201d Mr. Tribble said.By Wednesday morning, an employee had waded to work in chest-deep water and had fired up the kitchen, where he began to crank out pizzas. Emergency responders have dropped off blankets, baby formulas, and diapers, and Mr. Tribble said some mattresses appear to have arrived.One thing that\u2019s not happening at the alley is bowling. Not yet, anyway.Representative Brian Babin, Republican of Texas, who had been trapped with his family in their Woodville home because of nearby flooding, was able to leave the residence Wednesday afternoon, his spokesman said.Mr. Babin had told CNN earlier that although he had no \u201cway to get out\u201d of the home, he and his family were not worried.His spokesman, Jimmy Milstead, later confirmed that Mr. Babin and his family were \u201csafe and in no danger.\u201d In a subsequent email, Mr. Milstead said the congressman had made it out.The nine counties across Mr. Babin\u2019s 36th Congressional District have experienced unprecedented rains and flooding.After working for days on end during the storm at Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital in northeast Houston, Dr. Vladimir Melnikov finally got out on his bicycle on a windy, dry Wednesday afternoon. The memories of the preceding days were fresh on his mind.\u201cWe were on this island, a hospital surrounded by water everywhere,\u201d he said.A patient injured in a motorcycle accident was bleeding into his brain on Sunday night. He needed urgent brain surgery, but there was no neurosurgeon to do it, and no way to transfer the patient.After consulting with the patient\u2019s family, and speaking with neurosurgeons by phone, Dr. Erik P. Askenasy, a colon and rectal surgeon, opened the man\u2019s skull to relieve the pressure and remove a blood clot.Dr. Melnikov, an anesthesiologist, monitored the patient and watched as the surgeon \u201cdid it so elegantly\u201d that no blood transfusion was required. When the wind died down, the patient was transferred to another hospital for continuing care.Dr. Askenasy \u201cwas trapped with us in this small hospital, and he was an ortho surgeon, a neurosurgeon and a general surgeon, because we didn\u2019t have relief,\u201d Dr. Melkinov said.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of a man in east Houston who was looking for his dog. His name is Jose Machado, not Juan. The error was repeated in a photo caption.An earlier version of this article misidentified a building where some new evacuees in Houston would be taken.

{"Headline": "When Jack Daniel\u2019s Failed to Honor a Slave, an Author Rewrote History", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLYNCHBURG, Tenn. \u2014 Fawn Weaver was on vacation in Singapore last summer when she first read about Nearest Green, the Tennessee slave who taught Jack Daniel how to make whiskey.\u201cIt was jarring that arguably one of the most well-known brands in the world was created, in part, by a slave,\u201d said Ms. Weaver, 40, an African-American real estate investor and author.Determined to see the changes herself, she was soon on a plane from her home in Los Angeles to Nashville. But when she got to Lynchburg, she found no trace of Green. \u201cI went on three tours of the distillery, and nothing, not a mention of him,\u201d she said.Rather than leave, Ms. Weaver dug in, determined to uncover more about Green and persuade Brown-Forman to follow through on its promise to recognize his role in creating America\u2019s most famous whiskey. She rented a house in downtown Lynchburg, and began contacting Green\u2019s descendants, dozens of whom still live in the area.Through that research, she also located the farm where the two men began distilling \u2014 and bought it, along with a four-acre parcel in the center of town that she intends to turn into a memorial park. She even discovered that Green\u2019s real name was Nathan; Nearest (not Nearis, as has often been reported) was a nickname.She is writing a book about Green, and last month introduced Uncle Nearest 1856, a whiskey produced on contract by another Tennessee distillery; she says she will apply the bulk of any profits toward her expanding list of Green-related projects.Ms. Weaver\u2019s biggest success, however, came in May, when Brown-Forman officially recognized Green as its first master distiller, nearly a year after the company vowed to start sharing Green\u2019s legacy. (Daniel is now listed as its second master distiller.)\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical that the story of Nearest gets added to the Jack Daniel story,\u201d Mark I. McCallum, the president of Jack Daniel\u2019s Brands at Brown-Forman, said in an interview.The company\u2019s decision to recognize its debt to a slave, first reported last year by The New York Times, is a momentous turn in the history of Southern foodways. Even as black innovators in Southern cooking and agriculture are beginning to get their due, the tale of American whiskey is still told as a whites-only affair, about Scots-Irish settlers who brought Old World distilling knowledge to the frontier states of Tennessee and Kentucky.Green\u2019s story changes all that by showing how enslaved people likely provided the brains as well as the brawn in what was an arduous, dangerous and highly technical operation.According to Ms. Weaver, Green was rented out by his owners, a firm called Landis & Green, to farmers around Lynchburg, including Dan Call, a wealthy landowner and preacher who also employed a teenager named Jack Daniel to help make whiskey. Green, already adept at distilling, took Daniel under his wing and, after the Civil War and the end of slavery, went to work for him in his fledgling whiskey operation.In all likelihood, there were many other men like Green, scattered around the South. Records are spotty, though references to slaves skilled in distilling and whiskey making pop up in slave sales and runaway-slave ads from the early 19th century. But only one of them helped found a whiskey brand that today generates about $3 billion a year in revenue.The company had intended to recognize Green\u2019s role as master distiller last year as part of its 150th anniversary celebration, Mr. McCallum said, but decided to put off any changes amid the racially charged run-up to the 2016 election. \u201cI thought we would be accused of making a big deal about it for commercial gain,\u201d he said.It didn\u2019t help that many people misunderstood the history, assuming that Daniel had owned Green and stolen his recipe. In fact, Daniel never owned slaves and spoke openly about Green\u2019s role as his mentor.And so the company\u2019s plans went back on the shelf, and might have stayed there had Fawn Weaver not come along.As she tells it, she was looking for a new project when she picked up that newspaper in Singapore.\u201cMy wife often thinks and acts as a single activity,\u201d said her husband, Keith Weaver, an executive vice president at Sony Pictures. \u201cAs her husband, I knew, \u2018Here we go again.\u2019\u201dWhat was meant to be a quick trip to Lynchburg turned into a monthslong residency, as Ms. Weaver discovered an unwritten history, hidden in forgotten archives, vacant land and the collective memory of the town\u2019s black residents.Through dozens of conversations, local people, many of whom worked or still work for Jack Daniel\u2019s, told her about learning Green\u2019s story from their parents and grandparents, holding it as fact even as the company kept silent.\u201cIt\u2019s something my grandmother always told us,\u201d said Debbie Ann Eady-Staples, a descendant of Green who lives in Lynchburg and has worked for the distillery for nearly 40 years. \u201cWe knew it in our family, even if it didn\u2019t come from the company.\u201dNothing stays quiet in Lynchburg (population 6,319) for long, especially when it involves the biggest employer in town, and by late March Ms. Weaver was meeting with Mr. McCallum, the brand president, in the makeshift office she had set up in a run-down house on her newly acquired farm.With a sampling of her estimated 10,000 documents and artifacts spread across a table between them, it quickly became obvious that Ms. Weaver, who had no previous background in whiskey history, knew more about the origins of Jack Daniel\u2019s than the company itself. What was supposed to be a preliminary meeting turned into a six-hour conversation.Mr. McCallum says he left reinvigorated, and within a few weeks he had plans in place to put Green at the center of the Jack Daniel\u2019s story line. In a May meeting with 100 distillery employees, including several of Green\u2019s descendants, he outlined how the company would incorporate Green into the official history, and that month the company began training its two dozen tour guides.At one point Jack Daniel\u2019s proposed adding a Nearest Green bottle to its \u201cMaster Distiller\u201d series, a limited-edition run of bottles that celebrate its former master distillers, but dropped the idea over concerns from inside and outside the company about appearing to cash in on Green\u2019s name.Instead, Ms. Weaver has released her own whiskey, Uncle Nearest 1856, which she bought in bulk from another distillery. She is planning to produce a second, unaged spirit, made according to her specifications, which she says will mimic the style of whiskey that Green and Daniel probably made.Jack Daniel\u2019s seems unfazed, for now, by the use of Green\u2019s name on someone else\u2019s liquor. \u201cWe applaud Ms. Weaver for her efforts to achieve a similar goal with the launch of this new product,\u201d a Brown-Forman spokesman said.Ms. Eady-Staples, who met privately with Mr. McCallum before the big meeting, said she was proud that her employer was finally doing the right thing. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Brown-Forman for not acting earlier, because they didn\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce they did, they jumped on it.\u201dAnd although there is no known photograph of Green, the company placed a photo of Daniel seated next to an unidentified black man \u2014 he may be Green or one of his sons who also worked for the distillery \u2014 on its wall of master distillers, a sort of corporate hall of fame.\u201cWe want to get across that Nearest Green was a mentor to Jack,\u201d said Steve May, who runs the distillery\u2019s visitors center and tours. \u201cWe have five different tour scripts, and each one incorporates Nearest. I worked some long days to get those ready.\u201dMr. May said that so far, visitor response to the new tours spotlighting Green\u2019s contribution has been positive. It\u2019s not hard to see why: At a rough time for race relations in America, the relationship between Daniel and Green allows Brown-Forman to tell a positive story, while also pioneering an overdue conversation about the unacknowledged role that black people, as slaves and later as free men, played in the evolution of American whiskey.For her part, Ms. Weaver isn\u2019t finished with her search for Green \u2014 and may never be.\u201cI\u2019ve lost track of him after 1884,\u201d the year when Jack Daniel moved his distillery to its current location, and Green disappeared from the fledgling company\u2019s records, she said. She is still hoping to find Green\u2019s gravesite, and has recently been traveling to St. Louis to meet with a branch of the family there.\u201cI could be doing this the rest of my life,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Afghanistan, a Destructive \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The senior security official in northeastern Takhar Province was deferential when he telephoned Commander Bashir Qanet. After all, he was talking to one of the most powerful government supporters in the province, who has hundreds of militiamen under his command.\u201cPlease could you stop killing your own people?\u201d he asked the commander, whose irregulars had just opened fire on a couple of dozen pro-government worshipers inside a mosque, during prayers, killing five and wounding 37.The commander responded with a profane comment about the caller\u2019s wife \u2014 the worst possible insult to an Afghan \u2014 and slammed the phone down. At that point the death toll of Afghan civilians attributed by the authorities to Commander Qanet\u2019s three-month-long rampage in Takhar was about 30 (seven in just the last week), none of them insurgents, but the police and security officials as of Friday had been powerless to stop him or his followers.That has hurt the government\u2019s efforts to tame the insurgency. It is no coincidence that many of the places where the insurgents have made their biggest gains have been in the northern provinces, where warlords have long held power \u2014 and often are deeply resented.This week, the largest city in the north, Mazar-i-Sharif, was in turmoil after Asif Mohmand, a provincial councilman, posted on Facebook the week before to scold a supporter of the famously vain governor of Balkh Province, Atta Muhammad Noor, whose picture has been pasted all over the northern capital on giant posters. There is not even an election going on.Governor Atta, a notorious warlord himself and hardly one to shy away from a fight, sent his gunmen and a contingent of police officers to meet the provincial counselor\u2019s plane when it landed, only to encounter Mr. Mohmand\u2019s own armed supporters there to defend him from arrest. The ensuing firefight raged through the terminal and its parking lots, killing two, wounding 17 and temporarily shutting down Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport.The result is the central government does not really control large swaths of its own territory, even where the Taliban is not a factor. Instead, it cedes authority to warlords, some in government and some just aligned with it, who are too powerful to be subdued and often too angry at one another to focus on their common enemy, the Taliban.Such infighting among the warlords is precisely what helped catapult the Taliban to power in 1996. And many of those warlords are still on the scene, on the government side.\u201cMost of these political parties have illegal armed men, and it\u2019s a threat to the government,\u201d said a retired general and military analyst, Abdul Wahid Taqat. \u201cThey could force the government to collapse and also open a path for the Taliban to return to power.\u201dThe other faction in the Afghan government, led by Mr. Abdullah, is aligned most closely with the Jamiat-i-Islami party, another fundamentalist grouping identified with Tajiks and other northerners.Cha Aab\u2019s mullah, Muallawi Mahfuzullah, considered a Jamiat man, began preaching against smuggling and violence by Commander Qanet, who as a Hizb-e commander is now on the government\u2019s side. The commander\u2019s men ordered Mullah Mahfuzullah to stop, and after he refused, sacked his home and killed another mullah from his mosque, the police said.At prayers last Friday, Mullah Mahfuzullah spoke under the protection of 30 officers drawn from the Afghan police and the National Directorate of Security. But Commander Qanet\u2019s militia forced their way in and opened fire on the worshipers provincial police officials said.\u201cEven the police stood by and watched like victims and did not even try to stop the firing,\u201d said Qurban Mohammad, 45, a laborer who was present. \u201cThey were like wild beasts.\u201dCommander Qanet, reached by telephone, was clearly unhappy to take the call. He complained that Mullah Mahfuzullah had declared him an infidel, but denied attacking him. \u201cMy fault is this, that I voted for Ashraf Ghani in the election,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the allegations against me are false.\u201d Then he abruptly hung up.Historically, Junbish and Jamiat, like General Dostum and Governor Atta, are bitter opponents who have killed thousands of each other\u2019s followers. Now, however, they are in an enemy-of-my-enemy alliance. Both oppose to the predominantly Pashtun faction around President Ghani.Then there is Mr. Mohmand, the provocative provincial councilman. He enjoyed the support of the Hizb-e-Islami faction at the Mazar-i-Sharif airport, who apparently provided the muscle that protected him \u2014 for a while. The national police refused to arrest him, because they said there were no valid criminal charges. But Governor Atta\u2019s men, including the border police, captured him and, under pressure, turned him over to the Afghan intelligence agency, which in Mazar is run by an Atta follower. While in custody, he later claimed, Governor Atta\u2019s son bit off his ear.Some saw Mr. Mohmand\u2019s visit as a conspiracy by Mr. Ghani\u2019s supporters to so weaken Governor Atta that they could succeed in removing him \u2014 a move that has a new urgency, now that the governor has aligned himself with General Dostum.So far, the ploy, if indeed there was such a ploy, seems to have failed. But Mr. Mohmand was released Thursday and returned to Kabul, ready for another episode.Jawad Sukhanyar and Fahim Abed contributed reporting from Kabul, and Najim Rahim from Kunduz, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Allure of Argentina\u2019s Bubbling Cheese", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenBubbling melted cheese is hard to resist, whether it\u2019s French fondue swirled around cubes of bread, Swiss raclette spread on hot boiled potatoes, or Tex-Mex queso fundido, served with thick tortilla chips. On my first trip to Argentina, I encountered a South American version.My friend Fernando Trocca, a well-known Buenos Aires chef, met me at the airport. I was tired from the 10-hour flight but ready for anything \u2014 and hungry.Fernando had arranged for a group of friends to have dinner that evening at one of his favorite restaurants. A few hours later, we gathered around a long table at the bustling parrilla El Pobre Luis. I was warned to prepare for a night of feasting. It would be a traditional meat-centric asado, with everything grilled over a huge bed of hot, glowing coals.The first item to arrive was not meat, however. It was a grilled piece of cheese \u2014 a typical Argentine appetizer called provoleta, fragrant with oregano, crisped and browned at the edges, and starting to ooze. There was nothing low-cal about it, and it was delicious, smeared on bread that had been toasted over embers. Little bowls of chimichurri, the local version of salsa verde, were also on hand for extra embellishment.The meal was off to a good start, lubricated with free-flowing red Malbec wine, from the Mendoza region in the foothills of the Andes, as the meat began to arrive. First came little chorizo and morcilla sausages and sweetbreads, as well as chinchulines (grilled chitterlings) and kidneys, not for the faint of heart. Then came every cut of beef imaginable, from skirt steak to rib-eye and everything in between.But back to provoleta. In the United States, imported Italian provolone is your best choice. Provolone is a long, cylindrical cheese; what you want is a perfectly round piece sliced at least an inch thick. Go to an Italian deli or a good cheesemonger and ask to have it cut. Let it come to room temperature, uncovered, allowing the exterior to dry a bit. Then dust both sides with oregano and crushed red pepper.In Argentina (and Uruguay), provoleta is tossed on the grill like a steak, but unless you are very experienced, you risk losing the cheese that way, watching helplessly as it melts and drips into the fire below. Amateurs are well advised to cook the cheese in a small cast-iron pan over the coals. But a good version can be made on the stovetop, under the broiler or in a hot oven.It makes a fine snack, perfectly suitable for noncarnivores, too.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Russians Arrested on Treason Charges Helped U.S. Catch Hacker, Report Says", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States Secret Service, which investigates some online financial fraud, detained the hacker, Roman V. Seleznev, the son of a member of the Russian Parliament, during a vacation in the Maldives in 2014.He was accused of stealing credit card data in the United States that was traded in the digital underground. In April, a court sentenced him to 27 years in prison.That the two Russian officers had helped the Americans detain Mr. Seleznev would not rule out some role for them in the electoral hacking case, as more evidence emerges that the Russian government cooperated with cybercriminals in the election meddling.In December, for example, the Obama administration imposed sanctions for election meddling against two Russian hackers who were already wanted by the F.B.I. for online fraud.In its report on Wednesday, Dozhd cited sources within the F.S.B., whom it did not identify, saying the treason arrests sprang from helping the United States arrest Mr. Seleznev.\u201cSpecifically, as a result of processing information received from the \u2018Mikhailov group,\u2019 according to those Dozhd spoke with, there was the high-profile arrest in 2014\u201d of Mr. Seleznev, the television station reported.The F.S.B. also arrested Ruslan V. Stoyanov, a senior malware researcher with the antivirus company Kaspersky, and Georgy Fomchenkov, a man who more than a decade ago was known to associate with hackers but whose role in the case today is unclear. The arrests remained secret until January, when they were reported by Kommersant, a Russian newspaper.Ivan Y. Pavlov, a defense lawyer specializing in treason cases, has said he represents one of the four accused but was not authorized to say which one. In a post on Facebook on Thursday, Mr. Pavlov denied that the men were accused of assisting the United States in the Seleznev case.\u201cI am familiar with the accusation, though for now cannot reveal details,\u201d he wrote. He suggested the latest leaks were merely \u201cunder-the-rug intrigues of the special services.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dick Gregory, 84, Dies; Found Humor in the Civil Rights Struggle", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDick Gregory, the pioneering satirist who transformed cool humor into a barbed force for civil rights in the 1960s, then veered from his craft for a life devoted to protest and fasting in the name of assorted social causes, health regimens and conspiracy theories, died Saturday in Washington. He was 84.Early in his career, Mr. Gregory insisted in interviews that his first order of business onstage was to get laughs, not to change how white America treated Negroes (the accepted word for African-Americans at the time). \u201cHumor can no more find the solution to race problems than it can cure cancer,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, as the civil rights movement was kicking into high gear, whites who caught his club act or listened to his routines on records came away with a deeper feel for the nation\u2019s shameful racial history.Mr. Gregory was a breakthrough performer in his appeal to whites \u2014 a crossover star, in contrast to veteran black comedians like Redd Foxx, Moms Mabley and Slappy White, whose earthy, pungent humor was mainly confined to black clubs on the so-called chitlin circuit.Though he clearly seethed over the repression of blacks, he resorted to neither scoldings nor lectures when playing big-time rooms like the hungry i in San Francisco or the Village Gate in New York. Rather, he won audiences over with wry observations about the country\u2019s racial chasm.He would plant himself on a stool, the picture of insouciance in a three-button suit and dark tie, dragging slowly on a cigarette, which he used as a punctuation mark. From that perch he would bid America to look in the mirror, and to laugh at itself.\u201cSegregation is not all bad,\u201d he would say. \u201cHave you ever heard of a collision where the people in the back of the bus got hurt?\u201d Or: \u201cYou know the definition of a Southern moderate? That\u2019s a cat that\u2019ll lynch you from a low tree.\u201d Or: \u201cI heard we\u2019ve got lots of black astronauts. Saving them for the first spaceflight to the sun.\u201dSome lines became classics, like the one about a restaurant waitress in the segregated South who told him, \u201cWe don\u2019t serve colored people here,\u201d to which Mr. Gregory replied: \u201cThat\u2019s all right, I don\u2019t eat colored people. Just bring me a whole fried chicken.\u201d Lunch-counter sit-ins, central to the early civil rights protests, did not always work out as planned. \u201cI sat in at a lunch counter for nine months,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they finally integrated, they didn\u2019t have what I wanted.\u201dMr. Gregory was a national sensation in the early 1960s, earning thousands of dollars a week from club dates and from records like \u201cIn Living Black and White\u201d and \u201cDick Gregory Talks Turkey.\u201d He wrote the first of his dozen books. Time magazine, enormously powerful then, ran a profile of him. Jack Paar, that era\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d host, had him on as a guest \u2014 after Mr. Gregory demanded that he be invited to sit for a chat. Until then, black performers did their numbers, then had to leave. Time on Paar\u2019s sofa was a sign of having arrived.Newspapers in those days routinely put Mr. Gregory on a par with two white performers, Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce, anointing them a troika of modern satire. Just as routinely, he was later credited with paving the way for a new wave of black comedians who would make it big in the white world, notably two talents of thoroughly different sensibilities: the reflective Bill Cosby and the trenchant Richard Pryor.It was Mr. Gregory\u2019s conviction that within a well-delivered joke lies power. He learned that lesson growing up in St. Louis, achingly poor and fatherless and often picked on by other children in his neighborhood.He titled that book \u201cnigger,\u201d lowercase N. The word \u2014 typically reduced these days to \u201cthe N-word\u201d \u2014 figured prominently in his routines, even as he shunned the obscenities that casually littered the acts of other comedians.\u201cI said, let\u2019s pull it out of the closet, let\u2019s lay it out there, let\u2019s deal with it, let\u2019s dissect it,\u201d he said in a 2000 interview with NPR. \u201cIt should never be called \u2018the N-word.\u2019 \u201dIn 1962, Mr. Gregory joined a demonstration for black voting rights in Mississippi. That was a beginning. He threw himself into social activism body and soul, viewing it as a higher calling.Arrests came by the dozens. In a Birmingham, Ala., jail in 1963, he wrote, he endured \u201cthe first really good beating I ever had in my life.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt was just body pain, though. The Negro has a callus growing on his soul, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to hurt him there.\u201dIn 1965, he was shot in the leg (the wound was not grave) by a rioter as he tried to be a peacemaker during the Watts riots in Los Angeles.Increasingly, he skipped club dates to march or to perform at benefits for civil rights groups. Club owners became reluctant to book him: Who knew if he might fly off to Alabama on a moment\u2019s notice? As the \u201960s wore on, the college lecture circuit became his principal forum.\u201cAgainst the advice of almost everyone, he decided to risk his career for civil rights,\u201d Gerald Nachman wrote in \u201cSeriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s\u201d (2003). Some pillars of the movement, like Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the National Urban League, who died in 1971, believed that Mr. Gregory was more valuable to their cause onstage than in the streets. To which Mr. Gregory replied, \u201cWhen America goes to war, she don\u2019t send her comedians.\u201dIn 1967, his head now ringed with a full beard and bushy hair \u2014 no more the thin mustache of earlier years \u2014 he ran for mayor of Chicago, more or less as a stunt. The next year he ran for president on the Freedom and Peace Party ticket, getting by his count 1.5 million write-in votes. The official figure was 47,133.There seemed few causes he would not embrace. He took to fasting for weeks on end, his once-robust body shrinking at times to 95 pounds. Across the decades, he went on dozens of hunger strikes, over issues including the Vietnam War, the failed Equal Rights Amendment, police brutality, South African apartheid, nuclear power, prison reform, drug abuse and American Indian rights.And he reveled in conspiracy theories, elaborating on them in language that could be enigmatic and circuitous. Hidden hands, Mr. Gregory insisted, were behind everything from a crack cocaine epidemic to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001; from the murders of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lennon to the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr. Whom to blame? \u201cWhoever the people are who control the system,\u201d he told The Washington Post in 2000.His fasting led to a keen interest in nutrition. Working in the 1980s with a Swedish health food company, Mr. Gregory developed a weight-reduction powder called Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet. The partners had a falling-out, and the business swooned.Still, Mr. Gregory remained a fervent health-food advocate. In late 1999, he learned he had lymphoma but rejected chemotherapy, relying instead on vitamins, herbs and exercise. The cancer went into remission.His activism came at a price, however. For one thing, the cascade of cash that he had once enjoyed turned into a trickle. His family paid, too.Mr. Gregory moved to Chicago to build a comedy career in the late 1950s. There he met Lillian Smith, a secretary at the University of Chicago, and they were married in 1959. They had 11 children, one of whom, Richard Jr., died in infancy.In 1973, when cash was still rolling in, they bought a 400-acre farm near Plymouth, Mass. (Why Plymouth? \u201cI think the white folks is coming back, and I\u2019m going to get a handful of Indians and stop \u2019em there this time,\u201d Mr. Gregory said.) But by the early 1990s, the strapped Gregorys had lost the farm and moved into an apartment in Plymouth.Over more than five decades of marriage, Lillian Gregory said, she understood her husband\u2019s need \u2014 some called it an obsession \u2014 to wander off on behalf of this or that cause, typically earning nothing except attention, and sometimes not even that. But Christian Gregory, a chiropractor in Washington, said to The Washington Post in 2000: \u201cHe told his 10 children that the movement came before the family. It was a hard pill to swallow.\u201dFather absenteeism was a familiar phenomenon for the man born Richard Claxton Gregory in St. Louis on Oct. 12, 1932. He was the second of six children. His father, Presley, disappeared after the birth of each child, and finally left for good. The Gregory children were reared by their mother, Lucille, who scraped by on welfare and a meager income as a maid.\u201cKids didn\u2019t eat off the floor,\u201d Mr. Gregory said of their Depression-era poverty. \u201cWhen I was a kid, you dropped something off the table, it never reached the floor.\u201dBesides his son Christian, Mr. Gregory is survived by his wife, Lillian; two other sons, Gregory and Yohance Maqubela; seven daughters, Ayanna, Lynne, Michele, Miss, Paula Cenac, Satori and Zenobia Chisholm; two brothers, Ron and Garland; two sisters, Pauline Hariston and Delores Hill; 16 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.Mr. Gregory graduated from Sumner High School in St. Louis, then attended Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Ill. At both schools, he was a track star and enjoyed local fame.Not that the acclaim was free of complications. In 1961, by then a national figure, he received the key to the city from the mayor of St. Louis. Yet in his hometown, he was denied a room at a leading hotel. \u201cThey gave me the key to the city,\u201d Mr. Gregory said, \u201cand then they changed all the locks.\u201dHe left college in 1954 and joined the Army, where he was able to work on comedy routines while attached to Special Services. He then returned to college, only to give it up again without graduating.In 1956, he headed to Chicago, where he worked in small-time clubs at night and at odd jobs by day. He even tried running a club of his own, but that venture failed.In one part-time job, Mr. Gregory sorted mail in a post office. His pattern, he later said, was to toss letters destined for Mississippi into a slot marked \u201coverseas.\u201d That job did not last long.His real break came in January 1961, when he was asked to fill in for the comedian Irwin Corey, who had canceled a gig at the flagship Playboy Club in Chicago. On the big night, club managers had misgivings; the house was packed with businessmen from the Deep South. No matter, Mr. Gregory said. He insisted on performing.\u201cI understand there are a great many Southerners in the room tonight,\u201d he began his act. \u201cI know the South very well. I spent 20 years there one night.\u201d He so won over the crowd that Playboy\u2019s Hugh Hefner signed him for three more weeks, then extended the contract.Despite having sworn off nightclubs in 1973, saying he could no longer work in places where liquor was served, Mr. Gregory returned to them on occasion in later years, a thin presence wreathed in white hair and beard. Though his best days were well behind him, his approach never seemed to waver from principles that he set for himself when starting out. He put it this way in his autobiography:\u201cI\u2019ve got to go up there as an individual first, a Negro second. I\u2019ve got to be a colored funny man, not a funny colored man.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this obituary misstated the year of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. It was 2001, not 2011.Mel Watkins contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Teach in Houston. I\u2019m Worried for My Students.", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHOUSTON \u2014 I\u2019m sitting in a bedroom in my friend\u2019s house in southwest Houston, terrified for my city. The rain has poured down nonstop since Friday. I\u2019m lucky to be safe and dry, but I worry for the thousands of others who are not as fortunate \u2014 particularly many of my students.One of my students was being evacuated when I called to check up on her. I can only imagine what she and other kids are going through right now.We should be making lesson plans and study schedules. Now we\u2019re worried about students who don\u2019t have shelter or enough food.My phone has been buzzing for days with alerts about tornadoes and flash floods. My friends and I text one another images of the roads we once drove on that are now under water or have collapsed. Heartbreaking photos of friends and students who need to be rescued are circulating on Facebook and Instagram.My experience of the storm started when I came home on Thursday from work, where I\u2019d been preparing for the coming school year. A carefully folded letter from my apartment complex\u2019s managers had been slipped into the gate to my patio:\u201cWe are asking you to begin thinking about preparations,\u201d it read.My stomach dropped.\u201cIf an evacuation order is given by government officials, we encourage you to follow their recommendations as we will,\u201d the letter went on. \u201cAs a result, our team members are unable to access the community, so you will need to be prepared to go several days without assistance of our management/maintenance team.\u201dI felt a rush of feelings, but particularly residual trauma from the tornadoes and the storms I had already endured back home in Alabama, especially Hurricanes Katrina and Ike.I steeled myself and immediately went to gather supplies. I knew the Walmart on Westheimer would be packed, so I headed for the Family Dollar store on Dairy Ashford Road. All of the shopping carts were gone, so I got a bucket from the cleaning section.There was fear and determination in the air. People hurried through the aisles to get the things they most needed. They exchanged stories about surviving storms like this before. The line to check out grew with every passing moment as I made my way from one section to the next.I was baffled by the sight of people buying charcoal and barbecue grills until I heard one woman say to another, \u201cGirl, if the lights go out, I can still try and cook for my kids.\u201d I bought the second-to-last grill left on the shelf. We were all making a way out of no way.Later that night, the school district sent out a notice that schools would be closed Friday. I still felt safe enough in my split-level apartment in the Alief area, in West Houston, since a colleague who had lived there for about six years was also staying. We could at least keep each other from going stir-crazy.But when I took out my trash Friday morning, my colleague was packing up her car to head to her brother\u2019s house in North Houston.With that, my safety net was gone. I was terrified and I felt trapped. My ground-floor patio had already flooded, so I started making phone calls to take people up on their offers to stay with them. And I wasn\u2019t alone. I had a pregnant houseguest who\u2019d also recently gotten a teaching job in Houston. She\u2019s staying with me until she can move her family from Alabama. I needed a place where we could both be safe, but many of the people I called said they couldn\u2019t take the two of us.On Friday afternoon, I finally got a yes from a friend in Missouri City, just southwest of Houston. We\u2019ve been here in her two-bedroom apartment since then.All the while, I\u2019ve been reaching out to my students to make sure they\u2019re all right. Their lives matter to me. I hope they will all be able to recover from this. Our students\u2019 safety is paramount, but the state must get the kids back in school as soon as possible.Teachers in Houston are willing to do just about anything to support their education. We\u2019ll call, Google chat or Skype students if that\u2019s what it takes to have class. We\u2019ll help to build a makeshift school so our students can continue to learn.Meanwhile, it just keeps raining.Lisa Lyne\u00e9 Daniels is a high school history teacher.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Preparing for Hajj With a Case of \u2018Dad Brain\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s midnight, three days before I leave for my first hajj, the five-day religious pilgrimage that\u2019s among the most meaningful experiences in a Muslim\u2019s life. When I arrive in Mecca, I\u2019ll join nearly two million believers who\u2019ve traveled from Virginia, Kabul, and everywhere in between: a dysfunctional but tight-knit family of believers, dreamers and sinners, briefly united under the piercing sun of Mecca.Wearing white garments that conceal any clues about our professions or possessions, we\u2019ll embark on a journey retracing the steps and rituals of Abraham and the Prophet Muhammad and satisfying one of the five pillars of our faith. If we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll earn approving winks from God and return with purified hearts and spiritual clean slates.And yet here I am, sitting in my kitchen feeding tiny bites of chicken kebab and rice to Ibrahim, my insomniac 3-year-old, as we finish an episode of \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d on his iPad. Nusayba, my 1-year-old daughter, circles us. She just learned to walk, and is now a tyrant in diapers. I often wonder aloud if someone is sneaking the two of them energy drinks. They rarely sleep before 1 a.m. As a result, my wife and I are brown zombies. She\u2019s convinced that her neck is permanently damaged from lifting small children. I complain of chronic \u201cdad brain\u201d \u2014 my sleep-deprived mind making daily tasks feel unmanageable. Lately, I\u2019m fretting because exhaustion and the demands of domestic family life are standing between me and my pre-hajj checklist.Yes, there\u2019s a checklist. My mother interviewed several hajj veterans about indispensable items for the trip and passed their responses on to me in an email: \u201cTylenol, medicine for diarrhea and stomach upset\u201d \u2014 the extreme heat is known to take a toll \u2014 \u201cstrong chappals, not flip flops\u201d (you can\u2019t have your shoes falling apart mid-trek); and \u201csunglasses, fanny pack and an umbrella.\u201d By the time I\u2019ve scrolled to the end I\u2019m overwhelmed.Instead of attacking the list at Target, I just spent two hours at a discount grocery store with my wife, because, according to her, they had \u201cexcellent prices on bulk diapers and sweet iced tea.\u201d Helping to stock up on these essentials was the least I could do. I\u2019m worried about how she\u2019ll handle two babies without me, not to mention how I\u2019ll manage jumping back into our routine after I return.\u201cPlease don\u2019t die,\u201d one editor implored me, citing the numerous stories of deadly hajj stampedes, the most recent of which killed over 2,000 people in 2015. The risk is why it\u2019s traditional for each pilgrim to make a will before leaving. I\u2019ve joked that I might just scrawl an \u201cI.O.U.\u201d for my wife, perhaps on the back of one of our Toys-\u201dR\u201d-Us receipts.My guilt about my failure to properly prepare is amplified by an awareness of how lucky I am to have been invited to God\u2019s \u201chouse,\u201d a yearning unrealized and unfulfilled by millions of far more pious men and women. Many save their entire lives to make the trip. I always imagined I\u2019d make hajj after I reached a stage of stable adulthood \u2014 and accompanying income \u2014 that still sometimes feels distant. But in a fortuitous plot twist, a hajj tour company invited me as its guest, making it possible for a freelance writer to afford the trip.\u201cLabbayk Allahumma Labbayk\u201d is what I and all pilgrims will chant in Arabic when arriving in Mecca. \u201cHere I am, O Allah, here I am.\u201dI recently complained to my wife about how our kids\u2019 sleep schedule (or lack thereof) was stealing the time I needed to be truly ready for this moment. I immediately felt guilty. It occurred to me that I had to think of these frazzled pretravel days \u2014 and all of our days \u2014 differently.After all, what\u2019s the point of saying, \u201cHere I am,\u201d when you\u2019re not present at home? What\u2019s the point of seeing the Kaaba if you can\u2019t appreciate the miracle that is two manic munchkins running around after midnight?I haven\u2019t shown the selflessness and dedication of some of my peers in preparing for hajj, and I know it\u2019s likely too much to ask for this journey undo all of my flaws. But part of me believes I still have a chance to do it right \u2014 starting before I leave. That means watching another \u201cPaw Patrol\u201d episode with patience instead of resentment, and bringing renewed energy to being the kind of dad who will return to kids who have actually missed him.I hope I\u2019m lucky enough to have my hajj accepted. I hope to earn a wink from God.

But Is It Good?", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review9 PhotosThe food appears within 10 minutes from the moment you walk through the door on West 28th Street. Before that happens, you choose one of the eight or so main courses pictured on the wall, give your order to an extroverted host who taps it into a hand-held screen, and mill around the silverware and condiment station until you hear your name and are handed your meal on a charcoal-colored tray that doubles as a place mat.Like those two restaurants, Made Nice is under the ownership and direction of the chef Daniel Humm and his collaborator, Will Guidara. To bring some of their usual meticulous care and a few glimmers of their artistry to a high-speed operation is the trick Made Nice is trying to pull off. To do so, the two owners have requisitioned a sous-chef from Eleven Madison Park, Danny DiStefano, to run the enormous kitchen, while Mr. Humm waves his magic wand somewhere offstage.As trays loaded with salad-like dishes leave the counter, you can glimpse bits and pieces of the two more formal restaurants flying by, like the scraps of Kansas that Dorothy sees caught in the twister. Look \u2014 it\u2019s the NoMad chicken! And isn\u2019t that the pork confit from Eleven Madison Park?Well, no, not really, as you will discover when you sit down and eat. The Made Nice confit doesn\u2019t have the creaminess or the concentrated delicacy that suckling pig gives the original, or the golden roof of crisp skin. It\u2019s a dark brick of shredded pork, a heavy-tasting and oddly inert centerpiece for a summer salad of shaved corn, watercress and wheat berries.Served at night and on Saturdays, the chicken is the only major dish at Made Nice that could not even by the most elastic definition be called a salad. With a bread stuffing under its browned skin, it does resemble the NoMad chicken from a distance.Nobody should be surprised when a stripped-down dish that can be ready in five minutes and costs, on average, about $14 isn\u2019t as wonderful as one that was fluffed to greatness for its role in a $295 tasting menu. It\u2019s not a fair fight, yet it\u2019s one that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara have invited by trying to link their fast-casual business with their other restaurants.But some of the food at Made Nice doesn\u2019t just suffer by comparison; it can also suffer all on its own.The curried cauliflower is said to be a callout to another standby at the NoMad. I don\u2019t remember trying it there, so I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s so unevenly cooked that some pieces are brown and collapsed while others are white, crunchy and barely cooked. That\u2019s how the cauliflower at Made Nice was, though. It tasted nothing like a real curry, and only a little bit like curry powder.Another dish is called chicken rice. The rice tastes like tomatoes and needs salt. The chicken seems exhausted. Imagine a chain of Cuban restaurants started by retired employees of the Olive Garden. This could be their arroz con pollo.Of the nine major dishes on the current menu, there are three I would be happy to eat again. One is a salad of watermelon and quinoa that has just enough twists and turns to stand out, like crisp pistachios and soft, creamy feta. Another, seared hanger steak slices over roasted broccoli that is chopped and seasoned with lime, may not sound like a winning combination, but it is. A third is smoked salmon salad whose croutons are, in fact, little fried cubes of shredded potato.Actually, there is a fourth dish worth revisiting, though I wouldn\u2019t try to make a meal of it: the milk and honey sundae. The ice cream is soft serve \u2014 milk, uncontaminated by vanilla \u2014 strewn with a variety of fun, crunchy bits made from milk or honey. It\u2019s $6.The sundae combines sophistication and pleasure better than anything else on the menu. It is also the only item you can\u2019t get delivered. I suspect these things may be related.That enormous kitchen wasn\u2019t built solely to feed the 30 or so people who can be seated in the restaurant. It was designed to handle a tall pile of takeout and delivery orders. So, in fact, were the recipes. Aside from the sundae, everything is engineered to look and taste almost as good after being sealed with a plastic lid, packed into a bag and carted 10 blocks.These twin trends have created a new and nearly invisible kind of restaurant with no dining room, just a commissary kitchen that fulfills orders to go. They\u2019re called ghost restaurants. Made Nice seems to be something different. Its small dining room is merely the tip of a much bigger operation lurking below the surface. It\u2019s an iceberg restaurant.To test it out, I ate one of my three Made Nice meals at The New York Times Building. My order showed up about a minute late, which counts as early given Midtown rush-hour traffic, and was pretty much as advertised. The fried chicken skins that are supposed to be scattered over the gravy-like chicken velout\u00e9 didn\u2019t show up, and a caper-dill relish that the menu said came with the tuna ni\u00e7oise was smeared on the pork confit and the cod Proven\u00e7al as well.Nothing was hot after about 30 minutes in transit. But the cooked items were still warm, the lettuce and other raw ingredients hadn\u2019t wilted, and all the plates looked as if they had been primped by a food stylist for an overhead shot. Eating food like this at your desk would not feel like a complete surrender.Eating it in a restaurant is another story. Whether the same recipes can suit both experiences is the question Made Nice asks. Your own answer will depend on whether you are hoping for food that is quick, inexpensive and as delicious as you would expect from one of the city\u2019s best-known chefs, or are willing to settle for two out of three.Ligaya Mishan\u2019s Hungry City reviews will return next Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hunting a Killer: Sex, Drugs and the Return of Syphilis", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "Outbreaks of a deadly, sexually transmitted disease confound health officials, whose obstacles include drug shortages, uneducated doctors and gangs.Supported byOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 For months, health officials in this socially conservative state capital have been staggered by a fast-spreading outbreak of a disease that, for nearly two decades, was considered all but extinguished.To locate possible patients and draw their blood for testing, Oklahoma\u2019s syphilis detectives have been knocking on doors in dilapidated apartment complexes and dingy motels, driving down lonely rural roads and interviewing prison inmates. Syphilis has led them to members of 17 gangs; to drug dealers; to prostitutes, pimps and johns; and to their spouses and lovers, all caught in the disease\u2019s undertow.It took months for investigators to realize Oklahoma City had a syphilis outbreak. Last fall, the juvenile detention center reported three cases \u2014 a boy and two girls, the youngest, 14. The center had never had a syphilis case in seven years of testing for it.Investigators were mystified: The teenagers did not know each other, live in the same neighborhood or attend the same school.Nearly 24,000 cases of early-stage syphilis, when the disease is most contagious, were reported in the United States in 2015, the most recent data. That was a 19 percent rise over the previous year. The total for 2015, including those with later-stage disease, was nearly 75,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The way to shut down an outbreak is to locate all the sex partners of people who are infected and persuade them to get tested, treated and disclose other partners. That task has fallen on a handful of the health department\u2019s disease intervention specialists.This most recent wave of infections, spread through gang networks and prostitution rings, has made their jobs not only difficult but also dangerous.Erinn Williams, the lead field investigator for the Oklahoma City outbreak, drove slowly down a one-lane gravel road curtained by overgrowth and bristling with barbed wire and \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs.Ms. Williams, 39, life-seasoned by an Alaska upbringing, Air Force training and two small daughters, usually makes these visits alone. She keeps her baby\u2019s car seat in the back, to allay suspicions that she may be an undercover police officer.\u201cWhat you do is your business,\u201d she tells the wary. \u201cI\u2019m here because I care about your health.\u201dShe is accustomed to stopping by houses with locks punched out; to being warned off by drug dealers; to wearing comfortable shoes, the better to run away in.She pulled up to a clearing. Across a ragged lawn, she could see a battered blue trailer surrounded by pickup trucks and a stand of trees. Access was blocked by an iron fence, monitored by video cameras.Ms. Williams pushed a call button. \u201cHi, I\u2019m here from the health department. Can I talk to you? I have some news.\u201dA young woman hesitantly crossed the grass. For months she had avoided health workers. Once, an investigator spotted her slipping in through a side entrance to her mother\u2019s house; at the front door, the mother denied that her daughter was there.Fresh-faced, her blonde hair in a ponytail, the woman looked healthier than most people Ms. Williams visits, with their grayish skin, abscesses and mottled veins.Ms. Williams was gentle but direct: \u201cYour blood test results came back. It\u2019s positive for syphilis.\u201dThe woman buried her face in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed,\u201d she sobbed. (Bound by confidentiality rules, Ms. Williams did not disclose her name.)\u201cIs that why my baby died?\u201d she asked.Ms. Williams nodded affirmatively.\u201cCan my kid get it? We sometimes share the same glass.\u201dNo, Ms. Williams said. Just your sexual partners.The woman insisted she had slept with only two men that year \u2014 her boyfriend and her ex, the father of the baby who had died.Ms. Williams, who knew the woman\u2019s Facebook page revealed many friends in a gang central to the outbreak, asked her to think carefully about whether there were more. We never reveal your name, she said, just as we cannot tell you who gave us yours.The woman shook her head.It was time to coax the woman into treatment. Just an injection and you will almost certainly be cured, Ms. Williams said, offering to drive her to the clinic. Her boyfriend too, Ms. Williams added.He wasn\u2019t around, the woman said, but she promised they would be there in the morning.Are you sure you don\u2019t want to go now? Ms. Williams asked.Again, the woman shook her head.Reluctantly, Ms. Williams got in her car and drove away.By then, largely because of treatment and public education, syphilis was disappearing. A generation of physicians rarely learned to recognize it firsthand.But with the AIDS epidemic, syphilis surged, peaking around 1990. It was most common \u2014 and still is \u2014 among men who had sex with men, often those whose H.I.V. status made them vulnerable to other sexually transmitted infections.Once again, public health campaigns sent syphilis into retreat. By 2000, only 5,970 cases were reported in the United States, the lowest since 1941, when reporting became mandatory.But in the last few years, it has crept back.Here in Oklahoma City, 199 cases have been connected so far this year. More than half the patients are white and female. The youngest girl is 14; the oldest man, 61. Three stillbirths have been attributed to syphilis and 13 of the infected were pregnant women.Many people never suspect they have the disease. Early symptoms, including genital lesions and, later, rashes on palms and soles, have led patients and health care providers to mistake it for herpes or allergic reactions. The disease can lie dormant for decades and then affect the liver, joints, blood vessels.Once people are treated, though cured, they will almost always test positive. It is difficult to know whether a positive result indicates a new infection. After transmission, the bacteria may take three months to register. Those who test negative may have the disease.The cure for syphilis \u2014 usually two injections of Bicillin L-A, a type of penicillin \u2014 is relatively simple. But supplies have dwindled. Recently in Oklahoma, there were only seven doses statewide. Pfizer announced that stockpiles would be replenished by the end of 2017.\u201cAll the photographs still show patients who are Afro-American men,\u201d Dr. Wilson said. \u201cWhat message does that send?\u201dAfter several months, dispirited Oklahoma investigators acknowledged that old-school tactics for locating contacts, like knocking on doors and cold-calling, were not very effective. Many people they sought are transient and use disposable phones.\u201cBut they want to stay connected to their friends and their drugs,\u201d said Ms. King, a supervising investigator. \u201cSo they\u2019re all on Facebook. That\u2019s where we\u2019re finding them.\u201dThrough Facebook, investigators memorize faces and gang tattoos, and follow the flare-ups and flameouts of relationships. As gang members and dealers post partying plans, the sleuths determine where to point their investigation. They send potential patients messages through Facebook.Ms. Williams\u2019s team realized they were tracking a spread that reached back to last summer, involved members and associates of 17 gangs, and had infected young people from stable backgrounds who had used prescription opioids, then heroin. Patients often had symptoms that were a signature of this outbreak: weeping genital warts, called condylomata lata; patchy hair loss; and mucosal oozes inside the mouth.The office created a chart of the outbreak, coded with symbols. Diamond: drug user. Blue heart: pregnant. Strawberry: prostitute.They have come to understand why more than half of this outbreak\u2019s victims are women: \u201cThe men give up the women\u2019s names,\u201d Ms. King said. \u201cBut the women are too loyal or afraid to give up the men. \u201dBut recently investigators persuaded a gang leader to text members, ordering them to contact Ms. Williams.Every day, the team checks arrest reports for people they are seeking. Chloe Hickman interviews inmates. Wearing glasses and no makeup, inclined toward modest cardigans, she doesn\u2019t come across as someone who chats up gang members about their sex lives.\u201cI don\u2019t cuss in my real life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the jail, I flirt. I wear tight pants, a low-cut top and I use the F-word.\u201cMost of them don\u2019t know what syphilis is. When I say it\u2019s curable, they relax. And they\u2019ll give me names.\u201dUsually such efforts lead to sagas of unrelenting grimness: mothers who prostitute daughters, and men who forcibly inject runaways with drugs to hook them, a practice known as guerrilla pimping.Acquaintances of the investigators often dismiss their work as disgusting. For support, the women call each other daily, to laugh and vent.Ms. Williams, on the job for eight years, said it gets to her, but she cannot let it go. \u201cI remind myself that I\u2019m not trying to fix all their problems,\u201d she said. \u201cJust one.\u201dBy 10 o\u2019clock the next morning, Ms. Williams had arranged to pick up one person for treatment, been stood up by another and was texting with a man who refused her offer of a blood draw, claiming that needles made him anxious. She had driven a woman to the clinic, after waiting outside her house as, apparently, the woman was getting high on meth.Now at the clinic, the woman seemed to have fled. Ms. Williams and nurses ran through hallways, looking for her.One victory: The woman from the trailer was in the waiting room. But she was alone. In the parking lot, her boyfriend sat out the appointment in his pickup truck, motor idling. He would not come inside for treatment.He would almost certainly reinfect his girlfriend. And Ms. Williams would have to persuade her to be tested and treated, yet again.Advertisement"}

This is certainly not common among Silicon Valley company boards, right?If you haven\u2019t been paying attention, last weekend a Google employee\u2019s 10-page memo on Google culture went viral internally and created quite a controversy with some of its assertions, which included specious reasoning around why women were not as prevalent in engineering positions at the company.The way this played out has been extraordinary and yet predictable, a narrative in which corporate culture has been highly politicized because of the current divisive tenor of American cultural discourse.I\u2019m just curious for your perspective on it, and where you think it may head from here.Thanks, Katie, see you soon.Advertisement"}

For one, I rarely get lost now that I always have a GPS device in my pocket. After lots of practice with your camera, I\u2019ve become a decent photographer. And I\u2019m more punctual and responsive thanks to constant access to my calendar and email.\u201cPeople spend hours on it every day, so they can justify paying more for what they believe to be the best device,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who has studied Apple for years and called the company\u2019s positioning of the iPhone \u201cunique.\u201dMany eyes are now on Apple\u2019s 10th anniversary event for the iPhone, which is expected to be held next month. There, Apple is set to introduce major upgrades for the next iPhones, which could stoke our appetites again for the gadget. Or not.Chief among the changes for the new iPhones: refreshed versions, including a premium model priced at around $999, according to people briefed on the product, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apple made room for a bigger screen on that model by reducing the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Other new features include facial recognition for unlocking the device, along with the ability to charge it with magnetic induction, the people said.Here\u2019s a look back at the last 10 years of why the iPhone still has us in its grip \u2014 so much that people keep coming back for more.The role of Apple stores in keeping people loyal to iPhones cannot be overstated. The Apple stores include the so-called Genius Bar for getting repairs, so when things go wrong with an iPhone, you can simply schedule a repair appointment at the nearest location.Security experts agree that the iPhone\u2019s operating system is architecturally more secure than Android. The main reason is that Apple\u2019s iOS can only run apps that Apple approved to be distributed in the App Store. By contrast, Android phones are capable of running software from outside of Google\u2019s official app store, and apps from unauthorized sources are more likely to carry malware.The trade-off for stronger security, of course, is flexibility. Android users are free to tinker with their devices using custom software, while iPhone customers can only use apps that play by Apple\u2019s rules.\u201cThe iPhone is still arguably the best phone for regular people who just want their device to work without having to worry about lots of technical settings or malware,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research.Software updates are another factor in security. Apple issues its own software updates, making it easy for iPhones to get the latest security enhancements. By contrast, Android device makers have to coordinate software updates with carriers, making the process more complicated and time consuming.IPhones work well with other Apple devices like Macs and the Apple TV. Once you invest in other Apple products, it\u2019s tough to leave the ecosystem. The Apple Watch makes it especially tough: It requires an iPhone to work properly. So if you were to switch to Android, prepare for your smart watch to transform into a dumb watch.Less sticky is Apple\u2019s ecosystem of apps and web services. For every major Apple app, including Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple Photos, there are alternatives like Google Maps, Spotify and Google Photos. It\u2019s difficult to resist using iMessage, Apple\u2019s default text messaging service. But there are plenty of alternatives like WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Signal.Mr. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein said Apple had created a \u201cbrand halo\u201d for the iPhone by positioning it as a premium product with easy-to-use software and high-quality features, components and capabilities.Notably, among current iPhone customers surveyed by 451 Research, 91 percent of those who planned on buying a new smartphone in the near future said they intended to buy another iPhone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pregnant and Far from Home, a Sisterhood of the Expecting", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBETHEL, Alaska \u2014 The contractions were coming eight minutes apart, and Billie Jo Yupanik was breathing into them, her gaze down, hands cradling her abdomen.Around her, other pregnant women padded around the open, airy rooms of the Yukon-Kuskokwim prematernal home, chatting on phones or grabbing coffee from the pot. They mostly smiled and nodded at Ms. Yupanik as they passed, but otherwise seemed to pay her little mind. Going into labor, after all, is hardly remarkable in this place.But here on the far western end of the nation\u2019s biggest and most rural state, where roads are nearly nonexistent and populations are scattered across tiny villages, caregivers are trying to change the equation not by sending more doctors out, but by bringing more women in. At their first prenatal visits to the hospital, doctors assign a due date for the baby and a \u201cbe in Bethel\u201d date 30 days earlier, for a stay at the prematernal home, which the hospital operates nearby. An added stern warning makes most women comply: If they don\u2019t come, they might give birth without a doctor\u2019s care at all.The results of the effort go beyond medicine. Women staying in the maternal home \u2014 in Yupik, which most of the women speak, it\u2019s a \u201ckingalret witaviat,\u201d or \u201cpregnant women place\u201d \u2014 said they found a sense of bonding with other women they had never met and might never meet again. And so a kind of sorority unfolds day after day, birth after birth: women like Ms. Yupanik sharing the final month of the journey through discomfort, homesickness and joy, almost all of them a plane ride away from their families.Some women said the separation from loved ones was terrible, others said they saw the experiences as calming and peaceful, a respite from their hard-working lives at home. Experienced mothers come prepared to teach, young ones expecting to learn.\u201cI talk with them and explain what is to come, and what it feels like to be in labor,\u201d said Ms. Yupanik, 36, who was pregnant in early July with her sixth baby, describing the older-sister role she has taken on with first-time mothers.The numbers are even starker in the Yukon-Kuskokwim hospital\u2019s service area, where there are few jobs or industries. Medicaid covers more than 90 percent of prematernal home stays, and two-thirds of all births. The Trump administration has also proposed deep cuts to the federal Indian Health Service budget, which the hospital depends on to provide health care to 58 Native tribes in the region. About 5,000 women have stayed in the home since 2008.\u201cThere\u2019s deep concern,\u201d said Tiffany Zulkosky, a spokeswoman for the hospital.There are other prematernal waiting places in the Alaskan bush, where getting to a doctor can be arduous and expensive. But the one in Bethel \u2014 where about 40 babies are born a month and several dozen women are typically in residence at any given time \u2014 is one of the oldest and most storied.The roots trace back to 1967, when a pregnant woman made her way here for care but had no place to stay. She was found sleeping under a boat on the banks of the Kuskokwim River. The story so touched people in the community that they began informally putting up women for their final weeks of waiting \u2014 a function later taken over by the hospital. In the home\u2019s dining area, a painting of the woman and the boat commemorates the inspiration.Dr. Ellen Hodges, the chief of staff at Yukon-Kuskokwim, said that no major scientific study had been undertaken to measure health outcomes for babies and their mothers who stay at the home versus women who do not. But she said that in many instances, that would be hard to measure anyway, since many childbirth complications are being avoided that might have occurred in a home or village birth. What\u2019s abundantly clear, she said, is that women get pulled together by the experience.\u201cWhen women come to deliver at the hospital, often everyone at the prematernal home who is their friend also shows up,\u201d Dr. Hodges said. \u201cSo you\u2019ll have five or six pregnant ladies in the room cheering.\u201dElizabeth Phillip, 29, dates a new friend to each of her three previous pregnancies, and the time spent waiting here. The older friends, all from different villages, have continued to stay in touch through Facebook, email or phone. \u201cThis year, I met her,\u201d Ms. Phillip said, gesturing to friend No. 4, Micole Lomack, 28, who was eating lunch at Ms. Phillip\u2019s side.\u201cBoth our villages are on the river,\u201d said Ms. Lomack, who was expecting her second child. \u201cBut we might never have met.\u201dRelationships can also buffer homesickness only so much, and sometimes expectant mothers like Timatheen Ekamrak simply can\u2019t endure the separation. Ms. Ekamrak, 19, arrived in Bethel in June for her prematernal stay. But then, without telling anyone, she jumped on a boat heading back up the Kuskokwim River to her village. She went into labor while she was there, she said, and gave birth by the side of a road.\u201cI missed my family,\u201d said Ms. Ekamrak, a soft-spoken woman, who was back at the prematernal home in early July for a checkup with her newborn daughter.But it turns out, said Dr. Hodges, the chief of staff, that traditional infant care practices common in the villages \u2014 breast-feeding and nearly constant contact between baby and mother through the early weeks of life \u2014 are often the best medical responses to the problem. And so the hospital has been reinforcing those old ways in prematernal care and advice, too.Christy George, 25, who was awaiting her second baby in early July, said she was homesick for the foods that her family prepares in high summer as the salmon harvest and wild berry picking seasons hit their peaks through the long northern days.But she has made friends, she said, and the experience of being surrounded by women who can completely relate to what she is going through seems like something that could work far beyond Alaska.\u201cI think they should do this everywhere,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Contentious Memo Strikes Nerve Inside Google and Out", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After leaving Harvard\u2019s doctorate program in systems biology to join Google as a software engineer in 2013, James Damore joked on his Facebook page that he knew he had made the right move as he enjoyed a morning smoothie with oats. It was the type of workplace perk that is standard for Google employees.That initial assessment of Google seemed far removed from the contentious memo written by the 28-year-old Mr. Damore last week that has enraged advocates of greater diversity in the technology industry. The memo has also served as a rallying cry for conservatives and the alt-right who view Google \u2014 and Silicon Valley \u2014 as a bastion of groupthink where people with different opinions are shamed into silence.The memo was originally posted on an internal mailing list and was shared widely inside the company and throughout Silicon Valley. It struck a nerve and was harshly criticized inside a company and an entire industry struggling to explain why women are underrepresented in key engineering ranks and are often underpaid when compared with their male peers.In a short email exchange on Monday after his firing, Mr. Damore, who was a senior software engineer in Google\u2019s search division, said he had not expected this type of reaction when he shared his missive last week.\u201cAs far as I know, I have a legal right to express my concerns about the terms and conditions of my working environment and to bring up potentially illegal behavior, which is what my document does,\u201d he said. Mr. Damore said he would probably take legal action against the company.Like many new hires at Google, Mr. Damore boasted an impressive academic background. A competitive player of chess and computer strategy video games, he studied molecular and cellular biology at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, according to an online r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He conducted research in computational biology at Harvard, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before joining a Ph.D. program at Harvard. He dropped out before completing the program.In a footnote for his memo, Mr. Damore said he considered himself a \u201cclassical liberal,\u201d an ideology associated with advocacy of free market economics and libertarianism.\u201cDespite what the public response seems to have been, I\u2019ve gotten many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up those very important issues which they agree with but would never have the courage to say or defend because of our shaming culture and the possibility of getting fired,\u201d Mr. Damore wrote in an addendum to his original memo. \u201cThis needs to change.\u201dOthers outside the company came to Mr. Damore\u2019s defense. Eric Weinstein, a managing director at Thiel Capital, an investment firm run by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and supporter of President Trump, said Google was sending the wrong message to women.\u201cIt\u2019s insidious and it\u2019s all around the culture,\u201d Ms. Smith said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.The flap over Mr. Damore\u2019s criticism of Google\u2019s diversity efforts comes as the company has tangled with the Labor Department over its pay practices. The department has not charged Google with any wrongdoing, but a department official said there was evidence that the company systematically paid women less than men. Google denies this is the case.Mr. Damore\u2019s comments also raised another issue around Google\u2019s peer-review system. Employees at the company are expected to judge their colleague\u2019s work in a peer-review process that is essential to deciding whether someone gets promoted. By expressing certain beliefs \u2014 such as that women are more prone to anxiety \u2014 the concern was that he could no longer be impartial in judging female co-workers.For a company steeped in a rich history of encouraging unconventional thinking, the problem was not that he expressed an unpopular opinion, but a disrespectful one, according to Yonatan Zunger, who left Google last week after 14 years at the company to join a start-up.\u201cWe have a long history of disagreement over everything from technical issues to policy issues to the most mundane aspects of building management, and over all, that has been tremendously valuable,\u201d Mr. Zunger said in an email. \u201cThe problem here was that this was disrespectful disagreement \u2014 and there\u2019s really no respectful way to say, \u2018I think you and people like you aren\u2019t as qualified to do your job as people like me.\u201dWesley Chan, a venture capitalist at Felicis Ventures and an early Google employee who left the company in 2014, said Google had no choice but to fire Mr. Damore.\u201cIt\u2019s not about free discourse,\u201d said Mr. Chan. \u201cIt\u2019s about advancing a fringe viewpoint which is hurtful to a large population of the company.\u201dThe legal argument for Mr. Damore\u2019s dismissal is more complicated. On one hand, there may be a way to argue that the memo and its recommendations \u2014 such as \u201cstop alienating conservatives\u201d \u2014 constitute a \u201cconcerted activity\u201d to aid and protect his fellow workers, which may be protected under federal labor law. However, Google can argue that his memo created a hostile workplace for women.\u201cThere\u2019s no free speech in the private sector workplace,\u201d said Katherine Stone, a labor and employment law professor at University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cClearly, the company was concerned that he was making the environment difficult for people to do their jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The House bill would prevent school districts and county or local governments from adopting or enforcing nondiscrimination ordinances that would allow transgender people to use bathrooms of their choice. The ordinance override provision is also an element in the Senate bill.Although law enforcement, religious groups and transgender advocates have all been part of the opposing coalition, big business has been a dominant force throughout the debate.\u201cCorporate America is stepping forward, speaking loudly about the fact that this will have a chilling effect on business opportunity in this state,\u201d said State Representative Byron Cook, a Republican and the chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, who has thus far refused to call a hearing on the bill. \u201cI\u2019m hearing from many major corporations about this bill and the effect it will have.\u201dCorporations active in Texas that have opposed the measure include IBM, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Intel, Capital One, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Facebook, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.The association is the most powerful business lobby in the state, representing companies with more than two million employees and $8 billion in business. The group\u2019s president, Chris Wallace, said the association moved quickly to form a coalition, Keep Texas Open for Business, against legislation when it became apparent that the bathroom battle was heading to Texas.\u201cWe do not want to do anything to tarnish Texas\u2019 brand,\u201d he said.The strategy has included a seven-figure radio ad buy, strategically targeted letters signed by prominent chief executives, lobbying blitzes throughout the Capitol and rallies on the Capitol grounds.Several dozen women, predominately business owners and executives, many accompanied by their children, gathered on the south steps of the state Capitol on Tuesday as 15 speakers attacked the legislation as the work of \u201cextremist\u201d politicians that will blunt the economy and foster discrimination and hate crimes.\u201cI don\u2019t want my child to be a statistic of the 2017 special session,\u201d said Kimberly Shappley, a registered nurse and ordained minister from the Houston suburbs who was accompanied by her 6-year-old transgender daughter, Kai.Mr. Patrick and other supporters of the legislation say the projections in Texas and the impact in North Carolina have been vastly exaggerated.Business\u2019s involvement has increasingly become a target for proponents as they accelerate their efforts in the remaining days of the session.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has seen corporations engage on an issue like this outside the framework of taxes and regulations in our memory,\u201d said Dave Welch of the Texas Pastor Council, which is a leading supporter of the legislation. \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of a rising moral bankruptcy in corporate America, in which the only thing they support is their image and their bottom line.\u201dIf the session goes all 30 days \u2014 and it could end earlier \u2014 lawmakers would adjourn on Aug 16. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, has given no hints on whether he would call another session, although he has been particularly insistent that lawmakers give Texans new safeguards against rising property taxes.As for the bathroom legislation, the governor told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper on Friday that it was \u201cway premature\u201d to conclude that the House bill wouldn\u2019t come up for a vote.The intensity of the debate has raised questions about the future relationship between business groups and the state\u2019s Republican leadership, which have shared a decades-long bond. Mr. Wallace, president of the Texas business association, said the bond would remain unbroken despite the differences in the current showdown.\u201cNinety-plus percent of the time we are in agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just happen to disagree on this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Dionne Searcey, The Times\u2019s West Africa bureau chief based in Dakar, Senegal, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.What does the technology landscape looks like in West Africa? How is internet connectivity? Do people use Facebook and Google?Even just a few years ago, reporters needed to carry a BGAN, a portable satellite modem the size of a hardcover novel. I rarely take one. When I arrive in a new city, I always buy a SIM card with a data plan. But pretty much any cafe or restaurant will hand you a Wi-Fi password if you ask for it, and even small hotels in out-of-the-way places seem to manage to rig some kind of Wi-Fi system. One hotel in Maradi, Niger, about 400 miles outside the capital, had routers taped to the ceiling all over the hallways.And, yes, people are huge users of social media like Facebook and to some extent Instagram. Nigerians in particular are very active on Twitter. Besides business people, many others do not have a laptop. In urban areas, a lot of people have smartphones, especially young people, and if they don\u2019t have one, they desperately want one.What kind of role does tech play in many of these developing African countries?A lot of people in more-rural areas cannot afford TVs, and even if they can, in many areas electricity is highly unreliable, so mobile phones are a major source of news.Phone credit is expensive and calls across providers cost extra. Some people have created an ingenious system called \u201cflashing\u201d \u2014 they call you and hang up so you dial them back and pick up the tab. I thought I was getting prank calls before I caught on.Mobile money \u2014 using a mobile phone to transfer payments \u2014 is also mainstream in many places and is a lifesaver for people who don\u2019t have the option of bank transfers.What tech is most important for you to do your job there?Internet connectivity, by whatever means possible. Phone networks are often so bad that I make most of my calls using WhatsApp. People are really into it, so sources are more inclined to respond to messages on that platform than emails or regular phone calls. Business people and aid workers like Skype.How do you overcome connectivity issues?Both cell and internet networks can be elusive, but they work well enough that when they don\u2019t, I\u2019m emotionally crushed or, more often, maddeningly annoyed.I usually can\u2019t stream video or download big files anywhere but in major cities, and even that is a challenge sometimes. The networks get really crowded, especially at night. WhatsApp and Skype calls are wonderful and clear but cut out a lot. Just dialing phone numbers sometimes takes five or six tries to get a clear line. It\u2019s frustrating explaining to colleagues in New York that if they can\u2019t reach me on the first try, just keep dialing and eventually they\u2019ll get through.What role does tech play in combating issues like police abuse or corruption?Beyond your job, what tech product do you love using in your daily life?My kids \u2014 a middle schooler and two elementary-aged kids \u2014 like to post regular kid stuff to their private accounts, like photos of their friends and the occasional oversize snail or colorful lizard. It\u2019s fun to see how these Brooklyn kids are viewing their life here through their own eyes.We also created an account for the Senegalese street cat we adopted that when awake is vicious, but likes to sleep in absurd poses on his back.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Jobs Fair Sends Clear Message: Now Hiring Thousands", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROMEOVILLE, Ill. \u2014 Brandon Williams arrived at an Amazon fulfillment center here, about an hour outside of Chicago, around 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, one of thousands across the country who turned up for the company\u2019s first Jobs Day. While he appeared to wilt slightly during the five hours he waited before an M.C. summoned him for a tour, his enthusiasm did not wane.\u201cWhat\u2019s not great about a company that keeps building?\u201d he said, seated in a huge tent the company erected in the parking lot as a kind of makeshift waiting room.The event was a vivid illustration of the ascendance of Amazon, the online retail company that, to a far greater extent than others in the tech industry, has a seemingly insatiable need for human labor to fuel its explosive growth.Like other tech giants, Amazon is recruiting thousands of people with engineering and business degrees for high-paying jobs. But the vast majority of Amazon\u2019s hiring is for what the company calls its \u201cfulfillment network\u201d \u2014 the armies of people who pick and pack orders in warehouses and unload and drive delivery trucks, and who take home considerably smaller incomes.The event on Wednesday, held at a dozen locations including Romeoville, Ill., was intended to help fill 50,000 of those lower-paying positions, 40,000 of them full-time jobs.Those high-low distinctions did not seem to bother the attendees of the jobs fair, many of them united in the conviction that Amazon represented untapped opportunity \u2014 that a foot in the door could lead to a career of better-compensated, more satisfying work, whether in fulfillment, I.T., marketing or even fashion.Mr. Williams, a military veteran studying computer network security at a nearby community college, said he hoped to eventually work his way up to an I.T. job with Amazon. But even those whose ambitions were more in line with the vast majority of available jobs could not hide their excitement.Victor Salgado, who makes $9 per hour with no benefits doing maintenance at an aerosol company and spent three years before that grouting floors, said he was attracted by the promise of an upgrade in pay and benefits. He said he would be willing to \u201cdo anything\u201d at Amazon.\u201cA record-breaking 20,000 applications were received on this day alone,\u201d said John Olsen, an Amazon human resources vice president, \u201cwith thousands of job offers extended to candidates and more to come in the next few days.\u201dAmazon has said its wages and benefits are attractive. Five years ago, it introduced a program called Career Choice that pays tuition costs for employees seeking training to join higher-paid professions, like airline mechanics, medical lab workers and computer-aided design technicians.Jack Chasteen, who recently finished high school and is still living at home, said he had been planning to seek a job as a pizza deliveryman but that his parents urged him to turn up at Jobs Day instead.\u201cThey said it would be a good building block for stuff in the future,\u201d he said, citing Amazon\u2019s tuition assistance program, which he hoped might help him pursue a nursing degree.Arun Sundararajan, a professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Amazon\u2019s employment needs are unique among tech companies.\u201cTheir business has always been a meld of the digital and physical,\u201d he said. \u201cRetail is very different from digital products or music or social networking. The other tech platforms are, at their core, selling tech products.\u201dBut there are questions about how long Amazon\u2019s fulfillment jobs will exist, as robots and other forms of automation become more capable at doing the jobs that now require humans.Amazon is more aggressively using robots to help make the operations inside its warehouses more efficient. For now, the company said machines are not replacing people. Instead, they mostly move large shelves of merchandise to stations where orders are manually picked.When those technologies are perfected, the employment picture inside Amazon\u2019s warehouses could look very different. That day could be a decade or more away, though.\u201cWhile the digital disruption is destroying the traditional retail business model,\u201d Dr. Sundararajan said, \u201cthe Amazon model that replaces it will continue to live in the physical world and require human labor for the foreseeable future.\u201dAs for Mr. Williams, he later sent a text message to say that he was not hired on the spot on Wednesday, a possibility that Amazon had dangled before workers. On the plus side: he was told there was still a chance to get a job at the center through a temporary staffing company.An article on Thursday about Amazon\u2019s Job Fair misstated the hourly pay that one of the event\u2019s attendees, Victor Salgado, makes at an aerosol company. It is $9 per hour, not $10.75.Noam Scheiber reported from Romeoville, Ill., and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Virtue Signaling\u2019 Isn\u2019t the Problem. Not Believing One Another Is.", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsWe all want to be good. But often, what we want more is for others to know just how good we are. We have long been warned about the dangers of flaunting our own moral superiority this way: In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus instructs his followers not to be like the \u2018\u2018hypocrites\u2019\u2019 who \u2018\u2018love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners that they may be seen by men.\u2019\u2019 Nearly 2,000 years later, the 19th-century Catholic saint John Vianney argued that the instinct to show off our goodness \u2014 our fasting, our donations to the poor and the church \u2014 would \u2018\u2018make hypocrites of us.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018If we desire a heavenly reward,\u2019\u2019 he wrote, \u2018\u2018then we must hide the good which God works in us as much as possible, for fear that the devil of pride may rob us of the merit of those good works.\u2019\u2019 And yet lately, many people believe that these admonitions have been forgotten \u2014 that we are living in a veritable golden age of hypocritical showboats advertising their own righteousness.The charge of virtue signaling, though, has metastasized well beyond this type of comical figure. Once you\u2019ve decided this \u2018\u2018cultural tic\u2019\u2019 has become universal on the left, almost any public utterance of concern becomes easy to write off as false \u2014 as mere performance. It applies when people express dismay that a robotics team made up of Afghan girls may be barred from entering the United States; when someone frets about the American poverty rate; when The Associated Press shares information about a deadly oil-tanker fire in Pakistan. Every one of these things has been described online as the unholy product of \u2018\u2018virtue signaling.\u2019\u2019The real problem, of course, isn\u2019t the signaling part: Everyone is signaling all the time, whether it\u2019s about social justice or their commitment to Second Amendment rights or their concerns about immigration law. Those who accuse others of virtue signaling seem angry about the supposed virtues themselves \u2014 angry that someone, anyone, appears to care about something they do not. Another Twitter user, defending Donald Trump after the infamous \u2018\u2018Access Hollywood\u2019\u2019 tape, wrote: \u2018\u2018Stop virtue signaling. It doesn\u2019t work. Are you saying you never talked dirty in a [private] conversation?\u2019\u2019 The logic here is not that Trump or his actions were morally correct, but that no one else is, either, and anyone who claims otherwise is lying.Those who cry \u2018\u2018virtue signaling,\u2019\u2019 though? At least, they claim, they\u2019re honest about it. They are, of course, trying to signal something about their own values: that they are pragmatic, appropriately cynical, in touch with the painful facts of everyday life. Virtue signaling can be a way of staking out a position in an argument \u2014 not just the high ground, but the highest ground. (You may be against racism, but I am more against racism than you.) But calling out virtue signaling is a useful position in itself.But it indicates a problem that goes well beyond our rhetoric. Americans are now more sheltered and siloed in our sources of news and information than ever before. We live in areas and send our children to schools more segregated by class and color than they have been in decades. We are less likely to know different kinds of people, people who might care about different issues than we do. At the same time, we\u2019ve grown dangerously inured to pious doublespeak \u2014 whether it\u2019s the politician claiming to stand for the family while engaging in multiple extramarital affairs or the corporation that combines feminist ads with hostile work environments. A result is that we simply don\u2019t believe one another anymore. We do not believe that our Facebook friends really care about terror attacks in foreign countries, or that celebrities really care about climate change, or that Nancy Pelosi actually prays for Donald Trump and his family. Even our most exalted moral leaders aren\u2019t safe. Last year, Pope Francis pointedly opined that \u2018\u2018A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian.\u2019\u2019 Someone recently shot back online: \u2018\u2018Oh please Pope. Stuff your self righteous indignation and tear down that wall around the Vatican before you start your virtue signaling.\u2019\u2019The cynicism we\u2019ve felt about public figures for decades has trickled down to apply to our friends and neighbors as well. We imagine that people who take stands on behalf of those less fortunate than themselves are all a bit like those hypocrites in Matthew, standing on the street corners of the internet, telling us to stop buying conventionally grown potatoes and start using racially sensitive terminology before themselves going home, eating McDonald\u2019s french fries and swearing at the television. Our personal and political isolation has rendered us suspicious and blind to the fears and concerns and cares of others.But of course many people do care, about all sorts of things that you or I might disagree with. People on low-lying islands in the Pacific care about climate change. Members of the armed forces care about military spending. Transgender people care about their ability to access public facilities, gay people care about whether they can adopt children and evangelical Christians care about their ability to live out their faith in the workplace. These people have families and friends, and next-door neighbors and dog walkers, who most likely care, too. This caring is not a crime; it is an argument, about what people should value in the first place. And accusations of \u2018\u2018virtue signaling\u2019\u2019 are, more than anything, a way of walking out on that argument and dismissing it altogether \u2014 a quick and easy solution for those moments when engaging and listening, agreeing or disagreeing, seem too hard, too challenging, too personal, too dangerous.Jane Coaston is a writer and journalist based in Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Troll in Staten Island Politics", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkNo, no, no, says Richard A. Luthmann, a lawyer who practices politics on Staten Island with a blunt-edged hatchet.It is not trolling, Mr. Luthmann said, to set up phony Facebook pages to embarrass candidates \u2014 such as one in which a Republican Assembly candidate in a conservative district calls for more housing projects, or another, in which a liberal Democrat City Council member \u201cwelcomes\u201d a welfare hotel for drug addicts and criminals.While Mr. Luthmann neither denies nor admits creating the pages, he insists that there would be absolutely nothing unusual if he had.\u201cIt\u2019s what is called a dirty trick,\u201d Mr. Luthmann said, who misappropriated a term from Plato to deem Facebook spoofing a form of \u201cnoble lie.\u201dWere candidates he was aligned with glad to have him doing the dirty work?In private Facebook Messenger exchanges obtained by NY1, Mr. Luthmann wrote to Ron Castorina Jr., a Republican member of the Assembly, when they learned of a challenge from another Republican, Janine Materna, in the September 2016 primary.\u201cTime for a fake Janine Materna site,\u201d Mr. Luthmann wrote, according to the report. \u201cIs there a picture of her with Hillary?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for one,\u201d Mr. Castorina replied.Soon enough, a doctored photograph of Ms. Materna and Mrs. Clinton appeared on a Facebook page that, at first glance, looked as if it were Ms. Materna\u2019s, but it included a subtle clue that it wasn\u2019t authentic in the form of a slogan that, if abbreviated, would spell out a vile word to describe a woman.In another exchange, Mr. Luthmann sent Mr. Castorina images of Ms. Materna with Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, adding, \u201cIn a news feed near you very soon.\u201dMr. Castorina replied: \u201cGood.

He acknowledged having the exchanges with Mr. Luthmann, but said he did not intend to encourage the creation of the false pages.\u201cAny conversations I had with Mr. Luthmann were merely to placate him and to kind of move the conversation along,\u201d Mr. Castorina said. \u201cMr. Luthmann is a very eccentric individual. I\u2019m not going to say anything bad about him.\u201dThe campaign had been exceptionally nasty, Mr. Castorina said, and he said he \u201cdespises\u201d his former opponent for what he believed were dirty tricks by her side.\u201cI\u2019m certainly not the first elected official to say crude or nasty things about my opponent during a very vicious campaign cycle,\u201d Mr. Castorina said. \u201cIt just so happens that my commentary in the course of a private conversation was hacked.\u201dHe added, \u201cI think what has been lost here in many respects is that Mr. Luthmann is the victim of a crime.\u201dMs. Materna said she sought to upend an old-boys club in Staten Island politics by running against Mr. Castorina, who took office in a special election, and then defeated her in the primary. \u201cThey stole my identity, stole pictures from my real Facebook page, and they misrepresented my views,\u201d Ms. Materna said on Thursday. \u201cVoters saw that and people said, \u2018Oh my God, she wants homeless shelters next to a million dollar home.\u2019\u201dMr. Castorina scoffed at the idea that the Facebook page had been decisive in the election. \u201cI won this race by 40 points,\u201d he said.While Mr. Luthmann also cited the big margin of victory, he did say fake pages were useful. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t effective, it wouldn\u2019t be a practice that is engaged in on the national and local level,\u201d Mr. Luthmann said. He put them in a category of political satire protected by the First Amendment, no different than Alec Baldwin\u2019s impersonations of Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live.Records show that Mr. Luthmann was paid $1,650 for petitioning expenses by the campaign of Kamillah Hanks, who is trying to replace Deborah Rose in the City Council.

She presents the best documentary award at the Academy Awards to a film about land mines in Cambodia and Laos, and harmlessly flirts with a star-struck movie star at the Vanity Fair after-party.When in Los Angeles, she stays at the Hotel Bel-Air. But mostly she lives with Teddy Forstmann at his Fifth Avenue apartment and Southampton estate. She has a diamond engagement ring (a tasteful nine carats), and the $100 million prenup is signed, sealed and delivered. Diana is ours, again, if only for 208 pages.Diana was famous before the internet, famous before millions of iPhones began to capture every sneeze of every celebrity pushing her cart in a Whole Foods parking lot. To observe her, the public relied on paparazzi, magazines and newspapers of varying quality, and television. Biographers, including the longtime editor Tina Brown, have documented how Diana tried to shape all this coverage by making herself selectively available and self-revelatory.\u201cShe was the first global celebrity because she was authentic,\u201d said Hilary Black, the editor of National Geographic\u2019s new book \u201cRemembering Diana: a Life in Photographs\u201d (whose foreword was written by Ms. Brown). \u201cOnce she realized she could master the media, she took a feminist stance and told her story the way she wanted to tell it.\u201dBack in her day, that sometimes was called manipulating the press. Today it\u2019s called branding.Ms. Sittenfeld is getting more practice at considering the conjoining of fact and fiction, ego and alter. Last year, Esquire commissioned her to write a short story from the voice and perspective of Hillary Clinton. In it, a fictional Mrs. Clinton reflects on her relationship with a fictional journalist who has covered her for years, at The San Francisco Chronicle, The Washington Post and finally The New York Times.\u201cI expect to be burned by the journalist,\u201d the Clinton character tells the reader. \u201cNo matter how friendly our encounter, how personal, even, I will at best be irritated by what she writes.\u201dOnce Ms. Sittenfeld got Hillary in her head, she couldn\u2019t easily dispense with her. Now she is at work on a novel that will portray the life of Hillary Rodham after she decides to reject Bill Clinton\u2019s final proposal of marriage.Ms. Sittenfeld said she would not be interested in writing a novel that imagined that Mrs. Clinton was elected the 45th president of the United States. Despite the amount of press coverage devoted to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s career, Ms. Sittenfeld believes, what most Americans know about her relates to her marriage. Wiping that slate clear is what she finds compelling as a novelist. (She asked her social media audience to suggest titles for this book.

{"Headline": "Racial Violence on the Screen", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the thick of \u201cDetroit,\u201d a new film by Kathryn Bigelow about the uprising in that city \u2014 my native city \u2014 50 years ago, a white cop kills a black man. His partner then asks a witness, a black man, what he saw. The witness says he saw nothing. The partner puts the same question to another witness, a black teen, who refuses to play along.\u201cYou killed him,\u201d the teen responds.\u201cI don\u2019t see anything,\u201d the cop says.\u201cIt\u2019s a dead guy right there,\u201d the black teen angrily insists. Moments later the cop shoots and kills the defiant witness.The stakes are clear: There is a penalty for telling the truth about what we see of police brutality.There is a depressing similarity between the racial trauma that this film faithfully revisits and the painful events of today caught on cellphones and police dashcams. The cost is staggering for black people, who are told that what we see with our own eyes is not true \u2014 the vicious toll of being repeatedly disbelieved.Then a more vexing question arises: What will the country be unwilling or unable to see next?Take what has happened in recent months.In May, we learned that no federal charges would be filed against the two white officers responsible for the 2016 killing of Alton Sterling \u2014 a black man who, when he was shot by one of the officers, was already pinned to the ground. We saw it with our own eyes. A couple of weeks later, a jury in Oklahoma found a white female officer not guilty of a September 2016 shooting of an unarmed black man, an incident that was also recorded on camera.In June, a Minnesota jury acquitted the former policeman Jeronimo Yanez of all charges in the killing of the black motorist Philando Castile. That death had been captured on film twice \u2014 in a Facebook live stream, taken by his girlfriend, and in police dashcam footage.Last month, a white Australian, Justine Ruszczyk, was killed in Minnesota by a police officer. It\u2019s a tragedy, and impossible not to see through the lens of race; the outrage on behalf of the white victim and the suspicion cast on the officer, of Somali descent, was markedly different from past deaths at the hands of the police.Bias and distortion have also mangled the racial views of President Trump. What he seems to see is truly frightening. Last week in a speech to police officers in Long Island, Mr. Trump told them to be rougher with suspects. When cops put their hands over the heads of alleged assailants as they fit them into police cars, the president said, \u201cYou can take the hand away, O.K.?\u201dThe way the president sees black America is mirrored in the way many whites still see black folk: through a troubling lens of racial nostalgia. Such nostalgia can\u2019t be literally evoked, though it can be symbolically re-enacted.In recent months, the fearsome iconography of lynching visited our nation\u2019s capital: Three museums in Washington, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture, have had nooses left on or near their grounds.Black bodies in the early to mid-20th century often swung from trees, offering the strange fruit Billie Holiday sang about. The optics of lynching were rooted in both seeing, and not seeing, black life. White people photographed themselves at the lynchings and made postcards of the mayhem.White America is connected, whether it wishes to be or not, to a history that has shot and lynched black folk into silence. When visual evidence of police brutality circulates widely, it is a warning to black folk to keep in place.Black life now more than ever is the visible invisible. That\u2019s the sad effect of smartphone videos of police officers shooting black people without, it seems, ever really being held accountable.It is society saying \u201cI don\u2019t see anything,\u201d like that cop in Ms. Bigelow\u2019s film. I had the chance this summer to speak with her about the project. She said the racial violence she re-created \u2014 a history that doesn\u2019t feel too distant \u2014 was \u201ca way of honoring the tragedies of our time.\u201d Of the violence on screen, she said, \u201cThere\u2019s potentially a valuable empathy that can be gleaned from the story.\u201dAs a native Detroiter, I find the film rings true and haunts me. It aggressively captures the catastrophe that seared the city that, for decades, had been engulfed in racial misery. Some have accused the film of being torture porn or questioned whether it was Ms. Bigelow\u2019s story to tell, since she is white.Yet she has done what we black folk often demand white folk do: Take responsibility for your actions and a legacy of hate that is often silently transmitted.In that way the film is more than catharsis; it attempts to show what happened, with the hope that it won\u2019t be ignored. Our country must reckon with this history, our history, before we are all history.Michael Eric Dyson is the author of \u201cTears We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Accounting Tack That Makes PayPal\u2019s Numbers Look So Good", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameExceeding analysts\u2019 estimates \u2014 \u201cbeating the number,\u201d in Wall Street parlance \u2014 is crucial for any corporate leader interested in keeping his or her stock price aloft. Even the smallest earnings miss can send shares tumbling.Examining how a company meets or beats analysts\u2019 estimates, therefore, can be illuminating.PayPal\u2019s stock has been on a tear this year, up almost 50 percent since January. At a recent $59, its shares are trading at over 40 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates. It is clearly an investor darling, providing all the more reason to dig into its numbers.Naturally, many factors contributed to PayPal\u2019s second-quarter earnings. But one element stands out: the amount the company dispensed to employees in the form of stock-based compensation.How could stock-based compensation \u2014 which is a company expense, after all \u2014 have helped PayPal\u2019s performance in the quarter? Simple. The company does not consider stock awards a cost when calculating its favored earnings measure. So when PayPal doles out more stock compensation than it has done historically, all else being equal, its chosen non-GAAP income growth looks better.Accounting rules have required companies to include stock-based compensation as a cost of doing business for years. That\u2019s as it should be: Stock awards have value, after all, or employees wouldn\u2019t accept them as pay. And that value should be run through a company\u2019s financial statements as an expense.Consider the practice at Facebook, a company PayPal identifies as a peer. In its most recent quarterly income statement, Facebook broke out the roughly $1 billion in costs associated with share-based compensation that it deducted from its $9.3 billion in revenues.Back in the 1990s, technology companies argued strenuously against having to run stock compensation costs through their profit-and-loss statements. Who can blame them for wanting to make an expense disappear?They lost that battle with the accounting rule makers. But then they took a new tack: Technology companies began providing alternative earnings calculations without such costs alongside results that were accounted for under GAAP, essentially offering two sets of numbers every quarter. The non-GAAP statements \u2014 called pro forma numbers or adjusted results \u2014 often exclude expenses like stock awards and acquisition costs. And the equity analysts who hold such sway on Wall Street seem to be fine with them.As long as companies also showed their results under generally accepted accounting rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission let them present their favored alternative accounting.PayPal is by no means the only company that adds back the costs of stock-based compensation to its unconventional earnings calculations. Many technology companies do, contending, as PayPal does, that their own arithmetic \u201cprovides investors a consistent basis for assessing the company\u2019s performance and helps to facilitate comparisons across different periods.\u201dStill, some technology leaders are dumping the practice. In addition to Facebook, Alphabet said this year that it would no longer present results that excluded the costs of stock-based compensation.Dave Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, told investors on a May conference call that the company would report results that include share-based compensation because it\u2019s a true cost of running the business.PayPal takes the opposite approach. And look at what it does to its results.Under generally accepted accounting principles, PayPal reported operating income of $430 million in the second quarter of 2017. That was up almost 16 percent from the $371 million it produced in the same period last year.But under PayPal\u2019s alternative accounting, its non-GAAP operating income was $659 million in the June quarter, an increase of almost 25 percent from 2016.So what\u2019s to account for the added $230 million in operating income under PayPal\u2019s preferred calculation? Most of it \u2014 $192 million \u2014 was stock-based compensation PayPal dispensed to employees in the June quarter and added back to its results as calculated under GAAP.That was a big jump \u2014 57 percent \u2014 from the $122 million PayPal handed out during the second quarter of 2016. And back in 2015, PayPal reported just $89 million in stock awards.I asked PayPal why it has been ratcheting up its stock-based compensation. Amanda Miller, a PayPal spokeswoman, declined to discuss why the company was raising its stock-based pay, and the role the increase played in the company\u2019s recent results. She provided this statement: \u201cWe pay for performance and align our compensation with how shareholders are rewarded. We believe our treatment of stock-based compensation is broadly consistent with our peer group.\u201dBut this isn\u2019t accurate, according to the companies PayPal lists as peers in its proxy filing. At least four of those companies \u2014 Alphabet, Facebook, Mastercard and Visa \u2014 do not exclude stock-based compensation from their earnings calculations as PayPal does.In a telephone interview, Mr. Maurer was critical of how the company accounts for stock-based pay. He said that as a percentage of PayPal\u2019s non-GAAP operating income, stock-based compensation has risen to 29 percent this year from 17 percent in 2015.\u201cThey are literally taking a cost out of their income statement, moving it to a different line and backing it out of results,\u201d Mr. Maurer said in an interview. \u201cAnd you can see that it\u2019s adding significantly to their ability to meet earnings expectations. If you backed out the difference between what we were expecting on stock-based comp in the quarter versus what they reported, it was 2 cents of earnings.\u201dIn other words, the increase in stock-based compensation made a big contribution to PayPal\u2019s results versus what analysts had been expecting.PayPal\u2019s stock-based compensation practices have another noteworthy effect: They drive executive pay higher at the company. Here\u2019s how.The company says it has three main metrics for calculating its managers\u2019 performance pay each year. One of those measures, its proxy shows, is non-GAAP net income. So, as PayPal awards more and more stock to its executives and employees, non-GAAP net income shows better growth. And the greater that growth, the more incentive pay the company awards to its top executives.For PayPal insiders, at least, that\u2019s one virtuous circle.Twitter: @gmorgensonAdvertisement"}

Sometimes they even risk their lives.Supported byJones worked side by side with Jessica Ornelas, the \u2018\u2018second bucker,\u2019\u2019 who collected whatever wood Jones cut down. Together they were responsible for \u2018\u2018setting the line,\u2019\u2019 which meant clearing potential fuel from a six-foot-wide stretch of ground between whatever was burning and the land they were trying to protect. If they did their job right, a fire might be contained. But any number of things could quickly go wrong \u2014 a slight wind shift, the fall of a burning tree \u2014 and the fire would jump the break.\u2018\u2018This is what I get for wishing for live flames,\u2019\u2019 Jones said to Ornelas on the truck ride.It was just after 3 a.m. on Feb. 25, 2016, when Malibu 13-3, the 12-woman crew Jones belonged to, arrived at the Mulholland fire, ahead of any aerial support or local fire trucks. The inmates \u2014 including men, roughly 4,000 prisoners fight wildfires alongside civilian firefighters throughout California \u2014 immediately went to work. They operated in hookline formation, moving in order of rank, which was determined by task and ability. Fire captains divide the line into the cutting section and the scraping section. The first saw, or hook, leads; second saw is next. The Pulaskis, nicknamed for their tool, a type of shovel, follow. The McLeods, also named for their hand tool, rake the scorched remains. Mulholland was Jones\u2019s first fire as second saw; she was promoted the previous week. It took only four months for captains to notice her after she began training, and she quickly rose from the back of the hookline, where all inmates start, to the front.This part of Southern California, inland from the Pacific Coast Highway, is full of ravines and dry brush. Season after season, its protected lands are prone to landslides, flash floods and wildfires. The women scrambled over a slope that was full of loose soil and rocks, which made digging the containment line \u2014 a trench of sorts \u2014 even more challenging. \u2018\u2018It was very steep,\u2019\u2019 Tyquesha Brown, a member of the crew who was there, told me. \u2018\u2018The fire was jumping.\u2019\u2019 As the crew moved toward the flames, tools in hand, the firefighters kept a distance of 10 feet between each other and called out conditions.Ornelas could tell that Jones was struggling with the weight of her chain saw as they hiked up the slope. \u2018\u2018I was pushing her, she was sliding down,\u2019\u2019 Ornelas says. \u2018\u2018It was just too heavy for her. She wasn\u2019t used to the weight.\u2019\u2019 With every step they took forward, it felt as if they were slipping at least one step back. But by 7:30 a.m., a little more than a third of the fire was considered contained. Crew 13-3 had done its job: the fire didn\u2019t jump the line; it didn\u2019t threaten homes or ranches or coastal properties.By 10 the next morning, Jones was dead. She was 22. Her three-year sentence had less than two months to go.Inmate labor in California goes back to the mid-19th century and the earliest official state prison, located on the Waban, a 268-ton ship. In 1852, its prisoners slept on deck at night and spent their days building San Quentin, the state\u2019s first permanent prison. By 1923, California\u2019s road crews, made up of inmates who worked on highway construction, were receiving wages, albeit low wages, for their labor. During World War II, California turned its prisons into factories for the military industry and moved inmates into the temporary forestry camps of the Civilian Conservation Corps, a public work-relief program created during the Depression. They built roads, harvested crops and repaired infrastructure. In 1946, as part of Gov. Earl Warren\u2019s Prisoner Rehabilitation Act, the state opened Camp Rainbow which \u2014 under the joint supervision of the state\u2019s Division of Forestry and the California Department of Corrections (later renamed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger) \u2014 housed inmates to clear fire lines. This setup was so cost-effective that by 1959 Gov. Edmund G. Brown promised to double the size of the Conservation Camp Program. It now partners with Cal Fire and the Los Angeles County Fire Department. \u2018\u2018Any fire you go on statewide, whether it be small or large, the inmate hand crews make up anywhere from 50 to 80 percent of the total fire personnel,\u2019\u2019 says Lt. Keith Radey, the commander who is in charge of a camp where women train.When they work, California\u2019s inmates typically earn between 8 cents and 95 cents an hour. They make office furniture for state employees, state license plates, prison uniforms, anything that any state institution might use. But wages in the forestry program, while still wildly low by outside standards, are significantly better than the rest. At Malibu 13, one of three conservation camps that house women, the commander, John Scott, showed me a printout: Inmate firefighters can make a maximum of $2.56 a day in camp and $1 an hour when they\u2019re fighting fires.Those higher wages recognize the real dangers that inmate firefighters face. In May, one man was crushed by a falling tree in Humboldt County; in July, another firefighter died within a week after accidentally cutting his leg and femoral artery on a chain saw. But, after visiting three camps over a year and a half, I could see why inmates would accept the risks. Compared with life among the general prison population, the conservation camps are bastions of civility. They are less violent and offer more space. They smell of eucalyptus, the ocean, fresh blooms. They provide barbecue areas for families who visit; one camp has a small cabin where relatives can stay with an inmate for up to three days. They have woodworking areas, softball fields and libraries full of donated mysteries and romance novels. \u2018\u2018I always up-talk the program,\u2019\u2019 an inmate named Amber Sapp told me. She noted how the quality of time served is so much better than that in most correctional facilities. \u2018\u2018You see it on the women\u2019s faces, on the staff\u2019s faces.\u2019\u2019Still, when they\u2019re at work, the inmates look like chain gangs without the chains, especially when out working in Malibu, where the average annual household income is $238,000. \u2018\u2018The pay is ridiculous,\u2019\u2019 La\u2019Sonya Edwards, 35, told me during a break from clearing a fire road. \u2018\u2018There are some days we are worn down to the core,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And this isn\u2019t that different from slave conditions. We need to get paid more for what we do.\u2019\u2019 Edwards makes about $500 a year in camp, plus whatever she earns while on the fire line, which might add up to a few hundred dollars in a month; the pay for a full-time civilian firefighter starts at about $40,000. In 1999, in a study funded by the Open Society Institute, five prominent economists argued for basic worker rights, including minimum wages, for inmates. Those standards have not been widely embraced, however. David Fathi, the director of the A.C.L.U. National Prison Project, who opposes all forms of prison labor, told me, \u2018\u2018I think one important question to ask is, if these people are safe to be out and about and carrying axes and chain saws, maybe they didn\u2019t need to be in prison in the first place.\u2019\u2019C.D.C.R. says that the firefighter program is intended to serve as rehabilitation for the inmates. Yet they\u2019re being trained to work in a field they will probably have trouble finding a job in when they get out: Los Angeles County Fire won\u2019t hire felons and C.D.C.R. doesn\u2019t offer any formal help to inmates who want firefighting jobs when they\u2019re released.This institutional disinterest makes more sense when inmate firefighters, who are on-call continuously, are considered as a state resource. The Conservation Camp Program saves California taxpayers approximately $100 million a year, according to C.D.C.R. Several states, including Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming and Georgia employ prisoners to fight fires, but none of them rely as heavily on its inmate population as California does. In the fall of 2014, as the state\u2019s courts were taking up the issue of overcrowded prisons, the office of California\u2019s attorney general argued against shrinking the number of inmates. Doing so, it claimed, \u2018\u2018would severely impact fire camp participation, a dangerous outcome while California is in the middle of a difficult fire season and severe drought.\u2019\u2019 In 2015, Gov. Jerry Brown told a local CBS affiliate, \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very important when we can quantify that manpower, utilize it.\u2019\u2019After five years, that drought is over, thanks to a much-needed rainy season earlier this year that produced the rare \u2018\u2018super bloom\u2019\u2019 \u2014 vast, thick patches of orange, magenta and purple blossoms among the lime-green grasses. And yet experts still worry about this year in particular: The last time a drought ended, in 2010, the following fire season was even more extreme than the previous one. Rain caused more grass to grow in places it ordinarily wouldn\u2019t, and when summer temperatures regularly top 100 degrees, that grass dries out and becomes kindling. In addition, an estimated 102 million trees in California have been killed by the bark beetle since 2010; the insect, which is the size of a rice grain, has been attacking pines, oaks and cedars, leaving behind dry wood husks and a heightened risk of large, severe wildfires. The 2010 fire season was bad; this season could be catastrophic. A total of more than 5,000 fires have burned 460,000 acres already. Faced with the prospect of a state in flames, California continues to depend on its inmate firefighters as a tenuous and all-but-invisible line of defense.She recalled her first fire last year, going into Napa Valley as residents were evacuating. The town was burned over; cars were blackened. She wondered what she had got herself into. Despite her fear and strained nerves, she cut the containment line for 10 hours, almost until dawn. The heavy labor and the danger create a bond among the crew members. \u2018\u2018I can say, coming from the streets, when you\u2019re with your fire crew, that\u2019s your family,\u2019\u2019 Edwards said. Of the 30 or so women I met, most were serving prison terms because of drug- or alcohol-related crimes, nonviolent convictions that the state classifies as low-level. All had been drawn to the forestry camps by the relative freedom and the chance to make more money than they could doing other prison jobs. But many said the real education they were getting had to do with making and maintaining relationships. \u2018\u2018It helps you to work as a sister crew,\u2019\u2019 Marquet said. \u2018\u2018You learn how to work with them, you know \u2014 \u2019cause, really all you have is each other when you\u2019re on a fire.\u2019\u2019Some inmates say they would work the fireline for free \u2014 for the experience, the training, the gratification of doing something useful. \u2018\u2018It feels good,\u2019\u2019 Marquet said, \u2018\u2018when you see kids with signs saying, \u2018Thank you for saving my house, thank you for saving my dog.\u2019 It feels good that you saved somebody\u2019s home, you know? Some people, they look down on us because we\u2019re inmates.\u2019\u2019Marquet, who is 27, already had two strikes against her when she was arrested. \u2018\u2018I was just under the influence on meth and just felt like doing something. When you\u2019re under that drug, you really just go with the flow. You feel like you\u2019re invincible. Can\u2019t no one stop you \u2014 you\u2019re just the king or the queen of the world. I got under the influence and started walking down the street, saw a house with the window open and decided to go in. Through the window.\u2019\u2019 Now, her young boys \u2014 Bernard and Unique, both under 10 \u2014 live with her older sister. They haven\u2019t been able to visit, but Marquet goes to evening prayer meetings in one of the common spaces at Rainbow. \u2018\u2018I go Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018And I\u2019m starting to go Friday, too. But it\u2019s not really church. It\u2019s \u2018Moms in Prayer.\u2019 We pray for our kids.\u2019\u2019There are three all-female camps: the one at Rainbow, between San Diego and Los Angeles, also known as Conservation Camp No.\u20092; the one at Malibu, or Conservation Camp No.\u200913; and one at Puerta la Cruz, just east of Temecula, called Conservation Camp No.\u200914. Their grounds could pass for spiritual retreats. They are places of calm as much as training grounds; one inmate incarcerated in Malibu, for example, leads yoga and meditation sessions. Vegetable gardens are tended by inmates after work hours; there are the remnants of a boxing camp that complement the weight-lifting facility. Malibu is kissed with salt air and shade; Rainbow and Port are hiking paradises. All the inmates eat civilian food cooked by other inmates: rib-eye steak and lobster and sometimes all-you-can-eat shrimp. But the benefits of greater freedom and superior food also come with a physical cost. \u2018\u2018Your feet are hot and tired, and they have a pulse of their own,\u2019\u2019 Marquet said. \u2018\u2018You feel like you can\u2019t breathe, but you\u2019re breathing. Your face feels like it\u2019s about to melt off, but it\u2019s there. It\u2019s just \u2014 you have to be aware of everything.\u2019\u2019 Otherwise, she added, \u2018\u2018you\u2019re not going to survive.\u2019\u2019Jones didn\u2019t grow up with dreams of being a firefighter. She wanted to be a police officer. The first photo her mom, Diana Baez, showed me was of a cocky young girl of around 5 or 6 dressed up for career day. Jones is wearing navy blue head-to-toe and aviator shades. She has a death grip on a plastic baton and holds a leash tethered to the neck of a stuffed Goofy doll. \u2018\u2018She always wanted to be a K-9 handler, and here she was dressed like one,\u2019\u2019 Baez said. We were sitting in a dark, wood-paneled bar \u2014 the Trap, a dusty oasis on the fringes of Lancaster, a town already on the fringes of Southern California in the high desert of the Antelope Valley. Before Jones was incarcerated, this was her home. Her mom managed the bar; much of her extended family was in a hard-rock band called Seconds to Centuries (SIIC) that played the back room.Jones was smart, but as a teenager she couldn\u2019t sit still in class. Eventually she dropped out of high school to work at a mortuary owned by a boyfriend\u2019s family. The job ended when the relationship did. She had a string of boyfriends, most of them bad, and in May 2014, she was caught sitting in a car next to one of them and a large quantity of crystal methamphetamine. He had a lengthy record and didn\u2019t want to be locked up for life. He told Jones he would bail her out if she took responsibility for the drugs. Jones was convicted of possession with attempt to distribute methamphetamine and of marijuana possession. The boyfriend kept his promise and paid the $30,000 bail, and Jones was sentenced to three years\u2019 probation.She was trapped in Lancaster. \u2018\u2018No one can get out of here, it\u2019s like we\u2019re all stuck,\u2019\u2019 Rosa Garcia, Jones\u2019s friend, said. Jones helped her mom run the Trap\u2019s karaoke nights (screaming expletives of denial whenever someone sang \u2018\u2018Like a Virgin\u2019\u2019), and she made some extra money by drawing on patrons\u2019 flat-billed snapback baseball caps. She sold merchandise at her friends\u2019 shows; hustled pool; bummed cigarettes; wrote poetry; smoked weed; and skateboarded, sometimes all night. In some pictures from SIIC shows, her leggings are ripped and her eyeliner is winged to perfection, and she\u2019s standing victoriously over a riotous crowd. \u2018\u2018I could always count on Shawna being right there, right in front of me, center stage, every single time,\u2019\u2019 Jae Paige Dion, the lead singer of SIIC, said. \u2018\u2018She had no problem getting in the mosh pits and knocking down all the guys.\u2019\u2019 Jones was fearless. Her Facebook photos show her sticking her tongue out aggressively, flashing a middle finger at a friend\u2019s cellphone camera; there are shots of her belly red and raw from being slapped.Within a year of the methamphetamine arrest, Jones was back in trouble. She had violated parole at least three times \u2014 stealing puppy food, stealing groceries, selling marijuana, missing court dates \u2014 before a warrant was issued for her arrest. Jones decided to turn herself in. On June 2, 2015, she wrote on her Facebook page: \u2018\u2018I can only handle so much bad stuff at one time. and I have reached my quota for the year so it can stop now. I want some good stuff to happen soon.\u2019\u2019 The Trap hosted a party. Rosa Garcia got the dollar taco guy to bring his truck to the parking lot. \u2018\u2018We basically ordered one million tacos so that she would remember what real food tastes like,\u2019\u2019 Garcia said. Dion made her a personalized T-shirt with her nickname, \u2018\u2018Baby Hooker,\u2019\u2019 scrawled on it, which everyone signed, and by the next day she was ready. Jones hugged her mom, who was crying, and skated off on her longboard toward the Lancaster courthouse to turn herself in. Jones admitted to the court that she failed to comply with her probation conditions, and she was sentenced to three years. She heard about the forestry program during one of the 238 days she spent in the county jail: The women all spoke of it as a prison Shangri-La \u2014 lobster, shrimp, ocean breezes. Six months after leaving the county jail, Jones was transferred to Malibu.By November 2015, Jones was calling her mom weekly to tell her about the training, about the exhaustion after sandbagging a hillside to prevent flooding and about the optional weekend hikes that she always went on through the canyons of Malibu. She had found something in this sort of work, something she liked. It reminded her of a not-too-distant past. In high school, she camped out with friends on Shaver Lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains, plunged into cold lakes from rocky cliffs and boogie-boarded at the beach. She etched her initials with her boyfriend\u2019s, \u2018\u2018C.C. + S.J.,\u2019\u2019 on the side of a rusted beach picnic table. Her enthusiasm was so great it convinced her mother that Jones\u2019s luck was changing. Baez was already planning her daughter\u2019s welcome-home party.On the morning of the Mulholland fire, Feb. 25, an unknown number flashed on Diana Baez\u2019s cellphone around 10 a.m. It flashed again and again and again. Baez kept declining the call until it seemed like something she shouldn\u2019t ignore. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s been an accident,\u2019\u2019 a man told her when she answered. Baez, immediately hysterical, asked, \u2018\u2018Where is my daughter?\u2019\u2019 He paused and said, \u2018\u2018I can\u2019t tell you because she\u2019s an inmate.\u2019\u2019 An hour later, when the Lancaster sheriff\u2019s office called with numbers and instructions, Baez scrawled as much information as she could on her bedroom mirror using eyeliner. The sheriff told her that Jones was not admitted under her birth name, because of her incarcerated status. He told Baez that when she got to the U.C.L.A. hospital, she should ask for \u2018\u2018Hawaii X.\u2019\u2019 She arrived to find her daughter lying unconscious on a gurney.\u2018\u2018The first thing I did when I opened that curtain and I saw her \u2014 I grabbed her \u2014 right there, I grabbed her, and I said, \u2018You promised me,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Baez told me. \u2018\u2018She just called me two days before, and she said, \u2018Momma, I\u2019m coming home in six weeks,\u2019 so I freaking told her, \u2018You promised me.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Baez hardly recognized her daughter. Her face was swollen; her eyes were taped shut so that they wouldn\u2019t dry out; her head had been shaved because the doctors were trying to drain a blood clot. Baez crawled onto the gurney next to her daughter, but she remained unresponsive.The two police officers standing guard at the door to Jones\u2019s room tried to explain what happened. Captains and representatives from C.D.C.R. all tried to explain. But Baez could only cry and hold her daughter\u2019s hand. She never left Jones. (A nurse had to force her to eat a snack of orange juice and graham crackers.) Later, she found out from the intake administrator what had happened on the ravine in Malibu.The earth above Jones began giving way. At first it was just pebbles. Then, the first chain saw shouted, \u2018\u2018Rock.\u2019\u2019 But Jones couldn\u2019t hear over the noise of her machine. The large stone fell suddenly, 100 feet and, in an instant, struck her head. She was knocked out on her feet. A fire captain strapped her into a stretcher, and a helicopter, there to drop fire retardant, descended to retrieve the limp body.At a graduation last year of inmate firefighters at the California Institution for Women, near Chino, where all female inmate firefighters are trained, the mood was celebratory, almost exultant. One speaker brought up Jones and asked, to great applause, that her life and her death not go in vain. He said, \u2018\u2018She gave her life for this program, and L.A. County made sure she did not leave without full dress.\u2019\u2019When I visited Rainbow, I asked a Cal Fire captain named Danny Ramirez why the state wouldn\u2019t increase the incentive to join the program by paying even a little bit more. He didn\u2019t have a ready answer. Which brought up another puzzling aspect of the program: Why doesn\u2019t the state get more out of its investment in training these women by hiring them when they\u2019re released? Or at the very least, by creating a pathway to employment? Ramirez said the idea \u2018\u2018to keep tags on the girls\u2019\u2019 had come up before. \u2018\u2018Some of these girls leave very interested in what they got exposed to and say, \u2018Oh I never knew this exists, how do I keep on doing this?\u2019 And it\u2019s hard when they get out there because they do have a lot of the same walls that they were facing before. But a program to keep them guided and keep them on that path and keep them focused on something instead of getting back into their old ways or old friends would be awesome.\u2019\u2019Jones\u2019s body was driven from the coroner\u2019s department to Eternal Valley Memorial Park and Mortuary, located between Lancaster and Los Angeles. A fire company crew was on every overpass, standing on their trucks, saluting in full uniform as Jones\u2019s body was driven underneath. Outside her funeral, rows of sheriffs and deputies stood at attention, right hands at their brows. Two fire trucks were parked at the entrance with their ladders raised, crossed in tribute to her. Shawna Lynn Jones lived as an inmate and died an honored firefighter. Baez received a customary American flag, folded into a tight triangle. Someone told her, she says, that in Shawna\u2019s four months as a firefighter, she made about $1,000.Jaime Lowe is a frequent contributor to the magazine. She is the author of \u2018\u2018Mental: Lithium, Love and Losing My Mind,\u2019\u2019 to be published by Blue Rider Press in October.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Racially Charged Nissan Vote Is a Test for U.A.W. in the South", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for more than 3,500 employees who will be voting Thursday and Friday on whether to unionize the sprawling Nissan plant here, the concern is more immediate: How much they can expect of their employer in a world of diminishing prospects for blue-collar workers \u2014 not just in pay and benefits, but also in status and respect.Conversations with 20 workers reveal a workplace bitterly divided on these questions. In one camp are those who feel that Nissan has provided a standard of living that would have been unattainable had the company not opened its nearly mile-long plant in Canton more than 14 years ago.\u201cMost of us just have a high school education,\u201d said Kim Barber, a quality technician who has been with Nissan since the plant opened, in an overfilled parking lot before her shift last week. \u201cI\u2019m almost 50. I can\u2019t go anywhere else.\u201dMs. Barber said she made about $26 an hour, roughly twice what she made in her previous job driving a forklift at a storage company, adjusting for inflation.In another camp are those workers who believe they should not be asked to grade the company on the curve that is Mississippi\u2019s low-wage economy. \u201cNissan knew what they were doing when they put their plant around here,\u201d said Annie Matthews, a union supporter who is also in quality control and a veteran of 14 years at the plant.Many people had been working at McDonald\u2019s making $7 an hour, she said, \u201cand now this is the best thing that ever happened to them.\u201dUnion supporters complain that the company has been stingy with benefits and bonuses, that workers on the production line are pressured to sacrifice safety to keep the line moving briskly, and that supervisors arbitrarily change policies about discipline and attendance.And another issue looms awkwardly over the forthcoming vote: race. A large majority of the nearly 6,500 workers at the Nissan plant are African-American. One does not have to search hard for racial overtones.Along with some of her co-workers, Ms. Matthews, who is black, claimed that white supervisors rewarded white workers who were their friends with cushier assignments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Billy Bob as your manager, you go duck hunting, possum hunting together,\u201d she said.(The company rejected the accusation, saying that promotions and assignments were made on the basis of merit, and that the rationale for decisions was not always visible to other employees.)The U.A.W., for its part, has taken pains to highlight the campaign\u2019s racial dimension. In its news release announcing the impending vote, it quoted a worker who accused Nissan of violating African-Americans\u2019 labor rights even while marketing cars to them.The union has also forged close alliances with local black pastors and community leaders, whose mantra has been that the ability to form a union is a civil right.Bishop Thomas Jenkins, a local pastor who once led a group of fellow clergymen to the plant to urge Nissan to commit to an evenhanded election process, said Mississippi seemed to have a \u201cspirit of mediocrity,\u201d sending a message that workers \u201cought to be glad to have a job.\u201d Mr. Jenkins said neither he nor his church had received money from the U.A.W.In some ways the sensitivity about race may have prevented the organizing campaign from becoming more divisive than it otherwise might have.In Mississippi, union officials say, the state\u2019s Republican establishment has been relatively subdued, perhaps calculating that more aggressive opposition would be ineffective, even self-defeating.\u201cIf the governor of the state of Mississippi says it\u2019s not good for you, then it must be great for you,\u201d said Barbara Blackmon, the Democratic state senator who represents the area.Officials at the union, which has been working in earnest to organize the Canton plant since 2012, say a unionized South is crucial to restoring leverage for workers across the country, since employers can rein in wages by locating there, or merely threatening to. \u201cThere has to be a floor at some point that workers will not go past,\u201d said Gary Casteel, the union\u2019s second-ranking official.Nissan says that its wages are significantly higher than the average in central Mississippi, and that while it ended eligibility for its pension plan after 2005, it makes two forms of contributions to employees\u2019 retirement accounts \u2014 one matching a portion of what workers contribute, and one independent of their contributions. (The major American automakers contribute a roughly equivalent percentage of workers\u2019 income to their retirement funds.) Nissan distributes annual \u201cthank you\u201d bonuses to workers, worth $4,000 in each of the last two years, though the bonuses are not based on profitability, as is the practice with American automakers.In an ad campaign, Nissan testifies to its efforts to improve the lives of its workers. One ad features an African-American supervisor who describes struggling to pay her bills as a single mother before landing at Nissan, which later promoted her and even helped her finish college.\u201cIf anything, it should be the opposite argument,\u201d said Scott Waller, interim president and chief executive of the Mississippi Economic Council, a business advocacy group, alluding to the potential for racial polarization. The high proportion of African-Americans that Nissan employs at the plant, he said, \u201cspeaks to the great progress, the positive things that are happening in this state.\u201dStill, workers say there is more than one way to divide them than along racial lines \u2014 namely, by inciting fear. And Nissan \u2014 which unlike Volkswagen before it has refused to stay neutral in the union campaign \u2014 has not forsworn this tactic.In a video shown to workers, Steve Marsh, the plant\u2019s top official, warned that the employees of General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler represented by the U.A.W. \u201cexperienced significant instability in recent years, and suffered from many layoffs and plant closings.\u201dManagers have also held frequent discussions with workers in which they make similar suggestions about how a union could hurt job security. Nissan says the meetings are intended to counter misinformation.Workers say there are also fault lines between those who have more to lose and those who have less. For example, workers hired in the plant\u2019s early years make about $26 an hour and receive six days of paid time off each year; workers hired more recently top out at about $24 (and often make less) and receive only three paid days off. (In addition to paid time off, all Nissan employees receive 14 paid holidays and 10 to 20 vacation days, depending on how long they\u2019ve been at the company.)Some workers are also promoted into less physically demanding jobs like quality control, while others languish on the assembly line for a decade or more.Many of the anti-union workers are \u201cin a job where they\u2019re just walking around with a clipboard, they\u2019re not on that line,\u201d said Eric Hearn, who has worked on one of the plant\u2019s assembly lines for five years. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to say anything.\u201dAt a meeting of workers at the local U.A.W. office last week, union supporters fumed about a recent slide presentation in which managers explained that Nissan could not guarantee most workers their old jobs in the event of a strike.One worker, Chip Wells, later said in an interview that many colleagues were worried by the presentation, even though strikes are a rarity.\u201cIt just scared a lot of people,\u201d Mr. Wells said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the Facebook Group Where N.F.L. Wives Share Anxieties and Advice", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 The chatter runs the gamut from the practical to the profound, from sharing recipes and finding a home in a new city to dealing with a husband\u2019s growing dementia and applying for medical benefits. Touchy topics like alcoholism, depression and spousal abuse come up, too, mixed in with ideas on what to do with spare time.Part confessional, part help line, part bonding session, the invitation-only Facebook discussion group for the wives and partners of current and retired National Football League players has become the go-to place to air the complexities, anxieties and consequences of living with an N.F.L. athlete, past and present.The page was started last spring by Tara Nesbit, the wife of Jamar Nesbit, a former New Orleans Saints offensive lineman. It includes more than 2,000 women who, as science and medicine unlock more about the health consequences of the game, are increasingly sharing their anguish about injuries and the long-term effects of concussions, a contentious issue rocking the sport.\u201cIt\u2019s scary to think about the future and the \u2018what ifs,\u2019\u201d one wife of a current player wrote. But \u201cif it\u2019s what he loves, I have to support it.\u201dAnother woman, coping with a former player enduring chronic pain, passed along advice and a wrenching update.\u201cAfter about a month of being on the oil, he was able to stop taking his antidepressant and anxiety medications,\u201d she wrote about a product her husband had begun using. \u201cThings that used to set him off no longer seem to bother or irritate him.\u201dMany of the posts morph into virtual group hugs, as women who have grappled with the same issues offer support, advice and encouragement or, as one woman put it, a soft place to land.\u201cThey are very open about their husbands and the issues that can be perceived as positive or negative,\u201d Tara Nesbit said, sitting at her dining room table surrounded by a laptop and files. \u201cWhen someone says something, there are 10 women who jump on and say, \u2018My husband is like that, too.\u2019\u201dNesbit, who is helped by Jane Arnett, another former player\u2019s wife, tries to keep the site as private as possible, guarding against voyeurs. Though Nesbit provided a variety of screen grabs of discussions and posts, with the names of the writers removed, she declined to allow The New York Times full access. Quotations from posts were used only with the writer\u2019s permission.She allowed The Times this exclusive glimpse to highlight what many spouses, so often seen but not heard, talk about and experience behind the scenes of the country\u2019s most successful, sometimes most polemical, sports league.Nesbit\u2019s background helped win the women\u2019s trust. Her husband played in three cities and was for a time on a series of one-year contracts, so she understands how precarious an N.F.L. career can be. She spends hours a day making sure the page is up-to-date and the tone is civil.While many women ask for advice on where to find good doctors and how to navigate paperwork to secure health benefits, others delve deeper. Some women ask if football is worth the money and fame, and express worry that the game will wreak havoc on their husbands\u2019 brains.Alison Owens has shared her thoughts on these tough questions. Her husband, Terry, who played 10 seasons with the San Diego Chargers in the 1960s and 1970s, died in 2012 and was later found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the degenerative brain disease that has been linked to repeated hits to the head. Owens took care of her husband during his last years, as his dementia advanced, but she did so with no advice from other wives.Now, on the Facebook page, she helps other wives sidestep some of the mistakes she made, providing tips on everything from selecting the right bed for a husband who is losing his mobility to ensuring that you have a valid power of attorney.A neuropathologist has examined the brains of 111 N.F.L. players \u2014 and 110 were found to have C.T.E., the degenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head.\u201cI\u2019m giving advice because I\u2019ve been through it and no one was there for me,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cI definitely wish I would have had something similar at the time. I just muddled through it.\u201d\u201cWhen the study came out, it really scared me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cShould I encourage him to walk away? When is the money enough? That\u2019s the conversation we\u2019re having.\u201dStill, the page is generally not a place to complain about the N.F.L.; the vibe is more about bringing people together. After all, many of the women have the league to thank for their husband\u2019s professional and financial success, and the wives of current players \u2014 about 30 percent of the women on the page \u2014 tend to be more upbeat about the league.But with 10 to 15 active posts a day, plus comments, the challenges the families of players face seep in as they cope with the little-seen costs of being in \u201cthe N.F.L. family.\u201d This is especially true once players leave a league where the average career lasts only three or so seasons, and retirement often comes swiftly because of injury.The women\u2019s hunger for information is a sign of their husbands\u2019 uncertain journey into retirement, when players are left to deal with injuries, depression and a lack of structure.The conversations may not be easy, but many women on the page are reassured when they find out they are not alone.Lately, one of the most frequent topics is the N.F.L. settlement with players who sued the league for concealing the dangers of concussions. Players started registering in February for the settlement, which will pay players with severe cognitive and neurological problems up to $5 million each, and the pace of questions about the deal has quickened with the approach of the registration deadline on Monday.More than 18,000 of the estimated 21,000 retired N.F.L. players or their representatives have registered, and tens of millions of dollars have been awarded to players so far. Nesbit has posted many notices encouraging women to sign up their husbands, and given the page\u2019s wide access, she may have ultimately prompted hundreds of players to register.The wives and partners, then, are critical in these cases because they can help players overcome their fears. More broadly, they are a crucial link to players who sometimes vanish as they move to new cities, get busy with their families and start new careers.\u201cI said if we get the information to the wives, we can get to the husbands,\u201d Nesbit said, as her cellphone pinged with alerts. \u201cIt was long, long overdue.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When this comes to a boil, Mr. Lopez tosses in dried white field corn, which he used to import from Mexico until taxes went up. (Now he gets it from California.)A brief simmer, and the mixture is left to cool for four or five hours. \u201cMy grandma did it overnight,\u201d said Mr. Lopez, 35, but at the shop, turnover is high and he can\u2019t wait.As it steeps, the corn intensifies in color and releases a scent like rain steaming off sun-baked earth. Afterward, it\u2019s drained, rinsed and rubbed by hand to remove the hulls. More time passes while it dries. Then it\u2019s ground coarsely in an old stone mill, sifted through again for any stray hulls and finally made into masa.All this for a tamal that costs $2.The suffering is not in vain. Mr. Lopez\u2019s tamales are beautifully fluffy, clingy and crumbly at once, a texture that calls to mind the airiest of poundcakes. Lard is whipped in, along with chicken stock, bringing voluptuousness to every bite. (Mr. Lopez plans soon to offer vegetarian versions made with olive oil.)Mr. Lopez\u2019s innovations include a tamal that\u2019s a take on the Mexican dish tinga, enclosing shreds of chicken that has long wallowed with chipotle, tomatoes and onions, and another with a seam of bacon and mozzarella \u2014 the bacon just enough to make you thirst.He still remembers his grandmother\u2019s tamales: \u201cI always keep the flavor in my mouth.\u201d She died before he started making his own, so he had to cobble together a recipe by consulting his mother, his aunt and his wife\u2019s grandmother. He kept running tests until the flavor gave him \u201cthe feeling when I was a 5-year-old.\u201dThe rest of the menu is devoted to egg sandwiches, panini and B.L.T.s. \u201cI see what the neighborhood needs,\u201d Mr. Lopez said. One of the few other Mexican offerings is a diminutive but satisfying torta with layers of avocado, chipotle, quesillo (stretchy Oaxacan cheese) and a lemony burst of papalo. It\u2019s close to a cemita, save for the ciabatta it\u2019s served on. \u201cI can\u2019t call it a cemita if I don\u2019t have the right bread,\u201d Mr. Lopez said.He grew up in Cholula, Mexico, and at the age of 15 \u201cran away from home,\u201d he said, and made his way to the United States. Who taught him to cook? \u201cLife,\u201d he replied. His first job was as a dishwasher at a Chinese restaurant; he worked his way up to line cook, then moved on to other restaurants: Italian, Thai, Mediterranean.Three years ago, he started making tamales at home and selling them outside a bodega in Queens. It was hard. \u201cWhen you steam tamales, the apartment gets humid,\u201d he said.In January, he took over the space that had been Cabalito, a Salvadoran pupusa joint where he was the chef. He outfitted it with a photograph of the volcano Popocat\u00e9petl, which smolders near his wife\u2019s hometown, Atlixco, and a slumping red couch strewn with pillows made from servilletas, napkins hand-embroidered by his mother and his wife, one teaching the other, passing the tradition on.Already he has outgrown the little shop. On Thursday, he shifted to a new, slightly bigger location, around the corner on Ludlow Street. He promised that the pillows would come with him.Advertisement"}

The way it was disconnected \u2014 the digital tether that connected its service to the rest of the internet was severed \u2014 suggested more than a mere technical outage, according to the leader of the firm\u2019s technology team, who requested anonymity for himself and the company for fear of reprisals.Chinese officials did not comment on the test, and there was no indication that they would use the system again. But if they do, it may not be a total surprise.The shift \u2014 which could affect a swath of users from researchers to businesses \u2014 suggests that China is increasingly worried about the power of the internet, experts said.\u201cIt does appear the crackdown is becoming more intense, but the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been,\u201d said Emily Parker, author of \u201cNow I Know Who My Comrades Are,\u201d a book about the power of the internet in China, Cuba, and Russia. \u201cBeijing\u2019s crackdown on the internet is commensurate with the power of the internet in China.\u201dChina still has not clamped down to its full ability, the experts said, and in many cases the cat-and-mouse game continues. One day after Apple\u2019s move last week, people on Chinese social media began circulating a way to gain access to those tools that was so easy that even a non-techie could use it. (It involved registering a person\u2019s app store to another country where VPN apps were still available.)Still, Thursday\u2019s test demonstrates that China wants the ability to change the game in favor of the cat.A number of Chinese internet service providers said on their social media accounts, websites, or in emails on Thursday that Chinese security officials would test a new way to find the internet addresses of services hosting or using illegal content. Once found, these companies said, the authorities would ask internet service providers to tell their clients to stop. If the clients persisted, they said, the service providers and Chinese officials would cut their connection in a matter of minutes.The Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a faxed request for comment.China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has presided over years of new internet controls, but he has also singled out technology and the internet as critical to China\u2019s future economic development. As cyberspace has become more central to everything that happens in China, government controls have evolved.It is difficult to figure out the extent of the new efforts, since many users and businesses will not discuss them publicly for fear of getting on the bad side with the Chinese government. But some frequent users said that getting around the restrictions had become increasingly difficult.One student, who has been studying in the United States and was back in China for summer vacation, said that her local VPN was blocked. She said she had taken the period as a sort of meditation away from social media and left a note on Facebook to warn her friends why she was a \u201cgone girl.\u201dA doctoral student in environmental engineering in at a university in China said it had become harder to do research without Google, though his university had found alternative publications so that students did not always need the internet. He has since found a new way to get around the Great Firewall, the student said, without disclosing what it was.Close observers of the Chinese internet said some VPNs still work \u2014 and that China could still do a lot more to intensify its crackdown.\u201cWe do think that if the government has decided to do so, it could have shut down much more VPN usage right now,\u201d said a spokesman for VPNDada, a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find VPNs that work.\u201cIf the government had sent more cats, the mice would have a tougher time,\u201d said the spokesman, who declined to be named because of sensitivities around the group\u2019s work in China. \u201cI guess they didn\u2019t do so because they need to give some air for people or businesses to breathe.\u201dMuch like economic policy or foreign affairs, censorship in China is part of a complicated and often imperfect political process. Government ministries feel pressure ahead of the party congress to show they are effective or can step in if a problem appears, analysts said.\u201cSo it\u2019s definitely not an apocalypse for VPNs,\u201d said Paul Triolo, head of global technology at Eurasia Group, a consultancy.\u201cJust a more complex environment for users to navigate, and new capabilities and approaches give China better ability to shut off some delta of VPN use at a time and place of Beijing\u2019s choosing,\u201d he said.China\u2019s population is learning to deal with those difficulties at a younger age. Earlier this summer, China\u2019s internet giant Tencent began limiting the time that people under 18 were allowed to play the popular online game Honor of Kings to an hour a day for those under 12, and two hours for those age 12 to 18.So Chinese youths have taken to an age-old solution: getting a fake ID.\u201cYour Honor of Kings being limited?

{"Headline": "Why the Nazis Came to Charlottesville", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCharlottesville, Va. \u2014 \u201cShould we go downtown?\u201d my wife asked over breakfast on Thursday. \u201cRemember, after the election, when we said we would stand with our neighbors when they were threatened? Are we being true to our commitments?\u201dFor weeks, we had read reports from white supremacist groups that they were coming here by the hundreds or thousands to start a fight. They promised to come armed. The racist Daily Stormer website has been calling 2017 the \u201cSummer of Hate,\u201d and Charlottesville would be ground zero.How should we respond? All summer, we and the other residents of this college town have been discussing our choices across tables, on Facebook, on local radio shows, in church groups and at community meetings.We could join many of our neighbors for teach-ins at the university, discussing racial history, prospects for diversity and paths toward justice. The University of Virginia had arranged a slate of public programs to give people a safe place to convene, commune and debate while armed, angry white supremacists invaded our downtown, just a mile and a half from the university.Or we could join thousands of our neighbors who had pledged to confront the Nazis, risking broken bones, pepper-sprayed eyes, arrest or worse. We had friends and neighbors on both sides of this choice. And we saw virtue in both actions.One school of thought says we should deny these extremists attention, as if attention were the oxygen that feeds their flaming torches. The other calls for direct confrontation: Show them they are unwelcome, outnumbered, and that the community is bravely united in disgust.Denying hate groups attention might work if everyone agreed to do so. But as long as television cameras \u2014 or even just regular people streaming on Facebook Live and posting to YouTube \u2014 were going to witness the events, and as long as others were committed to confronting the white supremacists, there would be oxygen.Plus, as we had learned from previous such assaults on our community, the hate groups were not just after attention. They wanted conflict. They came to hear the sound of flesh being struck, bones being broken. So the idea of denying them attention seemed less significant as the event drew closer. Still, there were compelling reasons to avoid confrontation.\u201cThey will have guns,\u201d I said to my wife. \u201cThat\u2019s the defining issue for me.\u201d She agreed. The fact that we have a child who is committed to social justice and curious about politics tipped the balance. For her sake, we could not risk putting ourselves in danger, especially when we had an opportunity to enrich her experience with peaceful community engagement.I now believe we made the wrong choice. Does my status as a parent make me special? It shouldn\u2019t. A young man named Dre Harris was ambushed in a parking lot and took dozens of blows by club-wielding thugs. He took them so I wouldn\u2019t have to. Next time I will stand on the street with my neighbors, even at the risk of injury or death. It\u2019s the least I can do to repay those who stood bravely this time.We knew it would be violent. These racists are not a joke. They are not weak or small in number. They are not just pining for attention. This was not a media stunt. They did not come to offer \u201cspeech.\u201d They did not come to engage in \u201cdebate.\u201d They came here to hurt us.And they did. Two Virginia State Police officers died in a helicopter crash. A car allegedly driven by a white supremacist crushed to death a paralegal who had committed herself to justice, 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Hospitals treated more than 20 more people for injuries, some life-threatening.They hurt us. But they did not defeat us. Local clergy locked arms to stare down the attackers. Volunteers dispensed water to counter-demonstrators. Black Lives Matter members put their bodies on the line for all of us. Medics treated the pepper-sprayed eyes of racists and anti-racists alike. Just as the hatred came from one side only, the care did not come from \u201cmany sides.\u201d It came only from the people of Charlottesville.These invaders hate my family. They threaten my country. They are numerous. They are emboldened. They are organized. They have friends in the White House. They are armed. They came in July. They came in August. And now they promise to return to Charlottesville to hurt more of us.Charlottesville is an ideal stage for them to perform acts of terrorism. This was the home of Thomas Jefferson, the man who codified religious tolerance in colonial Virginia and who declared \u201call men are created equal.\u201d It\u2019s also the home of Thomas Jefferson, the man who owned, sold, raped and had whipped people he considered racially inferior to him. It\u2019s the site of the University of Virginia, an institution steeped in conservative traditions that echo the Old South. And it\u2019s the site of the University of Virginia, an elite, global research university with a cosmopolitan faculty and student body.And, for reasons that speak to the perverse legacy of the Confederacy, we have here a statue of a man who spent no significant time in Charlottesville and betrayed the United States by waging a bloody war to destroy it and preserve slavery: Robert E. Lee.Two years ago, this city engaged in a civil conversation about how we would like our public monuments to represent our city. Last year, the City Council, after significant debate and dissent, voted to move two Confederate statues from two small neighborhood parks in the center of town to McIntire Park, a large, grassy park on the north side of the city. There, the monuments could remind us of our hateful, shameful past, but they would not represent our present or future.We in Charlottesville demand the right to express our community values, not be bound by those of the \u201cLost Cause\u201d of the Confederacy. We demand that the rest of this country recognize how serious the threat of racial violence is. We never had illusions. It\u2019s in our air and water. It\u2019s our local history.This is not about \u201cfree speech.\u201d It never was. There is no \u201cfree speech\u201d if anyone brandishes firearms to intimidate those they despise. You can\u2019t argue with the armed. The Nazis told us their intentions clearly on Saturday. This, to them, is about \u201cblood and soil.\u201d They are serious. So are we.This week, it was Charlottesville. Next week, it could be any other town. We all must make a decision. How would you confront this threat?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get Ahead in Politics in the Philippines", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNative to the Philippines is a tart fruit called the balimbing. Ridges down the length of its oblong sides give it multiple faces, which is why many of our politicians are colloquially compared to it. Such criticism of our rulers\u2019 kaleidoscopic loyalties is usually apt, and it\u2019s always uttered with contempt.Last year, Rodrigo Duterte won the presidency under the slogan \u201cChange is coming.\u201d But the corruption and deception of those under him belie that promise. Mr. Duterte\u2019s policies and methods have caused controversy worldwide, yet it is the chronic dysfunction and selfish ambition across the political spectrum that most prevent the changes we Filipinos deserve.Few politicians exemplify what ails Philippine politics as well as Pantaleon Alvarez, the new speaker of the House of Representatives, and his ally Rodolfo Farinas, the House majority leader.Those salacious details were brought to the fore after an incident in which Mr. Alvarez\u2019s mistress reportedly fought with the mistress of another Duterte crony, Antonio Floirendo Jr., over seats at a cultural festival. Mr. Floirendo had bankrolled Mr. Alvarez\u2019s recent congressional candidacy, yet he soon found himself slapped with a graft complaint in which the speaker alleged anomalies in a government contract involving a banana plantation. Mr. Alvarez denies any personal agenda, just as he does in answering the allegations that he will benefit from a bill that he is pushing to legalize divorce, which for decades Congress has refused to do in our predominantly Catholic country.All this may be just Philippine politics as usual, but Mr. Alvarez has further embarrassed himself by getting into a very public dispute with Mandy Mercado Anderson, a lawyer at the Bureau of Customs. Ms. Anderson says she received a letter from the speaker insisting she promote an unqualified candidate in her department. She refused. According to reports, Ms. Anderson was then summoned for a scolding by Mr. Alvarez, threatened by a member of his staff and linked to a cover-up of a case of drug smuggling.Those threats had come after the court threatened Mr. Alvarez with contempt for refusing to release six people who had been arrested through the efforts of his congressional collaborator, Mr. Farinas, the majority leader. Known as the \u201cIlocos Six,\u201d after the northern province that includes Mr. Farinas\u2019s district, they were detained and cited for contempt for refusing to give evidence against Imee Marcos, the governor of Ilocos Norte and one of Mr. Farinas\u2019s political rivals, who is accused of misappropriating some $1.3 million.Ms. Marcos, whose family stole billions of dollars that have not yet been recovered when her father was dictator, was also threatened with being held in contempt after she put off testifying in the investigation. (She eventually agreed to appear.)That the newly empowered Mr. Farinas, with Mr. Alvarez, is standing against the Marcoses is of no small significance. The dictator\u2019s family has in recent years been resurgent, enjoying the unwavering support of President Duterte. Ms. Marcos\u2019s brother, Ferdinand Jr., lost his bid last year for the vice presidency by only about 2 percentage points. The family has recently paid the $1.3 million necessary for a recount, and there is a distinct possibility that Mr. Marcos may soon own the vice presidency.Mr. Farinas is seemingly unperturbed. He is renowned as an effective majority whip in a congressional bloc that consists of, according to one congressman, 267 out of the total 297 seats. He is powerful indeed. This is despite his checkered past, which consists both of accusations that abuse led to his wife\u2019s suicide and his well-known fealty to the past administration, members of which he and his colleagues now shamelessly attack.In Philippine politics, it seems that loyalty is first always to the self, and a far second to the country. Our rulers, however, would have us believe they are our heroes.As with the show, Filipinos can only watch and wait for the next episodes of deceit, betrayal, impunity and corruption. Meanwhile, our rulers readily wield accusations of contempt against any who refuse to cooperate. They miss the obvious irony. The contempt is ours, for them. For respect is earned, never demanded. They forget who, in a democracy, has every right to demand leaders worthy of our respect.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Damaging Myth of the Loner Genius Nerd", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmotional IntelligenceMany scientists have said he got the biology wrong. But the job requirements of today\u2019s programmers show he was also wrong about working in tech.In fact, interpersonal skills like collaboration, communication, empathy and emotional intelligence are essential to the job. The myth that programming is done by loner men who think only rationally and communicate only with their computers harms the tech industry in ways that cut straight to the bottom line.The loner stereotype can deter talented people from the industry \u2014 not just women, but anyone who thinks that sounds like an unattractive job description. It can also result in dysfunctional teams and poorly performing products. Empathy, after all, is crucial to understanding consumers\u2019 desires, and its absence leads to product mistakes.She added, \u201cBut not everyone is the same, and that\u2019s where empathy and broader diversity really help.\u201dIt\u2019s true that programming can be a solitary activity in college computer science classes or entry-level positions. But soon after, it\u2019s impossible to avoid teamwork \u2014 with the business or legal departments, but also with other engineers.Yet that was never an accurate description of the job. It was social from the beginning, in university computer labs and, later, Silicon Valley garages, he said. The social circle just didn\u2019t include women.\u201cFor a lot of these young men, a certain computer culture becomes an expression of masculinity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who aren\u2019t doing physical labor, aren\u2019t playing professional sports. But they can express their masculinity by intense competition, playing pranks on one another, demonstrating their technical prowess, in ways that don\u2019t translate well to mixed-gender environments.\u201dEarly on, children who are less comfortable with social interaction \u2014 particularly boys, who are more likely to be socialized that way \u2014 are channeled toward science and engineering, he said. Teachers generally focus on the technical aspects and not the interpersonal ones. The result is a field filled with people who dislike social interactions and have been rewarded for it.In the tech industry, the lack of interpersonal skills has become a weakness and a liability.\u201cYou might have ideas in your head, but unless you communicate them, no one\u2019s going to understand,\u201d he said.Technical skills without empathy have resulted in products that have bombed in the market, because a vital step to building a product is the ability to imagine how someone else might think and feel. \u201cThe failure rate in software development is enormous, but it almost never means the code doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem that actually exists, or it imagines a user completely different from actual users.\u201dWith Google Glass, for example, it was a technical feat to make a tiny computer you could wear as a pair of glasses. But the product wasn\u2019t one that typical people needed, or wanted.When Apple introduced its Health app, it tracked sleep, exercise, food, medications and heart rate, but not menstrual cycle. Yet period trackers are one of the most used health tools for women. (The app now includes it.)Google Plus, the company\u2019s social network, initially required that users make public their name, photo and gender. There was a technical argument for including gender \u2014 to construct sentences like \u201cShe shared a photo with you\u201d \u2014 but it also exposed women to online harassment.\u201cThe team that made this decision was entirely male,\u201d said Mr. Zunger, who was the chief architect of social networking at Google at the time. \u201cIt was a really clear case of getting things wrong, for the simple reason that the people in the room weren\u2019t diverse enough to notice an obvious problem.\u201dEmpathy also affects which products are built in the first place \u2014 why, for example, Silicon Valley has spent more time building apps for expensive food delivery than for decreasing hunger.When engineers build products with empathy, it can seem like magic: Technology seems to predict what people want before they know they want it. That was part of Steve Jobs\u2019s genius. Just look at the number of people connected to their phones, or a child using an iPhone for the first time.One way to develop empathy at companies is by hiring diverse teams, because people bring different perspectives and life experiences. But the more widespread the stereotypes like those in the Google memo, the harder it becomes.\u201cThat nerd identity is really damaging to women,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also damaging to minorities and to a lot of men who don\u2019t want to subsume their identity in that.\u201dThat\u2019s why the consequences of the Google memo could reach far beyond the particular case, influencing which young people choose to go into technology, and which products they make that affect every aspect of our lives.Advertisement"}

Ivanka Trump has our backs! She has tweeted as much, and I guess we\u2019re supposed to find consolation in those crumbs.Although prior arrangements had been made with a local funeral home, it refused even to pick up the dead man\u2019s body when it learned of his same-sex marriage, according to a breach-of-contract lawsuit by his husband that hasn\u2019t yet been resolved.I told Davidson that I thought that such don\u2019t-make-me-touch-it hysteria ended 25 years ago.South Carolina: another state that I love, another state that doesn\u2019t love me back, and the home of Tommy Starling, 45, and his husband, Jeff Littlefield, 61. Starling told me that they live there, in the coastal community of Pawleys Island, because of Littlefield\u2019s job in the insurance business, but they dream constantly of moving somewhere that doesn\u2019t cast them as provocative social experiments, somewhere that doesn\u2019t put and keep them on edge.They had trouble trying to adopt in South Carolina, so they turned to California and to surrogacy to have their 11-year-old daughter and 4-year-old son. Starling said that his family stands out in Pawleys Island in a way that it wouldn\u2019t in Brooklyn \u2014 or, for that matter, Atlanta \u2014 and disparaging, even menacing, remarks have come his way. To protect his kids from such ugliness, he has created, and works to preserve, a bubble of open-minded people around them.\u201cBut it\u2019s getting exhausting,\u201d he said, adding that the family\u2019s occasional travel sustains him. He recalled a trip not long ago to San Francisco, where his husband reached out to hold his hand in public and he reflexively tensed.\u201cHe had to remind me that it was O.K. there,\u201d Starling told me.Holding hands. Such a small thing \u2014 and yet so incredibly big for many gay couples in conservative environments and even for some couples in more liberal areas that can nonetheless seem threatening. That came through poignantly in more than 1,000 responses that The Times received after asking L.G.B.T. readers to share their reflections on the freedoms and limitations of where they live.Readers were acutely conscious of the absence or presence of employment-related anti-discrimination laws in their cities or states. (Only 22 states have such laws governing all gay and lesbian workers, in both the public and the private sectors, while only 20, including New York, have them for transgender workers as well.) Readers mentioned the vigor, or laxness, with which their local governments patrolled against and prosecuted hate crimes.And one after another, readers said they wished that a modest public gesture of affection wasn\u2019t a potent magnet for stares, slurs or worse.From a 45-year-old lesbian in Laingsburg, Mich.: \u201cSometimes I fantasize about living in parts of N.Y.C. or Provincetown, where I would be able to feel comfortable walking down the street holding hands with my wife, but our roots are here.\u201d From a 34-year-old lesbian in Lubbock, Tex.: \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 and I get disgusted looks when we hold hands walking into places.\u201dHe told me that if he draws looks from other parents when he\u2019s out and about with his 3-year-old son, Elan, he\u2019s pretty sure it\u2019s because he\u2019s a black man and there has been so much discussion about black children growing up with absent fathers. Acquaintances who learn or know that he\u2019s gay don\u2019t register any surprise or signal any disapproval.\u201cI don\u2019t take this for granted,\u201d he added, noting that he grew up in Kansas and knows gay men in cities less cosmopolitan than New York.337states have laws prohibiting gestational surrogacystates do not have a law explicitly allowing a second same-sex parent to adoptSource: Human Rights Campaign337states do not have a law explicitly allowing a second same-sex parent to adoptstates have laws prohibiting gestational surrogacySource: Human Rights CampaignOn the state level, the yardsticks for measuring respect for L.G.B.T. people include, recently, restrictions on \u201cconversion therapy,\u201d which attempts to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity.

{"Headline": "In South Korea, K-Pop Pleads for Peace", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThat is why this peace concert is so meaningful,\u201d Mr. Jung said. \u201cLet\u2019s shout \u2018no\u2019 to missiles and \u2018no\u2019 to nuclear weapons development and \u2018we want peace.\u2019 Maybe North Korea can hear us,\u201d he said. A roar rose up from the crowd in response.But the volume of these shouts was nothing compared with the shrieks of young men and women that filled the park after the performances of their favorite K-pop stars, including Girls\u2019 Generation, BTOB, Cosmic Girls, Mamamoo and GFriend, who performed at the seventh annual summer DMZ Peace Concert.Nam Hyung-jin, 18, a college freshman studying Chinese language, had traveled 70 miles north from Osan City. He felt apprehensive about attending, knowing how close the concert was to North Korea. He was unsettled by the bellicose remarks exchanged between the leaders of the United States and North Korea last week.But after cheering the Cosmic Girls as that 13-piece group bounced up and down in unison singing their syrupy hit \u201cHappy,\u201d Mr. Nam said he hoped that North Korea could hear \u201cthe sound of freedom\u201d from the south.\u201cIf enjoying K-pop right near the border with the aggressive North Korea is not freedom, what is?\u201d he said. \u201cI hope North Korea, too, understands how much happiness freedom can bring and chooses a path toward peace.\u201dAnother Cosmic Girls fan, Kim Ji-hyun, 12, a sixth-grader from Paju City, a few miles away, also felt some trepidation at first.\u201cI live close to the border so I am used to seeing soldiers around, but there are soldiers here at a peaceful culture event. The security situation in our country must be serious,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Cosmic Girls\u2019 act totally distracted me away from feeling scared.\u201dThis is the seventh time that the local government and the Korean national television network MBC have hosted the annual DMZ Peace Concert. The event commemorates National Liberation Day, a holiday common to both Koreas, that remembers the end of the 35-year Japanese colonial occupation in 1945. This year\u2019s concert, which had the slogan, \u201cAgain, Peace!,\u201d was organized with the participation of the South Korean Ministry of Unification. The ministry is mandated to prepare for the reintegration of the two Koreas into a single nation.\u201cYoung Koreans tend to not care about unification,\u201d said Kim Nan-young, deputy director of the ministry\u2019s cultural affairs division, adding that events like this one, intended to pique young people\u2019s interest in unification, are important.The effort has been effective, Kim Nan-young said. \u201cYoung people inevitably get to think about unification and security issues when they come to a place near the border with North Korea.\u201dThe government\u2019s efforts seemed to have worked on Kim Ha-min, 15, a high school student who came to the concert from Incheon, just west of Seoul. For Ms. Kim, North Korea had always been a scary, distant place. But on Saturday, when her to favorite K-pop boy band, BTOB, dedicated its ballad \u201cSomeday\u201d to the hope for unification, Ms. Kim said that it made her think differently.The song\u2019s lyrics made her realize \u201cthat there are people just like us living in North Korea,\u201d she said, \u201cand not just its belligerent leader, Kim Jong-un.\u201d\u201cThey are just over that border,\u201d Ms. Kim said, pointing toward the north.In between acts, a huge screen behind the stage showed K-pop stars in scenarios envisaging a peaceful society after unification of the peninsula, in which South Koreans would be able to vacation in the north and young people from both sides would be able to date and make friends.During those scenes, many teenagers took a rest from screaming for their idols and instead used their smartphones to look at Facebook and other social media platforms. Yang Ahn-na, 14, a BTOB fan from Paju City, felt cheated that not all of the concert was about the music.\u201cThe government used K-pop as bait to lure us teenagers to come to this concert so that we would want unification,\u201d Ms. Yang said.Others at the event agreed. \u201cMobilizing K-pop entertainers to spark people\u2019s interest in unification doesn\u2019t seem quite right,\u201d said Cho Eun-sol, 26, a human resources content developer from Seoul. \u201cIt is not their job and it puts an awkward burden on the entertainers.\u201dBut her boyfriend, Ha Bong-ahn, 27, a software engineer, also from Seoul, felt differently. Mr. Ha, who served his compulsory military duty near the border a few years ago, said that while people had come to the concert despite is proximity to the demilitarized zone, South Koreans shouldn\u2019t forget that the threat of war is always looming so long as the peninsula is divided.\u201cThat\u2019s why people should become more interested in unification, and if K-pop artists can help, that\u2019s good,\u201d Mr. Ha said.The concert ended with all the participating K-pop entertainers onstage together for a song about how happy everyone would be on the day the two Koreas come together. The screen behind them showed enormous South Korean flags waving.\u201cAt first, I felt scared about coming here so close to the border with North Korea,\u201d said Kim Na-young, 14, from Geojedo Island, \u201cbut I am glad I came. I can see now that we can enjoy ourselves anywhere even if North Korea threatens us.\u201dMs. Kim added, \u201cI hope people in North Korea got to hear the K-pop songs and our message of peace, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bombing Plot in Oklahoma City Is Thwarted With Arrest, F.B.I. Says", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 23-year-old Oklahoma man has been arrested after he tried to blow up a bank in downtown Oklahoma City using a vehicle bomb similar to the one that destroyed the federal building there in 1995, federal officials said Monday.The man, Jerry Drake Varnell, had been plotting the attack for months, the authorities said, but was thwarted by a long-running undercover investigation led by an F.B.I. joint terrorism task force.Mr. Varnell was arrested early Saturday after he parked a van loaded with what he believed to be a working explosive device in an alley next to the bank, and then dialed a number on a cellphone that he thought would set it off, federal officials said. The device was inert and could not explode, the officials said.The bank Mr. Varnell was said to target \u2014 the downtown branch of BancFirst, Oklahoma\u2019s largest state-chartered bank \u2014 is about a half-mile from the site of that attack.\u201cI\u2019m out for blood,\u201d Mr. Varnell wrote in one text message to a confidential informant who cooperated with the authorities, according to the affidavit, which was written by an F.B.I. special agent. \u201cWhen militias start getting formed I\u2019m going after government officials when I have a team,\u201d he wrote. The complaint did not name the informant.Federal law enforcement officials said the public was not in danger at any time.\u201cThere was never a concern that our community\u2019s safety or security was at risk during this investigation,\u201d Kathryn Peterson, the special agent in charge of the F.B.I. in Oklahoma, said in a statement. \u201cI can assure the public, without hesitation, that we had Varnell\u2019s actions monitored every step of the way.\u201dThe bombing case appeared to have started in December, when the confidential informant told the F.B.I. that Mr. Varnell wanted to bomb the Washington building that houses the offices of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. Mr. Varnell appeared to be especially angry with the banking and financial data system, and expressed interest in attacking corporate data centers and facilities known as server farms, including those run by Facebook and Bank of America, the authorities said.He told both the informant and the undercover F.B.I. agent that he did not want to kill \u201ca bunch of people.\u201d But when the undercover agent told him in June that any bombing might kill one or more people, Mr. Varnell responded, \u201cYou got to break a couple of eggs to make an omelet,\u201d according to the affidavit.Mr. Varnell also wrote a statement that he wanted posted on Facebook after the bombing, and sent it to the informant, the authorities said. The statement refers to the bombing as an act of \u201cretaliation\u201d for government actions that he said restricted Americans\u2019 freedom.\u201cIt was a wake-up call to both the government and the people,\u201d Mr. Varnell\u2019s statement said, according to officials.A variety of militia groups around the country regard themselves as 3 percenters. The term comes from their belief, debunked by historians, that only 3 percent of American colonists fought in the Revolution. These groups reject characterizations of them as racist or anti-government, describing themselves instead as pro-Constitution, pro-gun and, in many cases, pro-President Trump.The movement\u2019s logo, the Roman numeral III encircled by stars, was visible on at least one of the heavily armed, camouflage-clad militia members at the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va. Militia leaders claimed to be neutral and told reporters they were not affiliated with either the white nationalists or the counterprotesters.Mr. Varnell lives in Sayre, Okla., with his mother and other relatives. The authorities said that he had been outfitting a bunker next to his home with end-of-the-world supplies and that he had spoken to the informant of using marijuana and methamphetamine. He was arrested in 2013 in Weatherford, Okla., and charged with domestic assault and battery by strangulation; it was not immediately clear how that case was resolved.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More than 8,700 Rohingya Flee Myanmar Fighting This Week", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 As fighting in western Myanmar sent thousands of refugees fleeing to Bangladesh, the United Nations top human rights official on Tuesday urged Myanmar\u2019s military to show restraint and accused the office of the country\u2019s de facto leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, of issuing \u201cirresponsible\u201d statements that could endanger international aid organizations.In comments posted on Facebook on Sunday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office said the authorities were investigating reports that staff members of international organizations \u201chad participated\u201d in operations carried out by \u201cextremist terrorists.\u201d It said biscuits supplied by the United Nations food agency had been found at a rebel camp site.Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on Tuesday that he utterly condemned the violence and that those responsible should be brought to justice. But he also rebuked Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s office for its statements, which he said were \u201cirresponsible and only serve to increase fears and the potential for further violence.\u201d\u201cI am extremely concerned that the unsupported allegations against international aid organizations place their staff in danger and may make it impossible for them to deliver essential aid,\u201d Mr. al-Hussein said in a statement issued by his office in Geneva.The comments, which appeared to have been removed from Facebook on Tuesday, pointed to the deterioration in relations between the government and the United Nations since October, when insurgents attacked police border posts in Rakhine.Mr. al-Hussein lamented the latest upsurge in violence but said, \u201cIt was predicted and could have been prevented.\u201d He said \u201cdecades of persistent and systematic human rights violations, including the very violent security responses to the attacks since October 2016, have almost certainly contributed to the nurturing of violent extremism.\u201dIn the security crackdown after those attacks, around 80,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, bringing accounts of summary executions, mass rape and villagers burned alive in their homes. United Nations investigators who looked into those accounts said Myanmar\u2019s army and police might have committed crimes against humanity.Mr. al-Hussein said that Myanmar\u2019s authorities should \u201cissue clear instructions to security forces to refrain from using disproportionate force\u201d and that those who use excessive force should be held accountable.The latest attacks in Rakhine have raised alarm among aid and human rights groups that Myanmar may be on the brink of returning to similar violence. On Tuesday, the United Nations said it had suspended aid operations in the state and had relocated noncritical international and national staff members from Maungdaw, the state capital, because of safety concerns.Most refugees who crossed the border in recent days were women and children, and there were reports that some were wounded, the United Nations refugee agency told reporters in Geneva. It voiced concern that the number of people needing help would rise in coming days. Thousands more Rohingya were stranded on the Myanmar side of the border, with Bangladeshi guards pushing back many of those trying to get across. The refugee agency called on Bangladesh to open its border and allow those fleeing violence to find safety.Human Rights Watch said Tuesday that Myanmar\u2019s army had built up its forces in northern Rakhine since last week\u2019s attacks. The group said that new satellite images pointed to widespread burning in at least 10 areas of northern Rakhine, covering a larger amount of territory than did the October violence.The cause of the fires could not be identified but some occurred in locations that corresponded with areas where witnesses reported deliberate burning of houses by the military, Human Rights Watch said. It called for international pressure on the government to reveal what is taking place there.The United Nations has set up a three-person fact-finding mission led by a veteran Indonesian investigator, Marzuki Darusman, to look into allegations of human rights violations by military and security forces in Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine. The Myanmar government, however, has said it will not cooperate or allow them to visit.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Suspect in Charlottesville Attack Had Displayed Troubling Behavior", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe carnage \u2014 the chaos, the cries and the death of a woman \u2014 began to unspool over a few stunning seconds on Saturday: James Alex Fields Jr., the police said, aimed his sleek Dodge Challenger and slammed it into a crowd in Charlottesville, Va.Although the crash was a grisly coda to a day of clashes between white nationalists and their opponents, family members, acquaintances and internet posts suggested that Mr. Fields had mostly gone unnoticed by the authorities and researchers, even as he trafficked in radical views and unnerving behavior long before the outbreak of violence.As a young man in Kentucky, he sometimes espoused Nazi ideology at school. A military career ended in less than four months. On Saturday, before the crash that left Heather D. Heyer, 32, dead, and 19 others hurt, he stood in Charlottesville, donned a white shirt and clutched a shield that bore a symbol of the so-called alt-right. He is expected to appear in court on Monday to face an array of charges, including a count of second-degree murder; the federal authorities have opened a civil-rights inquiry.Mr. Fields spent most of his life in northern Kentucky and was raised near Cincinnati. His father was killed in a car accident in 1996, months before he was born.\u201cHe was a very quiet little boy,\u201d said an aunt, Pam Fields. \u201cWe\u2019re just treating this as a family issue. We\u2019re devastated as a family, and we really are praying for the victims and their families, and we are so sorry that this happened.\u201d\u201cOn many occasions there were times he would scream obscenities, whether it be about Hitler or racial slurs,\u201d a woman who attended middle school with Mr. Fields in Florence, Ky., said in an email on Sunday.The woman, who requested anonymity because she feared retaliation, said Mr. Fields \u201cmostly kept to himself\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t start fights or try to fight.\u201d But she described him as \u201cexceptionally odd and an outcast to be sure.\u201d\u201cHe wasn\u2019t afraid to make you feel unsafe,\u201d said the woman, who was among the students who said Mr. Fields had made them feel unnerved.As a freshman at Randall K. Cooper High School he wrote a report that, one teacher recalled, fell \u201cvery much along the party lines of the neo-Nazi movement.\u201dMr. Fields enlisted in the Army after he graduated from high school in 2015, but military records show that his service lasted less than four months. Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson, an Army spokeswoman, said Mr. Fields had been \u201creleased from active duty due to a failure to meet training standards.\u201d Mr. Fields, Colonel Johnson said, \u201cwas never awarded a military occupational skill nor was he assigned to a unit outside of basic training.\u201dThe sources of Mr. Fields\u2019s ideology were unclear on Sunday, but his Facebook page included memes and symbols associated with the far right.Mr. Fields was generally quiet, acquaintances said, and filled his time playing video games and working at a local grocery store. He and his mother eventually moved to the Toledo, Ohio, area, and Mr. Fields, a registered Republican, voted in the March 2016 presidential primary. By Saturday, he had driven his Challenger, his first car, to Charlottesville. He had told his mother that he was going to an event for the alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand what the rally was about or anything,\u201d she told The Blade. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was white supremacists,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump\u2019s not a supremacist.\u201dBut in Charlottesville, Mr. Fields stood among men believed to be associated with Vanguard America, a group whose manifesto declares that \u201ca government based in the natural law must not cater to the false notion of equality.\u201d After the crash, it sought to distance itself from Mr. Fields.Jonah Engel Bromwich and Kevin Williams contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Then came the water. \u201cIt bubbled up from the doors,\u201d she said, \u201cseeped in from the windows, everywhere you turned there would just be a new flowing puddle. It just kept filling. It passed the outlets. I was so scared, we didn\u2019t know what would happen.\u201dUpstairs, her father slept. She tried towels. She thought they\u2019d be ok. Then, at 4 a.m., a green light came from the street. It was the fire department, ready for rescue. She woke her father, Michael, 55, who stepped out of bed into a foot of water. Her mother Freda and her sister Ariel had gone to stay with a neighbor.Mr. Wadler grabbed his tefillin, Jewish prayer boxes often used by religious men. Neither Wadler had a moment to grab shoes. They climbed into a boat, the rain lashed at their backs, and they floated to an emergency truck.The truck bed was hard, damp and cold.\u201cI was sitting in the corner holding my dad really tight,\u201d Maya said. \u201cI usually just trust my parents that everything is going to be O.K. But I looked up and I saw that my dad was closing his eyes, the water was getting in his eyes. And I just thought: He has absolutely no idea where we are going to go.\u201d\u201cI was powerless,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget that ride.\u201dThe rescue team took Maya and Mr. Wadler to a fire station, where they are the only flood victims.As the sun rose, Mr. Wadler heard from his wife. She was trapped at the neighbor\u2019s home with little food and no plan. Friends began to send pictures of their neighborhood with water up to six feet.The effects associated with Tropical Storm Harvey are \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cunknown and beyond anything experienced,\u201d the National Weather Service said in a tweet.The Weather Service issued repeated flash flood warnings throughout Saturday night, and dry city streets turned to speeding rivers in a matter of minutes.

Their nominations:New York also was considered the capital for publishing piano sheet music, beginning in the 1800s, Mr. Schroeder told us, noting that the industry later dwindled with the advent of the internet.\u201cEvery time there was a stylistic change in what was popular,\u201d he added, \u201cit all came from New York City.\u201dHe described the instrument as \u201ca melodic percussion heartbeat\u201d of both the orchestra and the city.Mr. Rhoten explained how it\u2019s a musical centerpiece for the ensemble, both literally (the timpani typically sits in the back center of the group) and figuratively (timing-wise, it connects all of the other instruments). The New York Philharmonic is the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States, so its centerpiece also reminds us that our city is a centerpiece in the history of classical music.\u201cThe instrument that defines the global footprint of New York City is the turntable,\u201d said Mr. Sansano, because it helped catalyze the creation of rap and hip-hop, genres that he called \u201cpure N.Y.C.\u201dMr. Sansano acknowledged that the turntable, at least in the traditional sense of the word, is not an instrument, but \u201cmuch like the invention of the sustain pedal on a piano enabled Chopin, the turntable enabled a genre, as well as a global culture\u201d to grow out of our backyard.What instrument do you think is most emblematic of New York City?

{"Headline": "10 Missing After U.S. Navy Ship and Oil Tanker Collide Off Singapore", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Ten Navy sailors were missing and five were injured on Monday after a United States destroyer collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Singapore, the Navy said, the second accident involving a Navy ship and a cargo vessel in recent months.The guided-missile destroyer, the John S. McCain, was passing east of the Strait of Malacca on its way to a port visit in Singapore at 5:24 a.m. local time, before dawn broke, when it collided with the Alnic MC, a 600-foot vessel that transports oil and chemicals, the Navy said. The destroyer was damaged near the rear on its port, or left-hand, side.Ten sailors on the ship were unaccounted for, and five others were injured, a Navy official said. Ships with the Singapore Navy and helicopters from the assault ship America were rushing to search for survivors. Four of the injured were transported by a Singapore military helicopter to Singapore, where they were being treated for conditions that were not believed to be life-threatening. The fifth injured sailor did not require additional medical attention, according to the Seventh Fleet.A photo of the John S. McCain showed a gaping hole in its side right at the waterline, but the ship did not appear to be listing.No oil leaks have been reported in the area, according to the Singaporean authority.The Strait of Malacca, between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, is notoriously difficult to navigate because of congested traffic and episodes of piracy over the years.\u201cIt\u2019s always crowded, with ships entering Singapore and others passing by,\u201d said Shigeru Kojima, adviser of the Japan Captains\u2019 Association. \u201cThis is one of the top most difficult spots for ships going by.\u201dNavy ships \u201cfrequently transit\u201d the strait, said Cmdr. Clay Doss, a spokesman for the Seventh Fleet, with which the John S. McCain is deployed. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual at all,\u201d he said.Bonji Ohara, a research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation in Tokyo, said that one recurring problem was that while naval ships tended to have live crews on watch, most commercial ships work on autopilot mode to reduce costs, which can lead to problems in busy sea lanes.Nighttime duty on Navy ships like the John S. McCain is often in the hands of relatively young officers, between 22 and 24, according to a senior Navy officer. They are backed up by officers working the radar and looking out from the command center below the bridge. For the John S. McCain to have hit the Alnic MC, a handful of separate functions in the safety chain must have failed, the officer said.Commercial tankers can be reluctant to shift their course because maneuvering requires turning off the autopilot and costs time and money, the officer added. The Alnic MC has a gross tonnage roughly three times that of the John S. McCain.President Trump, asked about the collision by reporters at the White House, said, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d He later offered his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d to the sailors aboard the ship.On the destroyer\u2019s Facebook page, the ship\u2019s activities earlier this month were described as \u201ca patrol in the South China Sea in support of security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.\u201dA preliminary report on the June 17 accident described how seawater poured through a hole in the Fitzgerald\u2019s hull within 90 seconds, sending sailors racing from their flooding quarters. Both of the destroyer\u2019s top commanding officers were asleep when the collision occurred.In May, the Lake Champlain, a Navy guided-missile cruiser, collided with a South Korean fishing vessel, but no injuries resulted from that crash. In February, another such cruiser, the Antietam, ran aground in Tokyo Bay, gushing more than 1,000 gallons of hydraulic fluid near the American naval base at Yokosuka, Japan.The John S. McCain, the Antietam and the Fitzgerald are all in the Seventh Fleet and are based in Yokosuka. The ship involved in the collision on Monday is named after John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his son, John S. McCain Jr., a Navy admiral in the Vietnam era. They are the grandfather and father of Senator John McCain of Arizona, who offered his prayers for the crew.An earlier version of this article misstated John S. McCain Sr.\u2019s relationship to Senator John McCain of Arizona. John S. McCain Sr. was the senator\u2019s grandfather, not his father. The article also described the source of the ship\u2019s name incompletely. It is named after John S. McCain Sr. and John S. McCain Jr., not John S. McCain Sr. alone.Hannah Beech reported from Bangkok, and Matthew Haag from New York. Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Jane Perlez from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Survive in Tough Times, Restaurants Turn to Data-Mining", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe early diners are dawdling, so your 7:30 p.m. reservation looks more like 8. While you wait, the last order of the duck you wanted passes by. Tonight, you\u2019ll be eating something else \u2014 without a second bottle of wine, because you can\u2019t find your server in the busy dining room. This is not your favorite night out.The right data could have fixed it, according to the tech wizards who are determined to jolt the restaurant industry out of its current slump. Information culled and crunched from a wide array of sources can identify customers who like to linger, based on data about their dining histories, so the manager can anticipate your wait, buy you a drink and make the delay less painful.It can track the restaurant\u2019s duck sales by day, week and season, and flag you as a regular who likes duck. It can identify a server whose customers have spent a less-than-average amount on alcohol, to see if he needs to sharpen his second-round skills.So Big Data is staging an intervention.Both start-ups and established companies are scrambling to deliver up-to-the-minute data on sales, customers, staff performance or competitors by merging the information that restaurants already have with all sorts of data from outside sources: social media, tracking apps, reservation systems, review sites, even weather reports.They have an eager audience. The NPD Group, a market research company, is predicting \u201cflat\u201d growth in 2017 restaurant traffic, with a 2 percent decline among full-service restaurants and no growth for quick-service restaurants. A 2016 National Restaurant Association survey reported that four out of five restaurateurs believed that business would improve if they embraced technology, and a third worried that they were lagging in those efforts.In the old days, restaurateurs used ledgers to track sales, and scribbled notes about their customers\u2019 preferences or idiosyncrasies. Then along came point-of-sale software and reservation services that provided more sophisticated records and analysis, but created a tech tower of Babel, with most systems speaking their own dialect.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.These new tools make a paradoxical promise: that they can take restaurants back to the good old days, before the business grew so big.\u201cThe goal,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201cis to leverage the technology to do what we would do if we had one little restaurant and we were there all the time and knew every customer by name.\u201dMr. Oberholtzer and his two partners opened the first of two dozen cafeteria-style restaurants in Culver City, Calif., in 2006, and plan to open an equal number in the Northeast by 2020. Every new Tender Greens will rely on what he calls \u201ca whole rebuild of technology,\u201d because the 11-year-old system it uses is about as up-to-date as a beeper.\u201cIt gives us ways to recognize people who\u2019ve been in regularly, or haven\u2019t been in for a while or have specific preferences,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said.A regular diner who always orders the ni\u00e7oise salad will get a message on the app about the halibut special. A diner who always orders vegetarian options will not get the message about the summer hog roast. \u201cWe want to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs,\u201d Mr. Oberholtzer said, \u201csometimes before they even mention them.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t know that someone\u2019s going to become a regular, so you don\u2019t necessarily keep track of those people,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cBut the system does.\u201d It also tracks the top 100\u2019s dining companions when they split the check. Upserve sends a list of credit card numbers, dates of visits and items bought; the restaurant matches each number to a name, and a search on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn provides a face to go with it.\u201cWe\u2019re sure to recognize them\u201d the next time they come in, so the staff can welcome them back by name, Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt surprises people, in a nice way, when they didn\u2019t make the reservation themselves.\u201dEven the type of credit card contributes to the dossier. If a customer pays with an airline card, a server might mention travel. If a customer is a sports fan, he will most likely get a server who is as well.Customers who find the mining of personal data invasive can opt out, up to a point, but it requires effort: To avoid detection, they have to pay cash and not make reservations. Those who participate actively in the process get more information in return.In June 2015, the online reservation service OpenTable, which represents 43,000 restaurants worldwide, started to provide customized recommendations, just as Netflix and Amazon suggest programs or products based on a customer\u2019s history.If users sign up for the company\u2019s app and allow OpenTable access to their GPS, they receive recommendations for restaurants in the United States and several foreign countries, said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing.And if data can help a customer find a restaurant, it can also help a restaurant find its customers. To pinpoint potential locations in the Northeast that best reach what Mr. Oberholtzer calls Tender Greens\u2019s \u201cpsychographic\u201d \u2014 the college-educated diner who cares about health and locally produced food \u2014 he starts with data from a customer analytics firm that specializes in site selection.He refines that list with Google searches like \u201cplant-forward lifestyle,\u201d he said, and looks at where delivery systems like Uber and DoorDash do a lot of business.\u201cYou overlay and look for redundancy,\u201d he said, \u201cand that begins to tell the story of where you want to be.\u201dThe scorecard ranks servers on multiple criteria, which makes it easier for Ms. Williamson to identify the right waiter, for example, for a large party with children. She might not pick the server who sells the most. The more appropriate match could be a server who ranks higher in tip percentage than in sales, thanks to grateful families who tend to order less alcohol.Start-ups aspire to create even more streamlined software, but it isn\u2019t easy. \u201cWe\u2019re making a moon shot here,\u201d said Mr. Chowdhury of Salido, which originally set an August deadline for \u201ca fully operational stack\u201d of features but is only about three-quarters of the way there. The company has extended its deadline to early 2018, as development work continues with 64 existing clients.Still, some early adopters approach the new systems warily. Mr. Guidara, who also uses Avero at Eleven Madison Park, thinks technology is great for a fast-casual operation that emphasizes volume and delivery, and for the business side at a fine-dining operation. It has no place, he said, when it comes to service at Eleven Madison Park or the NoMad, where he and Mr. Humm rely on traditional methods of high-end hospitality: expertise, eye contact and a hair-trigger response to a diner\u2019s every need.\u201cWhen I worked as a controller, in accounting capacities, we used it quite often,\u201d Mr. Guidara said. \u201cBut from an experiential, guest-facing point of view, we don\u2019t use it. That\u2019s never been how we approach things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m pushed constantly about these new systems,\u201d Mr. Kinch said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s all about the guest? I think that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I place a tremendous value on direct eye contact and a genuine smile.\u201dAt Oriole, the Sandovals have left sake on the menu despite data showing that it doesn\u2019t sell well. \u201cWe go by our gut,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cIt pairs well with a lot of the courses, it\u2019s very versatile, and it speaks to how we\u2019re willing not to go the traditional route.\u201dThe sheer glut of new restaurant data systems can be overwhelming, even to those who embrace them.\u201cAt least once a week, I get something about a new start-up with a new gadget that\u2019s going to make our lives so much better,\u201d said Sisha Ortuzar, Mr. Colicchio\u2019s partner at \u2018Wichcraft. \u201cThey\u2019re distractions.

{"Headline": "These Tacos Get Their Fire From the Grill", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteIt\u2019s not the warm tortilla or the tender filling that makes a taco for me \u2014 it\u2019s the condiments. The main protein almost doesn\u2019t matter, be it fish, beef tongue or crisp pork carnitas. As long as there are several kinds of salsas and hot sauces, alongside the lime wedges, sliced radishes and chopped onions available at the taco truck, you\u2019ll find me happily dabbing, squeezing and layering before taking a bite.At home, though, your choice of taco condiments is usually more limited. How many salsas are you willing to make?Your best move, then, is to make a well-considered salsa that works with the protein at hand, and to put out a crisp vegetable or two as a counterpart to the soft filling in the warm tortillas.In this summery recipe, grilled skirt steaks, marinated with garlic, coriander, cumin, chile powder and lime zest, serve as the protein. The longer you let the meat sit in the seasonings, the more intense the flavors will become. Marinating overnight is best, if you can plan ahead, but just an hour or so makes a difference.Even if you don\u2019t get around to putting it into tacos, the steak itself is flavorful enough to stand alone. Serve it with a salad, and enjoy its beefy simplicity.That said, the salsa is worth the effort, and you can make it as the meat marinates.To make it, first grill the onion, garlic and a jalape\u00f1o. This caramelizes their flesh, making them tender and sweet. Then, add another jalape\u00f1o \u2014 this one raw \u2014 and a squirt of lime juice for bracing, fiery notes that you can adjust to taste. The jalape\u00f1o seeds will make everything spicier; adding more or less lime juice controls the acidity.For a bit of richness, I add avocado cubes to the salsa bowl. It\u2019s not a common move; usually, if they are paired with tacos, avocados are mashed into guacamole or neatly sliced on the side. But their gentle flavor and buttery texture work well here. Be sure to stir gently after adding them: You want them to remain little velvety pillows until you bite in.cookingAdvertisement"}

If you had tried the wine 15 years ago, it would have been completely different. Back then, many blaufr\u00e4nkisch producers were trying to get their wines to fit in among the fashionable reds of the time. They threw scads of new oak barrels at the wine, and tried pumping up its power. The results were stolid bores.But other producers had a different vision. Taking their inspiration from the subtler wines of Burgundy, they aimed for seduction rather than brute force, and the results were telling.The three wines I recommend are:Let me reiterate my usual suggestion: Give these reds a slight chill before serving.

We\u2019re happily in love and plan to go to law school together after we finish college. Here\u2019s the thing: I desperately want him to invite me home for Thanksgiving to meet his family. My family is wonderful, but it\u2019s spread out and dysfunctional. His is stable and traditional, almost movie-like. I could always ask him. But in my mind, the invitation would mean so much more if it originated with him. Any thoughts?A.J.Other than \u201cplan ahead much?\u201d Two things: Don\u2019t Norman Rockwell your boyfriend\u2019s family. When I was your age, my family looked stable and movie-like, too. Then, without a word of warning, my father killed himself with a rifle. Families are always more complex than they seem. By idealizing your boyfriend\u2019s clan, you (inadvertently) limit the stories he can tell you about them.As for Thanksgiving, only Disney princesses are always asked to dance. Just sitting back and collecting invitations is an outstanding fantasy. Who doesn\u2019t want to be wanted? But getting the things we really prize \u2014 like that job promotion or meeting our boyfriend\u2019s mother \u2014 is better accomplished by straight-up asking for them. Hints and trickery are cheap. Go with a calm, direct request. How can our boyfriends know our drumstick fantasies unless we tell them?I have a co-worker who is great. But she often says things like, \u201cIf I\u2019m not fired before then\u201d or \u201cIf I\u2019m still around.\u201d We work for a small nonprofit. There\u2019s very little chance of anyone getting fired unless a huge mistake was made. I\u2019ve tried to assure her that her job is safe, but the comments keep coming. Is there another route to go?MATTHappily, there is always another route. Try asking her, \u201cIs there a reason you keep saying you\u2019re going to be fired?\u201d Then hear her out. She may intend her remarks as charmingly modest or self-deprecating. If you are in a supervisory or mentoring role with her (or willing to be a busybody, which I sanction here), say: \u201cYou do a great job. But you\u2019re not doing yourself any favors by constantly planting the seeds of your incompetence or temporary status.\u201d Still, self-confidence is a hard trick for some of us to pull off. So engage her concerns. Don\u2019t boss her around.My sister-in-law (my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife) has declined the last six invitations to events given by me or in my honor. Her excuses are not convincing: Traffic was bad so she had to turn around; her child was too tired for a 5 p.m. dinner. When I do see her at family events, she is cold to me, while warm to others. I\u2019ve only had one brief conversation with her, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything to warrant this behavior. How many more times do I let her decline before removing her from my guest list entirely?ANONYMOUSBy your own account, your sister-in-law doesn\u2019t decline the invitations; she accepts, then cancels at the last minute. This may make her an even bigger horror show. Or it may demonstrate a desire to attend that\u2019s overtaken by anxiety as party time draws nigh. This also fits with your statement that you\u2019ve had only one conversation with her. You may be extended family, but you\u2019re still strangers.Don\u2019t get me wrong: Bailing at the last minute is rude. But before we declare her dead to you, invite her for coffee one on one. Say: \u201cWe\u2019ve never gotten the chance to sit down together. Can we make a date?\u201d If she refuses, I give up. She\u2019s probably not crazy about you. (We can\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.) But maybe she\u2019ll say yes. And you\u2019ll discover that banquets and strangers are the problem here \u2014 not you!I knocked on my neighbors\u2019 door to borrow their lawn mower. No one answered, so I opened the door to call inside. No one seemed to be home. But then I saw their 6-year-old son in the hall, wearing one of his mother\u2019s dresses with a yellow towel on his head. I was stunned! So, I left quickly. Should I say something?JIMAre you honestly claiming never to have played in your mother\u2019s closet or with her jewelry box? If so, you are the only boy I know who didn\u2019t. Kids pretend! It\u2019s practically obligatory \u2014 and signifies nothing, at least as far as you\u2019re concerned. Keep quiet. Next time, wait for your neighbors to answer their door.

Yes, it\u2019ll have a bird\u2019s-eye view of Central Park.Mr. Achatz and his partner, Nick Kokonas, didn\u2019t lack for suitors after the first Aviary opened to much ballyhoo in 2011. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many offers to do another in Tokyo or London,\u201d Mr. Achatz said. \u201cWe\u2019d been talking to the Mandarin for over five years.\u201d The early discussions centered on Mr. Achatz\u2019s bringing one of his famous Chicago restaurants to Manhattan, but pivoted to talk about the bar.The Aviary NYC will probably be the first of several branches. Micah Melton, the bars\u2019 beverage director, noted that there are many Mandarin Oriental hotels around the world. \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely have at least one more location, if not two or three,\u201d he said.Much of the Aviary NYC will be familiar to anyone who has visited the Chicago bar. The d\u00e9cor is hotel-lounge lush. The bartenders are out of sight, their workings as mysterious as those of Oz behind his curtain. Drinks will arrive in custom-made receptacles and glassware, fizzing and smoking and infusing away. Just as in Chicago, the Aviary NYC is paired with the Office, a more traditional bar that opened in the hotel in June.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.But there will be new features as well. The 90-seat Aviary NYC will open in the morning, inviting the prospect of day-drinking, and offer tea and coffee creations. Established drinks will be tweaked to reflect local tastes. One cocktail, which is typically served in a plastic bag filled with aromas associated with oatmeal, will now smell and taste like a New York breakfast of bagels and coffee.There will also be food \u2014 as progressive as the drinks \u2014 from morning until close, including tasting menus of three, five and seven courses, paired with cocktails. As in Chicago, there will be two tables in the drinks kitchen where guests can interact with bartenders and chefs, and enjoy an 11-to-13-course menu with cocktails and spirits.When the Chicago Aviary opened, elaborate trappings like these were novel. Cocktail customers have matured since then, and Mr. Achatz suspects that less indoctrination into the unique ways of the bar will be needed in New York.\u201cAromas and special vessels were pretty new seven years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are less uncommon. I don\u2019t think it will be as jarring.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Donald Trump Is Driving Up Health Insurance Premiums", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHealth insurance premiums for 2018 are on the rise for many, and for that, most of the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of President Trump.In recent days, a bevy of insurers have announced significant increases for Americans who purchase their coverage on the exchanges: a minimum of 12.5 percent by Covered California, 34 percent by Anthem in Kentucky and 43.5 percent by Medica in Iowa, to name just a few.Still more hikes may come from these insurers and others, who cite uncertainty around the Affordable Care Act as the principal culprit in this disturbing trend.Of that, just 8 percentage points will result from medical inflation, and 2 percentage points will stem from the reinstatement of an Obamacare health insurance tax; the balance will be related to the uncertainty that Mr. Trump has created around key pieces of Obamacare.The largest portion of the total \u2014 about 15 percentage points \u2014 is connected to the potential demise of the cost-sharing reductions (known as C.S.R.s), payments made by the government to insurers to help cover out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles that lower-income Americans can\u2019t afford.Those subsidies, which were created by the Obama health care legislation and which benefit seven million Americans, have been in limbo since House Republicans sued in 2014, contending that they needed to be appropriated by Congress, which wasn\u2019t going to happen as long as Republicans controlled each chamber.Conservatives won the first round in court, but that decision was stayed pending appeal, allowing both the Obama and Trump administrations to continue to make the monthly payments.President Trump has threatened to end the subsidies but has yet to take definitive action. A decision was promised by Aug. 4, but Mr. Trump decamped to his New Jersey golf resort with nary a word about C.S.R.s.As a result, many of the insurance companies that have already announced their increases have either baked in increases assuming loss of the subsidies or say that they will impose further hikes if the subsidies are not continued.The silence around the C.S.R.s is consistent with the new administration\u2019s overall approach to the A.C.A.: continually badmouthing it and taking small steps to undermine it without unleashing a full-force assault.Even without \u201crepeal and replace\u201d legislation emerging from Congress \u2014 an unlikely event at this point \u2014 the administration has enormous authority to shape the functioning of the A.C.A.Around the same time, the new team pulled advertising designed to encourage enrollments, causing sign-ups for 2017 to fall modestly short of expectations, especially among younger and healthier Americans, who are much more likely to wait until the last minute to enroll.More recently, the administration canceled contracts with two companies that helped Americans in 18 cities find plans.All of these actions \u2014 and more \u2014 could amount to undermining the individual mandate, a step that Mr. Gaba says would add another 4 percentage points to 2018 premium increases.At the same time, some steps toward preparing for the next enrollment period are proceeding normally, such as an annual meeting in June with \u201cnavigators\u201d who guide consumers in their choices of plans.In addition, the Trump team has been allocating funds to states with weak exchange markets to encourage insurers to continue to provide coverage.But what else the administration will or won\u2019t do as the November opening of the enrollment period approaches remains a mystery.An hour later, the spokeswoman, Jane Norris, tried to withdraw the statement and refused to comment further. Ms. Norris\u2019s office did not respond at all to my inquiry.So it well may be up to Mr. Trump to decide, in effect, the fate of the exchanges, which supply about 12 million Americans with their coverage. With final premium increase decisions due soon, even inaction could be devastating.Advertisement"}

One activist at the rally, Kirsten John Foye of the National Action Network, pledged to organize protests at Success Academy campuses when the school year begins.And the chairman of a board of trustees committee at the State University of New York, which reviews charter school applications for approval, said he had asked their counsel to review any options they have to deal with Mr. Loeb.\u201cThe students in our charter schools are overwhelmingly kids of color, and I think they deserve to have teachers and administrators and boards that inspire them,\u201d Joseph Belluck, the chairman of the Charter Schools Committee, said in an interview, calling Mr. Loeb\u2019s remark \u201creprehensible.\u201dMr. Loeb\u2019s spokeswoman did not return multiple emails and calls for comment.There has not just been pressure on Mr. Loeb, but also on the politicians whom he has showered with campaign cash in recent years. He has spent millions to back Republicans who control the state Senate, despite a slight numerical Democratic majority. Mr. Loeb has also donated $50,000 to a group of breakaway Democrats, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, who have formed a coalition with the Republicans.Mr. Loeb has also given generously to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo: more than $170,000, including money from Mr. Loeb\u2019s wife. Mr. Cuomo did not attend Monday\u2019s rally; one of his senior advisers, Alphonso David, came on his behalf.Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, Yvette Clarke and Adriano Espaillat, former Representative Charlie Rangel, Senator Mike Gianaris, a top deputy to Ms. Stewart-Cousins, and Letitia James, the city\u2019s public advocate, were among those who spoke at the event on Monday.The issues of Mr. Loeb and the I.D.C., which has existed since 2011, were blurred at the rally, as alternating speakers denounced both.Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, announced at the rally to loud cheers that he was returning a donation he received years ago from Mr. Loeb and giving the funds to a Democratic challenger to an I.D.C. member.\u201cYou have to have zero tolerance for hate speak,\u201d said Mr. Stringer, who had received $9,000 in 2011, state records show. \u201cAt some point, you have to put your money where your mouth is.\u201dAsked about what Mr. Cuomo \u2014 whom state activists and at least one national Democratic group have called upon to return Mr. Loeb\u2019s money \u2014 should do, Mr. Stringer demurred. \u201cEveryone has to make their own decision,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Advertising Giant WPP Lowers Forecast as Clients Cut Back", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWPP, the world\u2019s largest advertising group, cut its growth forecast for the year as clients led by consumer goods companies cut back on marketing budgets, raising broader concerns about the health of the industry.With major American companies like Procter & Gamble facing sluggish growth, traditional providers of mass marketing like agencies and television networks are feeling the ripple effects. At the same time, the disruptive companies threatening those established players are typically growing online without the help of agencies and TV ads, at least in the beginning.\u201cTo the extent that we\u2019re seeing growth in the total advertising market, we\u2019re seeing a substitution of the Dollar Shave Clubs of the world for the Gillettes of the world,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a media analyst at Pivotal Research Group. \u201cIt\u2019s the digitally native brands that are taking share, both from a consumer level and also when it comes to their spending on advertising.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe advertisers that are growing are not the ones who benefit disproportionately either from TV or from agencies.\u201dWPP, which owns agencies including Y&R and Ogilvy & Mather, said annual net sales may be flat or grow up to 1 percent as it reported that the measure shrank in the first half of the year. The company\u2019s stock tumbled 11 percent in London and its closing price was the lowest in more than a year.The company said that consumer packaged goods companies, which account for a third of its revenue, cut spending in response to pressure from digital competition and activist investors. But Martin Sorrell, WPP\u2019s chief executive, said in an earnings call on Wednesday that the company believed its clients would have to spend more on media and agency fees once the marketing cuts began affecting their sales.Others in the industry are not so sure.\u201cThe way I think about advertising is it\u2019s in secular decline and I need to think about products and services much more than I need to think about communication,\u201d said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief growth officer for the Publicis Groupe.He added that it was now so easy for start-ups to compete with entrenched brands online that \u201cmarketers are going to have to invest more money into transforming their businesses and coming up with superior products and services.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re probably going to have to spend in fees somewhere,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s to agencies or system integrators or consulting companies to help them rethink things and come up with new ways of doing stuff. But I\u2019m not convinced that the way out of this is to spend more money in traditional or other media.\u201dWPP\u2019s report, which followed muted results from rivals including Publicis and the Interpublic Group of Companies, came after two quarters of declines in national TV advertising. Time Warner said this month that it expected ad sales at Turner to \u201cdecline in the low single digits\u201d in the third quarter because of softening ratings.That says something about the health of agencies\u2019 biggest clients, said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen national TV this weak in two consecutive quarters absent a recession,\u201d he said.He sees the issues facing major ad agencies as similar to those confronted by the companies selling TV commercials. Both tend to serve Fortune 500 companies that can afford their services. Much of the advertising growth of digital players like Facebook, though, is coming from a plethora of small- to medium-size businesses.\u201cFor traditional people, they\u2019re kind of stuck with a limited number of clients that are not expanding their marketing spend,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said. \u201cAt the same time, the digital companies are really benefiting from companies that are maybe internet-only advertisers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memorize That Poem!", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLATE one night this spring, Justin Snider, an assistant dean at Columbia University, was riding the uptown No. 2 in Manhattan when the train ground to a halt. After about 15 minutes \u2014 with little information about the delay and no cell service \u2014 everyone in the car was getting restless. Suddenly, inspiration struck. \u201cI asked neighboring passengers if they wanted to hear some Shakespeare, and no one objected,\u201d Mr. Snider told me.He had memorized Hamlet\u2019s \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d speech more than 15 years earlier, to pass the time on a cross-country bike trip. \u201cI was definitely nervous because I\u2019d never performed publicly before,\u201d he said. Although his jaded audience neglected to clap when he finished \u2014 they did applaud when the train started to move again \u2014 Mr. Snider was pleased that he didn\u2019t forget a line.The soliloquy was fixed in the architecture of his brain, ready to serve in a moment of boredom or underground anxiety. It\u2019s no coincidence that Mr. Snider has asked students to memorize poetry many times in his career in education.Since ancient times, humans have memorized and recited poetry. Before the invention of writing, the only way to possess a poem was to memorize it. Long after scrolls and folios supplemented our brains, court poets, priests and wandering bards recited poetry in order to entertain and connect with the divine. For individuals, a poem learned by heart could be a lifeline \u2014 to grapple with overwhelming emotion or preserve sanity amid the brutalities of prison and warfare.Yet poetry memorization has become deeply unfashionable, an outmoded practice that many teachers and parents \u2014 not to mention students \u2014 consider too boring, mindless and just plain difficult for the modern classroom. Besides, who needs to memorize when our smartphones can instantly call up nearly any published poem in the universe?In fact, the value of learning literature by heart \u2014 particularly poetry \u2014 has only grown. All of us struggle with shrinking attention spans and a public sphere that is becoming a literary wasteland, bereft of sophisticated language or expressions of empathy beyond one\u2019s own Facebook bubble.For students, who seem to have less and less patience for long reading assignments, perhaps now is the time to bring back poetry memorization. Let\u2019s capitalize on their ear for the phony free verse of Twitter and texting and give them better words to make sense of themselves and their world.By the 1920s, educators increasingly questioned such poetry\u2019s \u201crelevance\u201d to students\u2019 lives. They began to abandon memorization in favor of teaching methods that emphasized self-expression, although the practice remained popular until about 1960 \u2014 and still endures in some foreign language classes (to pass a college Russian course, I had to memorize some Pushkin).The truth is that memorizing and reciting poetry can be a highly expressive act. And we need not return to the Victorians\u2019 narrow idea of the canon to reclaim poetry as one of the cheapest, most durable tools of moral and emotional education \u2014 whether you go in for Virgil, Li Po, Rumi or Gwendolyn Brooks (ideally, all four).Yet every good poem grapples with some essential piece of human experience. \u201cRimbaud wrote that poem when he was young, and he was talking about love. I related to him,\u201d Ms. Huggins said. (He writes: \u201cWe talked a lot and feel a kiss on our lips/Trembling there like a small insect.\u201d)\u201cReciting a poem will help you express what you\u2019re trying to say,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like when I need to pray about something, I\u2019ll look into a devotional, and those words can start me off.\u201d Ms. Huggins grew up Episcopalian, but even the resolutely secular need to borrow words of supplication, anguish or thanks every now and then.Understanding a good poem is hard \u2014 all the more reason to memorize it. Ask students to write a paper on Wordsworth, and once they turn it in, they consign the text to oblivion. But if they memorize his lament, years from now \u2014 perhaps while they are cleaning up their child\u2019s chocolate-smeared face after birthday cake \u2014 they may suddenly grasp his nostalgia for \u201cDelight and liberty, the simple creed/Of Childhood\u201d and the bittersweet truth that \u201cOur noisy years seem moments in the being/Of the eternal Silence.\u201dThe challenge is partly the point. When Jason Jones told students in his survey of British literature at Central Connecticut State University that they would have to memorize three poems of at least 20 lines each, he was prepared for groans and cries of outrage. \u201cI was interested in messing around a little with the mutual nonaggression pact between teachers and students, the one that says, \u2018As long as you don\u2019t expect too much from us beyond a couple of papers, a midterm and a final, we\u2019ll perform for you and we\u2019ll all get through this,\u2019 \u201d he told me. \u201cI was interested in things that will bring students into closer contact with the material in the class.\u201dColleagues teased Mr. Jones about \u201chow there\u2019d be lines outside my door of students quietly weeping or looking like they were about to vomit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d stare at a copy of the poem to prompt them, or turn and look away if they wanted.\u201d In the end, he said, \u201ctheir worst fears were typically not confirmed.\u201dMr. Jones didn\u2019t try to sell his students on a profound spiritual experience or practice in public speaking. Memorizing a poem is just as valuable as an exercise in close reading, a chance to observe the exertions of our own brains. \u201cWhen you memorize, you start to notice the things that you notice, your own habits of attention, your habits of reading,\u201d said Mr. Jones, who is now the director of educational technology at Trinity College in Hartford.THAT has been my experience. Ordinarily, I am a terrible reader of poetry. I am impatient; I prefer straightforward prose that tells me what it means. But this summer, I started devoting about 10 minutes a day to memorizing a few poems \u2014 one of Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, some Gerard Manley Hopkins, some Longfellow.Every time I bumbled through a stanza, I ruminated on each word a little more. I played with tone and emphasis. \u201cPoetry needs to be chewed over multiple times before you can begin to get what it is,\u201d Justin Snider, the subway Shakespearean, told me.Memorize a poem. Find your kindred spirits across the centuries so that \u2014 as W. H. Auden counseled \u2014 you might, \u201ccomposed like them/Of Eros and of dust,/Beleaguered by the same/Negation and despair,/Show an affirming flame.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Another analogy is to think of opening the cut piece of meat like a book. In the case of a four-pound pork loin, picture a nice big tome \u2014 \u201cMoby-Dick,\u201d perhaps.The advantage of this kind of trimming is that the slimmed-down slab of meat will cook faster. For my pork loin, this means less than 30 minutes on the grill, instead an hour or more in the oven. (Do not substitute pork tenderloin, as it is an entirely different cut.)I like to marinate butterflied pork loin with plenty of garlic, herbs, cumin and lemon. But you can adapt the basic cooking technique and flavor it any which way. Or leave it plain and porky, rubbing it down with salt and a little pepper.Just be sure to at least season the meat at least a few hours in advance. As the salt dissolves and forms a brine, it helps the pork retain its moisture.Then don\u2019t overcook it. Pull the meat off the grill when it\u2019s still medium rare (135 degrees on an instant-read thermometer) so it stays nice and juicy and beautifully pink in the center.A grilled pork loin may not be fluttery or delicate, but it\u2019s hearty and luscious enough to satisfy a hungry crowd.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thinning Hair? A New Treatment Offers Hope", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkin DeepWhen Heidi Imhof started losing her hair at 42, she also started losing sleep. Ms. Imhof, a lawyer, was afraid that blow-drying her straight dark hair would hasten the shedding, so she got up two hours early to shower and apply mousse and volumizers. When her hair finally air-dried, she\u2019d pull it back, hoping to hide the bald patches on her scalp.\u201cI was desperate,\u201d she said.Ms. Imhof, who lives in Land O\u2019Lakes, Fla., was skeptical. The company\u2019s before and after photos seemed too good to be true. But she went for a consultation and made the cut. (Harklinikken\u2019s products are not available to anyone with autoimmune illnesses like alopecia or baldness from scarring, or anyone who is unlikely to see at least a 30 percent increase in growth.)After three months of applying the $88-a-month serum, Ms. Imhof was so excited by the results that she overcame her embarrassment about the subject and posted her own before-and-after photos on Facebook.\u201cYou can\u2019t see holes in my hair anymore,\u201d she said.Harklinikken (\u201chair clinic\u201d in Danish) inspires great loyalty. Four out of five users come as referrals from satisfied customers, said Lars Skjoth, the company\u2019s founder and chief scientist. The results are certainly compelling. After four months of daily application \u2014 that is, working the tea-colored tonic into the hair section by section, then letting it sit on the scalp for six hours \u2014 most users regain at least 30 percent of lost density, and some as much as 60 percent, according to company figures.Mr. Skjoth said the plan is to have a presence in every state in the next two years. The company recently opened outposts in Tampa, Fla., and Beverly Hills, Calif.Panos Vasiloudes, a Tampa dermatologist and Harklinikken\u2019s medical director, said the company has double-blind, placebo-controlled studies it hopes to publish next year in peer-reviewed journals. Such studies are the one thing some dermatologists say they need to recommend the product to patients.For now, Maryanne Senna, a dermatologist and the director of the Hair Academic Innovative Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said the best she can tell patients who ask \u2014 and a lot of them do \u2014 is that Harklinikken won\u2019t do any harm.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I really want it to work,\u201d said Dr. Senna, who also teaches at Harvard Medical School. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of options, and I\u2019d love to be able to say to my patients, \u2018This is something you can try that is worth the money.\u2019 But I can\u2019t do that yet.\u201dHarklinikken\u2019s formula, refined over 20 years, is derived from plants and cow\u2019s milk. That\u2019s the most Mr. Skjoth will say about it. In the 1990s, clients mixed it with Rogaine, Mr. Skjoth said, \u201cand then we took the Rogaine part away and started focusing on the actual liquid.\u201dSmall studies have shown the efficacy of various plant-derived ingredients, mostly in mice. But two potential explanations for Harklinikken\u2019s success have little to do with its formula.One is how much emphasis the company places on compliance, the major stumbling block in the efficacy of any treatment, said Dr. Senna, an author of studies on the subject. Prospective users are questioned about their ability to stick to a regimen because the extract must be applied every day, and they are told that the more conscientious they are, the better. Users are also reminded and encouraged with regular check-ins.Clients must also use the company\u2019s shampoo, conditioner and styling products, forsaking all others \u2014 a psychological as well as a financial buy-in, Dr. Senna said. (Mr. Skjoth, who has a master\u2019s degree in nutrition and chemistry but is not a doctor, said this is because other products may clog the scalp, causing hair loss.)Hair changes about as fast as grass grows, which is to say it\u2019s extraordinarily slow and not visible to anyone checking impatiently in the mirror every day. But during regular follow-up appointments, Harklinikken uses high-tech equipment to photograph and magnify the scalp and count new hairs and active follicles, which motivates users to adhere to the regimen. Too many people give up on treatments like Rogaine and low-level-light devices before they\u2019ve had a chance to work, Dr. Senna said.It\u2019s also possible that some of Harklinikken\u2019s users are women whose hair would have grown back even if they\u2019d done nothing. Many women who arrive in a dermatologist\u2019s office with prior diagnoses of female pattern hair loss actually have what\u2019s called telogen effluvium. That\u2019s a period of acute shedding of hair \u2014 meaning up to 60 percent of hair \u2014 three months after a triggering event like pregnancy, significant weight loss or starting or stopping hormone medications.\u201cOnce that hair has stopped shedding, it does regrow, at a rate of about a centimeter a month,\u201d said Dr. Senna, who suffered from the condition after each of her pregnancies. She shares photos of herself with patients, to show she can sympathize. In one, her entire frontal hairline clearly is growing back in. \u201cIf I\u2019d used a treatment, I would have thought it was a miracle drug,\u201d she said.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t: \u2018You\u2019re going to get a full head of hair,\u2019\u201d said Jon Centella, 35, of Apollo Beach, Fla., who started seeing peach fuzz after four months. \u201cIt was: \u2018We\u2019ll give you 30 percent,\u2019 and that\u2019s what made me comfortable enough to give it a shot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Culture Wars Have Come to Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe culture wars that have consumed politics in the United States have now landed on Silicon Valley\u2019s doorstep.Silicon Valley\u2019s politics have long skewed left, with a free-market\u2019s philosophy and a dash of libertarianism. But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore\u2019s firing has now plunged the nation\u2019s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country.Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Mr. Damore\u2019s comments carried additional weight to people on either side of the political spectrum because he was an engineer at Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.Alongside other giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Apple, these companies \u201care seen as pillars of our society,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cControversy and statements that emanate from these employees take on a different heft.\u201dThe technology industry has long marched in lock step on issues such as supporting immigration and diversity, even though their companies remained largely male, white and Asian. But last year\u2019s election of Mr. Trump \u2014 with his broadsides against political correctness, his coarse language toward women and his actions to restrict immigration and deny climate change \u2014 seemed to threaten many of those ideals.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s words may have made dissenters in the tech industry more comfortable about speaking out.\u201cTrump, in a sense, licensed people to express what some people would call politically incorrect thoughts,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Business School. \u201cThen there\u2019s the other force that a lot of Trump\u2019s policies go against the inclusive ideals these companies espouse.\u201dMr. Damore\u2019s memo and dismissal transformed him into a hero on right-wing news sites like Breitbart, which has long criticized the political leanings of the tech industry.\u201cGoogle drives a big sector of tech into the arms of Trump: fires employee who wrote memo about women in tech jobs,\u201d Dr. Pinker wrote.One of the most outspoken supporters of Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley has been Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who has since faced derision from other people working in tech for his political stance. In a sign of how deep that ill feeling runs, Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings warned Mr. Thiel last August, a few weeks after Mr. Trump had accepted the Republican nomination for president, that he would face consequences for backing Mr. Trump.\u201cI see our board being about great judgment, particularly in unlikely disaster where we have to pick new leaders,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote in the email to Mr. Thiel, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \"I\u2019m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from \u2018different judgment\u2019 to \u2018bad judgment.\u2019 Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Hastings declined to comment through their spokesmen; neither challenged the authenticity of the email. Both of the men remain on Facebook\u2019s board.Mr. Luckey, through mutual agreement with his employer, stayed away from the Oculus offices to let the controversy die down, according to three people with knowledge of the episode who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. In December, before returning briefly to the office, he told colleagues he was committed to staying at the company, according to a copy of a message he posted on an internal discussion board, which was reviewed by The Times.But by the end of March, Oculus said he was no longer working there.A Facebook spokeswoman reiterated an earlier company statement saying that Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure was unrelated to his political views.

The island, roughly the size of Chicago and home to about 160,000 people, is about 2,200 miles southeast of North Korea.\u201cWe are with you 1,000 percent,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the call to Mr. Calvo, who invited the president to the island. \u201cYou are safe.

Others contend that the presence of the United States defense system is necessary, given the threats in the region.\u201cI think Guam is being used as a kind of pawn in this game,\u201d said Robert Underwood, president of the University of Guam. \u201cI think it\u2019s like our role in life.\u201dMr. Underwood, a former Guam delegate to Congress, said Guam should find a way to take advantage of its relationship with the federal government if the island continues as the platform to project the United States\u2019 military power in Asia.\u201cI think we should get more out of this relationship than what we are getting now,\u201d he said.Mr. Calvo, however, told Mr. Trump that he had \u201cnever felt more safe or so confident than with you at the helm.

{"Headline": "Fleece of the Century", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BoxingLAS VEGAS \u2014 The world finally had the two of them contained Saturday night, in a roped-off ring where they had to remain silent and just get on with it. Two mouthy welterweights, neither the best role model for his respective legion of young fans, throwing mocking looks and punches in a spectacle of the inevitable.So, then: Do the math.\u201cI thought it was close,\u201d said McGregor immediately after the fight, to the concurrence of no one.Mayweather, looking as though he had just returned from a light jog, summed things up with a charitable: \u201cI think we gave the fans what they wanted to see.\u201dPerhaps. Some wanted Mayweather to win, some wanted McGregor to overcome impossible odds \u2014 and some hoped that the two would manage to knock each other out. Mayweather has another record, a criminal one for hitting women, while McGregor has demonstrated a capacity for low verbal blows touching on race, misogyny, Mayweather\u2019s struggle with reading, you name it.They staged their performance before 14,623 fans at the T-Mobile Arena, many of the men in sharp suits and no socks, many of the women in cocktail dresses and heels, as if attired for a garish wake. There were A-list celebrities, D-list celebrities, people who consider themselves celebrities, swarms of Irish people wrapped in their country\u2019s tricolors, and a posse of young women wearing shirts emblazoned with the name of a company whose website requires that you confirm you\u2019re an adult. Also, some boxing fans.Then there were the rest of us, the world, with the combat-sport spectacle available for broadcast in more than 200 countries and territories. Millions of viewers eager to pay to see a pugilistic confection.Willing suckers, all.For months the two men had worked as hard in ginning up the match as training for it. During a four-city tour to promote the fight, they had engaged in foul-mouthed antics that reinforced how insufferable they might be in private company.In this arena, at least, McGregor outdid his opponent, wearing a suit that spelled out an expletive in pinstripes, and telling Mayweather to \u201cDance for me, boy.\u201d Mayweather is black, while McGregor has the type of white Irish skin that the comedian George Carlin once called \u201cphosphorescent.\u201dBut now it was time to bite down on a mouth guard and keep lips closed.In one corner fidgeted McGregor. He grew up in the somewhat scrappy Crumlin section of Dublin and chucked a job as a plumber\u2019s apprentice to focus on mixed martial arts. He has since become the sport\u2019s most popular star, with assorted championships and controversies under his belt.He is a working-class god to some in Ireland, a cringe-inducing embarrassment to others, especially given his habit of wrapping himself in the Irish flag as if it were a beach towel. He is quick-witted but crass, his lavish spending habits recalling for some the gross materialism that defined the rise and collapse of last decade\u2019s Celtic Tiger economy.In the other corner waited Mayweather, one of the most divisive sports figures of his day. Born in Grand Rapids, Mich., he grew up poor in a family dogged by drugs and crime, but rose to become arguably the best pound-for-pound boxer of his generation. His athletic skills and business acumen \u2014 in real estate, clothing and marketing, among other ventures \u2014 have made him astoundingly wealthy, an achievement he underscores by posing for photographs with stacks of money, the way that others might pose with their children.Now the bell sounded, and the veteran and the rookie \u2014 fighting at the super-welterweight level of between 148 and 154 pounds \u2014 approached each other on a blue mat sporting the name of a beer company. They raised their gloved hands.Or was it a reflection of \u2014 maybe even a distraction from \u2014 the times we live in, this Trumpian age when so much seems unsettled, if not unmoored? North Korea. Russia. Afghanistan. Sanctuary cities and border walls, the toppling of Confederate statues and the rise of white supremacists? In other words, race plus?Perhaps bits of all these themes were at play. So, too, was the age-old attraction of violent combat between men, the bloodlust we pretty up with smiling ring girls and tuxedoed announcers. But in the end, all the hype, all the blather, all the posturing, all the media, was about only one achingly obvious thing: money.As Paul Rouse, a professor at University College Dublin who specializes in sport, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big ball of candy floss being confected by a small group of men who are making themselves extremely rich by packaging up something that people have always done and selling it through modern telecommunications.\u201dDo some more math. With the fight\u2019s purse, plus merchandise sales, plus pay-per-views at $100 apiece, it is estimated that Mayweather \u2014 whose nickname is, in fact, \u201cMoney\u201d \u2014 will earn more than $200 million. McGregor, it is thought, will earn a paltry $100 million. Fitting, then, that the event took place in Las Vegas; staging it anywhere else would have been an affront to the mercenary gods. The match belonged here \u2014 deserved quarantining here \u2014 along the Strip, where any authenticity is often just another act of illusion that leaves you double-checking your wallet\u2019s whereabouts.A walk to the venue from any approach reinforced this belief, but a logical path to take was one effectively controlled by MGM Resorts International, the hospitality and entertainment behemoth that was a partner in the Mayweather-McGregor circus.This walk began at the Mandalay Bay resort, which rises from the sun-baked Nevada flatness like a 43-story stack of gilded bricks. Here, as everywhere, the twinned half-visages of Mayweather and McGregor glowered from posters and video screens, an Orwellian pair of Big Brothers on watch for any flagging in the suspension of disbelief.Not far from one of these advertisements there was a memorabilia store in which another sportsman claiming royalty, the former baseball star Pete Rose, often sits. Banned from Major League Baseball for gambling and denied induction into the Hall of Fame, the so-called Hit King has a regular gig here as a window-display attraction.The day before the fight, the squat legend was once again at his position, giving forced smiles for photographs and signing his name for money, each autograph like an author\u2019s signature on a book telling the cautionary tale of a fallen king.The mall led to the Luxor Las Vegas, a 30-story casino pyramid with an ancient Egyptian motif. Among its many attractions is one called \u201cBodies: The Exhibition,\u201d an intriguing look at the miracle of the human form that leaves presumably unmentioned the damage done, say, from repeated blows to the head.The Luxor then led to the Excalibur, a casino whose Medieval theme includes nightly jousting tournaments, which then led to New York-New York, a casino that does not, does not, evoke the city of its name. Up an escalator, through a parking garage, down another escalator and there, in the 105-degree sun, sat the T-Mobile Arena, where two supposed kings would supposedly collide.The stifling days preceding this night had been lightened by the thousands of McGregor fans who had come to support their man in states of infectious delusion.

Their delicate skins are loosely packed with ground beef, musky from cumin, and just barely pinched shut. They arrive dressed, resting on thick yogurt with an insistent beat of garlic and strewed with more ground beef in sunset slashes of long-broken-down tomatoes and onions.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.Ashak, indistinguishable from mantu from the outside, reveal green interiors lined with Chinese leeks, the closest Mr. Zaman can find to Afghan gandana. The fragrance is punchier than the flavor, which is lulling and tentatively sweet. Although theoretically vegetarian, ashak also come strewn with ground beef.Larger dishes are simple, gratifying arrangements of meat, be it lamb chops, dark and thrilling, with the tips of their bones nearly charred through; knobs of ground beef, burnished chicken thigh or lamb torn off the shank, the flesh still harboring an instinct to resist; or lamb korma, the lamb left to unknit itself in a pot of yogurt, tomatoes and onions kept seething until they weep sugar.Anchoring every plate is Kabuli palaw, the grains soaked and swollen with drippings from roasting lamb, then topped with fat, shining raisins and carrots, caramelized and chewy. Other vegetables come to the table in various states of surrender: a thatch of spinach with a sunny streak of preserved lemon; eggplant mellowed in the oven under tomatoes; okra, midway between crunchy and yielding.Brass samovars, their legs topped with tiny lion heads, stand by the kitchen. Tea is green or black, with sugar traditionally added to the first cup and the last cup untempered, bitter and strong. Here, too, is the drink of Afghan summers: dough, pronounced with the \u201cgh\u201d hard and half-swallowed, tongue curled to the back of the throat. Its base is yogurt, only slightly thinned by water, its creaminess cut by cucumber and flecks of dried mint. The salt is refreshing; there\u2019s not a hint of sweetness.The meal might end with sheer birinj, rice pudding scented with rose water and cinnamon, under a dusting of crushed pistachios. Or vanilla ice cream striped with rose-water syrup, improvised by Mr. Zaman, who weaves in and out of conversations as he checks on guests, with a flourish of silver hair and a frank smile.In Kabul, he was the youngest of 11 children, almost all of whom found their way to the United States, \u201cto live free and be happy in the best country in the world,\u201d he said.

It has altered our notions of privacy, tracking what we buy, what we search for online \u2014 and even our physical location at every moment of the day. Every business trying to reach mass-market consumer demand online knows that Google is the gatekeeper.The fact that it is a monopoly, with an almost 90 percent share of the search advertising business, is a given that we have all come to accept. It\u2019s Google\u2019s world; we just live in it. So it matters how this company works \u2014 who it hires, who it fires and why.When a company is dominant enough, it sets the tone for an entire era. In the fall of 1985, I was working as a vice president in the media mergers and acquisitions group at Merrill Lynch in Los Angeles. I would occasionally have to show up for a meeting at 5 a.m. in the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert. I would do this because Mike Milken, the king of junk bonds at Drexel, would demand it \u2014 once the trading day started at 6:30 a.m., he was unavailable.Executives were terrified that Drexel would start a raid on their companies. Politicians would seek Mr. Milken\u2019s counsel and his money. His \u201cwho\u2019s going to stop me?\u201d attitude was the perfect libertarian credo for the Reagan era of deregulation. Drexel gave us culture, too \u2014 \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d \u201cThe Bonfire of the Vanities\u201d and Gordon Gekko in \u201cWall Street\u201d telling us that \u201cgreed is good.\u201d But Drexel flew too close to the sun. Mr. Milken went to prison and Drexel is no more.Today, the great fortunes are not made at companies like Drexel but at companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon. And the rules set by Google are the rules we all abide by.\u201cPortions of the memo violate our code of conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,\u201d Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote in a companywide email.It\u2019s impossible to believe that Google or other large tech companies a few years ago would have reacted like this to such a memo. In 2011 when CNN filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the workplace diversity data on big tech companies, Google, among others, asked the Department of Labor for its data to be excluded. The company said that releasing that information would cause \u201ccompetitive harm.\u201d It was not until 2014 that Google began to disclose statistics showing that only 17 percent of its technical work force was female.If women should not even have the vote, why should we worry about gender diversity in the engineering ranks?Today Google is under growing scrutiny, and the cognitive dissonance between the outward-facing \u201cDon\u2019t be evil\u201d stance and the internal misogynistic \u201cbrogrammer\u201d rhetoric was too extreme.Google had to fire the offending engineer, James Damore, but anyone who spends time on the message boards frequented by Valley engineers will know that the \u201cbro\u201d culture that gave us Gamergate \u2014 an online movement that targeted women in the video game industry \u2014 is much more prevalent than Mr. Pichai wants to acknowledge.The company canceled a planned all-hands meeting on Thursday, citing concern about harassment.The effects of the darker side of tech culture reach well beyond the Valley. It starts with an unwillingness to control fake news and pervasive sexism that no doubt contributes to the gender pay gap. But it will soon involve the heart of Google\u2019s business: surveillance capitalism. The trope that \u201cif you are not paying for it, you aren\u2019t the customer \u2014 you\u2019re the product\u201d has been around for a while. But now the European Union has passed the General Data Protection Regulation, which will go into effect next May. This regulation aims to give people more control over their data, so search engines can\u2019t follow them everywhere they roam online. It will be an arrow to the heart of Google\u2019s business.We have an obligation to care about the values of the people who run Google, because we\u2019ve given Google enormous control over our lives and the lives of our children. As the former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris points out, \u201cWithout realizing the implications, a handful of tech leaders at Google and Facebook have built the most pervasive, centralized systems for steering human attention that has ever existed, while enabling skilled actors (addictive apps, bots, foreign governments) to hijack our attention for manipulative ends.\u201dThe future implications of a couple of companies\u2019 having such deep influence on our attention and our behavior are only beginning to be felt. The rise of artificial intelligence combined with Google\u2019s omnipresence in our lives is an issue that is not well understood by politicians or regulators.America is slowly waking up both culturally and politically to the takeover of our economy by a few tech monopolies. We know we are being driven by men like Peter Thiel and Jeff Bezos toward a future that will be better for them. We are not sure that it will be better for us.As George Packer, writing in The New Yorker in 2011, put it, \u201cIn Thiel\u2019s techno-utopia, a few thousand Americans might own robot-driven cars and live to 150, while millions of others lose their jobs to computers that are far smarter than they are, then perish at 60.\u201dSomehow the citizens of the world have been left out of this discussion of our future. Because tools like Google and Facebook have become so essential and because we have almost no choice in whether to use them, we need to consider the role they play in our lives.By giving networks like Google and Facebook control of the present, we cede our freedom to choose our future.Jonathan Taplin is the director emeritus of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Innovation Lab and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Google, Facebook and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Naming and Shaming Rapists the Only Way to Bring Them to Justice?", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY \u2014 In recent weeks in Australia, young women have been campaigning against sexual assault, holding up signs detailing the crimes committed against them. The protests coincide with the release of a survey by the Australian Human Rights Commission showing that some 2,000 university students, almost 7 percent of those surveyed, reported being sexually assaulted at least once during a two-year period.A recurring theme on the signs is that we tell women, \u201cDon\u2019t get raped,\u201d when we should be telling men, \u201cDon\u2019t rape.\u201d While faces of rape survivors are increasingly visible now, names of perpetrators are not. This leads to a troubling thought. Maybe the reason men continue to rape is that doing so is unlikely to pose any risk to their freedom or reputation. Very few rape cases are reported to the police and even fewer make it to court. Of those, only around 10 percent to 15 percent result in a conviction in countries including Australia, Britain and the United States.So it should come as no surprise that some women are seeking other ways to bring consequences to bear on men who have raped them. One powerful and controversial method is to make public the name of the perpetrator. Men are now periodically named as rapists on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.Such a case has recently made headlines in Australia. A young woman reported being raped to the police; she was accompanied by a friend who reported a similar experience with the same man. As is typical, the case did not progress to a prosecution.So this young woman reported the allegations to the political party to which this man belonged. Then she named him on Twitter and published a photograph of her injuries, purple bruising spreading across her neck and shoulder. The man was suspended from the political party; he deleted his social medial presence almost entirely. He denies all the allegations and says that he will be pursuing legal action. \u201cIn Australia,\u201d he told me over email, \u201cjustice is served through our established justice system,\u201d not through a \u201csocial media lynch mob.\u201dMany agree with him, and see this as vigilantism. It does not give an accused man the opportunity to clear his name in court. And there are the rare cases when a false accusation is made. This is a traumatic and violating crime in its own right.You may think suing for defamation is an inadequate response to the problem of false accusations, because it is likely to be expensive, emotionally onerous, slow and often unsuccessful. If so, I urge you to reflect on why you think these hurdles are unacceptable for men who are falsely accused, but acceptable for women who have been raped.Publicly accusing rapists is far from a perfect solution, but at a time when a vast majority of rapes still go unpunished by the criminal justice system despite decades of reforms aimed at making the process more hospitable to victims, it may be one of the few options that many victims have for bringing some consequences to bear on those who rape.Besides, justice and the criminal justice system are not one and the same. It is a fiction that justice must begin and end in the courtroom. Individuals and agencies have to make calls about the likelihood of guilt all the time. Child protective services, for instance, have to decide whether to remove children from their parents even when evidence of abuse is not sufficient to result in a criminal conviction. As human beings we have to make decisions about the rapists in our lives \u2014 whom we employ, whom we invite to family dinners.Perhaps what is needed is to formalize the practice of naming perpetrators, in a way that best protects victims and minimizes the risks of false accusations. Specifically, I would like to see a charitable body that carefully investigates and reports on sexual assault, including naming perpetrators.If this still sounds like vigilantism, consider that all I am describing is investigative journalism, with a specific purpose and subject matter. And that investigative journalism is an important institution of democracy, playing an especially vital role when other institutions like the courts prove incapable of delivering justice.The organization I am proposing would survive only if it observed rigorous investigative standards and did not make the error of simply assuming that a source was telling the truth, which a journalist should never do, even in the case of rape. The consequences for failing to do this are devastating, as Rolling Stone discovered after publishing the fabricated account of a gang rape by members of a University of Virginia fraternity. Despite not naming anyone as a perpetrator, the magazine has paid out millions of dollars in damages, after an administrator and a fraternity named in the story sued.Any investigation would have to gather sufficient evidence to defend an action for defamation. In Australia, the United States and many other countries, truth is the best defense against libel charges. A single successful defamation case would be likely to bankrupt such an investigative body, providing a strong incentive against publishing speculative or unfounded reports.It is time to accept that the criminal justice system may never be capable of providing justice for the vast majority of sexual assaults. The problem is not that we do not take rape seriously; we take it so seriously that we demand silence about perpetrators unless we are reporting on a court case and, as a result, very few perpetrators face any consequence at all.We do not necessarily need longer prison sentences for those convicted of rape. What we need is a higher proportion of rapists to face some kind of punishment for their actions, whether it is admonishment from their families or the loss of a job. Because it is extraordinary how few rapists now experience any disruption to their lives.And while it is right to guard against vigilantism, I don\u2019t think it is right to say that a woman who has been raped owes anyone a duty to be silent.Lisa Pryor, a medical doctor, is the author, most recently, of \u201cA Small Book About Drugs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sgt. Steve Perez, 60, a veteran police officer in Houston, drove into a flooded underpass on his way to the station.Then there were the deaths of Manuel Saldivar, 84, and Belia Saldivar, 81, and their four great-grandchildren: Daisy, 6; Xavier, 8; Dominic, 14; and Devy, 16, who were found in a partly submerged van in Greens Bayou.The couple\u2019s son, Sammy Saldivar, was driving the van and managed to escape through a window, watching helplessly as it disappeared under the water. The authorities were first alerted to the van around 10 a.m. on Sunday when they heard the screams of Mr. Saldivar, who was clinging to a tree after climbing through the partly open driver\u2019s side window.Harvey killed in other ways too. In Montgomery County, Lisa Jones, 60, had just lain down for a nap in her bedroom when a tree fell through the roof, crushing her. Her husband was in the living room, helpless to reach her through the debris until firefighters arrived.In a region where it is difficult to find a person without a harrowing story to tell, the story of Jordyn, the 3-year-old who saw her mother die, moved all who heard it. But it hit hardest within the large Beaumont family of nurses, pastors and military veterans who are relatives of Ms. Sulcer and her daughter and who live not far from them.Ms. Sulcer, a surgical nurse, and her only daughter had tried to escape the flooding Tuesday in their car, taking a service road of Interstate 10. But the water caught up with them.Relatives described Ms. Sulcer as a dedicated nurse who entered the profession after the death years ago of her mother, who was also a nurse.Read the words of people who requested rescue online.\u201cWe\u2019re a service family that takes pride in giving back to our community,\u201d said Ms. Logan, also a nurse.Ms. Logan said she and others in the family often referred to Ms. Sulcer by a nickname, Nan Nan, adding that she enjoyed caring for her daughter, traveling, watching cooking shows and listening to music.Ms. Sulcer had recently driven to Houston to attend a concert of the British singer Ed Sheeran, and had kept in touch with relatives and friends through social media, texting and by phone. She kept them updated on Tuesday about efforts to escape the flooding. Then the messages suddenly stopped.\u201cWe\u2019re in absolute shock,\u201d said Vanessa Jackson, 58, a cousin who is a retiree in Beaumont. \u201cYou hear about stories like this in other places, other people\u2019s lives. Not here, not us.\u201dThe goal now was to calm a traumatized child. \u201cWe just need to be focused now on little Jordyn, who experienced something none of us should,\u201d Ms. Jackson said.\u201cI\u2019m really having a hard time understanding today right now,\u201d she wrote.Michael LaBouef, a longtime friend of Ms. Sulcer\u2019s who worked with her at the Medical Center of Southeast Texas in Port Arthur, said that the tragedy devastated the staff at the 224-bed hospital.\u201cI always called her baby girl,\u201d said Mr. LaBouef, a retired surgical assistant. \u201cHer smile, I mean, the room just lit up. You couldn\u2019t help but smile back.\u201d\u201cI never did see that girl in a bad mood,\u201d he continued. \u201cI never saw her upset or mad. And she didn\u2019t have the life of leisure that would give her such a positive attitude. But she built on her adversity instead of letting it knock her down.\u201dCo-workers at the hospital had texted and talked to Ms. Sulcer on Tuesday morning as the rains were battering Beaumont. \u201cAnd one time she said, well, it looks like the weather is going to break, and we\u2019re going stir crazy so we\u2019re going to go out,\u201d Mr. LaBouef said.The Beaumont Police Department said that Ms. Sulcer and her daughter pulled into a parking lot when the waters began to rise, and then left their car. At some point, the police said, they were swept into a canal and ended up floating about half a mile.At that point, it was too late for Ms. Sulcer. But even as she succumbed to the floodwaters, she never let go of her daughter.Her friends kept on trying to contact her, Mr. LaBouef said, but \u201cthey got no answer.\u201dSimon Romero reported from Houston and Julie Bosman from Chicago.

{"Headline": "Behind Berkeley\u2019s Semester of Hate", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bycampus disruptedWhen far left meets far right, sparks fly. Students from both sides discuss their political journeys.Last semester\u2019s protests at the University of California, Berkeley, challenged liberal presumptions about who exactly the good guys were. Anti-fascists, or antifa, clad like ninjas and hellbent on silencing a speaker (the provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos), smashed windows and set fires. Clashes with right-wingers erupted again at rallies in March and April in support of free speech (a \u201cmessy pepper spray mosh pit,\u201d as one anti-fascist described it).The antifa collective, fueled by an emboldened right wing, has become a growing subculture, particularly on West Coast campuses. Fearful of being doxxed (having your personal information posted online) by \u201calt-right trolls,\u201d anti-fascists are cautious about their identity. Most don\u2019t even communicate over social media or phone. And many protest as a black bloc, a tactic ascribed to 1980s Germany in which a group protests anonymously, faces concealed by T-shirts, bandannas or masks to avoid detection and protect from pepper spray. Antifa is actually more label than organization, its believers connected by calls to action on websites like It\u2019s Going Down. Anarchist, communist or just liberal, they oppose fascism with militant zeal. But some formalize into affinity groups like the Pastel Bloc; dressed in pastels \u2014 a play on the head-to-toe uniform of black bloc \u2014 they offer medical attention during protests.Black bloc is often seen as mostly white males looking to wreak havoc for their cause. A half-dozen Berkeley antifa members who agreed to speak on record to us saw merit in that stereotype, but since the Trump inauguration, they said, those behind the masks represent the spectrum of gender and race. \u201cPeople showing up to the protests are the ones with the most to lose,\u201d said Neil Lawrence, a Berkeley student. Part of his decision to go public as a transgender anti-fascist is to counteract the stereotype.\u201cNobody wanted a street fight,\u201d Mr. Lawrence said. When the antifa got there, some with makeshift weapons and M-80 firecrackers, fighting broke out (each side blames the other). Mr. Lawrence didn\u2019t engage. \u201cI\u2019m 5 feet 2. I know what my assets are in this movement, and being able to throw down physically isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d His role: \u201cThere\u2019s power to being a body in the mass.\u201dMr. Lawrence has been involved with the anarcho-punk scene since high school. His first black bloc protest was last winter. \u201cViolence is frightening,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it. Violence is messy. It\u2019s not elegant.\u201d But he argues that today\u2019s high political stakes justify violence. \u201cWhatever you can do to throw a wrench in the gears is valuable.\u201dMr. Lawrence allowed his full name to be used to bolster his credibility in explaining a movement he believes is misrepresented in the media. In particular, he wants\u00a0his experiences as a trans student to illustrate its increasing diversity. \u201cThat is who the hammer falls on,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s whose existence in public is being criminalized in so many state legislatures right now. I never felt like a target walking down the street until the climate shifted so radically in the age of Trump.\u201d Mr. Lawrence is graduating this summer, nearly a year early, a decision reinforced by how Berkeley has dealt with the turmoil. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on a campus where I\u2019m looking over my shoulder all the time, but the people I\u2019m constantly looking over my shoulder for can stand on the steps of Sproul\u201d \u2014 where the Free Speech Movement was born, in 1964 \u2014 \u201cand give a press conference.\u201d \u201cEveryone just kind of wants to keep their head down, and the administration is really hypocritical about what\u2019s going on, for all their talk about wellness and campus climate. A pretty big part of me feeling safe on my campus, it doesn\u2019t seem crazy to say, is that there not be any Nazis here.\u201dSitting in his dorm room at the end of the school year, surrounded by tomes by anarchist thinkers, a freshman of Muslim descent named Dan was explaining his political journey. Suharto\u2019s forces had killed his grandfather during the Communist purge in Indonesia. The family immigrated to Southern California but was never political, fearful of suffering repression again. So Dan discovered Marx on his own, in the high school library. He moved on to Noam Chomsky and Peter Kropotkin. \u201cI started to realize: What\u2019s the use of reading about things when you don\u2019t really apply them in real life? And so, you know, the 2016 presidential came on and this was the first time I really got in politics.\u201d The antifa didn\u2019t protest at the April 27 rally supporting Ann Coulter, whose talk was canceled for that day by a university fearful of violence. \u201cSomeone like Coulter, she\u2019s pretty much nothing to us,\u201d Dan explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a different level of threat here. Milo Yiannopoulos, he\u2019s at the vanguard of a new right movement that\u2019s much more dangerous than the conservative establishment.\u201d Yiannopoulos supporters, he said, had displayed anti-Semitic posters and Nazi salutes at the free speech rallies. Dan said he supports the right of conservatives to speak on campus, but fascism must be stopped \u2014 by violence, if necessary. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen in history that the very fact that we allow certain people to talk normalizes their speech, and there\u2019s the possibility of their narrative being accepted and even being widespread in the society.\u201dHe predicts more violence for the new school year. Mr. Yiannopoulos has announced a weeklong tent city on Sproul Plaza this fall, vowing in a Facebook post to \u201cbring an army if I have to.\u201d And the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro plans to speak in September.\u201cWe are organizing people to put pressure on the institutions to engage us in dialogue,\u201d he said, \u201cto challenge their students to greater exposure to ideas they are censoring on campus, to bring a greater amount of literature into classes, to expand the speakers they\u2019re bringing in. There\u2019s an incredible amount of political nepotism on campus, which has led to ignorance about us, and quite a bit of strawmanning in regard to what it is we truly believe.\u201dMr. Damigo joined the Marine Corps right after high school, serving two tours in Iraq. Reintegration was difficult, and he began binge drinking. One night, in what he believes was a PTSD flashback, he pulled a gun on a cabdriver of Middle Eastern descent and took $43. \u201cI freaked out, didn\u2019t know where I was, thought this guy was trying to come through my checkpoint and just flipped out on him,\u201d Mr. Damigo said. \u201cAfter it happened, I felt very guilty about it.\u201d In prison on a four-year sentence for armed robbery, he began reading, taking a particular interest in race. His reading list included \u201cWhite Identity: Racial Consciousness in the 21st Century\u201d by Jared Taylor and \u201cThe Bell Curve,\u201d whose co-author Charles Murray was prevented from speaking at Middlebury College earlier this year. \u201cAnd yes, I read David Duke, if you want to throw that in there.\u201d From the other side of the argument was \u201cThe Triple Helix\u201d by Richard Lewontin. He earned an associate degree in social and behavioral sciences while incarcerated and on release immediately enrolled in Cal State. Mr. Damigo started Identity Evropa last year after watching videos of the French anti-immigration youth group G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire. \u201cPolicies of mass immigration have been called by the new right \u2018the great replacement,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a paradox in screaming racism at a people while promoting policies that would lead to the destruction of their identity and their culture.\u201d He was attracted, he said, \u201cto the group\u2019s willingness to go where most right-wing people hadn\u2019t gone before, which is into the activist front.\u201d\u201cI spent years researching the history of left-wing agitation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that the narrative regarding race and identity and diversity today is the way it is because of the activism of left-wing groups. Our countering narrative on it, like Milo Yiannopoulos, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jordan Peterson, they\u2019re getting shut down. So I said, there is a superior strategy to coordinated action, and that\u2019s something we have to replicate.\u201d When school resumes, Mr. Damigo plans to \u201cstep it up\u201d by setting up tables on campuses with Identity Evropa T-shirts and banners. And at U.C. Berkeley? Mr. Damigo laughed. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some plans.\u201d Andrew Beale and Sonner Kehrt are graduate journalism students at the University of California, Berkeley.Advertisement"}

He was one of the founders in 2009 of the PAMS Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports antipoaching efforts in Tanzania through the country\u2019s National and Transnational Serious Crimes Investigation Unit, which has been at the forefront in combating poachers and arresting suspects.Mr. Lotter worked as a ranger as a young man in South Africa before he moved to Tanzania, where he became a leading force in the fight against poaching, the foundation said. It said his work included training village game scouts in every corner of the country, as part of his belief that \u201ccommunities were the best protectors of the continent\u2019s animals.\u201d\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind but that Wayne\u2019s anti-poaching efforts made a big difference in the fight to save Tanzania\u2019s elephants from the illegal ivory trade,\u201d Dr. Goodall wrote. \u201cMoreover his courage in the face of stiff opposition and personal threats, and his determination to keep on fighting, has inspired many, and encouraged them also to keep fighting for wildlife.\u201d\u201cIf this cowardly shooting was an attempt to bring the work of the PAMS Foundation to an end it will fail,\u201d she added.Mr. Lotter is survived by his wife, Inge; his daughters, Cara Jayne and Tamsin; and his parents, Vera and Charles Lotter, according to the foundation.At a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species last year, colleagues teased Mr. Lotter because it was the first time they had seen him wearing a tie.\u201cHis response,\u201d Mr. Downes wrote, \u201cwas to arrive for a meeting at our International Headquarters in Washington, D.C., wearing two ties, one around his neck and the other on his head.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Australian Friendliness, Shopping, Faith in Government ... and Angst?", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 21______I\u2019ll also be heading back to the United States soon for a holiday, and when I return, I\u2019ll share some impressions about that experience as well. A lot seems to be changing and not changing since I left.What\u2019s below is, of course, just a selection of what\u2019s front of mind at the moment, so don\u2019t expect comprehensiveness and feel free to disagree with or expand on my impressions. My goal, as always to some degree, is to open up the journalism process.So consider this, perhaps, my rolling answer to the question I hear all the time: So what do you think of Australia?Forever FriendlyThere are lots of countries with friendly reputations, certainly, but what I\u2019ve come to appreciate about Australia is that for most people I meet, the first instinct seems to be \u201chow can I help.\u201dIt\u2019s pretty different from New York City, my last home, where people are locked in their own bubbles of work, or Mexico, my home before that, where people were simply scared when strangers approached. Australia often feels to me (as a white English-speaking male) like a backyard party where it\u2019s assumed that I have a good reason to be sharing the food and drink.Buy, and Buy MoreThink of the neighborhood butchers. And the chemists. And, well, all the small storefront business, and the crowded shopping centers \u2014 this, my friends, is not the way Americans shop.Ordering online and waiting is the reality in cities across the United States, but here in this remarkably wealthy country, brick-and-mortar retail is still king. And it\u2019s all a bit stunning for someone who has had to set up a bureau, and a new home, after years of avoiding the routine of park, choose, wait in line, purchase, carry out, carry home.In the meantime, you can find me in line at Coles, scratching my head, asking the friendly guy next to me what\u2019s taking so long.Government, Good?Australians gasp in horror when they look at American gun culture, but many Australians tell me it\u2019s not just because of the violence. It\u2019s also about government.Americans often discuss government in pure binary terms: It\u2019s good or bad. In Iraq, in Haiti and in many other countries where I\u2019ve worked, government is seen, instead, either as an annoyance or a path to wealth.Politically, this is perhaps the clearest difference between how Washington and Canberra are viewed and judged. As Julia Gillard, the former prime minister, told me when we met recently for coffee:\u201cFaith in government is stronger here than in the U.S. Australians believe government can work and should work, and to the extent it doesn\u2019t that is the fault of politicians, and you get to vote them in and out.\u201dBanter Never EndsIf Australians\u2019 first instinct is friendliness and the second is curiosity, then could the third be humor, insecurity or a mix of the two? I\u2019m thinking of the jokes and sharp comments, which especially when directed at outsiders, often seem aimed at diverting attention from (or reflecting) some underexplored sense of angst.This is an aspect of Australia that I\u2019m still trying to figure out, with help from others. Two recent conversations with \u201cnew Australians\u201d \u2014 the children of immigrants \u2014 come to mind. Both are journalists, both have lived outside the country and returned with their own set of questions about what it is that keeps conversations in Australia from going as deep as they could.One works for a major broadcaster, and he argued that Australia is anti-intellectual. The other, Isabella Kwai, works for us, and she tied it more to the Australian penchant for prioritizing a laugh.\u201cThe banter here is never-ending,\u201d Isabella said. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked joking around in conversations, sometimes probably in situations where I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant, but here, people can take a joke very, very far. I wonder if it makes it difficult to have serious, deep conversations about tough things happening in the world.\u201dThis is not universal throughout Australia. I\u2019ve had many deep and probing discussions about uncomfortable subjects like race, gender and violence since I arrived. And other countries have their own issues when it comes to self-examination (Cuba, te veo).But you tell me: Is there not something to this? How would you describe what I\u2019m getting at?And with that, here are my New York Times picks of the week, plus a recommendation._____________________________See you in two weeks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ship Monitoring Rescues of Migrants Refuses to Be Rescued", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In the end, it was the gang that couldn\u2019t sail straight.But the journey of the self-described identitarians seemed cursed from the start.The ship \u2014 festooned in banners reading \u201cDefend Europe\u201d and \u201cNo Way \u2014 You Will Not Make Europe Home\u201d \u2014 missed its planned media launch when the Egyptian authorities held it up in the Suez Canal. Then the group\u2019s Italian leader missed his plane to Sicily, where the group planned to depart. And some of the crew members of the ship chartered to stop asylum seekers themselves sought asylum in Cyprus.The greatest indignity came Friday when at 9 a.m., European naval aircraft noticed the ship, the C-Star, in apparent trouble with its engine turned off outside of Libyan waters in the Mediterranean Sea. The authorities searched for the closest vessel to come to its aid and found, only a few nautical miles away, one of the very ships the young hard-right activists had hoped to stop.\u201cThey refused our help,\u201d said Michael Buschheuer, a spokesman for the Sea Eye, a ship chartered by German humanitarians to rescue migrants. \u201cSo we just passed them and went on to our normal working day, which means keeping an eye on people who are really in distress.\u201dThe C-Star, the group wrote on Twitter, was \u201chaving technical difficulty. We\u2019re resolving it. No distress. #DefendEurope.\u201dThe group\u2019s Italian leader, Lorenzo Fiato, did not respond to a request for a comment. But last month in Milan, where he lives with his parents and sleeps in a room surrounded by board games like \u201cThe Middle Ages,\u201d he argued that the aid ships did not in fact rescue anyone.\u201cIt\u2019s not true the NGOs save lives,\u201d he said, referring to the nongovernment organizations that operate many of the aid ships. \u201cYes, they rescue people from shipwrecks. But do they guarantee these people a new life?\u201dMr. Fiato had spoken in heroic terms of his earlier effort to brave seasickness and stop \u2014 for a few minutes, anyway \u2014 an aid ship in Catania, Sicily, from leaving a port. For this voyage he had packed anti-seasickness gum and had a gleam in his eye when he spoke of his seafaring vessel.\u201cWe have a 40-meter search-and-survey ship given to us by a private person who saw what we did in Catania,\u201d he said, \u201cand gave it to us for a cut-rate price of 60,000 euros.\u201dMore than 95,000 migrants have arrived in Italy this year, and more than 2,000 have died at sea. The issue of migration, especially regarding the private aid ships that now rescue more than 40 percent of the migrants at sea, has dominated politics in Italy.The suspicion that some aid groups have helped traffickers provided a chief motivation, and talking point, for the C-Star\u2019s stated mission of monitoring the aid ships. But many humanitarian groups accused the C-Star of getting in the water to disrupt the saving of lives.Mr. Fiato, echoing right-wing politicians, accused the aid ships of turning off their transponders so they could dodge the authorities as they colluded with human traffickers to bring migrants to Europe.But Mr. Buschheuer of the rescue ship said that when his colleagues on the Sea Eye sought to identify the C-Star from afar, they could not see its name because its automatic identification system was not activated.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things they accuse us of doing,\u201d Mr. Buschheuer said.Many aid ships dismiss the accusation that they are colluding with human traffickers as ludicrous. But in recent days, the Italian authorities boarded and confiscated a different German aid ship on suspicion of such collusion.As migrant landings in Italy have decreased, Mr. Minniti received key support this week from the influential Italian Bishops Conference, which warned humanitarian groups to obey the law and avoid having their idealism exploited into collaboration with traffickers.But just as the political wind in Italy seemed to be starting to fill the C-Star\u2019s sails, the eager crew of young white nationalists instead found themselves with engine trouble. It was a development Mr. Fiato perhaps foresaw as he prepared for his journey last month.\u201cMore than smugglers shooting us,\u201d Mr. Fiato said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the unexpected.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Signs Russian Sanctions Into Law, With Caveats", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnlike other bill signings, Mr. Trump did not invite news media photographers to record the event, nor did he say anything about it to reporters. He ignored questions about the legislation at an unrelated event and instead relegated his comments to two written statements, one meant for Congress to describe caveats in his approval of the bill and the other issued to reporters to explain his grudging decision to sign.In the statement to Congress, Mr. Trump said the bill \u201cincluded a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.\u201d Although he added that \u201cI nevertheless expect to honor\u201d the waiting periods, he did not commit to it. Moreover, he took issue with other provisions, saying only that he \u201cwill give careful and respectful consideration to the preferences expressed by the Congress.\u201d\u201cYet despite its problems,\u201d he added, \u201cI am signing this bill for the sake of national unity. It represents the will of the American people to see Russia take steps to improve relations with the United States. We hope there will be cooperation between our two countries on major global issues so that these sanctions will no longer be necessary.\u201dLike Mr. Trump, who has offered no public comment or even a Twitter message about the Russian order to slash the number of United States Embassy workers, it appears that Mr. Putin has not completely given up on the idea of establishing closer relations. The Russian government took its retaliatory action before the president signed the bill so that it would be a response to Congress, not to Mr. Trump.After Mr. Trump signed the measure on Wednesday, the Russian government reaction was mild. \u201cDe facto, this changes nothing,\u201d said Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin press secretary, who was traveling with Mr. Putin in the Russian Far East, according to the Interfax news agency. \u201cThere is nothing new.\u201dHe added that no new retaliation should be expected. \u201cCountermeasures have already been taken,\u201d he said.Dmitri A. Medvedev, the Russian prime minister, declared the \u201cend to hope for the improvement of our relations\u201d and mocked Mr. Trump for being forced to sign. \u201cThe Trump administration has demonstrated total impotence, handing over executive functions to Congress in the most humiliating way possible,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. He added that \u201cthe American establishment has totally outplayed Trump\u201d with the goal \u201cto remove him from power.\u201dAmerican lawmakers said the new law sent an important signal that Russia would be held to account for its election interference and aggression toward its neighbors. But the lawmakers expressed concern about whether Mr. Trump would try to sidestep the measure.The president\u2019s signing statement \u201cdemonstrates that Congress is going to need to keep a sharp eye on this administration\u2019s implementation of this critical law and any actions it takes with respect to Ukraine,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader.Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee and a prime driver behind the legislation, said, \u201cI remain very concerned that this administration will seek to strike a deal with Moscow that is not in the national security interests of the United States.\u201dThe Trump administration continues to send mixed messages about Russia.\u201cLet me be clear: The United States prefers a constructive relationship with Russia based on mutual cooperation and common interests,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cBut the president and our Congress are unified in our message to Russia: A better relationship and the lifting of sanctions will require Russia to reverse the actions and conduct that caused sanctions to be imposed in the first place.\u201d\u201cThe action by the Congress to put these sanctions in place and the way they did, neither the president nor I are very happy about that,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe were clear that we didn\u2019t think it was going to be helpful to our efforts, but that\u2019s the decision they made.

And that\u2019s saying a lot. She\u2019s 101.\u201cMy life has always been organizing,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019m not afraid to tell people how I feel.\u201dAs a child, she and her father would join rallies in Union Square to support unions. After high school, she worked in a Manhattan sweatshop to better understand the working conditions and help laborers organize protests and go on strike. She volunteered with the Red Cross during World War II, among other social service work.So we asked Ms. Sansone for advice on how young New Yorkers can be more engaged in the city and world around them \u2014 in big and small ways.Civic Engagement\u2022 Figure out what your neighbors\u2019 needs are and then decide how you can best help, Ms. Sansone said. For example, if that need is housing, the focus could be as broad as improving safety at nearby homeless shelters, or as specific as finding lodging and resources for a local family whose home has burned down, which Ms. Sansone did recently.\u201cGo to the church and ask, \u2018Do you think people in this community need help, and what kind of help do they need?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cGo into the schools and ask the principal, \u2018Do you have kids that need help, and how can we help them?\u2019\u201d\u2022 Become familiar with your local community board, she advised. The meetings are open to the public and they are an effective place to offer and find help, she said.Political EngagementThose who are politically engaged (which is not entirely separate from being civically involved) hold those in power accountable, especially in today\u2019s divisive political climate.\u201cPoliticians will talk about, \u2018I\u2019m going to do this or I\u2019m going to do that,\u2019 but it\u2019s up to you to see if they\u2019re going to do it or not,\u201d Ms. Sansone said.\u2022 Attend a city meeting, like one of Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s town hall events.\u2022 Contact your state senator or a City Council member with questions or to voice your concerns about an issue. \u201cTell them that you need help or ask them where to go to get help,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep calling until you get results. If that doesn\u2019t work, send a letter of complaint.\u201d\u2022 Use Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms as tools to start conversations, organize and \u201cthen publicize so others can come with you,\u201d she said.Most importantly, get involved, whether the issue \u201chits home or not,\u201d Ms. Sansone said, because if we \u201cdon\u2019t get involved, then it starts all over again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been in demonstrations where people came with Seeing Eye dogs and walkers,\u201d she added. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t see, they couldn\u2019t walk, but they came.\u201dThink of them \u2014 or Ms. Sansone \u2014 as inspiration.Here\u2019s what else is happening:We\u2019re looking at a cloudy commute, with a chance of showers, particularly in the evening.But as long as Mother Nature gets it out of her system before the long holiday weekend, we\u2019re O.K. with it.But what else can we do to help?

{"Headline": "For Niven Patel, Farm-to-Table Cooking Means Taro and Mangoes", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Chef11 PhotosHOMESTEAD, Fla. \u2014 August may not be the ideal time to visit Niven Patel\u2019s backyard farm.But summer does have its payoffs for those who choose to live at the fertile edge of the Everglades. At a recent dinner party at Ranchopatel \u2014 Mr. Patel\u2019s gray stone house on Avocado Drive \u2014 the chef cut waist-high taro leaves, dug his own white turmeric roots, plucked teardrop Indian eggplants to stuff with crushed peanuts, and filled a wheelbarrow with 200 pounds of mangoes destined for lassis and chutney.\u201cAs soon as I drove in, I saw the lychee trees,\u201d Mr. Patel said, \u201cand it just felt right.\u201dMr. Patel, who turns 34 on Wednesday, was wise to trust his instincts. Located in the only part of the contiguous United States with a tropical monsoon climate \u2014 like those in India and Southeast Asia \u2014 Ranchopatel gave him not just sweet fruit, but a new direction.Homestead is part of one of Florida\u2019s most diverse agricultural regions. Mr. Patel\u2019s neighbors include ordinary owners of one-story homes with impossibly lush lawns, as well as farmers who send conventional supermarket vegetables north in December; large-scale exotic fruit producers with groves of Thai white guavas or Pakistani mangoes; and small-scale growers with roots across the Asian continent, the Caribbean or South America. Many of those growers cultivate just a few acres, their yards mixed carpets of foreign tree fruits, vegetables and herbs that creep right up to the road.Go to an Indian market in New York City, for example, and you are likely to spot green papaya or luffa gourd from Jalaram Produce, which Mahendra Raolji has run in Homestead for 22 years. \u201cHe is the biggest Indian farmer in probably the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Patel said, \u201cand he\u2019s 10 minutes away.\u201dThat\u2019s handy for Mr. Patel, who blends local sourcing with his family\u2019s home cooking. Born in Georgia and raised in Florida, Mr. Patel traces his roots to the Indian state of Gujarat, as does his wife, Shivani.At his four-month-old restaurant \u2014 a roomy modern space where jars of ground Ranchopatel chiles serve as both pantry and folk art \u2014 Mr. Patel may marinate the tropical game fish called wahoo in fresh turmeric, serving a still-raw slice alongside bhel puri, a mix of puffed rice with green mango and herby chutney. Charred local okra pods are seasoned with black mustard seed and soaked with preserved heirloom tomatoes, which he buys from farmer friends in spring. (The Florida vegetable season is reversed, Mr. Patel explained. Crops that thrive in extraordinarily hot and humid climates, like okra, beans and eggplant, are the only vegetables that grow during the summer; Floridians import fresh tomatoes and everything else from farmers up north.)Many Miami chefs work with local farmers or seek out special or native ingredients, but with Ghee, Mr. Patel is a game changer for the region. He is the first chef to draw such a sharp line from his cooking to the unique potential of his agricultural landscape, linking his heritage to his literal backyard.\u201cWhat he\u2019s cooking and what he\u2019s doing, and in this climate and in this zone, are just like a match made in heaven,\u201d said Michael Schwartz, the executive chef and owner of Michael\u2019s Genuine and a farm-to-table pioneer in Miami.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s inspiring,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly got everyone thinking about new possibilities.\u201dMr. Patel was still working for Mr. Schwartz when he decided to open Ghee. \u201cI never in my wildest dreams thought I would open up an Indian restaurant,\u201d said Mr. Patel, who has spent a majority of his 13-year career cooking modern American food, much of it farm-to-table.He first fell for hands-on growing six years ago while working as a chef at a restaurant on Grand Cayman that kept an expansive kitchen garden. After buying his house in Homestead in 2013, Mr. Patel had the land to create his own: He recruited his kitchen staff at Michael\u2019s to help build out 14 32-foot-long raised beds just past the swimming pool.Friends came to see, and he served them what his family always ate at home: basmati rice with roasted garlic, ghee and chiles; a simple okra curry; the hand-rolled Gujarati flatbread called rotli; a warm yogurt soup flavored with homegrown curry leaf and thickened with grated tomato, cucumber and tender, fresh pigeon peas.His guests were blown away by the food, and Mr. Patel by their reaction: \u201cI thought, \u2018We have to do this; we have to make a place that\u2019s like eating at home.\u2019\u201dHome, in fact, is where Ghee\u2019s staff came to train, learning the intricacies of the Indian kitchen from Mr. Patel, his wife and her parents, who also live at Ranchopatel. (His father-in-law is a co-farmer and the handyman, his mother-in-law is the restaurant\u2019s second culinary guru, and Ms. Patel works the dining room after spending the day at her full-time job in human resources at a resort.)\u201cWe would cook up a feast,\u201d said Mr. Patel, who eventually started summoning people over to eat it \u2014 chefs, brewers, farmers or food producers, some of whom he knew only via Instagram. These free-form dinners became legend, spread by social media posts showing sprouted mung beans or spices being ground by a hand-powered stone mill.Mr. Patel still lures crowds to Ranchopatel when he can. That backyard dinner with the wheelbarrow full of mangoes, for example, was a feast for about 30 on the family\u2019s one day off that week. The guests included a South Beach chef, a lawyer who runs one of Miami\u2019s best-read food blogs, the owner of an artisan tea company and most of Mr. Patel\u2019s staff, who pitched in to grill whole queen snappers slicked with ginger-chile spice paste and to fill flatbreads with the purple Indian yam called ratalu.These connections are important to Mr. Patel, whose goal \u2014 beyond hiring a farmer to convert the rest of his yard so he can grow more produce for the restaurant by fall \u2014 is to foster the deep links between agriculture, food professionals and diners that exist in many other cities.His sleep-deprived family might like it if the Ranchopatel gatherings got a little smaller, though. \u201cI invite too many people,\u201d he said, \u201cand they get mad at me.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colares, Where the Vineyards Snake Through the Sand", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourCOLARES, Portugal \u2014 The vineyards in this small wine region west of Lisbon on the Atlantic coast look like something that slithered up from the sea.Trained low to avoid the biting wind that blows incessantly off the ocean, the vines resemble green serpents snaking along the sand. It\u2019s as if vines from a more conventional region had come to the beach on vacation and had collapsed in a deep slumber.Colares, one of the world\u2019s singular wine regions, emits a sleepy timelessness. The grapes are grown today just as they have been for centuries, except far fewer of them can be found. As recently as the 1940s, vines covered almost 2,500 acres of these sandy soils.Yet Colares produces what may well be Portugal\u2019s most distinctive still wines. The reds, made of the ramisco grape, are high in acid and powerfully tannic, so much so that they are aged for years in the cellars before they are released. The current vintage on the market is 2007.For all their initial intensity, the wines soften after 10 years of aging, revealing a graceful complexity, with savory kaleidoscopic flavors: herbal, balsam and saline. The wines are low in alcohol, too, seldom reaching 12.5 percent.The white wines \u2014 made from the malvasia de Colares grape, which is genetically distinct from other grapes called malvasia \u2014 are fresh, rich and likewise herbal and saline with depth and character. They do not require quite as much aging as the reds; the current vintage is 2012.The Colares vineyards, the westernmost wine region in continental Europe, are often said to be on the verge of extinction, doomed by a relentless appetite for seaside housing. For the moment, the threat seems to have abated.In the last few years, about five more acres of vineyards were planted and will soon come into production, the first sign of growth in Colares in a long time. Interest in the wines is increasing, too.\u201cI\u2019m a little more optimistic,\u201d Mr. Figueiredo said as we walked through a vineyard in June. \u201cThere\u2019s more interest abroad. We used to be a little bit forgotten.\u201dIt was not always that way. Back in the late 19th century, the vineyards of Europe were devastated by the phylloxera aphid, which preyed on their roots. The vines of Colares were unaffected because phylloxera cannot live in sand, and the wines came to be in great demand.Eventually, phylloxera was stopped by grafting European vines onto American rootstocks, which are immune to the bug, and vineyards could be replanted. Virtually all European vines are now grafted, but Colares vines remain on their own roots.In the early 20th century, this was an indication of purity and quality for Colares. Fraud abounded as unscrupulous producers and merchants in other regions used the Colares name for their wines. In 1934, the authorities decided that, to prevent fraud, only wine made by the co-op could be called Colares. This was the law until 1994.Everything about growing the ramisco and malvasia grapes is hard work. To plant the vines, growers must dig trenches in the sand, which can be roughly 3 to 15 feet deep, to the chalky clay below. The roots need to grow in the clay to survive. As the vines get taller, the growers gradually fill in the sand, aided no doubt by the ceaseless wind, which blows back its share.The wind is the enemy of the vine, Mr. Figueiredo said. The salt it carries can burn the leaves. So in addition to keeping the vines low, growers also plant apple trees among the vines, and erect fences made of stone along with maintaining barriers of wild-growing cane.Once the grape bunches fill out, growers must raise the vines off the sand to facilitate air circulation. They achieve this by painstakingly placing wooden splints under the vines that elevate them like trestles under a road.Plenty of other grapes, like castel\u00e3o and tinta roriz (tempranillo in Spain), are grown conventionally on clay-based soils in the Colares area. These wines, which carry the appellation Vinho Regional de Lisboa, can be quite good. But only wines made from ramisco or malvasia grown on the sand can be called Colares.The ramisco grape, which makes up 75 percent of the Colares plantings, is superbly adapted to its unusual environment.\u201cWe looked at our region and the sand, and we said, \u2018Let\u2019s do what people used to do here,\u2019\u201d Nuno Ramilo said.So, in 2015, the brothers planted about five acres of grapes on a windy, sandy lot where their mother had wanted to build a condominium, a project they said was blocked by the government. Nuno Ramilo got a little creative, too, training the vines on low wires rather than along the sand, thus avoiding having to splint the vines.\u201cIf you want to work in Colares,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have to plant, because the old people who have the vineyards won\u2019t be working them forever.\u201dAt the airy, well-ventilated warehouse of the co-op, around 75 huge wooden tanks made of mahogany, imported from Brazil, and other \u201cexotic woods,\u201d as Mr. Figueiredo calls them, are a reminder of what production was like in the 1940s. Now, except for a scant few, they sit unused.The same is true at Vi\u00fava Gomes, where 10,000-liter vats are displayed like museum pieces.\u201cIt\u2019s good for Colares, but we don\u2019t have 10,000 liters of Colares anymore,\u201d said Diogo Baeta, who helps his father, Jos\u00e9, run Vi\u00fava Gomes. They age about 1,000 liters a year in smaller barrels.Mr. Baeta said he is happy with Mr. Figueiredo\u2019s winemaking but hopes to do it himself one day.\u201cFrancisco and I, we share the same philosophy of making the wine in the traditional manner of the region,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my goal is to make all our wines in the near future.\u201dVi\u00fava Gomes uses a facsimile of an old label on its bottles, from the days when the spelling was sometimes rendered \u201cCollares.\u201dThe Colares wines were traditionally sold in 600-milliliter bottles, an awkward size that is illegal in some markets, including the United States. So now, Colares, both red and white, is largely sold in 500-milliliter bottles, which are legal. The wines can be found for $25 to $45.\u201cIt\u2019s a homage to the old bottles but also a recognition that there\u2019s not a lot of wine to go around,\u201d Mr. Figueiredo said. \u201cRather than push prices up, they reduced the size of the bottle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vietnamese Art Has Never Been More Popular. But the Market Is Full of Fakes.", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam \u2014 The exhibition at the Fine Arts Museum in Ho Chi Minh City was billed as a triumphant homecoming for works by some of Vietnam\u2019s most influential artists.But Nguyen Thanh Chuong, a prominent artist himself, was stunned by what he saw.Hanging on the wall was a painting he recognized as his own, a Cubist-inspired portrait he did in the early 1970s.But instead of his name, the canvas bore the signature of one of Vietnam\u2019s best-known artists, Ta Ty, and the date 1952. \u201cI could not believe my eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made my hair stand on end.\u201dMr. Chuong\u2019s discovery set off a scandal that has rocked the Vietnam art world and highlighted an embarrassing truth: The Vietnamese art market, where prices of prewar paintings have recently broken the million-dollar mark, is rife with fraud.\u201cThat remains one of the biggest challenges for the Vietnamese art market,\u201d said Suzanne Lecht, an American who owns the Art Vietnam Gallery in Hanoi. \u201cHow do people know what is fake and what isn\u2019t?\u201dEven esteemed Vietnamese art institutions, including major national museums, have showcased paintings they acknowledged were not authentic. Likewise, the auction houses Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, as well as a consultant who worked for both of them, have sold works later dismissed by some experts as fakes.Some of Vietnam\u2019s greatest artists are enjoying a moment of increasing world attention, especially those who studied at the French-influenced Fine Arts College of Indochina before World War II. The best of them synthesize European post-Impressionist trends with classical Asian styles and subjects, and their work is commanding higher prices.Vietnamese art remains a niche market globally but is surging in popularity at international auctions. In April, a late 1930s painting by one artist, Le Pho, sold for nearly $1.2 million at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in Hong Kong, breaking the $844,000 record set by another of his paintings in 2014.But artists and dealers complain that the proliferation of fakes is dragging down the value of Vietnamese art.Vietnam\u2019s nouveau riche, who have begun to pay high prices for local artists, are a prime target for unscrupulous traders. So are international buyers, whose faith that they are buying the genuine article is bolstered by the institutions that vouch for it.The Fine Arts Museum in Ho Chi Minh City, where the disputed painting by Ta Ty, who died in 2004, was part of the exhibition \u201cPaintings Returned From Europe,\u201d rents its walls to private collectors, giving their paintings the imprimatur of the top museum in Vietnam\u2019s largest city.The 17 paintings in the exhibition belonged to Vu Xuan Chung, a Vietnamese art dealer who said he paid the museum about $1,300 to hold the 12-day event last year.\u201cA museum is the ultimate venue to validate a work of art,\u201d said Colette Loll, founder and director of Art Fraud Insights, a Washington consulting firm.All 17 paintings had been certified as genuine by a French art expert, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Hubert, a senior consultant for Vietnamese art at Christie\u2019s. One painting still had a Christie\u2019s tag dangling from it. Mr. Hubert appears to have had a conflict of interest. The 17 paintings had belonged to him, and he had sold them to Mr. Chung, his friend of more than 20 years, Mr. Chung said.Mr. Hubert declined to comment on the artwork or his role in the exhibition but said by email, \u201cAs a general principle I abide by the most stringent standards.\u201dChristie\u2019s said it would not knowingly auction any works if it had valid concerns about their authenticity. A spokesman for Christie\u2019s said that the company had nothing to do with the show in Ho Chi Minh City and that Mr. Hubert was acting on his own.But in an email to a Vietnamese journalist while the exhibit was underway, Zineng Wang, then Christie\u2019s head of curation and sale for Southeast Asian art, said that he and Mr. Hubert were \u201cabsolutely convinced that the works presented by Mr. Chung are authentic and genuine.\u201dMr. Van\u2019s son, To Ngoc Thanh, an established painter himself, called the painting attributed to his father a fake. \u201cI can tell you 100 percent that is not my father\u2019s painting,\u201d he said. \u201cI am disgusted. In this country there is a lot of fake art. Some crook just used that trick to make money.\u201dChristie\u2019s said it had completed \u201crigorous due diligence\u201d and had \u201cno basis\u201d to question the painting\u2019s authenticity.During the war with America in the late 1960s, museum officials removed hundreds of artworks for safekeeping, in case Hanoi was bombed by the United States, and commissioned copies to replace them. Originals disappeared, copies were passed off as originals, and no one knew which was which. Asked whether the museum had since tried to sort them out, the director, Nguyen Anh Minh, only smiled.Adding to the confusion, relatives of some prominent artists were known to certify copies as originals so they could fetch a higher price. At an auction in Hong Kong last year, Christie\u2019s sold the paintings \u201cBoats on the Perfume River\u201d by To Ngoc Van for $57,000, and \u201cA Lady of Hue\u201d by Le Van De for $89,000. Identical paintings are hanging at the Museum of Fine Arts in Hanoi. The museum says it acquired \u201cBoats\u201d in 1965 and \u201cLady\u201d in 1976.Mr. Thanh, Mr. Van\u2019s son, said that many copies of the two paintings were made decades ago and that it was difficult to know which were the originals. The Christie\u2019s catalog does not mention that fact. The description by Mr. Hubert said \u201cBoats\u201d was painted in 1935 and acquired from a private collection in Germany. \u201cA Lady of Hue\u201d was painted in 1945 and, Mr. Hubert wrote, authenticated by a student of the artist\u2019s.Lavina Chan, a spokeswoman for Christie\u2019s, declined to comment on the paintings in the Hanoi museum and said, \u201cWe stand by our cataloging at the time of the sale.\u201dTo prove a painting is genuine, experts can analyze its appearance, establish its ownership history, and use scientific tests to examine how it has aged and whether its materials come from the right period. In Vietnam, many paintings lack proper documentation. And there is no lab that analyzes artwork or has a database of the obscure materials and homemade pigments that artists often used during wartime.That leaves a heavy reliance on expert opinion about how a painting looks. \u201cAll I know is, I trust Mr. Hubert,\u201d said Mr. Chung, the art dealer. \u201cI bought the paintings from Hubert, and Hubert certified that.\u201dFor the 17 paintings in the \u201cReturned From Europe\u201d exhibition, Mr. Hubert provided notarized letters of authentication, identifying him as a Christie\u2019s consultant. In most cases, he provided little or no information about the paintings\u2019 provenance, including where they were in Europe before their supposed return to Vietnam.One work, a lacquer painting called \u201cDragon Dance,\u201d had been offered for sale by Christie\u2019s in Hong Kong in 2012, but it was not sold and still had the Christie\u2019s tag. Another, \u201cPoet Nguyen Du on His Fishing Boat,\u201d went unsold in a Sotheby\u2019s auction in Hong Kong in 2008. Both paintings ended up in Mr. Hubert\u2019s possession, were sold to Mr. Chung and were shown last year among the 17 paintings \u201creturned from Europe.\u201dA Sotheby\u2019s spokeswoman said that Mr. Hubert was a consultant for the house at the time of the 2008 auction but no longer worked for the company. Sotheby\u2019s did not respond to questions about the authenticity of \u201cPoet Nguyen Du.\u201dThe same year, Sotheby\u2019s was accused of trying to sell four other fake Vietnamese paintings, all said to be by Bui Xuan Phai, another graduate of the Indochina school. Sotheby\u2019s denied at the time that any of the paintings were copies.In response to the uproar over the supposed Ta Ty painting in the \u201cReturned From Europe\u201d show, Mr. Hubert distributed a photograph that he said was taken in 1972 showing the painting hanging in a room near four well-known Vietnamese art figures. He said the painting had come from the son of one of them, a filmmaker.Despite concluding that the 17 works were not genuine, the museum had little recourse. It had no means to prove the paintings were fakes or forgeries, one official said, so it had no legal authority to keep them.Even as he continued to insist that all 17 paintings were genuine, Mr. Chung returned the supposed Ta Ty to Mr. Hubert for one he could sell. He is optimistic that he will find buyers for all of them.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible in Vietnam to do an investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cWho is going to determine whether a painting is real or not? The police? They know nothing about what is real or not. And those painters? How can they judge my paintings?\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. Pick, Dara Khosrowshahi, Steps Into Brighter Spotlight", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s family immigrated to the United States from Iran in 1978, when their country was convulsed by revolution. They were not particularly welcomed in America, and were broke.\u201cEvery one of us cousins had a chip on our shoulders, having lost everything to the new Iranian government,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, a cousin of Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s. \u201cWe had a desire to build anew as entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi, 48, is on the threshold of becoming one of the world\u2019s most prominent entrepreneurs. On Sunday night, he was selected to be chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing company that is the world\u2019s most valuable start-up. The deal is almost official, according to the travel reservations site Expedia, which Mr. Khosrowshahi currently runs.His task will be to repair the internal culture, which had moved beyond gung-ho start-up to a company known for its divisiveness and tolerance for harassment. He will have to build Uber\u2019s business while preparing it for a self-driving future that competitors hope to dominate themselves. Sooner or later he will likely take Uber public.There is also the wild card of Mr. Kalanick, who might seize on any trouble to mount a comeback. And finally, he will have to manage all this under a much brighter spotlight than he has worked under before.Mr. Khosrowshahi was a long-shot candidate whose name did not become public until he had the job. Expedia is based in Bellevue, Wash., which makes him a Silicon Valley outsider. He had not commented on his new job as of Monday afternoon.His parents, Lili and Gary (short for Asghar) Khosrowshahi, were prosperous members of the Iranian elite in the 1960s and 1970s. Gary was an executive at an industrial conglomerate, where he worked with relatives. They fled as the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed.Four years later, Gary went back to Iran to take care of his ailing father, and he was detained for six years before he could return. Lili raised three children alone.\u201cHis mom raised him to be direct with people,\u201d said Mr. Partovi, the cousin. \u201cBy far the biggest challenge he faced, which is what all of us faced, was having to come to a new country and assimilate. Being an Iranian in America in the 1980s was not pleasant. People were singing \u2018Bomb bomb bomb Iran.\u2019 \u201dBut the tense environment also pushed them to succeed.Mr. Partovi and his twin brother Ali were early investors in Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb and, as it happens, Uber; Dara\u2019s brother, Kaveh Khosrowshahi, is a managing director at the investment firm Allen & Company; another cousin, Farzad \u201cFuzzy\u201d Khosrowshahi, played a major role in the creation of Google Docs; yet another cousin, Amir Khosrowshahi, is an executive at Intel; and Avid Larizadeh Duggan, also a cousin, is a general partner at Google Ventures.Mr. Khosrowshahi, in addition to running Expedia since 2005, joined the board of The New York Times Company in 2015.His route to success took him to the investment firm of Allen & Company, where he spent most of the 1990s as an analyst. Barry Diller was a client, and Mr. Khosrowshahi eventually went to work for the media mogul.In 2001, Mr. Diller acquired Expedia, a travel booking site founded by Microsoft. Four years later, Mr. Khosrowshahi became Expedia\u2019s chief executive. The site has flourished, acquiring three major competitors in 2015 alone. Shares in the company, which is now publicly traded, have risen 35 percent over the last year, despite competition from Priceline on one flank and Airbnb on another.\u201cIf Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing \u2014 he\u2019s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a note to Expedia employees on Monday.Uber, like Expedia a decade ago, has enormous promise but also faces enormous challenges. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s supporters believe he can fix the problems.\u201cHe\u2019s a global travel executive \u2014 he understands competitive dynamics, geopolitical challenges, and the operating challenges of running a sprawling global travel company,\u201d said Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, an investor in Uber as well as Expedia.Under Mr. Kalanick, some Uber executives were considered untouchable, which contributed to a poisonous atmosphere. Shana Fisher, who worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi at Mr. Diller\u2019s IAC and is now a venture capitalist, said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t get an excuse with Dara. They have to be good and good.

{"Headline": "Countering West Coast Pull, by Helping Finance Start-Ups Sell in New York", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jeff Bezos, then a New York hedge fund employee, decided to start Amazon in 1994, he quickly moved to the West Coast. So did Mark Zuckerberg, who moved from Harvard to California in 2004 to find the technology talent and financing needed to build up Facebook.Today, the West Coast exerts a similar tidal pull for start-up companies in finance. Nine of the 15 United States financial technology \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 companies worth $1 billion or more, as tracked by CB Insights \u2014 are in the San Francisco area. These Bay Area companies, which are not public, include the online payments processor Stripe, the online lender Social Finance and the finance website Credit Karma.For the last seven years, a New York business-backed program \u2014 the FinTech Innovation Lab \u2014 has been working to stem that West Coast tide by helping financial services start-ups sell their services in New York in an industry where the city clearly dominates: big banks and other finance companies.The program\u2019s backers include Henry Kravis, a co-chief executive of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; Fred Wilson, a co-founder of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures; and James D. Robinson III, a former chief executive of American Express.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason New York should not be the fintech capital of the world,\u201d said another program backer, the internet entrepreneur Kevin Ryan. He is a former chief executive of the online advertising pioneer DoubleClick and a founder of the flash-sale platform Gilt Groupe and the business news website Business Insider.The term \u201cfintech\u201d covers a group of start-ups, often funded by venture capital investors, that aim to apply new technology in areas like online lending, investing and payments. These start-ups have surged in popularity among investors as banks have had to focus on complying with regulations and rebuilding capital.The FinTech Innovation Lab is a so-called accelerator that annually gives a half-dozen start-ups the chance to interact with top financial firms, hone their products and learn how they can fit into what Accenture, a management consultant, estimated was a $270 billion technology budget for banks worldwide.Tim Estes, the president of Digital Reasoning in Nashville, which uses artificial intelligence to spot compliance and reputational risks for banks in routine employee emails, said that going through the lab program in 2012 was \u201ctransformative for the company, opening up doors across Wall Street as advertised.\u201dAs Digital Reasoning won business from Wall Street, it opened a New York office near Union Square, which now has about 30 employees and is the firm\u2019s second-largest office. Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse Group have become investors.Mr. Estes said Goldman was an early customer, two years after the investment bank\u2019s chief executive was attacked in televised congressional hearings over a subprime debt sale that one Goldman staff member had described in an email as a bad deal. As firms like Goldman realized other such \u201ctime bombs\u201d might be in their email files, \u201ceveryone wanted a better bomb detector,\u201d Mr. Estes said.Another start-up that won business through the lab, in 2012, was True Office, which turns compliance training into a game experience for employees. Adam Sodowick, the chief executive of True Office, had first met Maria Gotsch, a lab co-founder, at a dinner event at a Flatiron district loft. Morgan Stanley signed as a client and invested in True Office, which eventually moved its headquarters from Boston to New York and was acquired in 2014 by the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange resold it this year.The best-known firm to go through the program, in 2015, was the blockchain start-up Digital Asset, shortly after it recruited Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase derivatives pioneer, as its chief executive. Accenture soon invested in the company, which aims to improve Wall Street trade processing.The New York lab is one of hundreds of incubators and accelerators that have sprung up throughout the country to help start-ups, such as Y Combinator in Mountain View, Calif; Techstars in Boulder, Colo.; and Plug and Play Tech Center in Sunnyvale, Calif. Though many programs require start-ups to give them an equity stake of 5 percent or more, the New York lab gets only 0.5 percent.The lab began in 2010 as a way to bolster the New York City economy after the 2008 financial crisis. It is co-sponsored by Accenture and the Partnership Fund for New York City, an arm of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City \u2014 a business-backed civic group formed in 1979 by David Rockefeller.The lab is designed for companies that want to become partners with big financial institutions, rather than compete with them. One goal, said Mr. Robinson, an investor at RRE Ventures since 1994, is to \u201cexpose the big banks and insurers to early-stage companies doing interesting things in this area.\u201dJean Donnelly, the executive director of the Boston accelerator FinTech Sandbox, said, \u201cNew York has come up pretty quickly as No. 2\u201d behind Silicon Valley in fintech venture investments.Accenture says data from CB Insights indicates that Silicon Valley\u2019s lead in fintech debt and equity financing has narrowed. In 2012, the gap was 4.5 to 1, as valley fintechs raised $1 billion against $225 million for New York fintechs. In 2016, the gap was just 1.1 to 1, with $2.65 billion for Silicon Valley and $2.41 billion for New York.Some West Coast venture investors acknowledged the city\u2019s progress. The gap between Silicon Valley and New York has narrowed, said Pat Grady, a partner who focuses on fintech at Sequoia Capital in Menlo Park, Calif.But he added: \u201cIf you want to build the next Apple or Airbnb, you come to Silicon Valley. The unmatched talent, risk-taking culture and relentless optimism mean that you have a better chance of outsized success here than anywhere else in the world.\u201dNew York can be fertile ground for \u201cbusiness to business\u201d start-ups selling to banks, Mr. Grady said. But some of the largest United States fintechs, like Social Finance and Credit Karma, cater directly to consumers and have potentially larger markets, he said.So how does the FinTech Innovation Lab work?Every year, the staff and a sponsor committee choose 20 to 25 start-ups from more than 100 applicants to meet with about 35 banks and other sponsoring institutions. The sponsors, in turn, collectively choose six to eight winners for the three-month program.Banks that once had to be \u201cbrowbeaten\u201d to participate in the lab are now waiting in line to check out the start-ups, said Matt Harris, a partner in Bain Capital Ventures. Lately, out-of-town banks like KeyBank in Cleveland and U.S. Bank in Minneapolis have joined.Companies selected to participate this year included Cutting Edge, Nova Credit and BehavioSec. Cutting Edge, a cybersecurity firm, helps protect customers\u2019 locations and identities on the internet. Nova Credit processes and provides credit data from foreign institutions on individuals so banks can lend more readily to immigrants. BehavioSec helps confirm customer identities by analyzing how they type, click and swipe on their devices.The lab featured 19 events over three months, including meetings with Mr. Kravis and James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley. Mr. Kravis stressed the importance of company culture, and Mr. Gorman fielded questions about Wall Street\u2019s use of artificial intelligence and how investment banks do business with start-ups. There was also a practice pitch session at the office of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.This year\u2019s lab culminated with a Demo Day on June 22 at a packed 215-seat auditorium at Bank of America\u2019s New York office. Each entrepreneur was introduced by a Wall Street mentor and then gave a brief pitch for his business.Mr. Robinson and other venture investors strolled a hall with exhibit tables for each start-up. David Reilly, a senior technology executive at Bank of America, said the program was useful because big banks \u201ccan be exceptionally difficult to sell to.\u201dStill, none of the three New York fintechs that raised the most financing in 2016 were alumni of the FinTech Innovation Lab, according to the Accenture data.In one of last year\u2019s largest New York financings, Oscar Health Insurance, the lone New York fintech unicorn on the CB Insights list, raised $400 million. Oscar was co-founded by Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and backed by the younger Mr. Kushner\u2019s Thrive Capital.Other New York fintechs that raised the most money in 2016 included the online student lender CommonBond, which raised $612.5 million, and Payoneer, a global payments platform, which raised $180 million.Advertisement"}

Nostalgia is not merely a renewable resource. Like the atom, it can also be split, into ever-narrower, more time- and place-specific reveries. Two specimens of this niche-stalgia come to streaming TV this Friday.Now, the eight-episode sequel to the prequel returns for a reunion set in 1991, meaning the actors now play characters roughly the age they were when they made the original movie.So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters\u2019 \u201980s glory days; for the \u201990s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy \u201cThe State\u201d for MTV); and for itself \u2014 that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.As a cultural artifact, it\u2019s both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence. But as a franchise, it feels like it\u2019s running out of time.\u201cTen Years Later,\u201d with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on \u201990s stalker flicks like \u201cThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\u201d At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and \u201ca bunch of other things from 1991.\u201dMany of the core stories are the same. Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn\u2019t gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn\u2019t lost his virginity. And there\u2019s another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way. The lead roles \u2014 hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef \u2014 are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.It\u2019s a brilliant idea. But it\u2019s not much more than an idea.There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football). And the roster of famous voice-over actors \u2014 among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny \u2014 makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.But \u201cComrade Detective\u201d is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama \u2014 a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved \u2014 that it often plays like one. At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn\u2019t fast or frequent enough. Edited to a tighter length, \u201cComrade Detective\u201d might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge. The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.Advertisement"}

That money helped to establish New America as an elite voice in policy debates on the American left and helped Google shape those debates.The statement disappeared from New America\u2019s website, only to be reposted without explanation a few hours later. But word of Mr. Schmidt\u2019s displeasure rippled through New America, which employs more than 200 people, including dozens of researchers, writers and scholars, most of whom work in sleek Washington offices where the main conference room is called the \u201cEric Schmidt Ideas Lab.\u201d The episode left some people concerned that Google intended to discontinue funding, while others worried whether the think tank could truly be independent if it had to worry about offending its donors.Ms. Slaughter told Mr. Lynn that \u201cthe time has come for Open Markets and New America to part ways,\u201d according to an email from Ms. Slaughter to Mr. Lynn. The email suggested that the entire Open Markets team \u2014 nearly 10 full-time employees and unpaid fellows \u2014 would be exiled from New America.While she asserted in the email, which was reviewed by The New York Times, that the decision was \u201cin no way based on the content of your work,\u201d Ms. Slaughter accused Mr. Lynn of \u201cimperiling the institution as a whole.\u201dMr. Lynn, in an interview, charged that Ms. Slaughter caved to pressure from Mr. Schmidt and Google, and, in so doing, set the desires of a donor over the think tank\u2019s intellectual integrity.\u201cGoogle is very aggressive in throwing its money around Washington and Brussels, and then pulling the strings,\u201d Mr. Lynn said. \u201cPeople are so afraid of Google now.\u201dGoogle rejected any suggestion that it played a role in New America\u2019s split with Open Markets. Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, pointed out that the company supports a wide range of think tanks and other nonprofits focused on information access and internet regulation. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with every group 100 percent of the time, and while we sometimes respectfully disagree, we respect each group\u2019s independence, personnel decisions and policy perspectives.\u201dNew America\u2019s executive vice president, Tyra Mariani, said it was \u201ca mutual decision for Barry to spin out his Open Markets program,\u201d and that the move was not in any way influenced by Google or Mr. Schmidt.\u201cNew America financial supporters have no influence or control over the research design, methodology, analysis or findings of New America research projects, nor do they have influence or control over the content of educational programs and communications efforts,\u201d Ms. Mariani said. She added that Mr. Lynn\u2019s statement praising the European Union\u2019s sanctions against Google had been temporarily removed from New America\u2019s website because of \u201can unintentional internal issue\u201d unrelated to Google or Mr. Schmidt.Ms. Mariani and Ms. Sciuto said Google is continuing to fund New America.Hours after this article was published online Wednesday morning, Ms. Slaughter announced that the think tank had fired Mr. Lynn on Wednesday for \u201chis repeated refusal to adhere to New America\u2019s standards of openness and institutional collegiality.\u201dIn the run-up to that conference, Ms. Slaughter and New America\u2019s lead fund-raiser in emails to Mr. Lynn indicated that Google was concerned that its positions were not going to be represented, and that it was not given advanced notice of the event.\u201cWe are in the process of trying to expand our relationship with Google on some absolutely key points,\u201d Ms. Slaughter wrote in an email to Mr. Lynn, urging him to \u201cjust THINK about how you are imperiling funding for others.\u201dSome tech lobbyists, think tank officials and scholars argue that the efforts help explain why Google has mostly avoided damaging regulatory and enforcement decisions in the United States of the sort levied by the European Union in late June.The Open Markets\u2019 statement that drew Mr. Schmidt\u2019s ire praised the fine, and called on United States regulators to more aggressively enforce antitrust rules against Google, Amazon and \u201cother dominant platform monopolists.\u201dGoogle\u2019s willingness to spread cash around the think tanks and advocacy groups focused on internet and telecommunications policy has effectively muted, if not silenced, criticism of the company over the past several years, said Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. His group, which does not accept corporate funding, has played a leading role in calling out Google and other tech companies for alleged privacy violations. But Mr. Rotenberg said it is become increasingly difficult to find partners in that effort as more groups accept Google funding.\u201cThere are simply fewer groups that are available to speak up about Google\u2019s activities that threaten online privacy,\u201d Mr. Rotenberg said. \u201cThe groups that should be speaking up aren\u2019t.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}

But there was no time to rest. We were immediately tested on how well we could throw a ball across the court with a single bounce.\u201cHerkey and jerkey\u201d was how the assistant manger of ball persons, Cathie Delaney, described our movements across the court.

And you can thank light pollution for that.What are the negative effects of light pollution?Light pollution is most harmful to wildlife and ecology, Mr. Barentine said, because it can interrupt the circadian rhythms of different species and interfere with their ability to mate or feed. For example, baby sea turtles use light reflecting off the ocean to guide them to the water. Artificial light can cause them to move away from the water, or in circles, until they exhaust themselves or are picked off by a predator. Not only is the energy used in creating light pollution wasteful, it adds to climate change and is a drain on our energy resources, he said.How is light pollution measured?Satellites in orbit can tell us how much light is escaping the atmosphere, and instruments on the ground can help understand how much light pollution contributes to phenomena like \u201csky glow.\u201dWhat is sky glow?\u201cIt\u2019s when you\u2019re looking into the night sky and you\u2019re expecting to see stars, but what\u2019s getting in the way is light that originates on the ground, goes into the air and then scatters back down and into your eyeball,\u201d Mr. Barentine said.

Bowers Civic Center, where at least 100 people had taken shelter, was flooded overnight, according to a county sheriff\u2019s deputy, and reports said that people were being removed.The Port Arthur-based Motiva oil refinery, the nation\u2019s largest such facility, confirmed reports that it had started a controlled shutdown in response to the flooding.\u201cHarvey was not playing,\u201d he said, as he sloshed through water that had invaded rooms, closets and his backyard, his optimism mingling with shock at the state of his house. \u201cI know one thing though, it\u2019s not going to defeat us.\u201dTevin Baker, 18, who was trapped in his Port Arthur home with his mother, Kathy Baker, 56, tweeted for help throughout the night. The two were rescued shortly after 7:30 local time.\u201cMy house just started to flood,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cWe weren\u2019t ready at all.

Her family had expected water to flood in from the garage, but instead it started coming up through the floor and was soon waist deep.The family put a flatbed truck in the garage and opened the garage door so that they could be seen by rescue workers. They were on the truck from 3 a.m. until around 10 a.m., when they were taken to a temporary shelter in a bowling alley.\u201cWe don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going to go for sure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are definitely better now.\u201dMichelle Preble, 45, in Oregon City, Ore., was one of many people on Twitter trying to compile a list of the addresses being tweeted into something that could be useful to emergency medical workers and others responding to victims.She said that while it initially had been difficult to track whether individual requests for help were being answered by the group, she began to get confirmations Wednesday afternoon that the people whose addresses she had sent had been picked up by the Navy, including a 99-year-old man whose granddaughter had tweeted on his behalf.Eric Vargas, 19, had been waiting for help on a balcony in Port Arthur since early Wednesday morning, after the water inside his home rose to his stomach. He was initially with nine other adults and 10 children, including two as young as 2 years old, he said.He said he had reached the Coast Guard, and the person he spoke to had told him to make sure that there was a white blanket in plain sight. But Mr. Vargas said that he had not been given any update as to when, or whether, the much-needed help would arrive.\u201cI\u2019m just trying to be patient, but I guess I\u2019m going to have to call again,\u201d he said.Reached again nearly four hours later, Mr. Vargas, who had decided to leave the balcony along with some relatives, still had not been rescued.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Down the Breitbart Hole", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "FeatureSteve Bannon once said it was the platform for the alt-right. Its current editors disagree. Is the incendiary media company at the nerve center of Donald Trump\u2019s America simply provocative \u2014 or dangerous?Supported byAlex has been the editor of Breitbart for about four years. In 2008, he was the first employee hired by its founder Andrew Breitbart, and he began to lead the editorial staff when Breitbart died in 2012, although it would be another year and change before he claimed the title of editor in 2013. However you cut it, that puts Alex in charge of Breitbart long before last year\u2019s election, responsible for the daily decisions about what to cover and how. If right now you\u2019re thinking that it\u2019s kind of weird how you\u2019ve been reading about Breitbart more or less constantly for the past year, following the daily exploits of former employees like Steve Bannon and Milo Yiannopoulos, but this is the first time you\u2019ve ever heard of Alexander Marlow, that\u2019s by design. People close to Alex refer to him variously as \u2018\u2018a shut-in,\u2019\u2019 a \u2018\u2018misanthrope\u2019\u2019 and a \u2018\u2018hermit,\u2019\u2019 who communicates with his staff primarily by phone/text/email and doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. In fact, if you have come across Alex before now, it was probably in mid-June, when some of the people on the business side of Breitbart persuaded him to appear on the HBO show \u2018\u2018Real Time With Bill Maher.\u2019\u2019Before we get into that debacle and the jeweler\u2019s-loupe clarity it gave to Breitbart\u2019s predicament, you should know that in the weeks leading up to the appearance, Alex was nervous for all the wrong reasons. It seemed as if every time we got together, the topic of the show would arise, with Alex saying something along the lines of how much he hoped it wouldn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t that he worried what Maher would ask him or how he should respond. Alex grew up in one of the crunchier enclaves of Los Angeles, went to school at Berkeley and lives today in Washington on the boundary between Dupont Circle and Georgetown, which is another way of saying that he has spent his whole life surrounded by liberals who can\u2019t figure out why he doesn\u2019t get it. More than most of us, he is accustomed to defending his job and his opinions to the postman, the neighbors and his wife\u2019s colleagues with a faint, forbearing smile and quickly changing the subject if the vibe starts going south.What troubled him about the Maher appearance had nothing to do with the interview per se. It was the fact that after trying for years to maintain a certain balance in his public life \u2014 broadcasting his thoughts on Breitbart\u2019s website and radio program but declining most invitations to appear on television and public stages \u2014 he was apprehensive about trading 15 minutes of face time on cable TV for the precious anonymity that allows him, for example, to shamble through his neighborhood every afternoon, walking his two dogs, without running into the rabble of protesters who have been known to picket Breitbart offices, or being spit upon by the 30-to-1 ratio of Democratic voters at the dog park.Also, at a more basic level, he was feeling self-conscious about his looks. Alex is maybe six feet tall, with a thick head of dark hair that he brushes in the slapdash manner of a kid giving in to his mother, and he speaks in a bracing, nasal timbre that recalls a Wayans brothers imitation of white people asking for directions. Entering his 30s, he is well aware that his physique is filling out, hovering on the gauzy line between sturdy and stocky. I remember in particular a dinner that we shared about three weeks before the show, when he confessed, as we shoveled handfuls of stewed Ethiopian vegetables into our faces, that he\u2019d been trying all week to stay off carbs and slim down for Maher.\u2018\u2018The thing is,\u2019\u2019 he said with a sigh, \u2018\u2018if I gain 10 pounds, seven of them go to my face.\u2019\u2019I mention this not to harp on a person\u2019s ordinary insecurities but to give you a sense of how little importance he gave to the substance of the coming show. Among the topics that preoccupied our conversation \u2014 the precipitous rise of Breitbart; its elusive place in the taxonomy of conservative thought; its asymmetric impact on the last election and the subsequent migration of its staff into the West Wing, with writers like Julia Hahn and Sebastian Gorka decamping for senior policy positions, even as the company itself achieved a kind of mythic boogeyman status on the left \u2014 I don\u2019t think either of us paused to consider that any of these things would be clarified in a few minutes of television.\u2018\u2018You do ignore stories, would you not agree to that?\u2019\u2019 Maher asks.\u2018\u2018On purpose,\u2019\u2019 Alex replies.\u2018\u2018Do you agree that Russia did meddle and try to fix this election?\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Russia absolutely was trying to interfere,\u2019\u2019 Alex says.\u2018\u2018You don\u2019t have to share your bona fides with me,\u2019\u2019 Alex says.\u2018\u2018But your followers threatened my family, my children, my wife,\u2019\u2019 Nance says. \u2018\u2018You can apologize to me now.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018Show me the story,\u2019\u2019 Alex says. \u2018\u2018If the story is as you describe it, I\u2019ll be happy to offer an apology.\u2019\u2019For a moment, then, on the third weekend of June, it was possible to behold in a single television incident both the fracturing of the American public sphere into discrete fields of reality and their temporary reconvergence around the unlikeliest of propositions. Whether you trusted Daily Kos or The Daily Caller, whatever you thought about Russian hacking, however you placed yourself in relation to the dueling Manichaean orthodoxies of contemporary politics, for a few minutes everybody seemed to agree that just six months after tipping a presidential election, Breitbart was in retreat.Shortly after the election, my friends at The Times told me there was an internal debate over what to call Breitbart. Somehow, the words \u2018\u2018news organization\u2019\u2019 seemed too generous, and anyway, didn\u2019t encompass the weird power it had amassed \u2014 this company that began as a smattering of websites about Hollywood, government and the media, then morphed into a sprawling multimedia conglomerate with offices overseas, including an eight-person bureau in London and a daily radio program on Sirius XM, all financed by shadowy right-wing figures and buttressed by a mob of fervent readers whose engagement in the comment section, for example, dwarfs the comments at this newspaper by roughly a factor of 10, even as those readers/commenters/trolls remain, to most of the outside world, a mysterious horde of indistinct origin and uncertain intent.This leads to a curious phenomenon as the Trump presidency proceeds and we begin to see long articles about Breitbart by writers who are clearly more familiar with the conventional wisdom about the website than with anyone on its staff. Writing about Breitbart has become one of the few instances in American journalism where it\u2019s considered passable to publish a major feature speculating on the internal machinery of a company without naming a single source inside. A recent cover of Newsweek showed Alex hoisting Donald Trump on his shoulders, without any discussion of who Alex is, how he rose to power at Breitbart or what he believes.I\u2019m reminded of an incident earlier this year, when an article in Business Insider reported that the staff of Breitbart had been ordered not to write critically about Jared Kushner anymore. The article explained this in the context of byzantine palace intrigue: Bannon, after butting heads with Kushner, was rumored to be planting negative articles about him in Breitbart, but Kushner\u2019s allies caught on and complained to Trump, who ordered Bannon to stop the fighting. All of which made for delicious gossip but didn\u2019t appear true. In the days leading up to that article, I sat in for maybe a dozen editorial calls with Alex and his staff, who don\u2019t have a physical newsroom in Washington but gather twice a day by phone. Throughout that time, Alex repeatedly asked for more dirt on Kushner, whom he considered a \u2018\u2018Wall Street Democrat.\u2019\u2019 Just that morning, I heard him instruct a staff member to call the White House every day and try to get Kushner on the phone. When the Business Insider article appeared a few hours later, Alex was livid, not because it was true \u2014 Alex vigorously denied it \u2014 but because, true or false, it shaded any story he wanted to publish. He had already heard from his senior White House correspondent, Charlie Spiering, who was working on a profile of Kushner and wanted to know if there was anything to this claim that he was supposed to back off.\u2018\u2018That\u2019s what happens,\u2019\u2019 Alex said as we shuffled along a shady trail near his apartment that evening. \u2018\u2018I told him not to let them get in his head \u2014 just write the piece.\u2019\u2019 But when I met up with Spiering a few days later, he had decided to kill the story anyway. \u2018\u2018No matter what I write, people will read it as a response to that article,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If it\u2019s tough on Kushner, I\u2019m Steve\u2019s attack dog. If it\u2019s not, I backed off for Steve.\u2019\u2019 It seemed as if Breitbart was descending into a Droste effect. A story about the writing of a story came as news to the story\u2019s writer and caused the writer to stop writing the story in an effort to rewrite the story about the story.\u2018\u2018We didn\u2019t set out to study Breitbart,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Breitbart came from the data, not the other way around.\u2019\u2019The project, Benkler said, began with a friendly argument about how the internet works \u2014 whether it serves mainly as a distribution network for the articles on major media, or if small blogs and websites can funnel their own stories back into the mainstream press. \u2018\u2018I had taken the position that it created significant democratization and open pathways for diverse voices to speak,\u2019\u2019 Benkler said. His friend and colleague at M.I.T. Ethan Zuckerman disagreed. \u2018\u2018Ethan thought you saw more amplification and circulation of stories from the mainstream.\u2019\u2019But last spring, as Donald Trump was hurtling toward the Republican nomination in defiance of every analyst everywhere, Benkler got a call from the Open Society Foundations. This being an article about right-wing media, let\u2019s insert the disclaimer that O.S.F. was created by George Soros, the billionaire activist who haunts the fevered imagination of the right in about the same way the Koch brothers terrify the left. At the time, nearly everyone assumed that Clinton would win the election, but people at O.S.F. were still intrigued by the rise of Trump. \u2018\u2018They said: \u2018Something different is happening,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Benkler recalled. \u2018\u2018\u2009\u2018We need to understand what.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019Benkler made some tweaks and pointed his machine at the election. The list of websites it scooped up each day was dizzying. \u2018\u2018We begin with several thousand sources,\u2019\u2019 Benkler said, \u2018\u2018and then we look at links in all those stories, and we crawl out to grab them. If they fit the keywords that we\u2019re looking for \u2014 any candidate name, anything around the election \u2014 we put them in the data set. Then we go to the links in those stories, and draw in those, and go to their links. Usually by the time we\u2019ve done this 15 times, there are no new stories.\u2019\u2019At the same time, Benkler\u2019s team developed a method to determine the political association of any website\u2019s audience. If an article was posted by people who retweeted Hillary Clinton, they characterized the publication as one with a liberal readership. If an article was posted by Trump retweeters, they assumed the publication\u2019s readership was conservative. I can hear you thinking, \u2018\u2018Retweets do not equal endorsements,\u2019\u2019 but it turns out they mostly do. But when they encountered articles linked to by supporters of both candidates, they looked to see which side linked more often, then characterized the audience as center-left or center-right.Looking at the blue parts of the image, nothing was surprising: The largest circles were CNN and The New York Times, each shaded pale blue to indicate a center-left association. But the other side of the image showed just one big red circle: Breitbart. It was three times the size of Fox News and maybe a dozen times larger than any other news source on the right. If you wanted to know who was driving the Republican agenda in 2016, you didn\u2019t need to look much farther than the massive crimson orb parked on Benkler\u2019s screen.Benkler sighed. If the Trayvon Martin study challenged his theory about the democratizing power of the internet, the Breitbart study offered an unsettling confirmation. \u2018\u2018An important part of what happened in this election is that a marginalized community, with views that were generally excluded, forced their way into the mainstream,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Now, whether that\u2019s \u2018democratizing\u2019 or not depends on how much emphasis you put on people being able to contest an election versus how much you put on civil rights, protection of minorities, rule of law. You could say that if it translates into denigration of minorities, it\u2019s antidemocratic. But as long as you are focused on the question of \u2018Do you have an intensely engaged minority able to clarify its message so clearly that it can contest politically in a way that it couldn\u2019t before?\u2019 then it\u2019s a democratizing effect.\u2019\u2019Unlike pretty much all of the above, Alex never adopted a swaggering Rush Limbaugh bravado. He never even thought of himself as a Republican. Even today, his basic menu of ideas is fairly conventional fare. He thinks the federal government is clumsy and wasteful, that rich people get too many breaks, that mucking around in other countries is risky, that anybody entering the United States should pass through customs and that nobody should be defined by his or her gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. He is fond of pointing out a conflict between the traditional American ideal of a \u2018\u2018melting pot,\u2019\u2019 in which individual differences blend into a common culture, and the more recent understanding of multiculturalism, which tends to celebrate differences. Other than that, it\u2019s difficult to know where he\u2019ll land on many issues. He often declines to land at all. On several occasions, when I mentioned something in the news, he responded: \u2018\u2018I haven\u2019t made up my mind.\u2019\u2019 And I lost track of how many times he told me: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m not an opinion guy.\u2019\u2019 A few months ago, when the Trump administration announced that it was scaling back plans on the border from a \u2018\u2018big, beautiful wall\u2019\u2019 to something that looked more like a chain-link fence, he sparked the wrath of two staff members by announcing on an editorial conference call that it looked O.K. to him.\u2018\u2018In there?\u2019\u2019 I asked, looking at the building.\u2018\u2018Out here,\u2019\u2019 he said.Later that evening, Kassam and I traveled to a neighborhood of East London known as Tower Hamlets for dinner, where we encountered graffiti celebrating the Taliban and were harassed by young men who took offense at the sight of Kassam. Most of the locals on the street were dressed in traditional garb, with maybe half the women cloaked in niqabs and hijabs, whereas Kassam was wearing a blue blazer whose inner lining was patterned on the American flag. All day, the lapels had been flapping open to reveal the stars and stripes, but in Tower Hamlets he buttoned his blazer and kept his head down. \u2018\u2018Do you know what Islam says about apostates?\u2019\u2019 he asked quietly. \u2018\u2018The penalty for leaving the religion is death.\u2019\u2019I\u2019m aware that what Breitbart is doing when it publishes a writer like Kassam is to co-opt the principle of representation and use his identity as a shield to promote inflammatory ideas. Kassam was hired by Steve Bannon, whose own fixation on Islamic extremism takes a far more apocalyptic context and tone. But I still think it\u2019s worth holding in mind that when writers like Kassam or Hudson decide to write about the community they come from, they expect a certain prerogative to speak their minds without being labeled, as they so often are, traitors to their race.I won\u2019t delve into all the twists and turns in this theory, but the underlying contention is that a few refugee intellectuals from the Frankfurt School \u2014 Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Erich Fromm, Herbert Marcuse \u2014 were lucky enough to escape the Nazis for sunny California, and being constitutionally incapable of happiness, promptly began complaining. Their grousing and moaning and general sourpuss disposition soon filtered into academia, Hollywood and the media, then into the upper echelons of American snobbery, a.k.a. the Democratic Party. So today you have, per Breitbart, a \u2018\u2018Democrat-Media Complex\u2019\u2019 whose principal aim is to disparage everything quintessentially American, by which he really means Americana \u2014 think Norman Rockwell archetypes and whatever social conventions they imply. This is extraordinarily reactionary stuff, but not especially political in the sense of electioneering. Andrew Breitbart was never as interested in backing candidates as he was in attacking the media and entertainment industries for corroding American traditions. When people asked Breitbart why he wasn\u2019t more involved in electoral politics, he liked to say that if you could reorient news and entertainment, the rest would follow. \u2018\u2018Politics,\u2019\u2019 he often said, \u2018\u2018is downstream from culture.\u2019\u2019Solov is about as media-shy a personality as exists in American life, and despite my most plaintive efforts, he opted not to speak to me for this article. But I heard that many of the editorial staff were skeptical of his decision to hire Bannon, who had never been formally involved with the websites and was known for his explosive outbursts about politics. When staff members expressed concern to Solov, he reassured them that Bannon\u2019s role would be limited to fund-raising and public relations.For a few months, this proved true, but soon Bannon began to dial in to editorial conference calls; he began to interject suggestions, and then to make demands. At the same time, Alex was becoming increasingly central to the daily work flow. Unlike Pollak and Shapiro, he wasn\u2019t particularly fast or facile as a writer, but he was widely regarded as the best on staff at selecting which stories would resonate with readers, and he had a knack for punchy, half-comic headlines. Many of the other editors and writers believed he was already functioning as the editor. In the summer of 2013, Alex approached Solov and Bannon to ask for the top job. At a meeting in Los Angeles, where he made the case in person, he told me Bannon \u2018\u2018had this little smile, like he wasn\u2019t sure he would go for it, but he liked that I was asking.\u2019\u2019 Alex got the job.Although staff members believed Bannon wouldn\u2019t have a role in website content, he continued to parachute into editorial decisions any time he wanted. Alex describes Bannon\u2019s approach as \u2018\u2018theatrical,\u2019\u2019 but other people are more blunt. When Bannon wanted a story assigned or changed, they say, he would call Alex and commence screaming. Alex occasionally pushed back, but far more often he deferred. The stories that Bannon pushed were some of the most ideologically driven. Under his leadership, the site\u2019s coverage of immigration focused not just on trade and jobs but on panicky stories about the coming of American Shariah. So you could say that Bannon influenced only a handful of stories each week, but it\u2019s probably more accurate to say that he guided every editorial decision that mattered.After Breitbart\u2019s death, Bannon began to steer the site in a more nakedly political direction. If politics was downstream from culture, Bannon was downstream from Breitbart. He began to use the company as a tool for political action, coordinating with the site\u2019s activist investors Robert and Rebekah Mercer and using the website to support candidates and partisan causes. At the root of this lay the agenda described in Mead\u2019s book: American workers were under siege by clueless elitists whose embrace of open borders, trade agreements and environmental zealotry was destroying the working class.The last thing Yochai Benkler noted before I left his office at Harvard was that his team had performed a textual analysis of all the stories in their database, and they found a surprising result. \u2018\u2018One thing that came out very clearly from our study is that Breitbart is not talking about these issues in the same way you would find on the extreme right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018They don\u2019t use the same language you find on sites like VDARE and The Daily Stormer\u2019\u2019 \u2014 two sites connected to the white-nationalist alt-right movement. He paused for a moment, then added: \u2018\u2018Breitbart is not the alt-right.\u2019\u2019 Yet precisely because articles on the site were often less extreme than their own worst headlines, Breitbart functioned as a legitimizing tether for the most abhorrent currents of the right wing. Benkler referred to this as a \u2018\u2018bridge\u2019\u2019 phenomenon, in which extremist websites linked to Breitbart for validation and those same fanatics could then gather in Breitbart\u2019s comment section to hurl invectives.Shapiro\u2019s story suggests a more complicated view of Breitbart\u2019s relationship to the extreme right: not an exponent of all the most incendiary rhetoric but its willing conduit. Under Bannon, the site seemed content to welcome its alt-right base. This is what Bannon meant when he described the site as a \u2018\u2018platform for the alt-right,\u2019\u2019 and what Yiannopoulos was doing in March 2016 when he published \u2018\u2018An Establishment Conservative\u2019s Guide to the Alt-Right.\u2019\u2019 Maybe the difference between these things is slight \u2014 between espousing hatred and indulging it \u2014 but how you parse that distinction will shape the way you interpret what Alex is doing now.How much of this comes at Bannon\u2019s direction is hard to say. Bannon received an ethics waiver that allows him to remain in contact with Breitbart staff, and it would seem pretty obvious that some conspiring must go on. No writer on earth would allow a colleague to decamp for a job in the White House without pestering the daylights out of him for leads and scoops; what\u2019s harder to explain is why so few of those leads and scoops turn up on Breitbart. When a White House leak does surface on the right, it\u2019s far more likely to appear in a competitor, like Shapiro\u2019s The Daily Wire or the blog of Mike Cernovich. Shapiro told me that he doesn\u2019t think Bannon gives much to Breitbart at all. \u2018\u2018The way Steve plays the game, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018If he\u2019s going after Jared Kushner, he\u2019s not going to do that through Breitbart, because it\u2019s too obvious.\u2019\u2019 Charlie Spiering has yet to land an interview with the president, and in early June, Alex traveled to Sicily for the G-7 meeting, hoping to interview Trump himself \u2014 but Trump declined to see him. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s starting to become a pattern,\u2019\u2019 Alex told me recently. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re keeping us out of reach.\u2019\u2019We were sitting at a Mexican restaurant sipping mezcal, and I asked whether he felt he was trying to make Breitbart legitimate. At first, he scowled, but then he nodded. \u2018\u2018Are we trying to become a legitimate news site?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018Yes. The question is why. I don\u2019t think we have a choice. We are so high-profile now, we get so much scrutiny, we have no choice but to get it right. That\u2019s something that has changed over the past year. People read our stuff and pay attention. We don\u2019t need to be outraged and hysterical anymore. We don\u2019t need to wave our arms around, flailing madly because we don\u2019t feel like we are being listened to.\u2019\u2019I mentioned that I didn\u2019t really believe he would hire another Milo Yiannopoulos.\u2018\u2018You may be right,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It was getting to a point where Milo was limiting Breitbart, and Breit\u00adbart was limiting Milo. Our stories should look like they could appear in any other publication. The bias now comes in story selection. We\u2019re not going to cover the Russia scandal as much as we\u2019re covering the cartels coming over the border.\u2019\u2019The problems with trying to legitimize Breit\u00adbart are, of course, abundant. One is that conventional news organizations are themselves in a fight for economic survival; another is that the whole concept of news is in the midst of a revision. Most reporters these days think of objectivity as a laudable but abstract goal. Trying to verify facts and elide opinion may push a writer to higher standards, but the overall thrust of journalism these days has been a move away from the construct of objectivity, not toward it.In moments like this, it was possible to feel sympathy for a man in his predicament. He confided to me on another night that like so many people he has tried to hire, he knows that working for Breitbart will occlude his future. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t have a lot of security,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I think I\u2019m the best person to be editor of Breitbart, but what does that mean to the rest of the job market? I don\u2019t have a lot of outs.\u2019\u2019 I sometimes had the sense of him as a figure trapped in a myth \u2014 a man adrift on a rudderless ship, reeling from the tempest of Trump\u2019s election, surrounded by the deck fires of incendiary staff members and trying to pull down the pirate flag in order to steer a new course, past the sirens of click-bait outrage, between the Scylla and Charybdis of Bannon and Breitbart, and he could feel the sea of global resentments beneath him, tossing him this way and that, a riotous current that he partly understood and partly rued but mostly just wanted to leave behind.An article on Aug. 20 about Breitbart News misstated the religious affiliation of a British anti-extremist activist named Maajid Nawaz. He is a former Islamist, not an ex-Muslim.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Casts a Wary Eye at an iPhone Cash Cow, the App Store", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In China, where Western-owned online services like Facebook and Google have long been blocked, Apple\u2019s app store is a lucrative exception. Apple offers gaming, dining and dating apps in a country where most rivals are locally owned \u2014 and where it can reap big fees from iPhone users.That business is now facing a number of threats.The latest came this week, when a law firm representing more than two dozen app developers asked the Chinese authorities to investigate whether Apple\u2019s app store policies violated local pricing and antitrust laws.While it is not clear whether the government will respond, the call follows several other developments that have put a spotlight on the software and content that Apple offers in China. They include tighter regulations from the country\u2019s censors and a high-profile public spat with a powerful and deeply connected Chinese internet giant, Tencent Holdings.\u201cApple has been more successful in China than any Western tech company because their business model \u2014 selling devices that integrate software and hardware \u2014 couldn\u2019t be copied and couldn\u2019t be blocked,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an analyst who runs the website Stratechery.\u201cDevices are sold once,\u201d Mr. Thompson added, \u201cbut services are delivered over time, which means they can be interrupted or held hostage at any time.\u201dGreater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is one of Apple\u2019s largest markets after the United States. Its mainland app store has been a crucial part of its success. In June, the app store in the mainland accounted for almost a third of Apple\u2019s worldwide app store revenue, according to App Annie, a firm that tracks metrics for apps.While China has many locally owned app stores that sell software for phones running Google\u2019s mobile operating system Android, Apple has the business for its iOS platform to itself. As in other markets, Apple makes money from services bought over the platform, including purchases made within apps themselves.A statement from Dare & Sure Law Firm, a Beijing-based firm that said it had filed the complaint on behalf of 28 app developers, said, \u201cSteve Jobs and Apple\u2019s \u2018American dream\u2019 have inspired the people. So why are these young Chinese software developers who also want to pursue the \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019 of becoming entrepreneurs and improving their families\u2019 quality of life through honest work any different?\u201dLin Wei, a lawyer at Dare & Sure, said the firm had not received a response from either the National Development and Reform Commission or from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the two government agencies with which the complaint was lodged. Neither agency responded to multiple telephone calls on Thursday seeking comment.Apple said in a statement that, \u201cWe continue to expand our local developer relations team in China and are working hard to help developers be successful on the App Store,\u201d adding that its guidelines applied \u201cequally to all developers in every country where we operate.\u201dWhether any official action will be taken is unclear. China\u2019s antimonopoly law is less than a decade old, and experts are still waiting to see how it will be implemented. But according to Hu Gang, secretary general of the research center of the Internet Society of China, a Beijing-based organization backed by the Chinese government, the authorities are likely to pursue the complaint.\u201cApple took advantage of its position of unilateral dominance to set unfair conditions for its competitors, and collected a huge commission in the process of doing so,\u201d Mr. Hu said. \u201cThis kind of operation is not tenable according to typical business logic.\u201d\u201cThe relevant departments will definitely accept the complaint,\u201d Mr. Hu added. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201dThe complaint follows the recent tussle between Apple and Tencent Holdings, which brought the American company\u2019s position in China into sharp relief.Tencent owns the messaging service WeChat, which is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese smartphone owners to communicate, shop and pay bills, among many other services.In January, Tencent gave users the option to open \u201cmini-apps\u201d in WeChat, essentially allowing iOS users to bypass Apple\u2019s app store.Then, in April, Apple ordered Tencent to shutter its popular \u201ctipping\u201d function, which allowed WeChat users to reward content generators like emoji creators or bloggers with small monetary gifts using WeChat\u2019s in-app payment system. Apple said in a statement at the time that WeChat could still permit users to tip, as long as the function used Apple\u2019s purchase system.The American company has since moved to cool those tensions. In a conference call last week, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, praised Tencent and said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Alsatian Wines Strike a Balance of Dry and Sweet", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWhile the notion of grand cru in Alsace reaches back only a few decades, the individuality of Muenchberg has been recognized for centuries.Cistercian monks first planted vines in a natural amphitheater in the foothills of the Vosges Mountains in the 12th century. Perhaps for them the potential greatness of Muenchberg was evident in its complexity: diverse exposures angled in all directions and wide-ranging soils including red sandstone with lots of iron and quartz, volcanic sediment and limestone.From any angle, however, the vineyard is gorgeous. The light is pure, and the breeze fresh.The Alsace wine region, from Mulhouse on the south to Strasbourg on the north, is full of beautiful places and great terroirs. This long, narrow slash of rolling hills and pretty half-timbered towns between the Vosges on the west and the Rhine to the east has its share of great growers and winemakers, both older masters and young up-and-comers.Alsace also has an image problem. Or, to be more precise, in the United States it faces the absence of one. Ask a young person about the wines of Alsace, and chances are you will be met with a blank stare. The best wine lists in New York may have only a handful of Alsatian bottles, and the hipper lists none at all.Yet no region in France has a higher percentage of organic or biodynamic growers than Alsace, which theoretically should attract the keepers of natural wine lists.It is time for a deeper look at Alsace, where I spent a few days this year visiting a range of producers. I tasted many wonderful wines, like Mr. Ostertag\u2019s 2015 riesling from the Muenchberg vineyard, savory and saline, full of power and finesse. And, for a wine of less grandeur, his 2015 sylvaner, a grape practically unknown in the United States, is floral and zesty.Alsace did not always draw a blank in America. In the 1980s, when I was first learning about wine, the slender bottles from Alsace were known as delicious high-quality values, dry contrasts to the generally sweet wines from Germany made from a similar set of grapes.Mr. Ostertag attributed the increasing sweetness to American critics who favorably rewarded those wines. \u201cThe sweeter the wine, the higher the score,\u201d he said. \u201cMore and more wine appeared with sweetness and nothing more.\u201dOver time, Olivier Humbrecht, whose family owns Zind Humbrecht, adjusted his viticulture so that ripeness could be achieved with less sugar in the grapes. You can taste the difference. Bottles that I used to find almost syrupy are now sharp and focused, even when they do have some residual sugar.For years, Zind Humbrecht has put a code on its label to show the level of sweetness consumers can expect. The numbers, or indices, run from 1 (dry) to 5 (rich and sweet). I tasted a 2015 riesling from the Clos H\u00e4userer vineyard, marked Indice 3, that was clearly sweet, yet it was vibrant and refreshing, with a balancing zing of acidity that I would not have found a decade ago.Zind Humbrecht\u2019s dry 2015s are lovely, including a fragrant gentle muscat from the grand cru Goldert vineyard and a deeply mineral, concentrated riesling from the grand cru Brand vineyard. I was especially impressed with their pinot gris, a grape that seems particularly susceptible in Alsace to cloying heaviness.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work done in the vineyard getting the precision right in pinot gris,\u201d said Jolene Hunter, Zind Humbrecht\u2019s export manager. \u201cIf you hesitate for a day, the acidity drops massively and alcohol shoots up.\u201dThe 2014 pinot gris from the Rotenberg vineyard was beautifully balanced, fruity and saline, deliciously refreshing.Residual sugar does have an important place in Alsace, as long as the wines are balanced and consumers know what to expect. But Deiss leaves this responsibility to the wine trade and to consumers themselves rather than indicating on its bottles the characteristics of its various bottles.For example, the Engelgarten wines \u2014 from a gravelly terroir where muscat, pinot gris, pinot noir and riesling grow together \u2014 are generally dry, earthy and savory. But wines from the limestone Grasberg vineyard \u2014 combining riesling, pinot gris and gew\u00fcrztraminer \u2014 are invariably floral, spicy and sweet, though balanced by excellent acidity.\u201cThe nature of this vineyard is the expression of residual sugar,\u201d said Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cristofaro, commercial director and enologist for Deiss. \u201cThe wine never completes fermentation. This balance comes from nature.\u201dShe said, though, that Mathieu Deiss\u2019s experiments indicate that fermentation can go more smoothly with skin maceration, and suggested a future application in wines like the Grasberg.\u201cIt raises new questions,\u201d she said.\u201cIn Alsace, heavier, sweeter wines were understood,\u201d she said, noting that that is not the case internationally. To eliminate confusion, the Zusslin wines are dry unless clearly indicated.From the Clos Liebenberg, a southeast-facing vineyard outside Orschwihr in the southern part of the region, you can see the Swiss Alps on a clear day. Riesling is planted in rows and on terraces. Beehives are nearby for honey and pear trees for making eau de vie. Like all of the Zusslin estate, it has been farmed biodynamically for almost 20 years. Each element of the undulating terrain is different, with varying microclimates, exposures and soils.\u201cTo observe is paramount,\u201d Ms. Zusslin said, a key tenet of biodynamic viticulture.The Zusslin wines reflect this precision. They are characterized by acidity, energy and a savory quality that I can only describe as saltiness. I especially liked the lively 2014 sylvaner and the gentle 2014 riesling, both from the Bollenberg vineyard, along with the mineral 2013 riesling from the grand cru Pfingstberg vineyard and the linear 2013 riesling from Clos Liebenberg.The United States is its biggest market, said Pierre Trimbach, who oversees the winemaking, and Trimbach continues to do well there.\u201cWe\u2019ve had no problems,\u201d he said.Perhaps that is because Trimbach has never deviated from its policy of clarity in its labeling. Consumers know that its wines, like the great riesling Clos Ste.-Hune and the more affordable Cuv\u00e9e Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric \u00c9mile, are going to be dry. But when I said this to Mr. Trimbach, he grimaced.\u201cDon\u2019t say dry wine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s No. 1, balanced; No. 2, balanced; and No. 3, balanced.\u201dBalanced. I can live with that.Advertisement"}

He said, \u201cBut we aren\u2019t a weekend thing.\u201d I was mortified. He said he\u2019d think about it, but I never heard from him again. My friends say I dodged a bullet, but I feel terrible about pushing for too much. Any advice?SANDYLast week, I took a spinning class at Flywheel. While we were pedaling up some (imaginary) mountain, our instructor, Ruth, told us that 17 years ago, when she first started teaching, she asked her boss for a weekend slot, only to be told she wasn\u2019t \u201cweekend material.\u201d Reader, she is now the star instructor with an ownership stake.

When your desires shifted, you spoke up. (Well done!) Unfortunately, his wishes didn\u2019t evolve along with yours. No villains, just different aims. The only part of this story I dislike is your beating yourself up. You did nothing wrong in asking for what you want.That said, you are never going to find a good heirloom tomato at the hardware store.

And there are few signs it will stop anytime soon.Indeed, some of the coverage itself has become news \u2014 or at least commanded the internet\u2019s fleeting attention. There was a horrifying still photograph of the violence, a chilling documentary video, and of course, a series of defiant tweets from President Trump that continued into Thursday.And then there was Tuesday\u2019s news conference \u2014 a combative give-and-take between the news media and Mr. Trump, which Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, described as \u201ca moment that\u2019s going to have a legacy.\u201d\u201cTrump has already forced several moments of reckoning on journalists,\u201d Mr. Pope said. \u201cWhat happened this weekend is another one of these seminal moments, another step in this very odd progression.\u201dTaken together, the frenetic, disjointed ways the most striking media moments from Charlottesville and its aftermath unfolded and went viral \u2014 across many mediums and at lightning speed \u2014 seems emblematic of the way we consume news today.As tensions mounted around Charlottesville\u2019s Emancipation Park on Saturday, Ryan M. Kelly stepped onto the sidewalk. Photographing Saturday\u2019s rally was to be his final assignment for the The Daily Progress newspaper in Charlottesville; he had accepted a job as the digital and social media coordinator at a brewery, where, as he noted on Twitter, he would \u201cget paid to geek out about beer.\u201dThe image he captured \u2014 of a man frozen in midair before a fall, of the Challenger barreling through more victims in its path, of shoes having been knocked off their wearers\u2019 feet \u2014 was republished widely by news outlets across the country.Other indelible images would emerge throughout the weekend.With menacing music in the background, a pitch-black screen turns aglow by fire. White men marching with torches chant, \u201cYou will not replace us!\u201dThen, for the next 20 minutes or so, Elle Reeve, correspondent for \u201cVice News Tonight,\u201d guides viewers through the weekend\u2019s events \u2014 including from her place embedded among the white nationalist leaders who helped organize the demonstration.\u201cI think that a lot more people are going to die before we\u2019re done here, frankly,\u201d Christopher Cantwell, a man identified in the episode as a white nationalist, said Sunday after the rally had resulted in three fatalities. His opponents, he said, \u201cwant violence, and the right is just meeting market demand.\u201dThe unvarnished look at the alt-right and its leaders, which aired Monday on HBO, struck a chord with the public. By Thursday afternoon, a Vice News spokeswoman said that the episode had received more than 36 million views across all platforms \u2014 including HBO, Facebook and YouTube.\u201cI knew we had something pretty unique and pretty horrifying,\u201d Josh Tyrangiel, the Vice executive overseeing news, told the network.The tweet was deleted minutes later and a White House official said it had been posted inadvertently.Mr. Trump took to Twitter again Wednesday to repost other people\u2019s messages that assailed the mainstream media and congratulated a Fox News program for pulling in good ratings.Nothing that Mr. Trump tweeted on either day would garner him as much attention as what he said on Tuesday night.At an event at Trump Tower where he expected to discuss infrastructure, Mr. Trump asked for questions \u2014 something his aides, including his new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, had not expected.In a telephone interview Wednesday night, Mr. Drago said he had been taking photos of the president with different lenses when he looked to his left and saw Mr. Kelly with his arms crossed, staring intently at Mr. Trump.\u201cI started shooting a couple photos of him and he started to look down a little more,\u201d Mr. Drago said of Mr. Kelly. \u201cIt was a pensive stare that helped show the mood of the news event we were in.\u201dPeople can draw their own conclusions about what Mr. Kelly was thinking, the photographer said, but \u201cwhen you see his body language like that, you know something\u2019s up.\u201dMr. Pope, the Columbia Journalism Review editor, said that although the news conference was \u201cmessy\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable at times,\u201d it was \u201cappropriate to the moment\u201d and a template for reporters moving forward.\u201cIf someone is saying something that is demonstrably false, we don\u2019t have the obligation to let it unspool; we have the right to stop it,\u201d he said.\u201cI saw a guttural, emotional reaction from reporters to the news conference in a way I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he added. \u201cThere was something unleashed on both sides that is new.\u201dCNN, meanwhile, has not shied away from labeling Mr. Trump\u2018s remarks as \u201coff the rails\u201d in banners that stretch across the television screen.

Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within \u2014 from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\u201cNot every business decision is an economic one,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks, who was one of the country\u2019s first company leaders to proactively address social issues. \u201cThe reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.\u201dCompanies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth\u2019s desegregated.Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including General Motors and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. Apple, Disney and Xerox extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\u201cWhen I went to business school, you didn\u2019t see anything like this,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cNobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.\u201dNow, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected \u2014 to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders \u2014 than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\u201cC.E.O.s wield economic influence,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cNobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.\u201dThe business community\u2019s triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. Martin Winterkorn, a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company\u2019s emissions scandal.But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief of Disney, resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week\u2019s revolt.\u201cThe C.E.O.s of big public companies don\u2019t walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. \u201cBut today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.\u201dLast weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president\u2019s response. Among those watching was Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president\u2019s stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president\u2019s remarks \u2014 in which he blamed the violence on \u201cmany sides\u201d \u2014 were too much to bear.On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump\u2019s manufacturing council. \u201cAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u201d he wrote.The president took to Twitter, lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of Under Armour and Intel had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country\u2019s biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\u201cWhat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u201d the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\u201dAll week, the business world\u2019s actions went beyond the donations to charity and pledges to plant trees that once defined corporate social responsibility.\u201cFor a long time, corporate social responsibility was a buzzword marketing tool, walled off within an organization,\u201d said Alan Fleischmann, president of Laurel Strategies, an executive advisory firm. \u201cNow it has to be central for the C.E.O., part of their everyday responsibility and leadership.\u201dKevin Plank, the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, the athletic apparel maker, built a brand that celebrates diversity, sponsoring athletes like the basketball player Stephen Curry and artists like the ballerina Misty Copeland. Yet when asked to serve on the president\u2019s manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.His star sponsors made their displeasure known. \u201cI strongly disagree with Kevin Plank\u2019s recent comments in support of Trump,\u201d Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of Under Armour.\u201cThe leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,\u201d said Mr. Walker of the Ford Foundation. \u201cBut speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.\u201dBecause companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\u201cThe confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House,\u201d Mr. Carney wrote. \u201cThe battle lines are clear.\u201dThose executives who go out on a limb know the risks. \u201cWe all recognize that with every decision we make, there is a group of people that are not going to agree with us,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cBut you must define your core purpose for being. We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.\u201dDiversity \u2014 of opinions, ideologies and religions \u2014 is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity \u2014 of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force \u2014 that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. \u201cBusiness leaders aren\u2019t threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cBusiness leaders are bullish on diversity.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations \u2014 it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. \u201cOur employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,\u201d said Mr. Benioff of Salesforce. \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for affecting change.\u201dIf the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.The black chief executive of a $172 billion company \u2014 a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president \u2014 Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\u201cOur country\u2019s strength stems from its diversity,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u201dThe C.E.O.s had found their voice.Advertisement"}

Robinson, told a Guatemalan newspaper on Monday. Mr. Robinson has been an outspoken supporter of the anticorruption battle led by Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Attorney General Thelma Aldana.In a post on his Facebook page on Monday, Mr. Morales promised to abide by the ruling of the court.In the eyes of many Guatemalans, Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, a professorial Colombian prosecutor, has become their champion because of his role in cracking open corruption schemes led by members of Guatemala\u2019s political and economic elite.The breaking point appeared to come on Friday, when Mr. Vel\u00e1squez and Ms. Aldana announced that Mr. Morales\u2019s party had failed to report anonymous campaign contributions made during the 2015 presidential campaign.They asked for his immunity from prosecution to be removed to allow their investigation to proceed. That petition must first be considered by the Supreme Court, which will rule on whether to send it to Congress. A vote by two-thirds of the legislators is needed to remove the president\u2019s immunity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Protest, Artist in Germany Re-Purposes Hate Speech From Twitter", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Employees heading to work at Twitter\u2019s offices in Hamburg last week were greeted by a series of racist, homophobic and anti-Semitic slurs sprayed in chalk outside their front door.The graffiti that appeared on Friday was the work of an Israeli-German artist, Shahak Shapira, who said he took the slurs from hundreds of actual posts he flagged to Twitter over six months, only to see a majority of them remain on the platform.Twitter said on Wednesday that it had \u201cnothing new to share\u201d about how it plans to police the network under the new German law, instead pointing to its previously announced tools and features for handling hateful content.The social media giant said that in the past year it had taken actions against 10 times as many abusive accounts as it had the year before \u2014 sending warnings to some users, shutting down others. Twitter would not say how many accounts were addressed and declined to comment on Mr. Shapira\u2019s protest.\u201cWe continue to review and iterate on our policies and their enforcement,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.Starting in October, social media companies operating in Germany could face fines as high as 50 million euros, or nearly $59 million, if they do not respond to requests to remove illegal, racist or slanderous comments and posts within 24 hours of being notified.\u201cI can\u2019t see how Twitter is going to be able to do that,\u201d Mr. Shapira said. More than two days after his video was posted online, and weeks after he first reported the offending tweets, many of the messages remain on the site, he said. Others, however, have either been blocked in Germany or been removed entirely.With Twitter increasingly seen as a virtual free public space, Mr. Shapira\u2019s actions and Germany\u2019s new law have raised questions surrounding the role of private companies and to what extent they alone should be responsible for policing hate speech.Mr. Shapira said he also reported about 150 similar examples of hate on Facebook, 80 percent of which were removed within three days, he said.In its statement, Twitter stressed its policy of notifying users of the status of requests to remove hateful content. But Mr. Shapira said he had been left in the dark about many of his requests.\u201cI was hoping I could have real numbers at the end of this, but I have none because Twitter is so not transparent about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to say without exact numbers, but all I know was that there were too many that weren\u2019t taken care of.\u201dIn June, German police officers in 14 states raided the homes of 36 people accused of posting hateful social media messages, with most of the raids concerning politically motivated right-wing statements, including threats, coercion and incitement to racism.A study published in June by the executive arm of the European Union found that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft reviewed more than half of reports of hate speech within 24 hours, and that 60 percent of the messages were removed \u2014 up from just 28 percent in December. The E.U. study noted that all of the companies in question had improved their response rate.Unlike their digital inspiration, many of the messages sprayed on the sidewalk closest to the entrance to the Twitter offices were removed by a street cleaner several hours after Mr. Shapira painted them. Others remained visible awhile longer.\u201cYes, it\u2019s just words on Twitter, but if you post this on Twitter and you see there is no resistance and they let it stand, you will do it again,\u201d Mr. Shapira said. \u201cEventually you are not going to just post it on Twitter; you might actually go and do those things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Houston Looks to Recover, Small Towns Now Bear the Brunt", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWTON, Tex. \u2014 For the streets of Newton, a small town on the Texas side of the Louisiana state line, to become impassable, \u201cthe flood would have to be biblical,\u201d Kristen Rogers was told when she peeked into the sheriff\u2019s office looking for guidance.\u201cThat\u2019s what they said about Houston,\u201d replied Ms. Rogers, who was looking for a dry way out of rural Texas on her way to Florida.But as Houston, the urban behemoth that has so far been the focal point in the unfolding drama of Hurricane Harvey, began gingerly to assess the devastation, the storm marched on to conquer a vast new swath speckled with small towns that are home to millions of people who were shocked anew by Harvey\u2019s tenaciously destructive power. Officials faced a population in dire need, but far more difficult to reach.Flooding and rain, topping 47 inches in some areas, pounded 50 counties in southeast and lower central Texas with a combined population of roughly 11 million people. The area includes more than 300 towns and smaller cities that felt the storm\u2019s punishing force, even as Harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression on Wednesday.The Federal Emergency Management Agency began to send out heavy-lift military helicopters carrying tons of food and drinking water, delivering it to people who could not evacuate.Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said officials were \u201cimmediately deploying far more\u201d members of the National Guard to southeast Texas, increasing the total Guard deployment to 24,000, including 10,000 troops from other states.Read the words of people who requested rescue online.When officials there were caught off guard by the scale of the floods, and one emergency shelter started flooding, a MaxBowl bowling alley was transformed into a haven for about 500 people, the owner said.For every rescue accomplished, Captain Holmes said, there seemed to be more people who needed help: \u201cWe have so many citizens that are trapped inside their homes.\u201d\u201cEventually we will\u201d get to them, she said, \u201cbut we just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to be able to get to them in time.\u201d\u201cThe geographic scope of this event is probably what is going to make it one of the most costly flood disasters in U.S. history,\u201d said Samuel Brody, the director of the Center for Texas Beaches and Shores at Texas A&M University\u2019s Galveston campus. \u201cI\u2019ve seen heavy rain, I\u2019ve seen 30, 40 inches, but not over such a large geographic area, impacting rich, poor, black, white, you name it.\u201dAnd still, as of Wednesday afternoon, the rain poured down.Michael LeBouef, a retired surgical assistant who lives in Port Arthur, said air boats, fishing boats and helicopters, operating out of the Walmart parking lot, were running rescue missions.\u201cThe town looks like a lake, it really does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the whole town got dropped into Lake Sabine.\u201dEven before it hit Houston, Harvey had already deluged a band of smaller cities. \u201cWhat about the rest of us?\u201d a man named Sam Stone posted on Facebook on behalf of the lower Texas coast towns Aransas Pass, Port Aransas, Ingleside and Rockport, which took the storm head on. \u201cNo jobs to go back to, no money, no transportation. All they do is sit and worry about what happens next.\u201dIn Liberty County northeast of Houston, tiny Moss Hill \u2014 a couple of restaurants, a couple of churches \u2014 had become a refuge for people fleeing the water, which began to creep onto the highways about a mile from town.Moss Hill is the highest point in the area, and the Lighthouse Church attracted a steady stream of people seeking shelter, while a trail of pickup trucks towing fishing boats passed through on the way to points east.More than 20 people spent the night at the church. For the most part, they had fled homes nearby. But there was also a man from Florida who was rescued from his car and dropped off there. Newlyweds whose honeymoon road trip had veered horribly off course were given the nursery as a bridal suite.Residents said they were accustomed to hurricanes and floods, but not of this magnitude. Patty Lee, welcoming visitors with soup, cornbread and sweet tea, ticked off all the towns nearby that were struggling: Kountze, Silsbee, Sour Lake.\u201cYou\u2019ve never had this before,\u201d she said, \u201cso how do you prepare for it?\u201dOn Wednesday at the Simply Country Cafe, one of the few places open, B.J. Price said her home in nearby Batson had not flooded, but her property was engulfed. In the cafe, she got word that another friend had water up to the roofline.Ms. Price said 1994 was the \u201conly other time I\u2019ve seen it like this, and it wasn\u2019t on this magnitude.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is the most catastrophic thing I\u2019ve seen in my life.\u201dMs. Price said she knew how widespread the storm\u2019s toll was, and she knew that in the past rural areas like this one did not always get the most immediate aid.\u201cWe\u2019re not forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just takes them a little longer to get to us.\u201dRural residents insisted that they were used to being far from outside help and that self-reliance and an ethos of neighbors helping neighbors came with the territory.The cafe in Moss Hill, for instance, sent pancakes and bacon over to the church on Wednesday morning, and some raided food from their own pantries, and even pillows off their beds, to donate.In Bon Wier, Tex., people gathered at the Citgo, arriving by boat, truck or even dump truck, and helped others to a shelter in nearby Newton, where volunteers cheerfully divided up donated Clif bars and Fritos.The shelter had been organized through Facebook and text messages, primarily by a woman who works in a furniture store. One family with a catering business was making a huge bin of pasta. \u201cIn an hour we really need to start thinking about showers,\u201d said John Puz, another volunteer.There, Ambika Seastrunk, a 38-year-old mother of five, waxed philosophical about the previous time she lost her home. It was last year.But she got a new home, a double-wide trailer, that sits right by the Sabine River. It was a beautiful home. Is \u2014 or was.

{"Headline": "After Charlottesville, Even Dating Apps Are Cracking Down on Hate", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Silicon Valley companies that make money off social media and online services have started to enact strong measures against extremism, barring white nationalists, white supremacists, neo-Nazis and others who follow creeds they deem racist and hateful.Most remarkably, perhaps, the efforts have even spread to the free-wheeling world of dating apps, where users have for years been welcome to screen potential lovers based on everything from height to religious beliefs.But OKCupid officials said they already had enough evidence to ban Mr. Cantwell for life from the dating service. After being contacted by the user, they worked to verify that the man was indeed Mr. Cantwell, and on Aug. 17, the site tweeted, \u201cWithin 10 minutes, we banned him for life.\u201d\u201cWe do not tolerate anyone who promotes racism or hatred \u2014 it\u2019s that simple,\u201d said Elie Seidman, OKCupid\u2019s chief executive, in an email to The New York Times. \u201cAt OKCupid, our mission is to connect people based on substance \u2014 based on their shared sensibility. The privilege of being in our community does not extend to Nazis and supremacists.\u201dThe moves are \u201ca consequence of the increased political polarity,\u201d said John Drew, an assistant professor of digital media at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y.He added, \u201cSome companies, especially ones that cater to younger, urban audiences \u2014 like Bumble \u2014 are no doubt considering the contemporary moment as a potential opportunity to cash in politically and win over users.\u201dIndeed, even PayPal has joined the fray, electing to cut off the white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s organization. On his blog, Mr. Cantwell also complained about his PayPal account being shut down.\u201cCompanies and C.E.O.s have an obligation \u2014 maybe even a moral obligation \u2014 to stand up for values,\u201d PayPal\u2019s chief executive Dan Schulman said in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cWe have an acceptable use policy \u2014 any site that promotes hatred, violence or racial intolerance, we shut down.\u201dBut experts warned that once online services start banning users because of their views, they risk tumbling down a slippery slope. OKCupid may have had several good reasons to ban Mr. Cantwell, said Jeremy Littau, an associate professor in the department of journalism and communication at Lehigh University. But \u201conce they start policing peoples\u2019 beliefs offline,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s not unreasonable to ask why they allow people who have other beliefs or behaviors that are repugnant.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Cantwell complained in an interview before his arrest this week that in the days since the march and rally in Charlottesville, he had also been kicked off Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Match and Tinder.\u201cI can\u2019t even watch the Vice video on YouTube because it\u2019s age-restricted and I can\u2019t log in,\u201d Mr. Cantwell said.Spokeswomen for Facebook, Instagram, and Google (which owns YouTube) confirmed that Mr. Cantwell\u2019s profiles and channel were disabled because of hate speech. A Twitter spokeswoman would not comment on individual accounts, but said that the site\u2019s rules prohibit violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct. Officials with Tinder and Match, which like OKCupid are owned by Match Group , did not respond to emails.Mr. Seidman, the OKCupid C.E.O., said the need to remove Mr. Cantwell was clear and noted that the company\u2019s terms and conditions give officials full discretion to do so.Still, he acknowledged that \u201cas any person who has ever been on a date can understand,\u201d some cases are not as \u201cobviously cut and dry\u201d as Mr. Cantwell\u2019s.All harassment flags are reviewed by human moderators who review so-called fringe cases, Mr. Seidman said. One question he said moderators consider during a review: Did the user\u2019s action make the recipient feel unsafe or violated?\u201cWe, of course, always veer on the side of caution,\u201d Mr. Seidman said.Like most dating sites, OKCupid allows its members to filter their search for companions by age, location, race and religion. Paying members can even refine their results by attractiveness, body type and their answers to specific questions such as: \u201cWould you consider dating someone who has vocalized a strong negative bias toward a certain race of people?\u201d and \u201cDo you believe that there exists a statistical correlation between race and intelligence?\u201dAsked if that type of filtering posed a contradiction, Mr. Seidman said, \u201cWe do not believe that there is a slippery slope between banning white supremacists on OkCupid to policing other beliefs.\u201d\u201cWhite supremacy and Nazi ideology perpetuate oppression, hate, violence, terrorism,\u201d he wrote, and they \u201care in a league of their own. We will not trade a neo-Nazi\u2019s ability to espouse hate and murderous ideology at the cost of many people\u2019s freedom to date without fear and hatred.\u201dFrances Robles contributed reporting, and Susan Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}

Kennard speaks softly and uses social media to occasionally promote things like canned salmon and wearable fitness monitors.But Kennard is a reader, a passionate one who feels strongly that people, especially children, should discover different worlds in the pages of books.\u201cPeople think that reading is not cool,\u201d Kennard said. \u201cI know when I was younger I was outside playing games and stuff. It seems like kids are doing far too much video games, and on computer and on social media. I want them to get outside and get active. And if they are inside, find something productive to do. Like reading books and doing things that\u2019s actually going to help them learn about things and gain perspective, rather than mindless things.\u201dWhen Gomez heard about Kennard\u2019s reading contest \u2014 which incorporated the hashtag #ReadingwithDK \u2014 she promptly drove her two children, Brendan and Haleigh, 8, to a Barnes & Noble to pick up the books.As the two devoured \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d by Paulo Coelho, she transcribed their interpretations into Facebook comments that she posted on Kennard\u2019s public profile.\u201cSantiago overcomes his fear of failure by trusting his heart,\u201d she wrote about one of the book\u2019s major characters. \u201cIt takes him years to find the sand dune and he thinks about giving up a lot but then he realizes it was all worth it. He doesn\u2019t give up.\u201dTo her surprise, Kennard would respond each time.\u201cRemind Brendan of this whenever it is taking him a little longer to reach his goals than he originally expected,\u201d he wrote once. \u201cPerseverance is key!\u201dGomez said: \u201cI was screen-shotting these things to show people, \u2018Look! He\u2019s responding.\u2019 I made copies. So that they can know, this person could be an N.F.L. player, but he\u2019s not too good to talk with you.\u201dKennard also promised to mail autographed memorabilia to those who gave insightful answers to questions. Max Moore, a senior at Southern Connecticut State University, received a signed T-shirt and a photo. But he appreciated even more that Kennard prompted him to read Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u2019\u2019 a second time.\u201cIt made me think outside the box in regards to the story as a whole \u2014 the diversity and challenges that the story tells,\u201d he wrote in an email about the novel, which he first read in high school. \u201cI was actually really happy to see this was the book he chose because I had a decent amount of personal information on the story.\u201dLauren Russell, a Fordham freshman studying journalism, is a sports collector and a lifelong Giants fan. But it was not the offer of an autograph that got Russell to interact with Kennard and his book club. It was the opportunity to share a tidbit about her appreciation of Scout, the narrator and protagonist of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d\u201cI feel like I relate so much to her, how she was like the tomboy growing up, playing outside with the boys, that was me,\u201d Russell said. \u201cI just thought why not answer this? I relate to this so much.\u201dNow, she wants to purchase a Kennard jersey for the start of the season and feels invested in a football player who made her think.\u201cThat\u2019s why you go to the stadium and buy tickets.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P. Morgan) and $275 (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).As for other large multinationals and the broader market indexes, Mr. Arone sees no immediate threat to further gains. None of the warning signs he looks for \u2014 more-frequent market corrections, higher interest rates and widening credit spreads \u2014 have yet materialized. \u201cNone is flashing red,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even yellow.\u201d While conceding the bull market \u201cis getting long in the tooth,\u201d he said, \u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Are you Mr. Office Dweller now?As The Journal noted, Apple is starting way behind Netflix and Amazon, which have huge stables of original movies and TV shows they\u2019ve been producing for some time. Sure, Amazon has \u201cTransparent\u201d and \u201cMoonlight,\u201d but will it have \u201cPlanet of the Apps 2: Social Media Marketing\u201d?Seriously, though, I hope Apple hires some good content executives from places like Netflix and Amazon. Bring in Ted Sarandos, chief content officer from Netflix, who seems to have a good eye for spotting at least some hit shows. Or someone from high up at HBO. Or heck, just buy Netflix outright! Isn\u2019t Apple sitting on a zillion dollars in cash somewhere?Anyway, I think Apple needs a real breakout hit, just like Facebook and its big video push. I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.Then, one of Uber\u2019s largest shareholders sent an open letter to all of Uber\u2019s employees. The shareholder is Benchmark, which last week sued Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former C.E.O., to get him off the board. The letter included an intimation that there was more damning information that could leak if Kalanick didn\u2019t back down from a fight.In sum, it\u2019s like watching a slow-motion car wreck, where no one seems to have escaped unscathed.Some went even beyond that. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.There was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.I understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.To me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.What do you think?Let me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201dIsn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?Maybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon. But it\u2019s just peculiar to me to turn to, say, Tim Cook, instead of dialing up your local representative.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Working to Close the Breast-Feeding Gap", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Dr. Chelsea McKinney became pregnant with her first child nine years ago, she and some of her friends, all African-American, felt that their families weren\u2019t supporting their desire to nurse.\u201cWhen your mother hasn\u2019t breast-fed, it\u2019s hard to get that support to breast-feed your own child,\u201d Dr. McKinney said. \u201cThis is where health care providers have the opportunity to step in.\u201dShe examined the topic of race and breast-feeding for her doctoral dissertation at Northwestern University in 2012 and found significant evidence of early formula supplementation in hospitals serving lower-income populations.The study included 1,636 mothers who gave birth between 2008 and 2010 in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Lake County, Ill., and found that only 61 percent of black mothers initiated breast-feeding, compared to 78 percent of white mothers.Spanish-speaking Hispanic mothers, many of whom came from socioeconomic backgrounds similar to those of the black women studied, were most likely to initiate breast-feeding at 91 percent. What separated them from their black female counterparts was a reported family history of breast-feeding, a factor considered critical to breast-feeding success.She found that hospitals serving lower-income populations \u201coften rely on formula companies for financial support and lactation consultants are seen as supplemental, not essential,\u201d Dr. McKinney said. \u201cIf a mother doesn\u2019t make it clear that she wants to exclusively breast-feed, the nurses, who are already overwhelmed, will just pop a bottle in a baby\u2019s mouth in the hospital. You\u2019re already at a disadvantage.\u201dKeturah Redmond hoped to breast-feed after giving birth to her first child in an Atlanta hospital in 2012. Despite the help of a hospital lactation consultant, she and her daughter struggled. A nurse suggested supplementing with formula and sent Ms. Redmond home with a week\u2019s worth of formula samples. She stopped breast-feeding soon after that.\u201cA lot of black mothers don\u2019t have much support from home from a grandmother or father who might say, \u2018Just give that baby a bottle,\u2019 if the baby is crying or fussy,\u201d said Ruby Crawford-Hemphill, assistant chief nursing officer at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, who has worked with black mothers and families on breast-feeding education community initiatives.In Ms. Redmond\u2019s case, she tried again with her second child, a boy born in 2015 at a different Atlanta hospital. That time she feared that the colostrum she expressed wasn\u2019t enough to keep him satisfied. The hospital sent her home with a bag of formula samples and coupons, and she stopped breast-feeding after three weeks.\u201cThey showed me how to put the baby to my breast but they didn\u2019t teach me about breast-feeding,\u201d said Ms. Redmond, of Snellville, Ga., who is now 24, \u201cIt was discouraging to struggle with what I thought was supposed to come natural, and I wish they had at least told me what to expect and what was normal.\u201dMs. Redmond said she thought she had to pump in addition to nursing at the breast to increase supply and keep up with the amount of formula her son was taking by bottle. Family members told her to give up when she complained of exhaustion. When she sought help from a WIC nutritionist, Ms. Redmond said she got formula coupons instead.\u201cI\u2019m a pediatrician and I\u2019ve always advised mothers not to supplement, especially in the first few weeks of establishing breast-feeding, so hearing that there was still so much introduction of formula in the hospital was surprising to me,\u201d said Dr. Madeleine Shalowitz, a co-author of the N.I.H. study who is a pediatrician with NorthShore University HealthSystem and a research associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine.It didn\u2019t surprise Dr. Ifeyinwa Asiodu, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco. She began studying the impact of cultural and familial support on black women\u2019s feeding decisions after working with pregnant mothers and new parents as a researcher, registered nurse and international board certified lactation consultant.She said necessary steps include providing greater access to lactation assistance in lower-income communities, addressing beliefs that formula is a superior nutritional option and examining the resistance to a historical narrative of black women serving as wet nurses for white families during slavery.\u201cWhile breast-feeding cannot prevent prematurity or low birth weight, it has strong potential to mitigate poor birth outcomes and prevent infant mortality by supporting infant health, neurodevelopment and immune system development in vulnerable infants.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of stigma,\u201d said Ms. Crawford-Hemphill, the Cincinnati nursing administrator and lactation consultant. \u201cI\u2019ve encountered black women who will say they aren\u2019t a slave, or they don\u2019t want the baby to be too attached to them or that no one else can help care for them if they\u2019re being breast-fed.\u201dLike Ms. Crawford-Hemphill, black women are working on the ground in many major cities throughout the United States to change that narrative through peer-to-peer support before and after birth, whether through hospitals, the Women, Infants and Children program or in community-based breast-feeding groups led by black breast-feeding mothers, supporters and lactation consultants.\u201cI was breast-feeding my first child and saw a lack of black representation in breast-feeding images and stories shared online,\u201d said Nicole Sandiford, the founder of Black Women Do Breastfeed. Ms. Sandiford, now a mother of two in Charlotte, N.C., had her first child in 2009.\u201cI felt the narrative around black breast-feeding needed more balance,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause lots of black people were breast-feeding and should be able to see themselves reflected in breast-feeding advocacy.\u201d She added: \u201cVisible black breast-feeding helps to dispel the stigma against breast-feeding in some black communities.\u201dMs. Redmond said that when she and her husband had their third child, a boy, in May, social media was a factor in her decision to give breast-feeding another try.\u201cMy husband and I decided that this was going to be our last baby, making this my last chance to get it right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still had some bumps but I was more informed thanks to other breast-feeding moms. I didn\u2019t even bring formula into my house this time. I threw away every coupon they sent me.\u201d\u201cA lactation consultant did come to see me in the hospital and she was the most attentive of all of them, but I didn\u2019t ask for much help from her,\u201d Ms. Redmond said. \u201cI feel like I got too much bad advice in the past. I knew that I had to teach myself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Short Answers to Hard Questions About Health Threats From Hurricane Harvey", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey in Houston has brought a host of health questions from residents of the area and concerned relatives and friends. Here are some answers to common questions showing up in Google searches and on Facebook.Yes. Some Texas public health officials expect an increase in gastrointestinal problems from bacteria breeding in stagnant floodwaters that can contain Escherichia coli (E. coli), Shigella, and Vibrio vulnificus. The latter, which is present in the Gulf of Mexico, can cause terrible infections that can lead to amputations. It is harmful if swallowed or if it comes into contact with a cut.If you have walked through floodwaters, it is best to throw out the clothes and shoes you wore, said Winifred J. Hamilton, director of the environmental health service at Baylor College of Medicine.Dr. David E. Persse, Houston\u2019s chief medical officer, does not anticipate any big outbreaks. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a lot of people with those after other storms,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif you look at other floods, you don\u2019t see a lot of hepatitis. In poor countries, you see cholera, but we don\u2019t have it here.\u201dAlso, Houston \u2013 unlike New York and some other cities \u2014 has separate pipes for storm water and house sewage. \u201cOur storm sewer system was overwhelmed, but our sanitary system did not get breached,\u201d he said. \u201cThat water flows into treatment plants, and they did not get flooded or lose power that I know of.\u201dHouston health officials said there have been no breaches to the city\u2019s main public water supply, and that the drinking water is fine. But, they have warned residents who rely on small municipal water systems of potential contamination and have urged them to boil their water.If you\u2019re among the hundreds of thousands of Houston-area residents who rely on private wells, you are on your own. If flood water has gotten into your well, you need to get the water tested. Use bottled in the meantime.\u201cIf you\u2019re on a well, you are your water system,\u201d said Professor Marc Edwards, a drinking water expert at Virginia Tech. \u201cThat is why we have a special outreach effort, a collaboration with Louisiana State University, trying to get information to people who have private wells.\u201dNo.Not so good. In most cases the toxic air pollution given off by the refineries and chemical plants during emergency shut downs won\u2019t cause severe problems right away. But older adults, those with asthma and the immune-compromised may develop inflammations and other ailments. Long-term risks won\u2019t be known until health officials figure out what, exactly, has been spewed into the air.Residents going back to their houses will have to rip out wallboard that has developed mold, which is also a health risk. And be careful when tearing out cabinets or walls: Houses may have asbestos and those built before 1978 are likely to have lead paint. You don\u2019t want to expose yourself or your children.At the moment, the risk is lower than normal. Floods and high winds whisked billions of mosquitoes and their larvae to their doom in the Gulf of Mexico. \u201cWhen the water is raging and surging, everything\u2019s washed away,\u201d said Mustapha Debboun, chief of mosquito control for Harris County, which includes Houston.But once the waters settle, there will be countless low spots, old tires, flowerpots and the like where mosquitoes can begin rebuilding their populations.After Labor Day, Dr. Debboun said, he will send teams out to see how many land on an arm in a minute. If the situation gets bad enough, he said, he will start aerial spraying and probably ask for help from the federal agencies.To spread Zika or dengue, mosquitoes would have to pick up the virus from the blood of humans who recently returned from areas with outbreaks. Throughout most of the Western Hemisphere, Zika cases are down by more than 90 percent from last year\u2019s peaks, according to the Pan American Health Organization. However, Mexico is having a modest uptick this year, including cases in the state of Tamaulipas, which is just across the border from Texas\u2019s southeast coast.West Nile virus is endemic in the United States and outbreaks are triggered by several factors, including the concentrations of culex mosquitoes, humans who are not immune, and birds who are not immune. (The virus builds up to higher concentrations in bird blood than in human blood, so mosquitoes tend to pick it up from them to give to humans.) Birds were also probably driven away from coastal Texas by Hurricane Harvey\u2019s winds.In 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, there was initially no increase in cases of West Nile virus or St. Louis encephalitis, which is also spread by mosquitoes, noted Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But a year later, there was a surge in dangerous \u201cneuroinvasive\u201d West Nile disease in the affected regions of Louisiana and Mississippi: Cases of encephalitis and meningitis more than doubled. Researchers from Tulane University\u2019s School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine speculated that more people were bitten that year because they were outside doing reconstruction work or living inside partially-destroyed houses that mosquitoes could invade easily.\u201cThe big thing I\u2019m worried about is norovirus,\u201d said Dr. Persse, Houston\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cThat\u2019s the \u2018cruise ship virus\u2019 \u2013 with a lot of people in a small space, it can spread really quickly.\u201dThe disease causes vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. It is not normally fatal to otherwise healthy people, but severe dehydration can kill frail older adults.In shelters, it can be hard to control. Health officials try to stop outbreaks by quickly taking the sick to separate rooms where they are given food and entertainment, there is no wait for toilets and the floors are washed frequently with bleach.Dr. Persse\u2019s medical teams are walking through shelters now looking for people vomiting. Shelter populations are thinning out as people return home or find other places to stay, so the danger is decreasing.After Hurricane Katrina, 200,000 refugees ended up in 750 shelters in 18 states, and there were scattered outbreaks of various diseases, the C.D.C. said.About 1,000 cases of diarrhea in more than 20 shelter clusters were reported. One Dallas-area shelter had 30 skin infections with MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant form of staphylococcus bacteria.Officials worried about tuberculosis transmission, one new case was found in a shelter. Health authorities were able to trace about 70 percent of the patients they knew had previously been on TB treatment so they could be kept on it, the C.D.C. said. TB patients who are taking their antibiotics are usually not infectious.That is not likely, but dead bodies may leak feces that will contaminate the water and could lead to gastrointestinal infections.First, make sure that your electrical system is safe and there are no gas leaks. Check for structural damage.Once inside, there is likely to be toxic sludge. Throw out any food that has come into contact with floodwaters, unless it\u2019s well packaged in metal, waterproof glass or hard plastic containers. Even then, wash it off first.Don\u2019t run gas-powered electrical generators indoors or use gas or charcoal grills indoors. These can cause carbon monoxide to build up and kill you.\u201cMany people are already back into their homes that have been flooded with two or three feet or more of water,\u201d said Winifred J. Hamilton, director of the environmental health service at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cWe are already seeing piles of carpet and sofas on the curb.\u201cAs the water dries,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are going to have mold spores made airborne.\u201dShe advised anyone who has asthma, respiratory disease or is immune-compromised not to take on the cleanup. \u201cYou should get someone else to do it if possible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd wear personal protection equipment so that you are not breathing in toxins.\u201dYes, watch out for snakes. Humans aren\u2019t the only creatures who were seeking dry ground.Denise Grady contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Vacation: Printed, Framed and Delivered to Your Door", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe GetawayAnd so this year, I explored a few companies (including one that had just been founded when I was testing all those printing services) that allow you to upload a digital photo, have it matted, framed and delivered to your door in a matter of days. After the first framed photo arrived in the mail, I knew I\u2019d never go back to just plain old prints.Below, a look at a few companies that offer printing and framing. And for those who just want a few prints to pin to a cubicle wall or post on a refrigerator, I\u2019ve included some apps and websites that will print your photos for less than a dime and, in some cases, free (though you pay for shipping).The process is easy. I began by clicking the \u201cstart framing\u201d button. Then it was time to upload a photo and crop it. The photo sizes you\u2019re offered are based on your photo\u2019s resolution. (If you already have a print and want it framed, Framebridge will send you prepaid packaging so you can ship it to them.)Now it\u2019s time to choose a frame. If you want some advice, one of the site\u2019s designers will suggest some mat-and-framing combinations (a free service), or you can choose your own frame and mat. Then you\u2019ll see a preview of your framed art, along with the price. If you want to make changes to the mat and the photo size, you can do so from this page. Once you\u2019re happy, you simply add the project to your shopping cart.Shipping is where a lot of photo websites dent your wallet, but I was delighted to find that shipping through Framebridge was included in the price. It also makes you feel like you\u2019re not being nickeled and dimed.My gallery frame arrived at my doorstep nine days after I ordered it, faster than the delivery times of certain companies that only print photos. (If you want expedited shipping, it\u2019s $15 to $40, depending on the size of your art.) I opened the package, which was well-padded, to find the image just as I had hoped it would be: in a crisp, white mat and a white wood frame, ready to be hung on the wall. My printed photo, a 14x18 frame, mat and shipping was $79, and worth every penny.There is shipping and handling, which varies depending on the price of your order and how fast you want it. Shipping a 14x11, deep-set, $99 frame to New York ranged from $18.99 for the least expensive option to $41.99 for the most expensive.But let\u2019s say you don\u2019t want a frame. On the other end of the photo-printing spectrum are small, cheap prints you don\u2019t think twice about putting pushpins through. And there are plenty of places to get them.The app requires access to the photos on your phone, which may be a deal breaker for some. The desktop version allows you to drag an image onto the page so that Printage doesn\u2019t have access to all your photos. You\u2019ll have to sign up with an email address or through Facebook if you want to continue after that. A dozen 4x6 prints were $2.83 and 14 cents tax for a total of $2.97.Bottom line: Cheap, though not necessarily fast, prints are but a few taps away if you\u2019re not a stickler for professional-quality images. If you want your vacation photos framed on your wall, give a printing and framing site a try. My framed photos take me right back to those special trips. Now I just need to get around to hammering some nails.Advertisement"}

But with its recent moves to shut down the Qatari-backed broadcaster Al Jazeera\u2019s operations in the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government has chosen some strange, decidedly undemocratic bedfellows and sent a worrying message about its commitment to a free press.With Israel jumping on the bandwagon, a greater concern has emerged: The future of press freedom as a cornerstone of democracy is under threat at a time when democracy itself is declining around the world.Mhamed Krichen, a senior news anchor at Al Jazeera and a board member of the Committee to Protect Journalists, rejected the charge. \u201cIsrael always accused us of incitement,\u201d Mr. Krichen told me. \u201cI remember Shimon Peres,\u201d Israel\u2019s former president and prime minister, \u201cdid it in a live interview on my show a few years ago, but only now it\u2019s politically convenient for Israel to act on it.\u201d (Paradoxically, by shutting down Al Jazeera, the Israeli government would be silencing one of the few Arab media outlets that regularly invite Israeli officials on air.)Israel bills itself as a democracy while in the same breath defending its decision on Al Jazeera by noting the example set by Saudi Arabia\u2019s absolute monarchy and Egypt\u2019s military dictatorship. It is true that the government in Jerusalem will need to jump through more hoops than did the Arab states to shut Al Jazeera down. But if Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s government succeeds, it will set a dangerous precedent within Israel.Advertisement"}

His family said he had joined the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps in high school, and then visited recruiters for different branches of the military before deciding on the Navy, where his uncle and a grandfather had also served.Aboard big ships plowing waters far from land, he found serenity and exhilaration. Cynthia Kimball, his mother, shared one of her son\u2019s Facebook posts, written in June, that captured his feelings.\u201cI\u2019ve been to a few gorgeous places since I\u2019ve made it out to the Fleet,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut man,\u201d he added, \u201cI still can\u2019t get over just looking out at the ocean, or staring up at all of the stars at night. I think those two things are at the top of my list of favorite reasons for going Navy over any other branch.\u201dMs. Kimball last spoke with her son, 20, an electronics technician, third class, last Friday afternoon. He let her know \u201cthat they were going to dock soon and he would call me when they did,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was headed to bed. Told me good night and he loved me.\u201dThe destroyer John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker in the waters near Singapore on Monday. Ten sailors, including Petty Officer Hoagland, are presumed to have died despite the slim odds survivors could be found, said two Navy officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential aspects of the investigation. They represented a scattered group of men with early and pointed desires to do service on the world\u2019s oceans. They then became victims in the latest of a spate of accidents involving Navy vessels.After 80 hours of looking across 2,100 square miles of water, the Navy suspended search and rescue efforts on Thursday. Attempts to find the bodies inside the ship continued, but were complicated by the heavy damage to the vessel. At least 20 divers from the Navy and the Marine Corps have been working underwater with hydraulic cutters to try to pierce the McCain\u2019s crushed and flooded berthing compartments.The instructions direct Adm. Phil Davidson, the head of the Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Va., to examine issues including pace of operations, readiness, and whether the fleet was properly training officers and crews.The cause of the latest crash remains under investigation. A pair of House Armed Services subcommittees on Wednesday said they would hold a joint hearing on Sept. 7 about readiness issues associated with the two destroyer collisions. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican who heads the sea power subcommittee, is expected to meet on Monday in Japan with the new commander of the Seventh Fleet, Vice Adm. Phillip G. Sawyer. The Senate Armed Services Committee is also expected to hold hearings examining the accidents in September.A statement from the White House on Tuesday expressed \u201cgreat sadness\u201d and said, \u201cAs the Navy begins the process of recovering our fallen sailors, our thoughts and prayers go out to their families and friends.\u201dThe sailors came from eight states and ranged in age from 20 to 39. Eight were in their 20s.Niana Jasso knew Petty Officer Smith in high school and talked to him frequently over Skype while he was serving aboard the McCain. \u201cWe\u2019d talk about the latest video games he was playing,\u201d Ms. Jasso said. \u201cAfter the military he wanted to be a YouTube star and be a game developer.\u201dHe would joke to her that no one showered aboard the ship, so everyone smelled. Sometimes he sent Ms. Jasso videos from the deck. \u201cJust him just walking around,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d be looking out at the sea and the stars.\u201dShe last spoke to him last week. He had been badgering her to watch his favorite show, \u201cRick and Morty,\u201d and she wanted to tell him that she finally had.The allure of travel brought Jacob Daniel Drake, 21, to the Navy. An electronics technician, second class, from Cable, Ohio, he joined the Navy after high school.He loved gadgets and technology, according to Brandie Roberts, a cousin. \u201cHe was ridiculously smart,\u201d Ms. Roberts said in an interview over Facebook messenger, adding that he was \u201cawkward, but it made him even more fun to be around\u201d and that \u201che could make anyone laugh.\u201dMs. Roberts said she had last spoken with Petty Officer Drake a little over a week ago. He inquired about her daughter, she said, who has been having health problems. She tried to talk with him about once a month, but she said he had never mentioned the recent crash involving the Fitzgerald.\u201cI think maybe he didn\u2019t bring it up because I\u2019m sure it bothered him and he didn\u2019t want us to worry even more,\u201d she said.She said her cousin had made lots of friends in the Navy and enjoyed his experience there, but \u201cwas ready for his deployment to end because he was ready to be closer to home.\u201dLogan Stephen Palmer, 23, an interior communications electrician, third class, from Decatur, Ill., was known for his ingenuity. Caleb Stamper, who attended boot camp with him, said in an interview over Facebook messenger that he was \u201cvery outgoing\u201d and \u201cvery courageous,\u201d and was \u201calways stepping up and leading with new ideas on how we could do things.\u201dHe added: \u201cHe wanted to serve his country before he took what it had to offer. He thought that was the right thing to do.\u201dOne of the things that stood out about Corey George Ingram was his winning personality. Petty Officer Ingram, 28, was an information systems technician, second class, from Poughkeepsie, N.Y.The other missing sailors are Dustin Louis Doyon, 26, an electronics technician, third class, from Suffield, Conn.; Abraham Lopez, 39, an interior communications electrician, first class, from El Paso; Kevin Sayer Bushell, 26, an electronics technician, second class, from Gaithersburg, Md; and Timothy Thomas Eckels Jr., 23, an information systems technician, second class, from Manchester, Md.There was little question that the collision involving the Fitzgerald had gotten the attention of the McCain sailors. But it didn\u2019t seem to worry them.Ms. Kimball, Petty Officer Hoagland\u2019s mother, said she had discussed that accident with her son.\u201cWe talked about the other collision,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, he was not worried it would happen to them.\u201dEric Schmitt, Austin Ramzy and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. de Blasio had to show only that the candidates he is facing had appeared in the local news media at least 12 times or had received significant endorsements.

{"Headline": "Teaching Hurricane Harvey: Ideas and Resources", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdated, Sept. 4 with additional ideas from a Houston English teacher. Across a region that is home to millions of people and includes Houston, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city, no one has a clear idea how many people are missing, how many evacuated, how many hunkered down or were trapped in their waterlogged homes, or how many inundated houses and vehicles are beyond saving.The scale of the crisis is so vast, in fact, that officials concede they are nowhere near being able to measure it, much less fully address it.Below, we share a few ideas for how to begin to talk about this natural disaster with your students. We\u2019ll continue to update this lesson in the days and weeks ahead._____________________Images as a Starting Point for ResponsePost the images around the classroom, gallery-style, or project them on a whiteboard, then ask students to respond in writing or in a class discussion. You could also give students the option to write letters to people they see in these photos, or to the people affected in general.If you would like to use the photos to inspire your class to discuss what individuals and groups can do to respond to this disaster and its aftermath, see our section \u201cEveryday Heroes,\u201d below, for more ideas.In general, as students view and read about this storm, you might ask them: What stories, images or news items are most compelling, meaningful, moving or important to you? Why?Finally, you can have students generate lists of questions posed by these images and use them for later inquiry. Some of the additional resources and ideas below might help._________An Overview of the Deadly Damage__________ An Unprecedented DisasterHow is this storm \u201cunprecedented\u201d? How does it compare with other storms, like Hurricane Katrina? What lessons can the people of Houston learn from New Orleans? Here are other articles that may help:_________Understanding Houston What makes Houston a \u201cuniquely American success story\u201d?What about its geography, industry, history and politics might also make it uniquely complicated to fix in the aftermath of Harvey?But Harvey\u2019s staggering flooding is raising very un-Houstonian questions about whether there are, in fact, limits to the Houston model of perpetual growth, and whether humans can push nature only so far before nature pushes back with catastrophic force.As reporting on this region continues over the days and weeks ahead, students might attempt to answer the two questions we pose at the top of this section about what makes this city both a unique success, and uniquely complicated to fix._________Katrina wreaked devastation on New Orleans in 2005. Sandy pummeled the New York City region in 2012. Now Harvey.Even before the devastation from Harvey, southeastern Texas was enduring a year unlike any before.The severity of Harvey, in other words, is almost certainly related to climate change._________Education, InterruptedI\u2019m sitting in a bedroom in my friend\u2019s house in southwest Houston, terrified for my city. The rain has poured down nonstop since Friday. I\u2019m lucky to be safe and dry, but I worry for the thousands of others who are not as fortunate \u2014 particularly many of my students.One of my students was being evacuated when I called to check up on her. I can only imagine what she and other kids are going through right now.I teach second grade at an inner city elementary school in Houston. My babies are only 7. Displaced students may be assigned to my school and thus my class. I may have more students than I have chairs. That is ok with me. I will find chairs, even if I have to bring some from my home or purchase. Providing stability for them is most important to me. The lesson I want to share with my little ones is to focus on the positive impacts (masses of people and organizations putting individual differences aside and helping each other) while respectfully acknowledging the negative impacts Harvey has caused.Finally, if you are not in the Houston area, you might challenge your students to think about the issues a principal of an affected school might encounter. What would his or her priorities be? Why? Students might make a list of the things they would do or think about first if they were in charge of a school trying to weather the destruction._________Politics and LeadershipHow should leaders respond to anticipated storms? They often get criticized afterward if the storm is weaker or stronger than anticipated. With Hurricane Harvey, leaders rose to the challenge in different ways.Hurricane Harvey was the rarest of disasters to strike during the Trump presidency \u2014 a maelstrom not of Mr. Trump\u2019s making, and one that offers him an opportunity to recapture some of the unifying power of his office he has squandered in recent weeks.The devastating storm will likely require a multibillion-dollar emergency relief measure that must somehow find its way through a Congress already contending with a potential government shutdown on Oct. 1, a must-pass measure to raise the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit and a months-overdue budget needed to secure a promised overhaul of the tax code.What words of advice do you have for members of Congress? And, what predictions can you make: Is a relief package likely to sail through, or do you think there will be significant roadblocks to passage?_________Media Literacy and Fake News Ask your students, Is the photo above real or fake? Would you retweet it? How would you decide?You might start by asking them:\u2022In a world where news can be reported by anyone with a cellphone, how do you decide what is true?\u2022What questions should you ask to find out?\u2022What personal rules might you develop to decide what news you post and when you post it?\u2022What harm might be done by not following those rules?Everyday Heroes \u2014 and How Students Might HelpA large and complicated rescue operation is underway in Texas, and, so far, there\u2019s no end in sight. But an outpouring of support helped save lives during the storm and in its aftermath.Next, have students choose two of the following to read:Alternately, students can also watch \u201cHow a Mattress Store Became a Home for Harvey Victims,\u201d below._________Fire Ants and the Disruption of HabitatsBut certainly among the creepiest images to emerge were the rust-colored mounds formed by colonies of fire ants, the nightmarish spawn of the deadly storm that first made landfall last week and soaked South Texas with record-setting rains.How else has Hurricane Harvey disrupted habitats? What are the effects so far, and what other effects do you predict down the line?_________Poetry Ideas from a Houston English TeacherWhat\u2019s most difficult about planning is not knowing what the needs will be, who will have been affected greatly, and who will not have been affected. At school, our work must go on. Our students need to learn and grow while simultaneously experiencing grief, anger, pain, empathy, and all the other emotions coming to the surface now.I\u2019m considering poetry as an avenue into this work, from Emily Dickinson to poems by people posted just after the storm hit. We do a poem-a-day protocol called Through-Threes which focuses on these three questions:1. What happens?2. Where is the shift?3. What lines or moments stand out to you as especially powerful?I also think my first week back I may undertake teaching songs from Bruce Springsteen\u2019s album \u201cThe Rising.\u201d Ever since 9-11 occurred my second year as a teacher, I\u2019ve struggled with how to teach on that day, and Springsteen\u2019s lyrics tell poignant, painful stories of different people experiencing grief and loss while never overtly making the songs only about that event.Here is a tentative list of poems and songs compiled from a variety of sources that could be helpful for different high school-aged students to read and process. Some have strong, intense language. Some are about storms and floods, including Houston and New Orleans, while some are more oblique. Please read them closely before deciding to use them.I am by no means an expert but I am worried about supporting my community during this impossible time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swap the Hot Grill for a Cool Drink and Low Oven", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity KitchenWhy is it that whenever I decide to grill outdoors in New York, it turns out to be the hottest day of the century? This has occurred several times this season.Most recently, I had intended to light the coals and cook up a pile of ribs. But then I caved. Did I really want to stand over a hot fire in the scorching midday sun?It was easy to opt for an alternative. I turned the oven to 250 degrees, popped in the pork ribs, and retired to an air-conditioned room, cool drink in hand. Over the course of an hour and a half, I visited the ribs occasionally, flipping them over and daubing them with some of the marinade in the pan. The major work was essentially done. Later, I would paint them again and let them sizzle and glaze.The ribs themselves were not the giant slathered-and-barbecued kind; those are best left to the pros. Friends were coming over, and I wanted irresistible finger food on hand. Baby back ribs, cut Asian-style into three-inch, bone-in pieces, would be just the ticket. To determine how to cook them, I leafed through cookbooks.I also liked Mr. Ricker\u2019s stubborn stance on how long to cook these ribs. \u201cNot falling-off-the-bone tender!\u201d he insists. Thai diners prefer ribs on the chewy side, with a little tasty, crunchy cartilage or gristle in the bargain. I concur, having found pleasure nibbling on chicken wings and drumsticks with similar features.There\u2019s no real way to hurry these ribs. The longer they stay in the marinade, the more flavorful they become: two hours at minimum, or overnight if possible.I stayed faithful to the spirit of the \u201cPok Pok\u201d recipe but, of course, couldn\u2019t resist adding my own flourishes. I stirred in a bit of tamarind paste to complement the honey, and upped the hot pepper a fraction. This way, the ribs had enough oomph to forgo a dipping sauce. But feel free to serve them with a spicy dip if you want something more incendiary. You\u2019ll have fire on the tongue, but at least you will have circumvented the heat of the grill.And to Drink ...cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Apple Is Experiencing Another Growth Spurt", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At 41 years old, Apple is a respected elder of the tech industry. But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201dFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.In the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.The iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.In a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201dMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.Even Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.Apple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201dBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.Still, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.The risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said.Advertisement"}

Google, Mr. Schmidt and his family\u2019s foundation are the principal funders of that think tank.But as the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog discovered in February 2009 when it investigated Google\u2019s handling of consumer privacy, the funding from Google comes with strings attached. As the group noted on its website, Google\u2019s director of policy communications, Bob Boorstin, emailed the Rose Foundation (a major funder of Consumer Watchdog) complaining about Consumer Watchdog and asking the charity to consider \u201cwhether there might be better groups in which to place your trust and resources.\u201d Mr. Boorstin later apologized for his attempts to cripple a Google critic, but there is no evidence that the use of this kind of tactic has ended.So when these supposedly neutral organizations weigh in on issues that involve Google, you should take their advocacy with a grain of salt. In the coming months, privacy legislation put forward by Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, and modifications to the Safe Harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act advocated by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, will come before Congress. Google does not want either of these laws to pass, and you can be sure that papers from major think tanks will be part of the policy discussion.Perhaps more important, the discussion that is beginning to take place on both sides of the political aisle on whether companies like Google and Amazon are too big will continue. The role of the think tanks in this debate will be important.

{"Headline": "New Worries About Storm Damage as Beaumont\u2019s Drinking Water Shuts Off", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith drinking water cut off, its river still rising, and most routes in and out of the city flooded, Beaumont suffered the worst of Texas\u2019 hardships on Thursday, and they showed no sign of abating.Flooding shut down the pumping plants that supply water to Beaumont in the morning, prompting a hospital to transport its patients out of the city, and trucks carrying bottled water struggled to reach the largely isolated city.The Neches River surged far beyond its banks, into streets, houses and businesses in the city of almost 120,000 people 70 miles east-northeast of Houston, reaching six feet above the previous record by afternoon, the National Weather Service reported. It was projected to rise another foot by Friday afternoon.The loss of water was just one of a host of new dangers emerging in the aftermath of Harvey, a storm system that pounded southeast Texas with record rainfall for several days before blowing across Louisiana and into Mississippi. Once a Category 4 hurricane, Harvey has been downgraded to a tropical depression.A series of small explosions shook a chemical plant about 25 miles northeast of downtown Houston on Thursday and more blasts were expected, after floodwaters shut down the cooling systems that kept the chemicals stable. Twenty-one emergency workers were treated for exposure to the resulting fumes and smoke, which were described as a lung and eye irritant.It appeared that the health and safety risk from the plant was limited. But in a region dotted with chemical factories, oil refineries and natural gas plants, the explosions at the Arkema plant near Crosby, Tex., underscore the worries that many people have about the lingering dangers that damage from the storm poses to the region\u2019s infrastructure, economy and health.Houston officials ordered mandatory evacuation of areas around the Barker Reservoir, as flooding from that basin, and the nearby Addicks Reservoir, continued to pour into neighborhoods on the city\u2019s western edge. In other parts of the city, floodwaters receded, exposing countless losses and new hazards, like ruined and abandoned vehicles blocking roads, damaged electrical systems, and mold.As residents of the region tried to assess the damage and some returned to their homes, weather forecasters had some bad news: More rain is expected early next week.Read the words of people who requested rescue online.More updates:\u2022 Local officials blamed the storm for 39 deaths in Texas, cautioning that the number could go higher.\u2022 Vice President Mike Pence and other cabinet officials visited the region to meet with storm survivors.\u2022 President Trump plans to donate $1 million to help storm victims in Texas and Louisiana, the White House announced.\u2022 Tom Bossert, the White House official who is spearheading the administration\u2019s storm response, estimated that 100,000 houses in Texas and Louisiana have been damaged or destroyed, and said Mr. Trump will seek billions in aid in the coming weeks.\u2022 More than 30,000 people remained in shelters in the region. Houston fire officials said they would begin going door to door to search for victims, a process that could take up to two weeks. \u201cThe shelter mission is the biggest battle that we have right now,\u201d said Brock Long, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u2022 FEMA reported that 95,745 people in Texas had been approved for emergency assistance, including rent, repairs and lost property. The agency has so far paid out about $57 million.Arkema officials said the site had been without power since Sunday and the water was six feet deep in some areas. Organic peroxides stored there need to be refrigerated or they become unstable. With a storage warehouse warming up, the crew transferred the chemicals to diesel-powered refrigerated trailers.But the backup generators flooded as well, and the units apparently warmed to the point where the chemicals, which are used in making plastic and other materials, exploded overnight.The blasts were not expected to affect chemicals in other parts of the plant, said Mr. Rennard, the company official, and the company was able to monitor the status of the containers remotely.Vice President Pence and several cabinet officials arrived to a sunny, hot and humid Corpus Christi around midday before heading to nearby Rockport to speak with victims of the storm.\u201cThe American people are with you,\u201d he told a crowd outside a Rockport church that was damaged by the storm. \u201cWe are here today, we will be here tomorrow and we will be here every day until this city and this state and this region rebuild bigger and better than ever before.\u201dAbout 21,000 federal workers have been mobilized in response to the storm and Congress is expected to debate passage of a multibillion-dollar emergency aid package in the coming weeks.Mr. Trump, who visited the area earlier in the week, is expected to return to Texas on Saturday.Taps in Beaumont ran dry, and officials there said they could not predict when homes and businesses in the city of almost 120,000 residents would have running water again. The city manager, Kyle Hayes, said at a midday news conference that he would not be able to assess flood damage to the city\u2019s water pumps, or give a timeline for fixing them, until water began to recede, which he said would happen no earlier than Saturday. He added that the city was working on setting up bottled water distribution centers.The storm dropped 47 inches of rain in the Beaumont-Port Arthur area, and most roads into the cities remain impassable, making relief shipments of bottled water difficult.The city\u2019s Baptist Beaumont Hospital began to transport most of its 193 patients by ambulance and helicopter to other hospitals outside the area, and to discharge those who could safely go home, said Mary Poole, a hospital spokeswoman.Christus Southeast Texas-St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont decided not to evacuate, but until the city water supply resumes, it will only admit new patients who need critical or emergency care, officials there said.State figures showed nearly 150,000 water connections were affected by boil-water notices. Nearly 32,000 of those connections were in Victoria, which has struggled to provide clean water since late last week. Bryan Simons, a spokesman for the county\u2019s emergency operations center, said part of the delay was the state process to recertify the system after concerns about its integrity arose.\u201cOur community is very understanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand the circumstances behind it. They\u2019re sort of just rolling with it at this point.\u201dParts of Houston began to dry out, exposing daunting expanses of muck, vehicles and waterlogged homes, but other areas of the city remained under water or impassable. Rescues of stranded people continued, though at a much-reduced pace.Some people tried to go back to homes they had fled, but officials urged caution and patience.With much of the nation\u2019s oil refining capacity shut down by the storm, a fuel shortage began to be felt across the region, which experts said will continue for weeks. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, warned gas stations not to take advantage of consumers. The attorney general\u2019s office has received more than 500 complaints, including cases in Dallas where customers were charged $6 to $8 per gallon.Record flooding continued on the Buffalo Bayou in the western suburbs, a surge that will eventually flow downstream through Houston and pose a continued risk to parts of the city. In addition, the Addicks and Barker reservoirs continued to release water into the Buffalo Bayou.The city advised people to wash their hands after coming into contact with floodwaters, which may carry toxic chemicals and diseases, and warned against eating any food that had come into contact with the water. Some trash collections resumed.The Houston Independent School District announced that classes would not resume until Sept. 11. Superintendent Richard Carranza said that more than 10 percent of the city\u2019s schools sustained water damage or lost power. The district relaxed its school uniform rules through January. All of the city\u2019s public school students, regardless of family income, will be eligible for three free meals per day for the entire school year.When Hurricane Harvey made landfall, its winds smashed some things and spared others. Houses were pushed off their foundations, while shacks next door were spared. Big trees stood as small trees toppled.At Spanky\u2019s Liquor on the main street of Port Aransas, the windows shattered, the walls collapsed. \u201cThe roof? It\u2019s about 100 feet that way,\u201d the owner, Tom Hamilton, said as he paused from sweeping up the pieces and pointed toward a house with a boat capsized against the porch and a surfboard lodged in a tree.But nearly every bottle of liquor was still intact on the shelves now open to the sky.Like many on the island, Mr. Hamilton and his staff were beginning the long ordeal of loss and recovery. Christy Lambert pulled out her phone to find a photo of her home in Aransas Pass, just across the bay. There was nothing left but a single kitchen wall. Most of her possessions had blown away.\u201cWhen I saw it, I cried, I cried for hours,\u201d said Ms. Lambert, who fled the storm and returned on Monday.\u201cI don\u2019t really have anything but a few things I packed and $40,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to come back from that, but as long as I can keep working, I\u2019ll be O.K.\u201dReporting was contributed by Rick Rojas from Beaumont, Tex.; Dave Philipps from Port Aransas, Tex.; Alan Blinder from Houston; and Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Henry Fountain, Timothy Williams, Niraj Chokshi, Jonah Engel Bromwich and from New York.Advertisement"}

They will request a psychiatric evaluation of Mr. Madsen, a routine measure in cases involving the most serious crimes.The case has riveted Scandinavia, where Mr. Madsen is well known as a quixotic if mercurial innovator, and plunged Ms. Wall\u2019s friends and relatives into grief.Ms. Franz\u00e9n remembered her friend \u2014 a graduate of the London School of Economics and had two master\u2019s degrees from Columbia University \u2014 as courageous and modest.\u201cTo lose her is not just to lose a friend, but a source of inspiration,\u201d she wrote.Caterina Clerici, who met Ms. Wall when they took the entrance examination for Columbia Journalism School, expressed shock that her friend, who had reported from Cuba, Sri Lanka and Uganda and had written for The New York Times, died so close to home.\u201cShe was never reckless,\u201d Ms. Clerici said. \u201cShe never did anything stupid. She knew what she was doing. She was very well traveled. She had a lot of experience even though she was fairly young.\u201dJens Falkenberg, a friend of Mr. Madsen\u2019s and a fellow submarine builder, said he was \u201cshocked and astonished\u201d by the crime. \u201cPeter handles stress very poorly, but is never aggressive,\u201d Mr. Falkenberg said.He said it was common for Mr. Madsen to welcome journalists on board as many media outlets wanted to report on his submarine. Mr. Falkenberg was not aware of Ms. Wall\u2019s trip before it took place, he said.A foundation that had commissioned a documentary about Mr. Madsen as part of the city\u2019s designation as a European Capital of Culture this year, decided last week to stop the project mid-production.Peter Vestergaard, a spokesman for the foundation, said it and the film\u2019s director, Emma Sullivan, decided not to finish the movie given the criminal case against Mr. Madsen.The film, \u201cRocket Man,\u201d about Mr. Madsen\u2019s plans for outer-space travel, was scheduled to be shown on Oct. 25 in Aarhus.Martin Selsoe Sorensen reported from Copenhagen, and Christina Anderson from Stockholm.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Navigate Social Media Boundaries in a Relationship", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "Supported byAs a sex therapist, I never imagined I\u2019d spend so much time talking about Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.But a number of my sessions are filled with stories about the ways that social media interferes with my clients\u2019 relationships: things like snooping in a Facebook account, and then agonizing over what to do with suspicious, but not completely incriminating, activity; or ending a new and promising relationship because the person followed their exes on Instagram.\u201cIt\u2019s so tricky because it is completely uncharted territory,\u201d he said. \u201cSocial media accounts have never had this level of market saturation at any other point in human history. That\u2019s inevitably going to bring up some new challenges for people.\u201dMost of us are uncomfortable talking about these types of interactions because we worry that social media is too frivolous to argue over, but it is important to recognize that social media brings up real feelings, and those feelings do matter.Still, navigating social media boundaries doesn\u2019t have to be the colossal struggle we sometimes turn it into.The most common social media-related fight I hear from clients is how much time their partners spend on Facebook or Instagram. I hear story after story of couples planning a romantic date night that turns into nothing but chatter about Instagram likes, Twitter favorites and Snapchat views.The behavior even extends into the bedroom: Clients have told me stories of discreet mid-coitus phone check-ins.You should always make your partner feel more important to you than your phone, so dedicate at least 20 minutes a day to spending screen-free time together. (Scrolling through Facebook while watching television won\u2019t cut it.)Of course, more social media-free time is better, if you can swing it. You may like having all your meals be phone-free (or at least having those phones on silent or in airplane mode). Or try turning off notifications when you\u2019re together.Always prioritize your living, breathing, human partner. This is especially important when it comes to sharing details, photos of the two of you or details of your lives or dates together. Often in relationships, one person is more private than the other, a difference that can lead to fights.One easy rule to follow: Ask your partner before sharing anything related to your relationship. Simple questions like, \u201cAre you O.K. with my posting this picture of us on our date night?\u201d can go a long way toward heading off arguments. When there isn\u2019t agreement, Mr. Gray said to err \u201con the side of the partner who is more private.\u201dIf you find yourself stuck in oversharing mode, Ms. McCallum offered a great reminder. \u201cThe volume of photographs of your relationship that you post on Facebook is not indicative of the success or warmth within that relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cEven in this period of heightened social media use, very solid, strong, happy couples quite often choose to not lay their relationships bare on Facebook.\u201dIn the real world, the boundaries we should abide by when we are in a relationship are obvious. But social media can blur those lines, which might lead people to do or say things online that they wouldn\u2019t in real life. Commenting \u201cniccccce\u201d on your ex\u2019s latest bathing suit photo on Instagram may seem more innocuous than saying it to her face, but it might not come across that way.Use real-world boundaries as your digital guide. Imagine that your social media behavior is happening in person, with your partner standing right beside you. Would you make that comment or send that message with your partner watching? If you wouldn\u2019t do it in the real world, don\u2019t do it online.Social media also makes it easier to check on your partner\u2019s behavior. You don\u2019t have to don a trench coat, fake mustache and sunglasses to track your partner across town anymore. You can just grab his phone when he is in the shower. And there\u2019s a lot to find too; for some reason, most of us think our online activity is private, but it\u2019s shockingly easy to find a treasure trove of information.Some people insist on trading phone passcodes before getting into a committed relationship, or refuse to date someone who won\u2019t share their passwords as \u201cproof\u201d of their fidelity. It\u2019s easy to feel entitled to see your significant other\u2019s emails, texts and direct messages, assuming that you should be able to if they have nothing to hide. As tempting as it may be, snooping is never a good idea, in the real world or online.\u201cIf you feel the need to snoop on your partner\u2019s online behavior then there\u2019s a bigger conversation that you need to have about your lack of trust in the relationship, or your feelings of internal security in general,\u201d Mr. Gray said. If the need to follow your partner\u2019s every move is just too great, there is likely something else at work that, once resolved, will help more than giving in to the urge to snoop.You might consider simply not following each other on social media at all. I have two friends who are a couple. The guy\u2019s social media platform of choice is Twitter; his girlfriend prefers Instagram. They purposefully don\u2019t follow each other. They trust each other not to do anything inappropriate, and they like not feeling like they\u2019re \u201cchecking up\u201d on each other. It\u2019s a good reminder that your social media lives don\u2019t have to converge the same way your real lives do. A little distance is always healthy, in the real world and online.Even if you innocently stumble across suspicious-seeming activity, try to remember that tone and intent are much harder to gauge online.Most of us are quick to jump to conclusions with a limited amount of information. This is \u201cwhat I call storytelling syndrome: When you draw conclusions to decipher what\u2019s happening without first-hand knowledge,\u201d Ms. Edwards said. \u201cStorytelling syndrome usually escalates and before you know it, you\u2019re convinced they are cheating on you all because of a comment on someone\u2019s post.\u201dAsk your partner about their intent before making assumptions. For example: \u201cHey, I saw you\u2019re now friends on Facebook with that girl you told me you hooked up with before we met. How did that happen?\u201dEven with the best intentions, you and your partner are probably going to hurt each other with some of your online behaviors. It\u2019s best to address these episodes quickly and on a case-by-case basis. Address them directly before a pattern develops, or before bad feelings have a chance to fester.Mr. Gray suggested first taking the time to figure out why you\u2019re upset, rather than focusing on the behavior. What is the underlying issue? Our emotions can give us a lot of information if we let them.Then talk to your partner, focusing on the why, rather than the specific action. Let your partner know what the real issue is and what you need from them. For example, you might say, \u201cHey, I wanted to let you know that I feel uncomfortable seeing that you still have romantic pictures of you and your ex on your Facebook account. It made me worried that you\u2019re not fully over him. Do you think you could delete them?\u201dYes, it\u2019s frustrating to acknowledge the profound impact that social media can have on us and our relationships. But remember, even Snapchat can open up some meaningful conversations between partners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OpenTable Began a Revolution. Now It\u2019s a Power Under Siege.", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost 20 years ago, a new company came on the scene promising to revolutionize the tedious and often frustrating chore of securing a restaurant reservation.No more waiting on the phone and pleading with snooty receptionists. With just a few clicks of a mouse, a diner could secure a table at prime times in the hottest dining spots. Who you were or knew would no longer matter. Restaurants would benefit, too, handing off the job of juggling tables and recording reservations in a bulky book.The company was called OpenTable, and, since its genesis in 1998, it has come to dominate the field it created. Today, it says it seats more than 23 million diners a month in 43,000 restaurants across the globe.And for all the diners they do seat, neither OpenTable nor its competitors have yet loosened the telephone\u2019s grip on reservations, roughly two-thirds of which are still made by phone, according to Yelp, which once partnered with OpenTable and is now a rival.\u201cEveryone is fighting to win over the handful of top restaurants in each market \u2014 and then what?\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a former chief executive of OpenTable who is now a venture capitalist. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the endgame.\u201dConsumers continue to have fundamental gripes about these services: chiefly, that they offer few or no tables during the peak dining hours. They make it difficult to book tables for large or odd-numbered parties, which is why diners like Jeff Day, a marketing executive in Austin, Tex., keeps no reservation apps on his phone.\u201cMy default way to make reservations is still to call,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess because my desire to speak to a human transcends the need to just make a reservation.\u201dReserve has managed to attract those restaurants because, like many of other new reservation services, it is paying more attention to meeting their needs. After all, the restaurants are paying monthly fees for the service.But winning over restaurateurs, many of whom have accumulated a long list of gripes against what they perceive as cookie-cutter approach to their reservation woes, is still a challenge.\u201cThese kinds of technologies have been a boon for the diner,\u201d said David Barber, an owner of Blue Hill in New York City and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s delivered this great efficiency to the restaurant business is kind of a myth, especially for fine-dining restaurants.\u201dOpenTable is not just standing by as others invade its turf. While it has been slow to move in the past, last spring it upgraded its flagship GuestCenter package for restaurant managers, improving its ability to handle large parties and better juggle servers\u2019 shifts, among other things.Restaurateurs can now see what\u2019s happening with their reservations in real time and even on their Apple Watch. And OpenTable offers consumers points that can earn benefits like access to special wine tastings or menus at various OpenTable restaurants.\u201cCompetition for our business is not new,\u201d said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing. \u201cIt makes us faster and more innovative.\u201dLeslie Cafferty, a Priceline spokeswoman, said OpenTable is profitable and bigger than it was then. She said Priceline had bought the company based on a strategic plan that was in place at the time but has since changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some changes in leadership in OpenTable and in the Priceline Group,\u201d Ms. Cafferty said. \u201cWhen we got caught up and looked at where OpenTable was, it was basically different than when we bought it.\u201dHighly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.Resy, now used by roughly 1,000 restaurants in 80 cities across the country, has seated more than 25 million diners since its inception, and the number of meals served to those using its system quadrupled in the year that ended in May, Mr. Leventhal said.\u201cIn fine dining, you have the cost of business going up, the notion of fine dining evolving rapidly, a lot of restaurants being forced to rethink their formats and business models,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to make sure every table is working for you, and restaurants are finally embracing technology that can help them do that.\u201dMany restaurants that use Resy, for instance, require diners making a reservation to enter a credit-card number, in an effort to discourage no-shows and cancellations; about 1 percent require a down payment. Resy follows up to remind diners when a reservation they made is imminent.Users can also put themselves on a waiting list at some restaurants, which makes it much easier to ensure that all tables will be filled, since most cancellations happen within 24 hours before the reservation time. As a result, Resy says, it has brought no-shows down to under 4 percent on average; the usual rate is as much as 15 percent, the company said.Perhaps the company\u2019s biggest coup, though, was winning over Union Square Cafe when that perennially popular New York restaurant reopened in December. Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, was on the OpenTable board for almost two decades and one of its best ambassadors.In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Meyer was working to open his second restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, he tried starting a similar system himself. He didn\u2019t even think about using it to allow customers to make reservations online; rather, it was to be an answer to a perennial problem.\u201cI was tired of this recurring problem we had in the restaurant, where people would always be yelling up and down the stairs, saying, \u2018Who\u2019s got the reservation book?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cOne time a fraternity brother of mine pulled a prank and took the book out of the restaurant entirely \u2014 it was not a nice prank.\u201dSo when he opened Eleven Madison Park in 1998, OpenTable was taking the reservations. When Blue Smoke opened in 2002, the only way to make a reservation was via OpenTable; a phone line was discontinued. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAn online blog called Daily Candy announced that step and within hours, we had filled the entire restaurant for a month.\u201dBut OpenTable had its limitations. Until recently, for instance, it would not link the reservation systems at the Union Square group\u2019s restaurants. A free-spending diner who patronized Union Square Cafe for years could show up at Gramercy Tavern for the first time, and the host would not know him.Mr. Meyer said that, to some extent, OpenTable had been criticized unfairly. After all, it still seats far more diners in restaurants like his than any other service, and serves all the Union Square group restaurants except Union Square Cafe and the new Martina, which doesn\u2019t take reservations. Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthe latest round of assaults from start-ups looking to eat their lunch is more than they\u2019ve ever faced before.\u201dThe rivals have easily identified OpenTable\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: the fees it charges restaurants every time someone books a table using its system. For reservations made on OpenTable, the restaurant pays $1 for each diner. Even if reservations are made on the restaurant\u2019s website, OpenTable charges 25 cents a diner. And if they don\u2019t show up, the restaurant recoups none of those fees, several restaurateurs said. (OpenTable, however, says it charges fees only for guests who do show up.)That galled Anjan Mitra, proprietor of Dosa, a popular Indian restaurant with locations in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif. Many of his diners are repeat customers, he said, coming two or three times a month and using OpenTable to make reservations.\u201cI don\u2019t mind paying OpenTable for new customers, but OpenTable was charging me for customers I already had and knew well,\u201d Mr. Mitra said.He said he paid as much as $50,000 to OpenTable in fees on top of the $295 a month for use of its technology. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t know this,\u201d Mr. Mitra said. \u201cThey just love the convenience, and I understand that.\u201dYelp says more than 4,000 restaurants now use its service for reservations. The company doesn\u2019t need to attract marquee dining spots to entice users, who are already coming to it for reviews, giving it a major advantage.Yelp Reservations charges a restaurant $249 a month, and, in exchange, a reservations option is added to the top of its page on the Yelp app and website. \u201cMany people planning to make a reservation for dinner are already opening Yelp to figure out where they want to go, and now they can see whether there\u2019s a table waiting for them or not,\u201d said Vishwas Prabhakara, the general manager of Yelp Reservations.He said the flat-monthly-fee model used by most of the new reservation services helped discourage a restaurant practice that infuriates customers: holding back tables during prime hours. Some restaurants do that because they know they can fill the tables on their own at those times, and they like to seat valuable guests who show up at the last minute.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to hold tables back because you\u2019re not having to pay for each reservation,\u201d Mr. Prabhakara said.\u201cPeople in the restaurant business have moved from fear of change to a recognition that OpenTable was built in 1998,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really kept up innovation-wise, and part of that is because of the architecture of their technology.\u201dHe said that, until this summer, OpenTable gave restaurants only \u201cone blank box on the screen\u201d to enter a wide range of information on a diner \u2014 such as dietary restrictions, preferred nights of the week and wines ordered \u2014 instead of separate fields that made it easy to see if a customer, say, has lactose intolerance.\u201cNot to be creepy, but instantaneous and easy-to-read customer data is the best way we have to give the customer the best service,\u201d Mr. Kokonas said. \u201cIt lets us know that the last time you were here, you finished with a special spiced tea that you liked, and we can make that happen again and easily.\u201dMr. Jampol of OpenTable said that his company also compiles piles of similar data on customers that restaurants could use \u2014 but that they rarely want it. \u201cRestaurateurs have a lot of things to keep track of every day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as much as they say they want data, they\u2019re often too busy to dive into it.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Kokonas and others see an opportunity to do it better. Tock, which was co-founded by Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google engineer, spent roughly two years building its system, testing different components with restaurants and getting feedback. It is web-based rather than app-based, because that makes it easier for restaurants to log in and configure Tock to their needs.Other new reservation services are also looking to please restaurants. Reserve has adopted an \u201copen data model\u201d that allows its restaurants to see what diners are looking for, and, since it tweaked it service in May, it is adding more than 100 restaurants a month (for a total of 850), said Peter Esmond, its vice president for customer success.Say a potential customer is seeking a table for four at 7:30 p.m., and a restaurant is showing nothing available at that time. If it has a table available then that it has held back, it can quickly add it to its Reserve page in an effort to attract the booking.Thus, more control over how reservations are made is put in the hands of restaurants, rather than the reservation app.At Blue Hill, Reserve worked with Mr. Barber to tailor its product to his needs. And that, Mr. Barber said, is why a monolithic reservation titan like OpenTable may be a thing of the past.\u201cTrying to build ubiquitous software that will meet all the needs of high-, middle- and low-priced restaurants and make consumers happy, that\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a baseline product that comes close to what OpenTable does and then allows some customization, that\u2019s what the restaurant business wants \u2014 and then customers will really start to see the benefit of these things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Explosion at Minneapolis School Kills 2 Staff Members", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe receptionist and a janitor at a Minneapolis school were killed on Wednesday in an explosion that collapsed walls, buckled floors, ignited fires and knocked people off their feet outside, the authorities said.The blast happened about 10:30 a.m. after a construction crew at the school, Minnehaha Academy, frantically warned of a gas leak. The explosion tore through the center section of the Upper School.Emergency responders and school employees fought flames and climbed through debris to pull people to safety, witnesses said. By midmorning, at least eight people had been rescued, but the receptionist, Ruth Berg, and a part-time janitor, John Carlson, were reported missing.Ms. Berg\u2019s body was found about 2 p.m. as Minneapolis Fire Department crews used heavy equipment to remove chunks of the collapsed building. Mr. Carlson\u2019s body was found about six hours later.They were found in the rubble near an exterior door, Chief John Fruetel of the Minneapolis Fire Department said. He said that emergency responders held out hope until the end that the two victims had found a safe spot inside the debris.\u201cWe were hoping there might be a void space,\u201d Chief Fruetel said at a news conference on Wednesday night.One witness, Jack Mahler, said he was practicing soccer across the street when he saw two men trying to get people\u2019s attention inside the school. One man, he said, opened a door and yelled, \u201cGas! Get out!\u201dMr. Mahler said he saw neighbors run to the collapsed building to help. Officer Dean Milner of the Minneapolis Police Department said he and other officers battled five-foot flames to rescue people.The explosion occurred several weeks before the start of the school year, when the building would have been packed with students and teachers. Minnehaha, a private Christian school that opened in 1913, enrolls about 825 students. The campus has two buildings for students in prekindergarten through the 12th grade.On Wednesday, only some staff members and a few students were there for summer instruction.Ms. Berg started working at Minnehaha 17 years ago, and Mr. Carlson, who graduated from the school in 1953, returned to work part time after his retirement, the school said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Boring Little Budget Office That Trump Hates", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Congressional Budget Office never exuded sex appeal, at least not until recently. Its bland office building, which sits unobtrusively by a freeway in southwest Washington, houses an often-overlooked assemblage of wonkish economists whose idea of professional happiness is producing 10-year fiscal forecasts.Nevertheless, it\u2019s an agency of indispensable importance that is now coming under attack not only from Critic-in-Chief Donald Trump but from a broad array of Republican leaders, including even Speaker Paul Ryan.If, as Oscar Wilde said, that you can judge a man \u2014 or in this case an institution \u2014 by the quality of its enemies, then the C.B.O. has chosen very well.The current Republican beef with the C.B.O. is that it has repeatedly (and undoubtedly correctly) concluded that conservative proposals to gut the Affordable Care Act would cost tens of millions of Americans their health insurance.Amazingly, in July, the White House even put out a 45 second video contending that \u201cthe Congressional Budget Office\u2019s math does not add up.\u201d A few days later, two senior Trump aides labeled the C.B.O.\u2019s health care scoring \u201cfake news\u201d in a Washington Post Op-Ed. In 40 years of observing the budgeting process, I can\u2019t recall anything remotely like this criticism of the C.B.O.Developing long-term projections \u2014 particularly for complex policies like health care \u2014 is exceptionally difficult. And by no means do C.B.O. analyses invariably prove correct.But passing sweeping legislation without input from the budget office would be like planning a picnic without checking the weather forecast. Meteorologists are not always right either but imagine what life (and businesses such as agriculture) would be like without them.Health insurance changes may now be on hold for the moment, but other critical policy issues \u2014 notably, tax reform and next year\u2019s spending \u2014 are moving to the front burner.The C.B.O. was established in 1974 to do precisely what Republicans now don\u2019t want it to do: serve as an independent counterpoint to the Office of Management and Budget. As a creature of the executive branch, the O.M.B. is often, and appropriately, criticized for lacking that nonpartisan viewpoint.Keith Hall, the current director of the C.B.O., was selected two years ago by the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill \u2014 some of the same individuals who are now attacking the agency\u2019s credibility.\u201cAt some point, you\u2019ve got to ask yourself, has the day of the C.B.O. come and gone?\u201d O.M.B. director Mick Mulvaney \u2014 himself a former House member \u2014 asked in May.More recently, a group of conservative House Republicans proposed slashing the C.B.O.\u2019s budget and cutting its staff of 235 by 89 employees.In a burst of bipartisanship unusual in today\u2019s Washington, all eight of the previous directors sent a letter in late July to congressional leaders expressing their \u201cstrong objection to recent attacks on the integrity and professionalism of the agency.\u201dMore support has come from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, with which I\u2019m affiliated. \u201cYou don\u2019t beat up the referee just because you don\u2019t like the score,\u201d President Maya MacGuineas said in a statement.Their pushback rests on strong footing: The C.B.O.\u2019s analysis of the impact of Obamacare were closer to the mark than those of most other forecasters.For example, back in 2010, the agency projected that the number of people without insurance would drop to 30 million in 2016. The actual figure in that year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was 28.6 million (a drop of 20 million from 2010).Yes, the C.B.O. initially overestimated marketplace enrollment and underestimated Medicaid enrollment. But it was closer on the top line estimate than forecasts from many other organizations, according to a 2015 study by the Commonwealth Fund.Healthcare is not by any means the only policy area where the Trump White House has tried to fudge the numbers to a degree not seen in many decades.The administration\u2019s first full budget proposal, issued on May 23, included a number of absurd assumptions, particularly about the pace of economic growth and the impact of the president\u2019s still-vague tax plans.Happily, the C.B.O. weighed in and concluded that instead of a small surplus in 2027, the O.M.B. proposal would instead result in a $720 billion deficit.In particular, the budget office focused on the administration\u2019s wildly optimistic assumption that the economy would grow at a 3 percent annual rate over the next decade. Instead, the agency agreed with most private forecasters that 1.9 percent was a more realistic assumption.That conclusion will put much needed pressure on the White House to propose a more responsible tax package, and on Congress to act judiciously.As we face an era of widening budget deficits and the increased fiscal burden of an aging society, having the independent voice of the Congressional Budget Office is more important than ever.The only way to deal with bullies like Mr. Trump and his lackeys is to stand up to them. Capitol Hill legislators \u2014 who have mostly been curiously silent \u2014 need to come to the defense of an agency essential to the policy process.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cider Moves Beyond the Apple", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Reynolds\u2019s first love is perry, the traditional name for pear cider, and that\u2019s what he began with that day \u2014 a hazy, unfiltered 2014 vintage that showed a surprising balance of piercing acidity and creaminess, along with winelike tannins. \u201cFor me, perry is always a more complex drink than apple cider,\u201d he said.But Mr. Reynolds, who previously worked nearby in the horticulture department of Cornell University as a plant-breeding specialist, didn\u2019t stop at pear cider. Over the course of an afternoon here on his farm in the Finger Lakes region, he poured crazy, often-transcendent ciders that blend apples with fruits like chokeberries or sea-buckthorn fruit or local riesling grapes.He normally makes a cider with black currants, but he lost most of his crop last year. \u201cI\u2019m a fruit grower first and cider maker second,\u201d he said. In the future, he\u2019ll make a quince cider from trees he planted a few years ago. \u201cAnd medlar fruit is definitely something I\u2019m tempted to plant.\u201dFor ages, farmers have been fermenting all types of surplus fruit. But never before have hard-cider enthusiasts found so many nonapple variations on store shelves and bar menus.\u201cSome people see adding anything besides apples as blasphemy,\u201d Mr. Reynolds said. \u201cThen there\u2019s wild experimentation. I guess I see myself as somewhere in the middle.\u201d\u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he added. \u201cBut the question always will be, \u2018When is it not cider anymore?\u2019\u201dThat\u2019s a question being asked all over, as cider\u2019s popularity explodes in the United States, and producers large and small stray ever further from classic apple cider.That\u2019s one reason so many flavors are being added to basic apple cider. Art & Science, for instance, is allowed to label its apple-and-quince blend as cider, but it must call its all-quince cider fruit wine. \u201cThe laws and regulations have not caught up with cider making,\u201d said Kim Hamblin, who with her husband, Dan Rinke, owns Art & Science. \u201cIt really confuses the consumer.\u201dFinger Lakes Cider House, which Ms. Madden owns with her husband, Garrett Miller, has become a hub of New York\u2019s growing craft cider movement. It pours ciders from five acclaimed producers, including its own Good Life Cider.\u201cWe\u2019re proud apple growers and cider makers, just like winemakers who are growers of wine grapes,\u201d Ms. Madden said.Having said that, she sheepishly poured a glass of Nor\u2019easter, a Good Life cider flavored with cranberries. \u201cThis is where we go down a slippery slope,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cBut we do have a friend on Cape Cod who has a cranberry bog. And we home-juice the cranberries. I guess the question for us is: Who\u2019s growing the fruit?\u201dThe identification with winemaking is important for many craft cider producers, including Andy Brennan at Aaron Burr Cidery.\u201cFlavoring ciders or creating these \u2018recipe ciders\u2019 is similar to beer making, where it becomes about the prowess of the brewer, or the cider maker,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cWith wine, there is still a model for remaining faithful to quality farming practices.\u201dMr. Brennan is an outspoken critic of flavored ciders and what he calls \u201cthe ease with which cider can be manipulated.\u201d Still, asked about his best-selling ginger-carrot-apple cider, he replied: \u201cI stopped making that two years ago out of concern for how cider was portrayed. Admittedly, that\u2019s a dumb reason.\u201d\u201cOur consumers have no preconceived notion of cider,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have set opinions yet. They\u2019re open to whatever.\u201d But, he added: \u201cI don\u2019t carry things that are flavored for the sake of flavor, or are synthetically flavored. We won\u2019t have a mango-haba\u00f1ero cider.\u201dBut for enthusiasts, there is a key difference between what many companies call pear cider and authentic perry, which must be made from inedible, tannic, bitter varieties. \u201cPerry pears differ from eating pears in the same way cider apples differ from eating apples,\u201d said Tom Oliver, the cider maker at Oliver\u2019s.Mr. Pucci says producers have only scratched the surface of pear\u2019s potential. \u201cThere\u2019s so much apple research,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019re so much further behind with pears.\u201d\u201cCider is in a dynamic place right now,\u201d he added. \u201cBut cider\u2019s big challenge moving forward is all about identity. For example, we\u2019re not sure if we want to be like beer or wine.\u201dHere are some unconventional ciders to try. All bottles are 750 milliliters unless noted.Cider\u2019s wild edge, with flavors and aromas that suggest mythic, old-time fruit.Pure, fresh pear flavor; almost like fine wine in its balance of tannins and acidity.Crisp, subtle, elegant and low in alcohol, from a renowned Norman cidermaker. (B. United, Oxford, Conn.)A good nonapple offering from a larger producer. Winelike acidity balances the fruity plum.Rich, with notes of baking spice and baked pear. Classic British perry. (Shelton Brothers, Belchertown, Mass.)Bright, fresh like a spring rhubarb pie, with a dry, winelike finish.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated Dan Pucci\u2019s current occupation. He is a beverage consultant, and no longer the cider director at Wassail.Advertisement"}

Mileto, a 16-year-old football player from Farmingville, N.Y., was performing the training exercise at Sachem East High School with four other students. The boys were hoisting the log above their heads on Thursday morning when it fell and struck Joshua, the Suffolk County Police Department said. He was pronounced dead at Stony Brook University Hospital.\u201cWe are absolutely beyond devastated,\u201d Joshua\u2019s mother, Sayyida Mileto, wrote on Facebook. \u201cWe are in no way able to respond or speak to anyone at this point.\u201dGreg Fernandez, who lives in nearby Holtsville, N.Y., said his 17-year-old stepson, who was good friends with Joshua, \u201csaw pretty much everything\u201d that day.\u201cHe has not been able to speak entire sentences without breaking down,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said in a phone interview.Three of the boys were on one side of the log, Mr. Fernandez said, and Joshua was on the other side with one other boy.\u201cWhen I heard about what they\u2019re doing, I thought, \u2018Whoa. What are they doing? Why are they doing that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Fernandez said.He added, \u201cThese are kids \u2014 they aren\u2019t really developed yet.\u201dHis stepson has also carried the log. \u201cHe told me it\u2019s really heavy,\u201d Mr. Fernandez said.It\u2019s \u201cone of the toughest physical evolutions that anyone has to go through,\u201d the director of fitness at the Naval Special Warfare Center says in a 2013 YouTube video. Each log is approximately 180-210 pounds, he says, and is carried by \u201cboat crews of six or seven men\u201d for \u201cclose to two hours, almost nonstop.\u201dIt\u2019s not a common activity, however, for high school athletes.Valerie Malfa, 16, a cheerleader at Sachem East, will be participating in a carwash on Sunday at the Applebee\u2019s in Farmingville, N.Y. Proceeds will go to the Miletos.\u201cHe was such a sweet person and I never heard anyone speak a bad word about him,\u201d Valerie said, describing Joshua, a defensive back and wide receiver, as a \u201creally talented\u201d football player. \u201cEvery time I would talk to him, he was always so kind.\u201dMr. Fernandez said Joshua was a \u201cgreat kid\u201d and a \u201creally funny guy,\u201d recounting how Joshua and his stepson had been inseparable for the last two years, even dyeing their hair the same color.Mr. Fernandez said he was not aware that the training camp was using heavy logs during the workouts. \u201cI just thought they were doing the typical football crackbacks,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ve coached and everyone\u2019s always trying to get an edge,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re always looking for training techniques. But you also have to remember these are not professionals. These are kids.\u201dTyler Simpson, 23, who grew up on Long Island and played football throughout much of his youth, said he had never been asked to carry a log at Center Moriches High School, in the town of Brookhaven, despite having a coach who had been in the military.He did carry logs, however, during Marine Corps training in Quantico, Va., while simultaneously running short distances and doing shoulder presses along with a team of eight other men.\u201cIt was exhausting,\u201d said Mr. Simpson, who spent five years in the Marines and is now in the Reserves. \u201cSome of these kids aren\u2019t going to be able to hold the end of a 400-pound log.\u201dA spokeswoman for the school district deferred questions about the episode to the Sachem East Football Touchdown Club, which organized the training camp.Kenneth E.

Because of American sanctions against the country, the company\u2019s iPhones are not legally available for sale here, and Apple does not offer a version of its App Store in the country.That has not stopped Iranians from snapping up millions of iPhones smuggled in from places like Dubai and Hong Kong. Nor has it kept Iranian app developers from creating thousands of apps for local users and offering them through App Stores outside Iran.In a message to Iranian developers whose apps were affected by the ban, Apple said, \u201cUnder the U.S. sanctions regulations, the App Store cannot host, distribute or do business with apps or developers connected to certain U.S. embargoed countries.\u201dAn Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, confirmed the message\u2019s authenticity.

Imagine if in the U.S. you wouldn\u2019t be able to get Uber on your phone.\u201dIn addition to blocking Twitter, the Iranian government has long blocked Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube service.When it comes to technology, American sanctions against Iran over its nuclear weapons program are complicated. The Obama administration eased restrictions on American tech companies that offered internet services in Iran as a way of encouraging a free flow of information, especially among younger Iranians.The Trump administration has modified the overall sanctions, and President Trump signed a new sanctions bill into law this month. It is unclear whether the administration meant to impose new restrictions on technology companies.European countries lifted all sanctions against Iran after the 2016 nuclear agreement was reached.\u201cThe full removal of Iranian apps by Apple means our work will be much more complicated,\u201d said Mr. Taghizadeh.

There are plenty of places you can stream the eclipse online if you\u2019re in no position to see it with your own eyes \u2014 and you might even get a better view.The first thing you\u2019ll need to know is when you should pay attention to the events happening in the sky. This chart from NASA runs down when the eclipse begins and ends, along with when totality (those precious minutes where the moon completely covers the sun, and day turns into night) begins and ends, for each time zone in the United States. This way you\u2019ll know exactly when to pop outdoors or go up to the roof to catch the event.For example, if you\u2019re on the West Coast of the United States, you might want to grab your eclipse glasses or goggles and head outside just after 9 a.m. Pacific, but definitely make sure you don\u2019t miss totality around 10:19 a.m. if you live far enough north to see it. Those of us on the East Coast, however, should make sure to head outside just after 1 p.m. Eastern and pay close attention around 2:30 p.m.If you\u2019re stuck indoors, the weather is absolutely terrible, or you live where you won\u2019t get to see even a partial eclipse, you can enjoy the action virtually instead.This way even if you miss totality in one location, you can see it in another, and experience the eclipse over and over as it travels across the continental United States.________Advertisement"}

So much for his \u201cfood aggression\u201d and the test that nearly led to his being killed by the county shelter.Your story brought me to tears because we adopted a pit/boxer mix (Glenda) through a rescue group that looks just like Elsey, scars and all. She is a gentle, loving, obedient girl with humans (of any age), but aggressive with dogs.Glenda would have passed the human test and shown the same hackles-up, fighting stance behavior with dogs. We know how to handle her and we avoid other dogs. Elsey should not have been euthanized. Someone could have given her a home.My own rescue dog Archer was one of these. He was rescued as a newborn puppy by a local rescue organization and well cared for until he was adopted by us. He was sweet and loving, but it was evident even then that he had severe anxiety.Over the next year, his anxiety increased and he became aggressive toward anything or anyone that frightened him. It got so bad that every time we went out in public we had to keep him in a muzzle. Anxiety medication and months of training did not help.Still, we were never willing to give up until he bit me on the face unprovoked. I bent down to pet him and when I stood up he lunged and got my lip.It was only then, and after much consultation with our trainer and vets, that we made the decision to euthanize. He was only 2 years old. It was the worst day of my life. While I know we made the right decision, I only wish there were more ways to help Archer and other dogs like him. We wouldn\u2019t euthanize a mentally ill person, but we do it to dogs all the time.We had a dog from the Humane Society. He was so sweet. Never showed any signs of aggression except once: I tried to pick a few pieces of kibble from his bowl. He didn\u2019t bite me, but it was the only time he ever snapped at anyone.I have a kind and generous sister, but if you tried to take a French fry from her plate she might stab you with a fork. I don\u2019t think this test is fair.I have fostered more than 130 dogs in my home (one at a time) over the last eight years, mostly Labrador retrievers. I have had to evaluate many at shelters. Yes, the shelter is a stressful, chaotic environment, but I do believe in attempting as much evaluation as possible at the shelter.Rescue groups must evaluate dogs as thoroughly as possible and have the backbone to turn down dogs that show signs of aggression. For starters, no dog with bite history should ever be taken into rescue. And when mistakes are made, rescues also must have the courage to euthanize dogs that are unsafe \u2014 or take them off the adoptable list for good.I understand why shelters have to euthanize animals, but the behavior tests are very, very flawed. I adopted a cat last year, and his behavioral assessment of \u201ctense, nervous, hisses when approached\u201d landed him on the kill list. I pulled him out of the shelter the night before he was due to be euthanized.Clearly the nervousness was due to his confusion at suddenly being in the shelter with other frightened, and sometimes sick, cats. One year on \u2014 you could not ask for a sweeter kitty (though he is still a bit shy!).I was on the board of a small animal shelter for a number of years.The shelter that I served had one incident in which a large dog pinned a woman to the couch in an act of vicious aggression that was not anticipated by the shelter. In response, the shelter determined that it had to take reasonable effort to screen for aggression. We were a \u201cno kill\u201d shelter, but dogs and cats determined to be aggressive were regretfully put down. Those who opposed any euthanasia were unable to offer alternative solutions for animals identified as aggressive.The testing was imprecise and the staff was not perfectly skilled. Undoubtedly, some dogs and cats were put down unnecessarily. But the shelter could hardly afford its liability insurance. Risk management was an essential part of legal claim reduction.The regretful truth is that the survival of the shelter is more important than the survival of any individual dog. As a lover of rescue dogs, I say this with sadness.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Cool Solution for Hot Summer Nights", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCity Kitchen6 PhotosFor some, a cold supper\u2019s main virtue is expedience \u2014 a less-than-exciting but convenient way to get food on the table with no cooking required.My friend from upstate New York, however, has fond memories of summer evenings and cold suppers eaten on the screened-in porch. His family\u2019s small farm supplied everything but the cold cuts, which were picked up in town. Potato salad, macaroni salad and deviled eggs were always served, along with sliced tomatoes from the garden, a green salad and homemade pickles. A tall, frosty Tom Collins was the beverage offered to grown-ups. The kids drank lemonade.But even this sort of idyllic farm supper requires some cooking. Water must be boiled, at the very least. No, you don\u2019t want the oven on all day, but plan to make some use of your stovetop and grill if you want a good summer meal.The urge to boycott the kitchen entirely during the summer months is understandable, especially for city dwellers enduring heat waves. The irony is that high summer is when ingredients are at their best. If ever there was a moment to have a meal straight from the farm or garden, that time is now.When I returned from the farmers\u2019 market the other day, my bags were filled with glistening eggplants, truly ripe tomatoes, tender young green beans, just-picked okra and colorful summer squash. I was determined to make them all into five simple salads and to serve them later in the day at room temperature. That\u2019s my kind of cold supper.Working somewhat in advance is the trick to hot-weather cooking. Grab an hour in the early morning or midafternoon to get a little vegetable prep done or make a vinaigrette. But be sure to leave herb-chopping for the last minute \u2014 your herbs will taste and look brighter.Freshly picked green beans are a true summer treat. Whatever the color \u2014 green, purple or pale yellow \u2014 choose smaller beans, which are naturally more tender. (Midsize Blue Lake beans or tender Romano beans are other options.) I pair mine with a mustardy vinaigrette, toss them with green olives, then shower them with snipped dill and chives.A great tomato salad starts with sweet, ripe tomatoes. Good news: They are here. I chose a mix of midsize heirlooms in assorted colors, from green to red to burgundy to golden. Dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar, with a touch of garlic, this salad is draped with anchovy fillets, the perfect counterpoint to the tomatoes\u2019 sweetness. I toss the salad with large handful of fragrant basil leaves just before serving.I\u2019m an okra fan, whether it is fried, pickled or simmered in gumbo. Another way to love okra is barely cooked. For this salad, the okra boils for only two minutes in salted water, which gives it a texture reminiscent of asparagus. Seasoned with a warm and earthy Moroccan spice blend, it pleases even avowed okra-phobes.The happy mix of eggplant, peppers and onions is found throughout the Mediterranean. Ideally the vegetables are cooked over hot coals, which adds a welcome smokiness, but I charred mine on a stovetop grill for a similar effect. Then I chopped them together in roughs chunk and added olive oil, lemon, capers and oregano \u2014 simple but glorious when made with super-fresh ingredients.A salad of julienned raw zucchini dressed in yogurt, with a generous amount of lemon juice and zest, is extremely refreshing. My favorite herb vendor at the market had chervil, mint and a type of sorrel with tiny leaves, all of which enhanced the lemony essence. Sometimes I add a pinch of powdered sumac, too.Lined up on the table, these salads made an impressive buffet. But you can also use this little collection for five nights of summer dining, with a different salad each night. Since none of the vegetables were ever refrigerated, they had that straight-from-the-garden sweetness. It made this city boy think about moving upstate.cookingcookingcookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Maria Sharapova Granted Wild Card Into U.S. Open Field", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMASON, Ohio \u2014 The United States Tennis Association has awarded Maria Sharapova a wild card to enter the main draw of this year\u2019s United States Open, which will be her first Grand Slam tournament since serving a 15-month suspension for doping.Because she returned to the tour this year without a ranking, and has only been able to raise her ranking to 148th because of injury struggles, she has been at the mercy of tournaments to award her wild cards in order to play. U.S.T.A. officials said her status as a past champion \u2014 Sharapova won the U.S. Open in 2006 \u2014 helped make her case to play this year.\u201cHer suspension under the terms of the tennis anti-doping program was completed and therefore was not one of the factors weighed in our wild card selection process,\u201d the U.S.T.A. said in a statement. \u201cConsistent with past practice, a wild card was provided to a past U.S. Champion who needed the wild card for entry into the main draw.\u201dThe U.S.T.A. cited previous champions who had received main-draw wild cards at the tournament when they would not have qualified otherwise, including Martina Hingis, Lleyton Hewitt, Kim Clijsters and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, the last of whom received one last year.\u201cAdditionally, Sharapova has volunteered to speak to young tennis players at the U.S.T.A. National Campus about the importance of the tennis anti-doping program and the personal responsibility each player has to comply with the program\u2019s requirements,\u201d the U.S.T.A. added.Sharapova has played the Open only once since 2012, having missed the 2013 and 2015 tournaments with injuries, and last year\u2019s event because of her suspension.Sharapova thanked the U.S.T.A. on Twitter, adding, \u201cThis is so so special.\u201dThe U.S. Open wild card is the 10th Sharapova has been awarded this year. She earlier received them to gain entry into the first four tournaments she played this year (in Stuttgart, Madrid, Rome and Stanford, Calif.). She also got wild cards into several tournaments she was forced to miss because of injury (Birmingham, England; Toronto and Cincinnati) and for two events she plans to play in China this fall.\u201cThere can be a wild card for return from injuries,\u201d Giudicelli said. \u201cThere cannot be a wild card for return from doping.\u201dThat decision was criticized by Steve Simon, the chief executive of the Women\u2019s Tennis Association, who said he believed the decision was extrajudicial since it came after the end of the lengthy ban Sharapova had served. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done, in essence, is increase her penalty,\u201d Simon said.That injury also forced her out of the Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto as well as this week\u2019s Western and Southern Open near Cincinnati. Sharapova traveled to Ohio but did not practice, and ultimately she pulled out citing her arm injury \u201cas a precaution for the U.S. Open.\u201dUnlike the French Open, for which her ranking was insufficient to gain entry, Sharapova would have been eligible to compete in the qualifying draw of the U.S. Open had organizers declined to give her a wild card into the main field.Early in Sharapova\u2019s return, the topic of her wild cards was a divisive issue among players. But questions about her participation in tournaments have more recently been met with fatigue.\u201cI\u2019m sure that this is a great moment for her to have an opportunity to be back to where she has done so well,\u201d Venus Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily have any thoughts. I\u2019m pretty focused on my own life these days.\u201dThe U.S.T.A. has less discretion with its wild cards than other Grand Slam federations. Five of the eight available are predetermined: two go to Tennis Australia and the French Tennis Federation in a reciprocal swap; another is allotted for the N.C.A.A. singles champion if it is an American; a fourth goes to the winner of the 18-and-under junior national championship; and the fifth goes to the player who has accumulated the most ranking points in a set of tournaments over the summer, called the U.S. Open Wild Card Challenge.The Australian federation has not yet nominated its wild card choice, but the other four were given to Amandine Hesse, Brienne Minor, Ashley Kratzer and Sofia Kenin.And in addition to Sharapova\u2019s, the other two discretionary women\u2019s wild cards were awarded to the Americans Kayla Day and Taylor Townsend.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Messy, Confusing Future of TV? It\u2019s Here", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf you\u2019re like me and the millions of other Americans who have canceled a cable television subscription over the past few years, you\u2019re probably familiar with the phenomenon I\u2019ve started calling \u201cthe hunt.\u201dIt goes like this: First, you decide to watch one of your favorite shows \u2014 HGTV\u2019s \u201cFixer Upper,\u201d in my case. You plop down on your couch, turn on your TV and boot up your streaming device. Then you shuffle from app to app, trying to remember which of your half-dozen streaming services has the program. Was it Netflix? Hmm, no. HBO Go? Nope. Hulu Plus? It has the first three seasons, which you\u2019ve already seen, but not the fourth.You finally find the fourth season on Amazon, but it\u2019s not included free with Prime Video. It costs $2.99 per episode. The hunt ends with a whimper: You sigh, suck it up (those kitchens aren\u2019t going to renovate themselves), and fork over $19.99 for the entire season.What happened to the glorious, consumer-friendly future of TV? We were told that the internet would usher in a golden era of streaming video, and that incredible shows and movies would be a click away through low-cost, easy-to-use services. The $100-a-month Time Warner cable packages that required navigating a byzantine menu of third-rate channels would be a distant nightmare.Instead, we\u2019ve rushed headlong into a hyper-fragmented mess, with a jumble of on-demand services that, added up, cost more and often offer less than the old cable bundle. There are lots of great shows and movies being made, but finding them has become harder than ever.I felt another twinge of cable nostalgia last week, when both Disney and Facebook \u2014 very different companies, but united in their desire for your attention \u2014 announced big steps in their next-generation video strategies.A day later, Facebook announced Watch, a tab inside the main Facebook app that will soon host a slate of professionally produced video series. The company says people will be able to enjoy premium fare like \u201cReturning the Favor,\u201d starring the \u201cDirty Jobs\u201d host Mike Rowe; a reality show about tiny houses; and \u201cBae or Bail,\u201d which Facebook describes thusly: \u201cUnsuspecting couples put their relationship and wits to the test as they\u2019re thrown into terrifying scenarios.\u201dDisney, which has built an enormously profitable business that includes movie ticket sales and cable revenue from ESPN, is betting that a significant number of customers will pay $10 or $20 a month to watch \u201cFrozen\u201d and keep up with their NBA teams, above and beyond what they\u2019re already shelling out for Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime subscriptions.On the other hand, Facebook \u2014 which makes its money from advertising \u2014 is giving its shows away free. Their theory is that the more time Facebook users spend watching video, the more ads they\u2019ll see. Facebook doesn\u2019t have a huge library of popular content like Disney, but it does have a treasure trove of data about the personal tastes and preferences of its more than two billion registered users, and presumably plans to use that data to target ads at exactly the people companies want to reach.More than $70 billion per year is spent on traditional television advertisements, and as that pile of money shifts to digital video, Facebook presumably wants to make sure a hefty chunk ends up in its own pockets. It also very likely wants to replace YouTube as the home for amateur creators who might not produce professional-quality shows, but still have large and loyal audiences.On the surface, these seem like very different strategies \u2014 selling premium video to an existing audience of fans, versus giving away premium video in an effort to sell hyper-targeted ads and attract a network of amateurs. But they\u2019re both part of the same seismic change. As the decline of traditional TV creates a gold rush for ad dollars and consumer attention, every tech and media company seems to be heading to the mine, pickax in hand.Consumers, meanwhile, are forced to contend with (and often pay for) an ever-expanding group of services. There are already Netflix and Hulu, single-company services like CBS All Access, and \u201cskinny bundles\u201d such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV, not to mention the endless amateur video available from Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\u201cOne of the barriers to entry for the consumer right now is simply confusion,\u201d said Paul Verna, the principal video analyst at eMarketer, a media research firm. \u201cThe more of these services that are out there, the harder it\u2019s going to get for people to make rational, informed decisions about what to subscribe to.\u201dNumbers like these have created an industrywide panic and set off dozens of efforts to replace the revenue seeping out of the old cable model. Disney\u2019s streaming service won\u2019t be the last of its kind; pretty soon, you\u2019ll be forced to choose from an overwhelming menu of streaming apps and services, each of which will have its own price tag, interface and ever-changing libraries of shows and movies.An enterprising entrepreneur might someday be tempted to package some of these new services and sell them for a single price, essentially remaking the old cable bundle for the internet. But industry experts say that such cooperation between the industry\u2019s giants is unlikely, given the enormous sums at stake.\u201cThere\u2019s no chance of that happening,\u201d said Dan Rayburn, who analyzes streaming media for Frost & Sullivan. \u201cCompanies will do what\u2019s best for their bottom line.\u201dThe post-TV world \u201cwill not be orderly or neat,\u201d said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, a marketing technology company. \u201cNo one is sitting back and saying, \u2018What\u2019s the perfect way the consumer wants to come at this?\u2019 Everyone is arming up.\u201dIn other words, the hunt will only get harder.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How A.I. Is Creating Building Blocks to Reshape Music and Art", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 In the mid-1990s, Douglas Eck worked as a database programmer in Albuquerque while moonlighting as a musician. After a day spent writing computer code inside a lab run by the Department of Energy, he would take the stage at a local juke joint, playing what he calls \u201cpunk-influenced bluegrass\u201d \u2014 \u201cJohnny Rotten crossed with Johnny Cash.\u201d But what he really wanted to do was combine his days and nights, and build machines that could make their own songs. \u201cMy only goal in life was to mix A.I. and music,\u201d Mr. Eck said.\u201cIt\u2019s about creating new ways for people to communicate,\u201d he said during a recent interview inside the small two-story building here that serves as headquarters for Google A.I. research.The project is part of a growing effort to generate art through a set of A.I. techniques that have only recently come of age. Called deep neural networks, these complex mathematical systems allow machines to learn specific behavior by analyzing vast amounts of data. By looking for common patterns in millions of bicycle photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a bike. This is how Facebook identifies faces in online photos, how Android phones recognize commands spoken into phones, and how Microsoft Skype translates one language into another. But these complex systems can also create art. By analyzing a set of songs, for instance, they can learn to build similar sounds.As Mr. Eck says, these systems are at least approaching the point \u2014 still many, many years away \u2014 when a machine can instantly build a new Beatles song or perhaps trillions of new Beatles songs, each sounding a lot like the music the Beatles themselves recorded, but also a little different. But that end game \u2014 as much a way of undermining art as creating it \u2014 is not what he is after. There are so many other paths to explore beyond mere mimicry. The ultimate idea is not to replace artists but to give them tools that allow them to create in entirely new ways.Much as a neural network can learn to identify a cat by analyzing hundreds of cat photos, it can learn the musical characteristics of a bassoon by analyzing hundreds of notes. It creates a mathematical representation, or vector, that identifies a bassoon. So, Mr. Eck and his team have fed notes from hundreds of instruments into a neural network, building a vector for each one. Now, simply by moving a button across a screen, they can combine these vectors to create new instruments. One may be 47 percent bassoon and 53 percent clavichord. Another might switch the percentages. And so on.For centuries, orchestral conductors have layered sounds from various instruments atop one other. But this is different. Rather than layering sounds, Mr. Eck and his team are combining them to form something that didn\u2019t exist before, creating new ways that artists can work. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next film camera,\u201d Mr. Eck said. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next electric guitar.\u201dThe tools are new, but the attitude is not. Allison Parrish, a New York University professor who builds software that generates poetry, points out that artists have been using computers to generate art since the 1950s. \u201cMuch like as Jackson Pollock figured out a new way to paint by just opening the paint can and splashing it on the canvas beneath him,\u201d she said, \u201cthese new computational techniques create a broader palette for artists.\u201dA year ago, David Ha was a trader with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. During his lunch breaks he started toying with neural networks and posting the results to a blog under a pseudonym. Among other things, he built a neural network that learned to write its own Kanji, the logographic Chinese characters that are not so much written as drawn.Then, you ask them to, say, draw a pig with a cat\u2019s head, or to visually subtract a foot from a horse or sketch a truck that looks like a dog or build a boat from a few random squiggly lines. Next to NSynth or DeepDream, these may seem less like tools that artists will use to build new works. But if you play with them, you realize that they are themselves art, living works built by Mr. Ha. A.I. isn\u2019t just creating new kinds of art; it\u2019s creating new kinds of artists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Smartphone\u2019s Future: It\u2019s All About the Camera", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We all know the drill. For the last decade, smartphones have gotten thinner and faster and thinner and faster and, well, you get the picture.But it\u2019s too soon to write off our smartphones as boring. The gadgets are still evolving with new technologies. And for a clue as to what the smartphone of the future might look like, turn your attention to the device\u2019s cameras and the software and sensors that make them tick.Here\u2019s a peek into how the camera may come into play: As soon as you pick up your gadget, it will see you and know you are the owner and unlock the screen. Overseas, you will be able to point the camera at a restaurant menu to translate items into your native language. When shopping for furniture, you can point your phone camera at your living room floor and place a virtual rendering of a coffee table down to see how it looks and move around and peek underneath it.Some of this futurism is already starting to happen.\u201c2018 will be the year where the smartphone camera takes a quantum leap in technology,\u201d said Philip-James Jacobowitz, a product manager for Qualcomm, a chip maker that provides components to smartphone makers.Mr. Jacobowitz added that emerging camera technologies would be the key to stronger security features and applications for so-called augmented reality, which uses data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.Here\u2019s a rundown on what this all means for how your next smartphone will work.For the last few years, we have become accustomed to unlocking our smartphones by scanning our fingerprints or entering a passcode. But when Apple shows its new iPhones next month, including a premium model with a starting price of $999, the company will introduce infrared facial recognition as a new method for unlocking the device.How would the new iPhone do that exactly? Apple declined to comment. But Qualcomm\u2019s Spectra, a so-called depth-sensing camera system, is one example of how face scanning works.The Spectra system includes a module that sprays an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. If the dots are smaller, then the object is farther away; if they are bigger, the object is closer. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the contours of the head \u2014 it\u2019s not just the front of the face as you\u2019re typically thinking about,\u201d said Sy Choudhury, a senior director of product security for Qualcomm.Because of the uniqueness of a person\u2019s head shape, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with the incorrect face is 1 in a million, he added. That compares with a false acceptance rate of 1 in 100 for previous facial recognition systems, which had very poor security.There are, however, limitations to infrared-scanning technologies. For example, objects that you wear, like a hat or a scarf, might throw off the camera, according to Qualcomm. In addition, experts said infrared light can get drowned out by bright sunlight outdoors, so face scanning might work less reliably on the beach.It remains to be seen how exactly face scanning will work in the next iPhone. But Apple is well acquainted with depth-sensing camera technologies. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a depth-sensing camera system that let Xbox players control games using body movements. Analysts expect some rendition of PrimeSense\u2019s technology to appear in future iPhones.Depth-sensing cameras may be crucial to enhancing augmented reality, a jargony industry term that probably makes your eyes glaze over. But bear with me for one moment: Augmented reality will have major implications for future mobile apps.It\u2019s no secret that Apple is bullish about augmented reality. In a recent financial earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called augmented reality \u201cbig and profound,\u201d with major implications for gaming, entertainment and business products. This fall, Apple will release iOS 11, its next mobile operating system that includes support for applications made with ARKit, a tool kit for app developers to easily create augmented-reality applications.ARKit uses a combination of the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensors, including the accelerometer and gyroscope, to let people lay digital objects on top of the real world and interact with them with precise movements.I got a demo of ARKit from Ikea, the furniture maker, with its coming app Ikea Place. I placed an Ikea bed on the floor and was able to move around and look underneath it. This type of application would be useful for getting a sense of how an item looks and fits alongside other furniture in a space before placing an order.\u201cThis is like a real application that real people can use to make real-life decisions,\u201d said Michael Valdsgaard, the head of digital transformation at Ikea.But the limitations of the Ikea Place app underscore what\u2019s missing from ARKit. For placing virtual objects, the app can detect horizontal surfaces, like a table surface or the ground, but it cannot yet detect walls.Vertical planes like walls are trickier to detect because they are not as smooth as floors \u2014 with doors, windows and picture frames getting in your way. Depth-sensing cameras make wall detection much easier for future iPhones, said Blair MacIntyre, a research scientist who is working on augmented reality for Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser.Mr. MacIntyre said augmented reality has huge potential when it matures. He envisioned people being able to take a tour of a natural-history museum, pointing their smartphone cameras at a fossil exhibit to bring a dinosaur back to life.But he said that augmented reality on smartphones was a stopgap to the inevitable: wearing data in front of your face at all times through some kind of headset.\u201cIf you look at science fiction, a lot of it has this characteristic of being always on and serendipitous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot closer to that when you get a head-mounted display.\u201dUntil that happens, smartphones are about to become much smarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Was the Alt-Right\u2019s Favorite Chat App. Then Came Charlottesville.", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftThey posted swastikas and praised Hitler in chat rooms with names like \u201cNational Socialist Army\u201d and \u201cF\u00fchrer\u2019s Gas Chamber.\u201d They organized last weekend\u2019s \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Va., connecting several major white supremacy groups for an intimidating display of force. And when that rally turned deadly, with the killing of a 32-year-old counterdemonstrator, they cheered and discussed holding a gathering at the woman\u2019s funeral.For two months before the Charlottesville rally, I embedded with a large group of white nationalists on Discord, a group chat app that was popular among far-right activists. I lurked silently and saw these activists organize themselves into a cohesive coalition, and interviewed a number of moderators and members about how they used the service to craft and propagate their messages.I also asked Discord executives what, if anything, they planned to do about the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who had set up shop on their platform and were using it to spread their ideology. Several said they were aware of the issue, but had no concrete plans to crack down on any extremist groups.On Monday, Discord finally took action, banning several of the largest alt-right Discord communities and taking away one of the white nationalist movement\u2019s key communication tools.\u201cWe unequivocally condemn white supremacy, neo-Nazism, or any other group, term, ideology that is based on these beliefs,\u201d said Eros Resmini, Discord\u2019s chief marketing officer, in a statement announcing the bans. \u201cThey are not welcome on Discord.\u201dThe alt-right, as the loose constellation of far-right political groups that includes white nationalists and neo-Nazis is known, uses many mainstream tech platforms to distribute its message: Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube for recruiting and public broadcasting, Reddit and 4Chan for lighthearted memes and trolling, and, until Monday, Discord for private group communication. Many of these companies resisted efforts to cut off the activists, arguing that as long as their activities weren\u2019t illegal, they were simply using the tools as any others would.Partly, these are self-preservation instincts kicking in \u2014 no company wants to end up like Reddit, which has struggled to shake its reputation as a den of toxicity \u2014 but it is also indicative of an emerging consensus around the moral responsibilities of tech platforms.Like most platforms, Discord never meant to become a virtual home of the alt-right. It started in 2015 as a chat app for video gamers, where fans of games like World of Warcraft could form teams and talk about strategy. Over the next several years, as gamers invited their friends to the app, it became one of the hottest start-ups in Silicon Valley, growing to more than 45 million members and raising nearly $100 million from top tech investors.But Discord also attracted far-right political groups, whose members were drawn to the app\u2019s privacy and anonymity features. Discord allows users to form private, invitation-only chat groups invisible to those outside the app, and it allows a high degree of anonymity, making it an ideal choice for people looking to avoid detection or surveillance. Perhaps most importantly, it is largely self-policed \u2014 administrators of servers, as Discord\u2019s group chat rooms are known, set their own rules and are responsible for keeping their members in line.Leaders like Richard Spencer, who is credited with coining the term \u201calt-right,\u201d and Andrew Anglin, the editor of the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer, used Discord to discuss current events and debate movement strategy. These discussions were not always harmonious, and often featured infighting and disagreement over tactics and cooperation with older and less internet-savvy groups like the Ku Klux Klan and Vanguard America. But Discord became a private sounding board for the movement, and over time, Discord groups devoted to far-right politics \u2014 including one where newcomers were required to show proof of Caucasian skin before being given posting privileges \u2014 swelled to thousands of members.In the days leading up to the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, Discord proved that it could be an indispensable organizing tool. White nationalists used alt-right Discord servers to form car pools to Charlottesville and arrange local lodging. On the eve of the protest, one Discord user posted a poem written to commemorate the gathering, titled \u201cThe Fire Rises.\u201d (Sample stanza: \u201cA brotherhood of white man\u2019s will / against Jews and their disguises. / And we will march on Charlottesville / as the fire rises.\u201d) And on Saturday, after the protest had ended with three people dead and more injured, the moderator of one Discord server declared the rally a success, posting: \u201cHail victory! Hail our people!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s become a central communication interface for the white nationalist and neo-Nazi movements,\u201d said Keegan Hankes, an analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit that studies right-wing extremist groups. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty unavoidable to be a leader in this movement without participating in Discord.\u201dJosh Elman, a Discord board member and investor with Greylock Partners, told me before the Charlottesville rally that Discord was analogous to a chat app like Skype or iMessage, and said that it had fewer responsibilities to patrol for hateful content than a public-facing social network.\u201cIt\u2019s basically a private email group,\u201d he said.Reached after Discord\u2019s decision to ban alt-right groups, Mr. Elman said, \u201cI believe every communication channel \u2014 public or private \u2014 has a responsibility to investigate and take action on any reports of misuse including harassment, inciting violence or hate, and other abuse.\u201dSome white nationalists see Discord\u2019s actions as part of a greater \u201cno-platform\u201d movement, in which tech companies systematically take away the digital tools that activists use to generate attention and organize their activities. In response to being kicked off services like PayPal and Patreon, a crowdfunding site, several far-right groups have begun creating alternative platforms, where extreme views will be tolerated.One moderator of an alt-right Discord server that was banned on Monday, Nathan Gate, who goes by the username TheBigKK, told me that Discord users were \u201cleaving in droves\u201d in search of a more hospitable platform.\u201cDiscord started out as a great service but unfortunately it looks as though we will have to move,\u201d he said.Another right-wing Discord moderator, who goes by Based, said that his server, a large pro-Trump group called \u201cCentipede Central\u201d that is still active, would have to be more careful to police its users going forward.\u201cWe\u2019re a little on pins and needles,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause Discord has shown they\u2019re willing to nuke servers.\u201dModeration on the internet is an endless cat-and-mouse game, and it\u2019s a near-certainty that without Discord as a safe haven, white nationalists will organize themselves somewhere else. Just hours after Discord shut down their servers, several alt-right users were already attempting to form new rooms, and others were suggesting alternative chat apps that might be friendlier to their views.Advertisement"}

What can I get you?\u201d The goal is to be helpful and offer comfort during a difficult time.Don\u2019t make it about you. Avoid referring to your own experiences with the death of a loved one, Ms. Masini wrote, adding that those references can be saved for a future conversation.\u201cFor now, comparing the loss of your beloved pet to the loss of your uncle\u2019s brother diminishes the death at hand,\u201d she wrote. Similarly, don\u2019t try to empathize so much with your friend that they wind up feeling like they have to console you.Avoid clich\u00e9s, and do not use expressions such as \u201cIt happened for the best\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through.\u201dLinda Fite of Kerhonkson, N.Y., emphasized the importance of reaching out.

One evening there in February, they encountered Adam W. Purinton, a 51-year-old white man, who questioned their immigration status and hurled racial slurs at them.Mr. Purinton was kicked out of the bar but came back a short time later, angry and armed.

{"Headline": "A Wish List for New Restaurants", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookFor poets, autumn may be a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, but for restaurant critics it is time to get cracking. Reading those long lists of new places to eat in New York and around the country, I stare hopelessly at my calendar, trying to figure out if there might be a way to squeeze an extra two or three nights into each week.There\u2019s not. I\u2019ve tried.So when people ask me what I\u2019d like to see in the fall crop of openings, I don\u2019t say, \u201cMore restaurants.\u201d But I do find myself hoping for different restaurants, or restaurants run differently, by a wider and more diverse range of operators.A few years ago I would look at these lists and, if a good number of projects were backed by big restaurant groups with a strong track record, I\u2019d take it as a sign that an interesting season was in the wings. Now I\u2019m less sure. What I see more and more is the way power accrues to chefs who are already powerful, while independent restaurants struggle to get going.Of course, I\u2019ll end up reviewing many projects from the groups at the top of the ladder, and chances are that a lot of those reviews will be positive. (The big groups got big by knowing what they\u2019re doing.) But I\u2019ll also be looking at the lower rungs of the ladder for a chance to celebrate fresh, individual points of view.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.It\u2019s wonderful that all these interesting guys are willing to help. It would be even more wonderful if having a hand in these high-profile projects gave them an appetite for backing other talented chefs and restaurateurs who don\u2019t have such an easy time getting financing. Maybe they will want to start something in neighborhoods that make banks skittish.Real-estate developers can get in on the action, too. They have seized local government incentives to build major projects, creating dense populations almost overnight in areas where there isn\u2019t a lot to eat. Many of these high-rises have restaurant spaces down below, which give the developers an opportunity to nudge gentrification in another direction.The days when female servers were scarce in the dining rooms of formal restaurants should be over, and more people of color should be working at jobs besides busing tables and filling water glasses.Another signal, of course, is keeping the prices low. Expensive restaurants can be a treat, when they\u2019re good. But prestige in the restaurant business has been derived by high prices for too long. Chefs and restaurateurs know all kinds of tricks for keeping costs on a short leash. Now a few are using that knowledge to open places that are truly affordable.Not everybody can run a nonprofit. We all need to earn a living. But the restaurant business has become a cultural obsession, and people who are talented and lucky enough to have had some success in it don\u2019t have to devote their lives to feeding the same sliver of society over and over. The world is too big for that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rich and Oaky, White Rioja Bends the Summer Standard", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of The TimesWhat\u2019s more, good white Rioja is not so much about fruit as it is about the absence of it. Savory, oaky, mineral, spicy, nutlike; these words all come to mind. Citrus is the closest white Rioja comes to fruit, and, really, that is more of an allusion to its lively acidity than it is to a distant family member of the grape.Still, white Rioja can be a great wine for summer. Lobster and corn, scallops, crab, meaty white fish like halibut \u2014 all of these would benefit from the rich embrace of a classic example. Good Riojas are refreshing, a quality that has more to do with balance and energy than it does lightness.I had been thinking about white Rioja recently because it has been many years since the wine panel looked at a cross section of this unusual category. With that in mind, we recently tasted 20 white Riojas, including bottles from nine different vintages, from 2015 going back to 2003.It is fair to say that white Rioja is not exactly a well-known wine, nor is it well understood. Many people are not even aware of its existence.\u201cNinety-five percent of the customers who order a white Rioja, when the wine comes, they say they thought they ordered a red,\u201d Ashley said.Almost alone, L\u00f3pez de Heredia continues the practice of aging the bottles at the winery until they are ready to drink. This means that the current vintage in the marketplace for its Vi\u00f1a Gravonia crianza, its least-aged white, is 11 years old, the 2006. The latest available vintage for Vi\u00f1a Tondonia reserva, the midage white, is the 2003, and, for the Tondonia gran reserva, which gets the longest aging before release, it is the 1996.We could not fit the gran reserva into our tasting, as it exceeds our cap of $100 a bottle, but the other two were included, and, needless to say, they took the top two spots. The \u201906 Gravonia was our No. 1 wine and received our highest rating, the rarely awarded four stars. It was rich and oaky, yet pulsing with energy, with a coiled core of mineral flavors.The wines are so singular that we all recognized the producer in the blind tasting. Rachel called it \u201chistorical,\u201d and Ashley said \u201cthis is what I want when I order white Rioja.\u201d The Gravonia was also our best value at $29.Theoretically, a reserva like the 2003 would be a step up in concentration and complexity over the crianza, and usually it is. But 2003 was a bizarrely hot year, often resulting in wines of lower acidity than usual. This seemed true with the reserva, which was nonetheless delightful. It was our No. 2 bottle, but it did feel as if it were tiring a bit. The 2006 vintage was also a hot one, but you could not tell it by the crianza.Aside from the long aging, the other telltale sign of a traditional Rioja is the use of American oak in its aging vessels, rather than the French oak commonly used for more modern versions. The difference may not be neon obvious, but to my taste, American oak melds better with both red and white Rioja, imparting a light coconut creaminess that seems perfectly at home with the wines.French oak tends to offer a spicier, toasty woodiness that sticks out. I should say these are generalizations subject to many variables, including how and where the barrels were made.The contrast in woods was evident in our No. 3 wine, the full-bodied but resonant 2014 Que Bonito Cacareaba from Benjamin Romeo\u2019s Contador. It was a modern, much younger wine with evident flavors of French oak that the traditional-minded panel still found impressive.Most Rioja Blancos are dominated by the viura grape, supplemented primarily with garnacha blanca and malvasia as the primary supplements. A few international varieties like chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are also permitted.But the Que Bonita Cacareaba is, unusually, 73 percent garnacha blanca, with 15 percent malvasia and just 12 percent viura. By contrast, the L\u00f3pez de Heredia wines were 90 percent to 100 percent viura. And our No. 4 wine, the 2008 Honoratus Aurum from Vi\u00f1aspral, was 100 percent viura, aged in a combination of French and American oak. We found it rich and smoky, textured and energetic.Wines like the Que Bonito Cacareaba and our No. 6 bottle, the 2015 Muga Rioja Blanco, are not so much aged in oak as they are fermented in oak. What\u2019s the difference?Those two wines were fermented in new French oak, which imparts the flavor of the wood. But they don\u2019t receive the very slow interaction with oxygen that comes from long aging in barrels, which can deepen and enrich the texture of the wines. Nonetheless, the Muga, a $15 bottle, was focused and lively with flavors of nuts, oak and minerals.The most surprising element in our tasting was the relative absence of fresh young whites, which maybe a decade ago seemed to be squeezing out the oak-aged and oak-fermented versions.We rejected several bottles because they were overbearingly oaky, lacking the fine balance of our favorites. And a couple of bottles didn\u2019t make our top 10 because the divergence of opinion was too great. They were the 2010 \u201cB de Basilio\u201d from Basilio Izquierdo, which I found rich but lacking energy and definition, and the 2012 Pl\u00e1cet Valtomelloso from Palacios Remondo, which Florence and I liked, but Ashley and Rachel did not.Over all, the quality of these wines was high. They certainly made more of an impression on us than they appear to make on the public. But if you are interested in a break from the familiar, they are well worth exploring.Best ValueRich, oxidative and oaky, yet alive and lively, with a taut core of savory minerality.

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Barnstorms for \u2018Moral Responsibility\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was. And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201dThat was Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, across the table from me over breakfast here in downtown Austin late last week at the end of a mini-tour across the country during which he focused on topics usually reserved for politicians: manufacturing, jobs and education.He had just spent the prior day in Ohio, where he toured CTS, a technology company that produces the equipment that Apple uses to test water resistance and dust protection for the iPhone and the Apple Watch. He then flew to Des Moines, where he announced plans to make a $1.3 billion investment in a 400,000-square-foot data center in nearby Waukee to help store and move giant amounts of information for its services like iCloud and FaceTime. And he arrived here to announce that Austin Community College will begin offering its 74,000 students a curriculum that Apple developed to teach them how to write code to create apps for iPhones. Austin is one of 30 community colleges that will offer the curriculum.As Mr. Cook\u2019s breakfast arrived \u2014 two scrambled egg whites, crispy bacon (they didn\u2019t have his preferred turkey bacon), sugar-free cereal with unsweetened almond milk \u2014 he described his week, punctuated by a visit the night before to the L.B.J. Presidential Library, the museum of President Lyndon B. Johnson.\u201cOne of the things that hits you,\u201d he said, is \u201call of the major acts, legislation, that happened during just his presidency.\u201d His eyes widened as he listed some: \u201cYou have the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Act, you have Medicare, you have Medicaid, you have several national parks, you have Head Start, you have housing discrimination, you have jury discrimination.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your politics,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou look at it and say, \u2018My gosh.\u2019\u201dMr. Cook\u2019s comments weren\u2019t a dig at President Trump so much as they were a critique of Washington\u2019s seemingly perpetual state of gridlock.And now Mr. Cook is one of the many business leaders in the country who appear to be filling the void, using his platform at Apple to wade into larger social issues that typically fell beyond the mandate of executives in past generations.He said he had never set out to do so, but he feels he has been thrust into the role as virtually every large American company has had to stake out a domestic policy.He was vocal, for example, in criticizing Mr. Trump after Charlottesville in a memo to his staff: \u201cI disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans.\u201dWatching Mr. Cook over the years, I\u2019ve been fascinated to see how he has become as animated when talking about big issues like education and climate change as he is when talking about Apple.\u201cI think we have a moral responsibility to help grow the economy, to help grow jobs, to contribute to this country and to contribute to the other countries that we do business in,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI think there\u2019s still probably a more significant group that feels my sole responsibility is to Wall Street.\u201dHis critics will, of course, say all this happy talk is a P.R. ploy for a company that makes its most popular products on the other side of the world and keeps nearly a quarter-trillion dollars abroad, untaxed by Uncle Sam. In fairness, Apple is one of the largest taxpayers in the country, paying $28 billion in federal taxes between 2014 and 2016 at an average rate of 26 percent, which is in the middle for big multinational American corporations.And Mr. Cook is paid handsomely: On Thursday, as a result of the company\u2019s financial outperformance compared with its peers, Mr. Cook was given nearly $90 million of stock as part of his previously agreed upon compensation plan. (He has said he plans to give away all of his wealth.)But there\u2019s a more nuanced version of Apple\u2019s story \u2014 and Mr. Cook\u2019s transformation of the company after taking over as its chief executive in 2011 \u2014 that has been lost amid the din of nonstop chatter about the company in Silicon Valley and Washington.When Mr. Cook announced, for example, the new data facility in Waukee, he said it would run fully on renewable energy. But he slipped in another fact that has largely gone unnoticed: Over the past several years, Mr. Cook has gotten all of the company\u2019s corporate facilities in the United States to run on wind and solar energy \u2014 in their entirety.\u201cWe\u2019re running Apple a hundred percent on renewable energy today\u201d in the United States, he said over breakfast, \u201cand we\u2019ve now hit that in 23 other countries around the world.\u201dHe is hoping the curriculum turns into jobs. Last year, according to Apple, 150,000 new jobs were created through the App Store. Apple paid out $5 billion directly to app makers.He said he had chosen to focus on getting the curriculum to community colleges, rather than four-year colleges, because \u201cas it turns out, the community college system is much more diverse than the four-year schools, particularly the four-year schools that are known for comp sci.\u201d He noted that \u201cthere is a definite diversity issue in tech, in particular in coding and computer scientists.\u201dApple has already rolled out the curriculum in Alabama, Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other states. \u201cYou want it to increase the diversity of people that are in there, both racial diversity, gender diversity, but also geographic diversity,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cRight now, the benefits of tech are too lopsided to certain states.\u201d (Like California.)Students who take the classes learn the Swift language, which is used to make apps on Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad. Admittedly, Mr. Cook is not helping students learn how to code in languages for his competitors, but he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s significantly transferable.\u201dHe continued, with a laugh: \u201cWe know that people making a mobile app, many of them are going to make iOS apps and Android apps. And I wish they wouldn\u2019t, but they\u2019re probably going to.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to make money on it. It\u2019s a gift.\u201dAs for Mr. Cook\u2019s coding skills? \u201cI might fail a little bit on that.\u201dAs we finished up breakfast before we headed over to Austin\u2019s Capital Factory, an incubator for tech start-ups where he would announce the new curriculum, I mentioned a question that some in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have asked: Is his focus on jobs and speeches in front of American flags a hint at something bigger? After all, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s name is now regularly bandied about in discussions of potential presidential candidates.\u201cI have a full-time job,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cI appreciate the compliment,\u201d he added with a wry look, \u201cif it is a compliment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(Do you like me? Circle yes or no.) That heart-pounding, sweaty-palmed infatuation is nothing new in children\u2019s animation, but two students decided to tell the tale in a different way, creating an animated short film that is drawing the interest of big production studios.Here, the enamored characters are both middle-school boys. And their dovelike innocence is charming a huge audience on YouTube. Posted on Monday, the four-minute film has already been viewed more than 14 million times.Not bad for a first project.The filmmakers, Beth David, 21, and Esteban Bravo, 24, made the short for their senior thesis while at Ringling College of Art and Design, where they recently graduated, in Sarasota, Fla.Even so, they couldn\u2019t have predicted this.\u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing to me,\u201d Ms. David said in an interview, adding that people want to see gay-themed stories \u201cin a positive light.\u201dMr. Bravo, who is from Mexico City, was similarly stunned by the response. \u201cIt\u2019s really surreal,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cI hope I give a good name to people from my country.\u201dThe two have signed with Verve Talent and Literary Agency, which is in talks with Blue Sky Studios, Illumination Entertainment and Disney; they\u2019ve been accepted to multiple festivals, including the HollyShorts; and they are semifinalists for a student Academy Award.It\u2019s a tale that is very personal to viewers, who have responded en masse, and to the filmmakers, too. Mr. Bravo is gay, and Ms. David \u2014 while she doesn\u2019t necessarily like to label herself \u2014 says she considers herself \u201ca member of the gay community.\u201dSean McLaughlin, one of the instructors at Ringling who helped guide Mr. Bravo and Ms. David during the production of their film, said he saw the short in preliminary form during the 2015-16 school year.\u201cEven back then I knew it was going to be something special,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIf an audience doesn\u2019t connect with a film and its characters on a basic story level, it fails,\u201d but this film, he said, \u201cresonates a truth.\u201dDr. Sean Griffin, a professor at the Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University, said he believes it can be especially meaningful to adolescents who are figuring out their sexuality. \u201cIt turns a situation that is often fraught with extreme emotions \u2014 excitement, anxiety, fear, and potentially shame and embarrassment \u2014 into one that is \u2018cartoony\u2019 by literalizing the runaway heart, thus making it a bit more amusing,\u201d he said.This certainly isn\u2019t the first children\u2019s story to include gay and lesbian characters. There\u2019s Ruby and Sapphire on Cartoon Network\u2019s \u201cSteven Universe,\u201d for example, and LeFou in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of \u201cBeauty and the Beast.\u201dNick Davis, an associate professor of English at Northwestern University who has written about sexuality and gender in film, said it was gratifying to see such a variety.\u201cI do some programming for the L.G.B.T. film festival in Chicago and we\u2019re increasingly struck by how the short films submitted are animated, and sci-fi, and fantasy, and horror,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it almost seems like there\u2019s no genre where they don\u2019t show up anymore.\u201d\u201cIf anything we\u2019re just glad that we\u2019re getting to release it right now because I feel, and we both said, it\u2019ll help change some people\u2019s perspectives around the amount of controversy and hatred that\u2019s been going around lately,\u201d Mr. Bravo said. \u201cWe just hope that this helps to change, or begin changing, what people think about people in this community and try to understand them better.\u201dPerhaps one secret to the charm of \u201cIn a Heartbeat\u201d is its simplicity: The story is told without words, just music and animation.\u201cI think audiences do like discovering something that\u2019s not built to bowl you over, but just kind of unexpectedly does,\u201d Mr. Davis said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Are Markets Due for a Reckoning?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a decade after the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, concerns are rising that euphoric markets may be headed for a hard fall.Technology companies have been an important driver behind the increase in financial markets in recent years, with seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies now coming from that sector.The so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and the Google parent Alphabet \u2014 have had some of the biggest gains in the past 12 months.And a stunning amount of money (more than $60 billion a year for the past three years) has flowed into the tech sector through venture capitalists and private equity funds.\u2022 Many of the gains have been concentrated around a small number of stocks, rather than resulting in a broader rise.\u2022 Tech companies may face increasing scrutiny from regulators.Google was fined a record $2.7 billion this summer by European Union antitrust officials for unfairly favoring some of its own services over rivals. The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The menu will offer a somewhat limited list of steaks, plus a bone-in pork schnitzel and a lamb sirloin. (Glen & Co. is designing the interior of this one, too.)Butcher & Banker will mark the return of the chef Scott Campbell, who has been quietly working on this project for several years. The restaurant and lounge, in the former Manufacturers Hanover Trust bank vault under the New Yorker Hotel, will put a new spin on the steak menu, with a long list of vegetable sides, choices like culotte and rib cap steaks, and a number of cuts, not just beef, on the bone. At Holy Ground in TriBeCa, smoked briskets and pork butts will be served tableside, along with prime strip loins and rib-eyes.

Mr. Benavides is from Argentina, so expect some South American flavors to complement traditional cuts of beef.Late fall will bring a third branch of Michael Stillman\u2019s Quality Eats, where lesser cuts of steak are given their due.

Below, Ms. Hunter discusses why she felt compelled to write about Greg, how she has been influenced by the photographer Cindy Sherman and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I always wanted to write about this main character, Greg. I knew him. I felt like I was going to either write a novel about witches or about Greg. I thought the witches book could be so much bigger, commercially. As a writer, you make up all these rules, and one day you tell yourself: \u201cWhat are you talking about? You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d I loved the idea of writing something that felt really different from what I\u2019d done in the past, including from the perspective of a middle-aged man. I always say people should pay attention to what they have fun with while they\u2019re writing, and I just kind of followed that.I\u2019ve always been fascinated with families, and how you start as this one thing and end up, after the kids are grown, as this other thing. Hopefully you\u2019re not too worse for the wear, but it can be a hard journey. I kept thinking about fathers, and the mistakes you\u2019re making that you don\u2019t even know you\u2019re making. It\u2019s really hard to be a parent, and it\u2019s really hard to be someone\u2019s child.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?Early on, I wondered if I was going to switch perspectives, which is what I did in \u201cUgly Girls.\u201d As I kept writing, I fought against that. And I wondered why, because I love doing that kind of thing. I fought and fought with it in my head, and had a lot of conversations with my husband about it, and I finally, toward the end, came to the realization that this is only Greg\u2019s story. I finally accepted it.I also kept a journal as I was writing. I never do that. But I remember that with \u201cUgly Girls,\u201d people asked me, \u201cWhat was your intention when you wrote this or that?\u201d And I didn\u2019t remember. With this novel, I was going to take ownership of all of that \u2014 I wanted to keep track of everything I was doing, and the daily journal would just be a paragraph of, \u201cHere\u2019s what I set out to do today.\u201dIn what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?Once you settle into the narrative and you allow it to take control, it doesn\u2019t matter what you intended. Very early on, I describe what Greg looks like. Once I could see him clearly, it totally changed my view of him and I had to go with it. I thought, O.K., this is who we\u2019re dealing with here. He\u2019s on this quest, but he\u2019s actually not trying that hard to find his son. So what is he doing? It\u2019s almost like I was writing about a hero and I ended up writing about an antihero. I hear everything from \u201cGreg is really sympathetic\u201d to \u201cI hate Greg.\u201d I love Greg, and I love being around him. In general, I like unreliable narrators. I think that\u2019s just reality.I remember thinking that this novel was going to be a love letter to parenthood. And maybe it\u2019s still that, but it ended up being more about one small moment of grace. And as a parent, I think, if you end on that note it\u2019s a good thing.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?But to me it\u2019s almost an unfair answer, because she is a writer. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s actually written the characters down, but I feel like she could tell you \u2014 not that she would, or that she\u2019s obligated to \u2014 \u201cObviously this is Janice, and she\u2019s the receptionist at a small airfield and she cans every other day and.\u2026\u201d These characters, to me, are a story in full.Persuade someone to read the novel in 50 words or less.If you like awkward conversations, Florida, heat and sweat and junk food, this is a bite-size story, and I think it will move you in every sense of the word. You might laugh, you might cry, you might be disgusted, and what more could you want out of a book?This interview has been condensed and edited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fall Forecast: 4 Trends to Shop Now", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrowsingRegardless of what the Gregorian calendar says, for many of us fashion folk it\u2019s September that feels like the start of a new year. Perhaps it\u2019s because the magazines stretch their bindings on their biggest issues, or that, on the runways, we get a glimpse of what is to come. Or it may be the persistent association with back-to-school prep that lingers long after the last bell. Whatever the reason, autumn puts one in mind of fresh beginnings. We can hardly be blamed, then, for wanting to jump-start the seasonal update now, even as we wait for temperatures to cool. Luckily, the stores have plenty of fresh offerings that play into fall\u2019s biggest trends.Velvet is to fall what florals are to spring. The cozy material is always a mainstay of the season. This year, though, the volume has been turned way up. Not only is it more omnipresent than ever, but instead of the usual navy, black and burgundy, it\u2019s showing up in loud hues like hot pink and mustard gold.There are those of us who love to wear red and those who swear they can\u2019t. This season may convert some of the naysayers. All over the runways, at Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana and, most notably, Givenchy, which showed a completely crimson lineup, the potent color comes in many iterations \u2014 hipster-approved ensembles, sophisticated separates \u2014 that will appeal to all sorts.It\u2019s always nice when a trend comes along that\u2019s as comfortable and practical as it is cool. The tracksuit, seen on the runways at Marc Jacobs, Chlo\u00e9 and Yeezy, is one such gem. Updated in a variety of fabrics and slightly tweaked silhouettes, the tricked-out suits invite a certain swagger.It\u2019s a little odd that, at a time when feminism is arguably thriving more than ever, the corset, that hallmark of the patriarchal oppression, should be enjoying a moment of popularity. Of course, the 2017 versions are a good deal less restrictive \u2014 and pair perfectly well with a finely honed sense of social justice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manhunt in Missouri for Driver Suspected in Fatal Shooting of Officer", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA manhunt was underway on Monday for a man suspected of shooting and killing a Missouri police officer during a routine traffic stop on Sunday evening.Gary Michael, 37, a police officer in Clinton, Mo., died at a hospital there shortly after he was shot by a driver he had pulled over at about 10:45 p.m. on Sunday, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said in a statement on Monday.The Highway Patrol identified the suspect as Ian McCarthy, 39. Mr. McCarthy was charged on Monday with one count of first-degree murder and one count of armed criminal action, according to court papers.The Highway Patrol statement said that Officer Michael had been able to return fire but that it was not clear if Mr. McCarthy had been struck or wounded.Sgt. Bill Lowe, a spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol, said Monday evening that investigators believed Mr. McCarthy was still in or around Clinton.He said Mr. McCarthy had lived in Clinton \u201cfor a while\u201d but was originally from New Hampshire. Mr. McCarthy had no known relatives in the area and \u201cdoesn\u2019t have an employment history,\u201d the sergeant said.\u201cIn the recent past we know he was unemployed so there wasn\u2019t anything we can pinpoint that drew him here,\u201d Sergeant Lowe said. He added that investigators were interviewing the suspect\u2019s friends and acquaintances. \u201cWe\u2019re getting as much information as possible.\u201dMr. McCarthy was convicted of first-degree assault in New Hampshire for the June 2001 stabbing of a minor who was left with severe neck, chest and abdomen injuries, according to court records.The Associated Press reported on Monday that Mr. McCarthy was charged with more than 20 crimes in New Hampshire between 1997 and 2011. A warrant for his arrest was issued there in 2013 when he failed to show up for sentencing after he was convicted of disorderly conduct, The A.P. said.Sergeant Lowe said there was also a warrant out for Mr. McCarthy\u2019s arrest in Johnson County, Mo. Court records show that he was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm there in 2015.Officer Michael was a lifelong resident of Clinton, Sergeant Lowe said. He is survived by his wife and two stepsons and had been on the police force for less than a year.\u201cHe had a past military background and his desire was to be a police officer,\u201d Sergeant Lowe said. \u201cIt just came to the point where he was able to do that.\u201dBefore shots were fired, Officer Michael radioed in a description of Mr. McCarthy\u2019s car, a 2008 Dodge Nitro sport utility vehicle, according to a probable cause statement filed with court by Sgt. Greg Martin, an investigator with the Highway Patrol\u2019s Division of Drug and Crime Control. He said the vehicle was registered in the suspect\u2019s name.Surveillance video from two convenience stores in Clinton was used to link Mr. McCarthy and the abandoned vehicle, Sergeant Martin said.Video from an Everyday Convenience Store shows Mr. McCarthy driving his car into the store parking lot shortly before Officer Michael was killed, the sergeant wrote. The video shows Mr. McCarthy getting out of the car, entering the store and buying a package of cigar wrappers.The video then shows him leaving the store and stopping to talk with someone \u2014 who court papers describe only as \u201ca witness\u201d \u2014 before getting back into his car. Sergeant Martin said that witness confirmed that the person who got in the car and drove off was Mr. McCarthy.Video from a second shop, Clinton Convenience Store, shows Mr. McCarthy\u2019s car leaving the parking lot of the Everyday Convenience Store and driving toward the scene of the shooting. It does not record the shooting itself.\u201cAt this point, the surveillance footage shows a Clinton Police S.U.V. overtake and activate its lights behind the S.U.V.,\u201d Sergeant Martin wrote. \u201cBoth vehicles then leave the view of the camera. The time signature for this footage is consistent with Officer Michael\u2019s murder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Identity Thieves Hijack Cellphone Accounts to Go After Virtual Currency", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHackers have discovered that one of the most central elements of online security \u2014 the mobile phone number \u2014 is also one of the easiest to steal.In a growing number of online attacks, hackers have been calling up Verizon, T-Mobile U.S., Sprint and AT&T and asking them to transfer control of a victim\u2019s phone number to a device under the control of the hackers.Once they get control of the phone number, they can reset the passwords on every account that uses the phone number as a security backup \u2014 as services like Google, Twitter and Facebook suggest.\u201cMy iPad restarted, my phone restarted and my computer restarted, and that\u2019s when I got the cold sweat and was like, \u2018O.K., this is really serious,\u2019\u201d said Chris Burniske, a virtual currency investor who lost control of his phone number late last year.But a particularly concentrated wave of attacks has hit those with the most obviously valuable online accounts: virtual currency fanatics like Mr. Burniske.Within minutes of getting control of Mr. Burniske\u2019s phone, his attackers had changed the password on his virtual currency wallet and drained the contents \u2014 some $150,000 at today\u2019s values.Most victims of these attacks in the virtual currency community have not wanted to acknowledge it publicly for fear of provoking their adversaries. But in interviews, dozens of prominent people in the industry acknowledged that they had been victimized in recent months.\u201cEverybody I know in the cryptocurrency space has gotten their phone number stolen,\u201d said Joby Weeks, a Bitcoin entrepreneur.Mr. Weeks lost his phone number and about a million dollars\u2019 worth of virtual currency late last year, despite having asked his mobile phone provider for additional security after his wife and parents lost control of their phone numbers.The attackers appear to be focusing on anyone who talks on social media about owning virtual currencies or anyone who is known to invest in virtual currency companies, such as venture capitalists. And virtual currency transactions are designed to be irreversible.Accounts with banks and brokerage firms and the like are not as vulnerable to these attacks because these institutions can usually reverse unintended or malicious transactions if they are caught within a few days.But the attacks are exposing a vulnerability that could be exploited against almost anyone with valuable emails or other digital files \u2014 including politicians, activists and journalists.In a number of cases involving digital money aficionados, the attackers have held email files for ransom \u2014 threatening to release naked pictures in one case, and details of a victim\u2019s sexual fetishes in another.The vulnerability of even sophisticated programmers and security experts to these attacks sets an unsettling precedent for when the assailants go after less technologically savvy victims. Security experts worry that these types of attacks will become more widespread if mobile phone operators do not make significant changes to their security procedures.\u201cIt\u2019s really highlighting the insecurity of using any kind of telephone-based security,\u201d said Michael Perklin, the chief information security officer at the virtual currency exchange ShapeShift, which has seen many of its employees and customers attacked.Mobile phone carriers have said they are taking steps to head off the attacks by making it possible to add more complex personal identification numbers, or PINs, to accounts, among other steps.But these measures have not been enough to stop the spread and success of the culprits.In several recent cases, the hackers have commandeered phone numbers even when the victims knew they were under attack and alerted their cellphone provider.Adam Pokornicky, a managing partner at Cryptochain Capital, asked Verizon to put extra security measures on his account after he learned that an attacker had called in 13 times trying to move his number to a new phone.But just a day later, he said, the attacker persuaded a different Verizon agent to change Mr. Pokornicky\u2019s number without requiring the new PIN.A spokesman for Verizon, Richard Young, said that the company could not comment on specific cases, but that phone porting was not common.\u201cWhile we work diligently to ensure customer accounts remain secure, on occasion there are instances where automated processes or human performance falls short,\u201d he said. \u201cWe strive to correct these issues quickly and look for additional ways to improve security.\u201dMr. Perklin, who worked at a Canadian mobile phone operator before joining ShapeShift, said most phone companies would write down any additional security requests in the notes of a customer account.But agents can generally act on their own, he said, regardless of what is in the notes, and can easily miss what is in the notes.The vulnerability of phone numbers is the unintended consequence of a broad push in the security industry to institute a practice, known as two-factor authentication, that is supposed to help make accounts more secure.Many email providers and financial firms require customers to tie their online accounts to phone numbers, to verify their identity. But this system also generally allows someone with the phone number to reset the passwords on these accounts without knowing the original passwords. A hacker just hits \u201cforgot password?\u201d and has a new code sent to the commandeered phone.Mr. Pokornicky was online at the time his phone number was taken, and he watched as his assailants seized all his major online accounts within a few minutes.\u201cIt felt like they were one step ahead of me the whole time,\u201d he said.The speed with which the attackers move has convinced people who are investigating the hacks that the attacks are generally run by groups of hackers working together.Danny Yang, the founder of the virtual currency security firm BlockSeer, said he had traced several attacks to internet addresses in the Philippines, though other attacks have been tracked to computers in Turkey and the United States.Mr. Perklin and other people who have investigated recent hacks said the assailants generally succeeded by delivering sob stories about an emergency that required the phone number to be moved to a new device \u2014 and by trying multiple times until a gullible agent was found.\u201cThese guys will sit and call 600 times before they get through and get an agent on the line that\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Mr. Weeks said.Coinbase, one of the most widely used Bitcoin wallets, has encouraged customers to disconnect their mobile phones from their Coinbase accounts.But some customers who have lost money have said the companies need to take more steps by doing things like delaying transfers from accounts on which the password was recently changed.A spokesman for Coinbase said the company \u201chas invested significant resources to build internal tools to help protect our customers against hackers and account takeovers, including compromise through phone porting.\u201dThe irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions has often been lauded as one of the most important qualities of virtual currency because it makes it harder for banks and governments to intervene in transactions.But Mr. Pokornicky said the virtual currency industry needed to alert new users to the added risk that comes with the new features of the technology.\u201cIt\u2019s powerful to be able to control your money and move things without any permission,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that privilege requires a clear understanding of the downside.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Nur, an Open-Armed Approach to Middle Eastern Flavors", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review9 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.New York is supposed to be tough on out-of-town chefs who go into business here. In reality, it\u2019s tough on chefs of all kinds. Distance simply multiplies the difficulties, and competition weeds out the unprepared.Running a new restaurant in New York tends to be more than a half-time job, and yet Nur doesn\u2019t have the lethargy and mechanical quality of a kitchen run by remote control. The plates have energy. At times, in fact, they don\u2019t know when to quit. The sauces and powders and garnishes proliferate so quickly that it\u2019s hard to keep count. But it\u2019s easier for a new restaurant to settle down after an excess of high spirits than to recover from a tentative start.The swirl of flavors also reflects Mr. Adoni\u2019s expansive definition of the food of the Middle East. Nur\u2019s menu embraces Morocco and Libya in North Africa, in addition to Israel, Yemen and Syria; again, it\u2019s hard to keep count. His vision of his part of the globe is pluralistic.Inspired by the Arab cooks working in Mr. Adoni\u2019s Tel Aviv restaurants, Nur\u2019s Palestinian tartare begins with mounds of raw beef and adds layer upon layer of complication. Pine nuts, tender young favas, pickled onions, slices of green chiles, broccolini florets, sumac powder and micro-sprouts are strewn over at least three sauces, including a pitch-dark and smoky eggplant pur\u00e9e and a very good sheep-milk yogurt. All of this flirts with chaos, but it doesn\u2019t topple over.Nur turns an Arab dessert, the folded pancakes called qatayef, into fried savory pies filled with a mince of spiced lamb. There is some sweetness in the dough and a fair amount of delicious fat in the lamb, so a break from the richness comes in the form of cucumber spears and salted green almonds. Maybe the yogurt-mint sauce would work better as a dip than a \u201cchaser\u201d served in a shot glass, but the flavors are right.Born in southern Israel to a Moroccan family, Mr. Adoni draws on some of the cooking of that culture. The Moroccan fritters known as sfenj are the basis of an odd and appealing appetizer he calls a date doughnut. Although it is sweetened by dates it could just as easily be seen as a smoked trout beignet, or, when you get right down to it, a fish cake. The sauce is an intense sweet-and-sour citrus vinaigrette with curry powder lurking in it; a few drops go a long way.Like the chatter of a nervous guest at a party, the hyperactivity of certain dishes probably comes from a desire to impress. But the quieter plates can be just as remarkable, sometimes more so. There is a suave and very good seafood stew that is a cross between bouillabaisse and chraime, the Moroccan braise of fish in spicy tomato sauce.One factor in Nur\u2019s early success \u2014 the small dining room has been thronged every time I\u2019ve gone \u2014 is Mr. Adoni\u2019s business partner and guide to local customs, Gadi Peleg. An owner of Breads Bakery, a champion producer of babka and rugelach, Mr. Peleg found the space, which crouches three steps below grade, beneath an eyelash-extension salon.The ceilings are low. The layout is tight. The service is familiar and opinionated about the menu. (Almost all the opinions are positive.) The place looks and acts, in other words, like a New York restaurant. It sounds like one, too, when all the seats are taken and raised voices start careening off the ceiling. Oddly enough, the bar is relatively quiet, and not a bad place to eat if you want to have a conversation.I recommend trying all three. Probably not on the same night.With all the ideas zinging around Nur\u2019s menu, a few are bound to veer off in the wrong direction. The brazenly trayf gefilte shrimp, buried under pebbles of dashi jelly, doesn\u2019t open up the way it should; both it and the jelly are too firm to melt on the tongue. A main course of octopus shimmers under a fine spice glaze, but gets wrong-footed by a jumble of sauces.Sea scallops, another main course, get along better with just one good sauce, a tart sorrel pur\u00e9e with an undercurrent of cumin. If the kitchen can do something about the awful, overcooked nuggets of ricotta gnudi, it would be onto something.Lisa Meisenger, the pastry chef, is certainly with the program. For a recent special, she scattered some juicy, dark strawberries over a bay-leaf custard with candied walnuts and pine-nut brittle. Rounded out with a scoop of mastic ice cream and decorated with flowers and edible gold, it was one of the more straightforward desserts.Something going by the name of chocolate cassata is made up of three small sandwiches of pistachio ice cream between almond cookies. They are nearly engulfed by chocolate foam, cherries in syrup, orange zest and candied pistachio. It is hectic, but delicious.Mr. Adoni said he would like to open a second New York restaurant. Selfishly, I\u2019m hoping it will be North African; he could build an entire menu around that Libyan couscous. But he has his sights on a kosher restaurant. If he can use ingredients as vibrant as those at Nur, and keep the prices from soaring out the window, it would be a real achievement.A listing of information with a review last Wednesday about the Middle Eastern restaurant Nur, on East 20th Street, misidentified the cross street. It is Park Avenue South, not Park Avenue.A review on Aug. 9 about Nur, a Middle Eastern restaurant in the Flatiron district, misstated the relationship of Gadi Peleg, a partner in the restaurant, with Breads Bakery. He is an owner, not the sole owner.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyLigaya Mishan\u2019s Hungry City reviews will return on Aug. 23.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Erin French Made a Tiny Maine Town a Dining Destination", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by13 Photos\u201cIt\u2019s July in Maine,\u201d she said on a recent night, raising a sweaty glass of ros\u00e9. \u201cHow lucky are we?\u201dLocals in the dining room cheered; July meant long sunlit days with cherries and elderflowers, sweet snap peas and creamy new potatoes, small and misshapen as freshwater pearls.Ms. French talked through her menu, annotating it like a memoirist. The main course today was lamb, not because it was part of her plan, she explained cheerfully, but because the swordfish she had ordered never arrived, and the angry phone calls she made got her nowhere. So Ms. French did what she always did: She vaulted off the disaster toward something else, something she hadn\u2019t planned for.Dinner at the Lost Kitchen is an occasion, and most restaurants of its caliber work to maintain an illusion of effortless perfection. Ms. French, who is 36, has built a cult following with her own approach \u2014 open, intimate and personal.When reservations opened in April, Ms. French received thousands of phone calls requesting tables, clogging up the phone line and answering machine. The restaurant is open eight months of the year, and she filled the books from May right through to New Year\u2019s Eve in just one day.\u201cPeople told me I was crazy, that this restaurant would never work,\u201d she said.Despite its success, they still do. Smiling politely, Ms. French brushes off inquiries and advice from those who think her small restaurant in rural Maine should operate in a certain way.Has she considered staying open longer, on more days of the week, and serving breakfast, lunch and dinner? Couldn\u2019t the dining room squeeze in at least a dozen more seats? And wouldn\u2019t online confirmations be more efficient than a phone call from her mother?One man mailed Ms. French what he considered to be a better business plan, perhaps not realizing that she was already running her business exactly the way she liked.Most of Ms. French\u2019s cooks and servers are close friends, and all of them are women, something of a rarity in the industry. Rarer still, many of them are also farmers, growers of heirloom tomatoes and organic blueberries, who are working second jobs at the restaurant.The team thrives without the stereotypes associated with high-pressure kitchens, and important decisions are made as a group, like the one to pay cooks and servers more equally, and pool tips.Freedom has Prohibition-era laws that ban alcohol sales in restaurants, so Ms. French\u2019s mother, Deanna Richardson, manages a wine shop downstairs where people can buy bottles on their way to the dining room. She also greets people as they come in, wearing a slate gray linen apron, her hair in a low crown roll.In the open kitchen upstairs, Ms. French says a quick hello before sliding into the rhythm of service with her two cooks, plating fried green tomatoes with buttermilk and flowering herbs, pouring chilled squash soup over lemony garlic scape pesto, searing dozens of steaks on cast-iron spitting with hot fat.A giddy diner approaches with a copy of Ms. French\u2019s cookbook. \u201cErin, would you sign it?\u201d Ms. French grew up in Freedom and never expected her hometown of fewer than 1,000 to become a food destination. As a teenager, she played soccer, listened to Bj\u00f6rk and flipped burgers at her family\u2019s diner.She worked in catering later on, and in bars, and in her early 20s, she got into baking. With her newborn son, Jaim, strapped in the carrier on her chest, Ms. French rolled dough for pecan pies and creamed butter for carrot cakes. She delivered the orders as he slept in the car seat.Ms. French looked into culinary school but was put off by the expense. Instead, she cooked more at home, and more ambitiously. She married and started a supper club out of her apartment in nearby Belfast.She called it the Lost Kitchen, and tinkered there with the earliest drafts of her precise, straightforward cooking, often embellished with edible flowers and shallots macerated in vinegar. Ms. French reconfigured a classic salade ni\u00e7oise into a dish that made sense in Maine, serving halibut browned in butter with a runny poached egg and a warm vegetable salad. And she pur\u00e9ed local vegetables with fresh buttermilk and lemon juice to make soups with beautifully controlled acidity.She used few ingredients to build each dish, and worked simply, without special equipment, taking service cues from both fine dining and dinner parties at friends\u2019 homes.Ms. French soon opened a restaurant of the same name downstairs. But just as she was finding success, her marriage was coming apart.\u201cIf you want to find where all the cracks are in your relationship, open a restaurant,\u201d she said, \u201cthen watch it implode.\u201dThe stress took a toll on her mental health. Suffering from anxiety and depression, she became addicted to the pills prescribed to help her manage. Ms. French went to rehab to get clean, and she did. Two weeks later, when she returned home to Belfast, the fallout from her divorce took her by surprise: The locks were changed, her staff was fired and her restaurant was closed. It was no longer hers.\u201cJust like that,\u201d she said, \u201cI lost everything.\u201dMs. French moved into an Airstream trailer, which she still occasionally refers to as the divorcemobile, and parked it for a while in her parents\u2019 yard. She was paralyzed by a sense of failure, misery and rage, but only temporarily.When Ms. French was a little girl, she had been warned to stay away from the grist mill in Freedom. It was dilapidated, streaked with spray paint, littered with decades of bloated trash. It seemed as if it might fall apart at any moment.But the mill was restored to splendor by a new owner, just as Ms. French was ready for her own second chance. She built the Lost Kitchen inside it, and when she opened, in the summer of 2014, many of the cooks and servers who had worked with her in Belfast were ready to come back, too.\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain it,\u201d Ms. French said, \u201cbut this place is our fuel.\u201dOne of Ms. French\u2019s defining qualities as a chef is the immediacy with which she responds to change \u2014 an immediacy she brings to her menus each day.The elder tree behind the mill is in full, fierce bloom for just one week in July. The moment Ms. French spots the elderflowers from the dining room window, she hops the fence by the footbridge, climbs down the rocks and snips as many as she can carry.She batters and fries the blossoms into sweet, spindly fritters, dusted with powdered sugar. Or she infuses them in syrup to pour over warm lemon cakes. She serves the cake in thick slices with softly whipped cream, semifreddo and cherries from Ms. Flynn\u2019s trees, drizzled with honey. After dessert, people totter out, and a few stop by to hug Ms. French as they say good night.When all of the tables are clear, Ms. French heads home to an old farmhouse a mile from the mill, where she lives along with 14 chickens and a dog named Penny. Jaim, now a teenager, splits his time between his parents, and when he\u2019s staying with Ms. French, they hike together behind the house to swim in the trout pond, and build fires in a stone-lined pit on the lawn, where they chat until they\u2019re dry.On her way back to work in the morning, Ms. French usually lets the chickens out to feast on the buffet of insects. But on the next day, she spotted a hawk in the sky. Though Ms. French couldn\u2019t be sure it was hunting, she\u2019d already lost a few birds to predators and thought about keeping them inside, safe from danger.She quickly reconsidered. There was no such thing as being safe from danger, not really. And staying inside? That was no way to live.\u201cGood morning, girls,\u201d said Ms. French, pushing the cover off the coop door. \u201cBe careful out there, O.K.? Be careful, but go, go, go!\u201dAnd to Drink ...A caption in an earlier version of the slide show accompanying this article misspelled the surname of one of the cooks at the Lost Kitchen.

{"Headline": "Two Men Arrested in Connection With Charlottesville Violence", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe arrests came two weeks after the Aug. 12 rally, which brought hundreds of white supremacists to Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general. The day was marked by skirmishes between demonstrators and counterprotesters, and a 32-year-old woman, Heather D. Heyer, was struck and killed by a car in what the authorities have called a terrorist attack.The beating victim, DeAndre Harris, 20, was cornered in a parking garage just yards from Police Headquarters, where he was attacked by six men who had gathered for the rally. Mr. Harris has a broken wrist and sustained a head injury that required 10 staples, his lawyer, S. Lee Merritt, said.\u201cFor DeAndre and his family, news of the arrest of one of the six men that assaulted him comes five suspects short and 14 days too late,\u201d Mr. Merritt said Saturday. \u201cGiven that these men were identified by a journalist almost immediately, it appears that law enforcement sat on its hands for a couple of weeks before deciding they probably should arrest someone.\u201dMr. Merritt said the suspects were identified as a result of efforts by Shaun King, an activist and a columnist at The Daily News in New York, who issued a $10,000 reward for information that led to arrests.According to Mr. Merritt, Mr. Ramos\u2019s friends identified him after he posted about the attack on Facebook, saying that as a Puerto Rican man he disavowed white supremacy but participated in the rally because he despises leftists.

{"Headline": "Vietnamese Abduction Suspect Is Extradited to Germany", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe man, identified only as Long N.H., 46, was arrested in the Czech Republic on Aug. 12 and returned to Berlin, German federal prosecutors said on Thursday. His extradition, carried out on Wednesday, came three weeks after the executive, Trinh Xuan Thanh, was returned to Vietnam.Mr. Thanh, 51, fled Vietnam last year amid accusations of economic mismanagement, and sought political asylum in Germany. But on July 23, a day before his case was set to be heard, Long N.H. dragged Mr. Thanh and a companion from a Berlin street into a Volkswagen van he had rented in Prague a few days earlier, German prosecutors said.Mr. Thanh was later taken \u201cagainst his will\u201d to Vietnam and placed in state custody, in an episode that has strained diplomatic relations between the two countries and led to the expulsion of Vietnam\u2019s top intelligence official in Germany, the prosecutors said.Long N.H. is formally under investigation for unlawful foreign intelligence activity and being an accessory to deprivation of liberty, prosecutors said.Mr. Thanh was dismissed from Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly last year and accused of economic mismanagement as chairman of PetroVietnam Construction that resulted in losses of about $145 million for the company, a subsidiary of the state-owned oil giant PetroVietnam. He had also been a senior official in the southern province of Hau Giang.Separately, Germany\u2019s Office for Migration and Refugees said it had suspended one of its employees pending an inquiry into whether he had provided tips to the Vietnamese authorities about Mr. Thanh\u2019s presence in Germany. The move came after provocative statements about the executive were discovered on the employee\u2019s Facebook page. The posts were first reported last week by the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.In one example from October cited by the newspaper, the employee had questioned what would happen if the \u201ccriminal\u201d Mr. Thanh happened to be discovered in Germany.This month, Mr. Thanh was shown on state-run television in Vietnam saying that he had come back to the country after encouragement from his family and friends \u201cto seek the forgiveness of the party, the government and the law,\u201d referring to the governing Communist Party.It was not clear whether his statement was sincere or coerced.Before his return, the authorities in Vietnam had submitted a request for Mr. Thanh\u2019s extradition from Germany.Officials in Germany had not made a ruling on the request by the time of the suspected abduction, but said they strongly believed that Vietnamese diplomats and intelligence agents had been involved in the kidnapping. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Martin Sch\u00e4fer, said after the episode that Germany reserved the right to take further action at \u201ca political, economic and development policy level.\u201dVietnam\u2019s Foreign Ministry replied that it found Germany\u2019s statement \u201cvery regrettable.\u201dGerman federal prosecutors on Aug. 10 took over the investigation into Mr. Thanh\u2019s abduction from the authorities in Berlin. The next day, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Long N.H.Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been fraught in recent years, primarily because of Germany\u2019s criticism of Vietnam\u2019s human rights record. The countries, however, also share a cultural connection: Many Vietnamese lived and worked in East Germany before the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and about 20,000 people of Vietnamese origin now live in Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weaning Itself From Elephant Ivory, China Turns to Mammoths", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNANJING, China \u2014 Environmentalists worried about the fate of Africa\u2019s dwindling elephant population cheered when China announced a ban on the sale of commercial ivory last year, but an increasingly popular substitute is raising concerns of its own.To sustain a carving and collecting tradition that is centuries old, many Chinese artisans have turned not to ivory from elephants but from the tusks of extinct mammoths harvested from an unlikely place: the melting permafrost of Russia\u2019s Arctic.\u201cIf we can get more, we can make more,\u201d said Wu Xinghua, an owner of Jin Sha Mammoth, which operates five workshops and two galleries around China that produce and sell jewelry, pendants and other intricately carved figures.No one can be sure how much mammoth ivory remains to be unearthed, but as a fossil, it is limited in supply and will one day dry up. For now, some say it is the best hope for preserving the heritage.\u201cAs long as there is a legal trade in mammoth, ivory of all kinds can be laundered into it,\u201d said Mark Jones, associate director for policy for the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife conservation organization based in London.Mr. Wu travels each summer to Yakutsk, a provincial capital in Siberia, to buy ivory from a man, he said vaguely, who had connections with Russia\u2019s military, though he clears his purchases through customs in each country.Ivory\u2019s place in Chinese culture and history will make the trade difficult to squelch entirely. And many here say the craftsmanship involved should be preserved. Prized as \u201cwhite gold,\u201d ivory has for centuries been considered a symbol of prestige and, as a gift, of honor. It is also an object of veneration and even considered a source of healing. For all those reasons, China long resisted restrictions on ivory.When the United Nations-backed Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species banned the sale of elephant ivory, with some exceptions, in 1990, China was given an extra year to comply. In 2008, when the convention allowed a controversial auction of ivory stockpiles amid signs that the herds in Africa were recovering somewhat, China bought 68 tons, while Japan bought nearly 42. That is, officially, China\u2019s only stockpile, and it is dwindling as the ivory is auctioned to factories.Under growing pressure because of the slaughter, China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, pledged to impose a ban in 2015 during a meeting with President Barack Obama. Last December, the government detailed the plan for phasing one in, and since then has seemed serious about enforcing it.In March the State Forestry Administration, which oversees the trade, ordered 67 factories and retailers to close. Zhang Dehui, the agency\u2019s director for wildlife, said in an interview that another 27 factories and 78 stores would also have to close by Dec. 31. The police have also been cracking down. Last month, they seized 3,185 ivory items being sold by unlicensed vendors in a market in Beijing\u2019s Chaoyang District.The ban has nonetheless thrown the market into upheaval. In Nanjing, a city of eight million on the lower Yangtze, six of seven retailers closed with the first wave in March. The last one open is the Nanjing Arts & Crafts General Company, a state-run gallery exhibiting all manner of crafts, though for the moment ivory holds center stage in the store\u2019s glass displays.Signs hanging around the store offered 68 percent discounts on virtually all of the roughly 10,000 pieces the store manager, Liu Zhengyu, has to sell before the end of the year. Chopsticks, amulets, bracelets, pendants, even a showpiece, an intricately carved dragon boat that previously cost $225,000 \u2013 everything must go.Mr. Liu said that his store would survive by selling other crafts, but holding an intricately carved ivory sphere containing 21 increasingly smaller, free-moving spheres inside it, he lamented what would be lost with the ban. \u201cA lot of people will stop doing this,\u201d he said.Among those who have is Dai Deyu, a carver from Nanjing whose work once sold in the store. He followed his grandfather and two older brothers into the craft, beginning as an apprentice when the Cultural Revolution ended. Now 54, Mr. Dai stopped carving elephant ivory last year. And while he has tried his hand at mammoth ivory, it is not the same, he said. \u201cIvory carving is, after all, an intangible part of cultural heritage,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s a very smooth transition from elephant to mammoth,\u201d one carver, Zheng Kaiwen, said. Since finishing art school in 2007, he has worked only with mammoth, never elephant, he said, adding that he chose it over other materials, like jade, because it \u201cis more expressive.\u201d\u201cThis tradition has been inherited for so many years,\u201d he said, \u201cit is not going to disappear.\u201dFollow Steven Lee Myers on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at @stevenleemyersOwen Guo, Zoe Mou and Yang Xiong contributed researchAdvertisement"}

Find a partner. Raise some chicks. Zoom to the top of your field. Check each box by 50.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly half of long-term unemployed people in the 55- to 64-year-old age bracket are women.Hey, I\u2019ve been there. I loved going to an office, where satisfaction was wrapped in camaraderie garnished by a salary, health care, paid vacation and sick days I never used. In my mid-50s I was shown the door. Opportunities came along, far from my home. I held out for a situation that did not involve relocation while I watched my industry \u2014 magazine publishing \u2014 start to disappear as if it were written in vanishing ink. Remaining jobs went to editors with three years of experience, not 33.Which is why I joined the gig economy. For the past decade I\u2019ve worked hard, hoping to write books as long as editors and readers will buy them. My second act has gone well, perhaps because I report to a taskmaster: me. I\u2019ve also been lucky, and for that I\u2019m grateful, but self-employment is hardly an option for everyone, nor does it offer any benefits beyond the chance to work in dollar-store leggings while Facebook \u201clikes\u201d replace human contact.Recently I celebrated my aunt\u2019s 100th birthday. Whoa, is Ruth sharp. Manages her finances. Follows politics. Remembers everything, including that in 1984 I failed to thank her when she cared for my Alzheimer\u2019s-afflicted mother so that her brother \u2014 my dad \u2014 could visit me. Mea culpa, Aunt Ruth.Ruth explained how she and her husband grew a tiny North Dakota shop into a mini-Tiffany\u2019s, taking afternoons off for bridge, to which she credits her mental muscle. How the couple got wind of a 55-plus community sprouting in Arizona. How after prairie winters, Sun City was Nirvana.It\u2019s 45 years since Ruth retired. That\u2019s a heap of bridge. As I toasted her, my mind wandered: If I knew I had 45 lucid years left, what would I do?Nor would social sports make my cut. My eye-hand coordination ends with typing. If forced to live among a tribe of friends, based on their ability to team up to play tennis, I\u2019d organize a book club.The one-two punch of my agenda: I\u2019ll decide when I \u201cretire,\u201d along with when I become \u201cold.\u201d If I want to rock long hair into my 90s, I will. Likewise for hanging with friends half my age. I\u2019ll study history, take up painting and in the company of my husband \u2014 who in my eyes will always be a shaggy sophomore \u2014 go dancing and see every art-house film and as many plays as we can afford. (Damn you, Broadway, for tickets that cost what we paid for our first car.) We\u2019ll travel because I don\u2019t want to be the last American to visit Reykjavik. I\u2019ll take my grandchildren to museums, throw parties and get out the vote, lest my life be one big orgy of me time.But all of this needs to fit around my nonretirement retirement: work. Some sidelined women can afford to be ladies of leisure and happily fulfill conventional expectations, finding joy at gardening clubs and golf courses. The rest of us? Hello, darkness, my old friend. Got Lexapro? The old saw goes that on a deathbed nobody wishes they\u2019d spent more time at the office, but I suspect many women, whose careers stop prematurely, do. Work is where we get our superpowers and not incidentally, our income. How else will we afford a ticket to Iceland?But women can\u2019t just imagine change. They need to speak up about this issue, just as female managers should think about hiring women the age of their mother. Today\u2019s 30- and 40-somethings can\u2019t \u201clean in\u201d forever. If they don\u2019t address embedded ageism, they\u2019ll blink, pass 50, and possibly see their success evaporate faster than a boss can say, \u201cSorry, we\u2019re going in another direction.\u201d A younger direction.An opinion essay last week about older women in the work force misstated a statistic about 55-to 64-year-old women who are looking for work. Nearly half of the long-term unemployed in that age bracket are women; it is not the case that half of women in that age bracket are among the long-term unemployed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Political Donors Put Their Money Where the Memes Are", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftImagine you\u2019re a millionaire or billionaire with strong political views and a desire to spread those views to the masses. Do you start a think tank in Washington? Funnel millions to a shadowy \u201csuper PAC\u201d? Bankroll the campaign of an up-and-coming politician?For a growing number of deep-pocketed political donors, the answer is much more contemporary: Invest in internet virality.As TV, radio and newspapers give way to the megaphonic power of social media, today\u2019s donor class is throwing its weight behind a new group of partisan organizations that specialize in creating catchy, highly shareable messages for Facebook, Twitter and other social platforms. Viral media expertise is emerging as a crucial skill for political operatives, and as donors look to replicate the success of the social media sloganeers who helped lift President Trump to victory, they\u2019re seeking out talented meme makers.Stand Up America, a new progressive outfit run by Sean Eldridge, the husband of the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, is emblematic of the union between big-money donors and social media organizing. Mr. Eldridge, who unsuccessfully ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2014, started a Facebook page in the week after Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, and began writing posts and linking to anti-Trump stories.\u201cThere was a ton of anger on the left and many progressives looking for something to do,\u201d Mr. Eldridge told me in an interview. \u201cParticularly on social media, the existing political media was pretty slow to respond.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve spent in the low six figures to reach, on average, 10 million people a week,\u201d he said.Donor excitement about social media organizing, he added, is a \u201cnatural evolution toward a skepticism of TV and paid media, where you can spend a lot of money very quickly and not be sure what you\u2019re getting for it.\u201dNimble America has since folded, according to a representative who responded to an email sent to the group.What distinguishes the current wave of donors is a focus on social media \u2014 Facebook in particular \u2014 and a willingness to fund newcomers without ties to the media establishment.John Sellers, a left-wing organizer and former Greenpeace activist, started a Facebook page called The Other 98% several years ago to promote his views on environmentalism, corporate greed and other progressive causes. The page has five million followers, and its nonprofit affiliate has received funding from donors including Open Society Foundations, a group backed by the progressive billionaire George Soros.Civic Ventures, an organization founded by the Seattle venture capitalist Nick Hanauer, has paid partnerships with several popular left-wing Facebook pages, including The Other 98% and Occupy Democrats.Zach Silk, the president of Civic Ventures, credited these pages with building support for some of the organization\u2019s key issues, including the \u201cFight for 15\u201d movement, in which fast-food workers advocated a higher minimum wage.\u201cThere\u2019s real soul-searching going on\u201d among donors, Mr. Silk said, \u201cand a real interest in finding these other mediums to communicate.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need a complicated website with hundreds of white papers,\u201d he added. \u201cYou need quick, memeable, shareable content.\u201dWhile some social publishers are structured as nonprofits, many are for-profit businesses that more closely resemble internet start-ups. Milo Inc., which has nearly 20 employees cranking out content for Mr. Yiannopoulos\u2019s 2.2 million Facebook fans, claims to have raised $12 million from a group of investors in order to \u201ccultivate an entire next generation\u201d of conservative internet personalities.Conservatives, it is generally acknowledged, have so far had the upper hand in the viral content wars. Mr. Trump spent many millions less than his opponents did on traditional TV advertising, but benefited from an army of amateur creators who flooded social media with pro-Trump messages.Donor funding is no guarantee of success for partisan publishers \u2014 as with all viral internet content, there are limits to what money can buy. But given the outcome of the presidential election, Democrats may have no other choice than to enter the meme wars.\u201cThis was the missing piece of the progressive infrastructure,\u201d said Jess McIntosh, Shareblue\u2019s executive editor, who worked as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s director of communications outreach during the 2016 campaign. \u201cEveryone understands that what gets shared online matters now.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the surname of the right-wing commentator behind Milo Inc.

{"Headline": "As Investigations Intensify, Israel Imagines Life After Netanyahu", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 A black curtain went up a few months ago near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s official residence on Jerusalem\u2019s leafy Balfour Street. It screened pesky protesters from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s view \u2014 and prevented the public from seeing lawyers and detectives come and go as criminal investigations of the prime minister intensified.For the past eight years, Mr. Netanyahu has dominated the Israeli political scene and become nearly synonymous with the state on the world stage. Long called \u201cthe magician\u201d for his survival skills, he has quashed rivals from right and left despite never enjoying particular popularity in the street.Yet Mr. Netanyahu, the longest-serving prime minister since Israel\u2019s first, David Ben-Gurion, suddenly appears not so invincible after all.\u201cAll the alliances, discussions and thinking about the day after have taken on much more significance,\u201d said Yoaz Hendel, the chairman of the Institute for Zionist Strategies, a right-leaning research group, and a former spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cFor the first time, people are thinking that Netanyahu won\u2019t be the prime minister next time around, whether elections take place in a few months\u2019 time or a year and a half.\u201dMr. Netanyahu has fought off swirling scandals for much of his public life, but experts say that Friday\u2019s signing of a state\u2019s witness agreement by Ari Harow, who served as Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff and directed his 2015 re-election campaign, could be a game changer.Mr. Harow was offered a light sentence in an unrelated matter in return for information about Mr. Netanyahu in what the police have called Case 1000 and Case 2000.The police came across recordings of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s talks with the newspaper while searching Mr. Harow\u2019s belongings, the Israeli news media has reported.Mr. Hendel, who worked in the prime minister\u2019s office during the first of Mr. Harow\u2019s two stints there, said Mr. Harow worked in the \u201cvery broad, gray area\u201d between Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s personal, familial and national obligations.He added, \u201cSomeone like Ari would see it all.\u201dMr. Netanyahu has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and on Tuesday he made a statement about terrorism after a hospital visit to the victim of a recent attack, with no mention of the criminal investigations. He and his office have repeatedly lashed out at the news media and his critics, asserting that the focus on the investigations is meant to topple him under the weight of baseless accusations, rather than at the ballot box.There is, as yet, no clear contender to replace Mr. Netanyahu, who is serving his third consecutive term and fourth over all. An Israel without Mr. Netanyahu at the helm would, in any case, be an unfamiliar place for its inhabitants, the Middle East and the world.Mr. Netanyahu has had abrasive relationships with some international leaders, including President Barack Obama, particularly over his championing of settlement expansion and his efforts to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear program. President Trump\u2019s victory came as a great relief to Mr. Netanyahu and his coalition \u2014 the most right wing in Israel\u2019s history \u2014 alleviating the pressure from Washington.In May, Mr. Trump paid a bonding visit to Israel. But Mr. Netanyahu has not been given totally free rein on settlement building, and Mr. Trump\u2019s election promise of moving the United States Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv remains unfulfilled.Mr. Netanyahu has also built strong alliances with other leaders, including President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, and has expanded Israel\u2019s global reach based on its prowess in intelligence, counterterrorism and technology.His tenure has been one of impasse in the Palestinian peace process. But inside Israel, he is credited with having maintained stability as Arab neighbors descended into chaos. A departure would leave Israel, its allies and its enemies in uncharted terrain.It could take many months for Mr. Harow\u2019s information to be substantiated. Any police recommendation for an indictment would have to be approved by the state prosecutor and attorney general; there is no precedent in Israel for a sitting prime minister to be charged.But one or more of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s coalition partners may bolt before that to protect their own reputations. There are already some signs of unease from within his own Likud Party.On Friday, when Mr. Harow signed his deal, the anchor of Israeli public radio\u2019s noon news program said that the only one of Likud\u2019s 30 Parliament members willing to discuss the case was David Amsalem, a novice elected in 2015.A Likud rally in support of Mr. Netanyahu is scheduled for Wednesday evening.Late Monday, Israeli news outlets reported that the attorney general would soon announce charges against Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, on accusations that public funds were misused in the family residences. And, responding to a journalist\u2019s freedom of information request, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court has given Mr. Netanyahu two weeks to disclose the call logs of his conversations with executives of Israel Hayom, a newspaper widely considered to have been established to support him.Yehuda Ben Meir, an expert in national security and public opinion at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that recent political polls showed \u201ca degree of erosion in the support\u201d for Mr. Netanyahu, but that \u201cthere are no indicators at this moment that his position has been dealt a fatal blow.\u201dMr. Netanyahu\u2019s durability can be attributed at least in part to the fractured field of potential rivals.Naftali Bennett, leader of the far right Jewish Home party, and Avigdor Lieberman, of the nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, would like to contend for the premiership but have relatively small parties that make it difficult.The Likud has several people jostling for the top spot, including Yisrael Katz, the minister of transportation and intelligence affairs; Gilad Erdan, the minister of public security; and Gideon Saar, a former education minister who recently returned to public life.Dahlia Scheindlin, a political analyst, said all the chatter was not so different from what she heard before the election two years ago. \u201cThen, too, people were complaining that Bibi had been in for too long, that it was time for change,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname. \u201cBut in the same breath they would say, \u2018But there\u2019s nobody else.\u2019 It\u2019s the same thing now.\u201dGadi Wolfsfeld, a professor of political communications at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said, however, \u201cAt some point, people in his party are going to say enough is enough.\u201dThe notion that there is nobody to replace Mr. Netanyahu holds \u201cuntil it happens,\u201d Professor Wolfsfeld said. \u201cThey said nobody could replace Ben-Gurion.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Godello, a Case Study in the Character of Wine", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolNo wine can be said to possess an innate character. How a wine ultimately evolves depends on a balance of place, grape, grower and producer.This is not to say all Chambolle wines will taste the same, even those that come from the same particular vineyard. The vintage characteristics and the stylistic inclinations of each producer will always influence the outcome, and the wines will vary accordingly. But they will often have some genetic resemblance, some family characteristic that, no matter how pronounced or reticent, states, \u201cThis is Chambolle-Musigny.\u201dWines like godello offer wonderful opportunities for exploration, both external and internal. Learning about new wines adds to our understanding of the marketplace and what sorts of flavors are available to us. But wines like godello are also especially interesting because a convention for how it ought to taste has yet to be written. This allows a freer hand for winemakers to experiment with the grape and for consumers to measure their own reactions, as no standard text for godello yet exists.In retrospect, maybe this wasn\u2019t the wisest question as it compelled readers to discuss the godellos in terms of other wines. But the answers were intriguing.It doesn\u2019t sound particularly appetizing, but contact with lees can be beneficial to a wine, particularly to whites. It can contribute to a wine\u2019s flavor, make the texture more interesting and add to its ability to withstand the effects of air. These effects can be enhanced by stirring the lees periodically, though they can also be overdone, resulting in an overly rich wine that is paradoxically prone to oxidation.With each of the wines I mentioned \u2014 Champagne, Muscadet and white Burgundy (particularly from the C\u00f4te de Beaune region) \u2014 contact with lees is an essential step in making the wine.How is the influence of the lees felt in the wine? Partly, it\u2019s in the richness of the textures. Unlike leaner wines, which can have a flatness to them, these wines feel more dimensional. I have the sensation of being able to explore the folds and creases of the wines as I roll them around in my mouth. They also each had a mild, underlying minerality, which can be augmented by contact with lees.Beyond that, the Gu\u00edmaro had a sort of smokiness to it, which could be mistaken for barrel aging, except that none of these wines spent time in wood. Nothing is wrong with barrel aging. Each of these producers also makes a godello aged in barrels, and those bottles would be delicious, I\u2019m sure, though more expensive and harder to find. The three bottles we looked at this month were aged solely in steel tanks, which amplified their fruitiness.I sensed tropical fruit aromas and flavors in each of them, as well as a floral quality. The Gu\u00edmaro seemed the most exotic, while the Coroa had a peachiness, as well as some herbal flavors. The Valdesil was the most subtle of the three, I thought, with an attractive bitterness as a lasting reminder of the wine.All told, these wines offered a lot to like, but maybe not yet enough to love. Most readers seemed to feel as if these wines were a decent first date. Not swooning material, maybe, but pleasant enough.That, I submit, can be high praise for a wine. I\u2019ve had that experience, particularly with young white Burgundies, where I taste and taste, but I cannot quite grasp the core of the wine. And because I am so eager to figure it out, the wine keeps bringing me back.Is the mystery of godello gripping enough to keep tasting?Enough is there to warrant regularly checking in, though, as Ferguson put it, you may not want to buy it by the case.It does seem as if the godello experimentation is settling down. Having tried enough of them over the years now, I think we can safely assume that basic godello wines like these will be rich, textured and floral, with a spine of minerality and lively acidity.While they may now remind us of many other white wines, perhaps we\u2019ll come to recognize this specific combination of elements as distinctively godello.Advertisement"}

The cultural memory of this Nazi violence shapes modern Germany\u2019s view of itself and its role in the world.A 41-year-old American who gave the salute in a bar in Dresden on Saturday is under investigation for his actions, the police there said. The man, who was not identified in keeping with German privacy law, suffered light injuries in a scuffle that followed his gesture, the police said. His assailant could also face charges.In London, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said the British government condemned \u201cracism, hatred and violence\u201d and singled out the far right for specific criticism.

Thursday was a \u201ccraft jam\u201d \u2014 terra cotta pot painting amplified by ros\u00e9 and salty snacks \u2014 at Node in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn. A few weeks earlier, I had made a terrarium at Jersey City Urby \u2014 bromeliads, plastic critters and rum punch, with the Marshall Tucker Band on the Sonos \u2014 and joined a bar crawl through the Lower East Side with a group from Quarters, open since mid-June on Grand Street. I slept in an adorable plywood cubby on Wall Street and on the 68th floor of the tallest residential building in Jersey City, in a flashy model apartment from which you could see all the way up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge, a view so vertiginous I dropped to my knees and crawled into bed on my elbows, special-ops-style. (Happily, at such a height, there were no neighbors to see me do so.)These were some of my adventures in co-living, a housing model that draws inspiration from the single-gender residence hotels of the early 20th century and postwar intentional communities, along with modern co-working spaces and hacker hostels.Using architecture, design and so-called community programming (craft jams and bar crawls, say) co-living aims to push people together. It\u2019s housing buoyed by and addressing a collision of attendant themes: the sharing economy and a yearning for connection, social and professional, among overworked millennials and a work force that\u2019s increasingly freelance.15 PhotosEventually, Mr. Fix added 25 Brooklyn apartments to his Pure House portfolio. He recalled organizing dinner parties and morning raves, weekend jaunts to upstate New York and Burning Man, and the overall emotional cost of being a mentor to 65 people, some of whom fell in love, went traveling and started new businesses, he added \u2014 juicy alliances he is proud to have overseen.In the sky-lighted mailroom, bright blue metal mailboxes look like mini high school lockers; above, ferns and vines erupt from canvas bags. Though Jersey City Urby, like its sister property on Staten Island, is not quite co-living \u2014 it is, essentially, a conventional apartment building with 762 units that rent with conventional leases \u2014 its community features are right out of the co-living playbook. (Rents start at $2,500 for a studio.)You won\u2019t find much of that outside the building, which is why this Urby is essentially a vertical \u2014 and interior \u2014 neighborhood. Though the place is 85 percent rented, I was terrified alone in my posh, helicopter-high apartment, missing the street, empty though it was, far, far below. And I marveled at the stamina of my fellow terrarium-creators, who after a long day at their nonprofits and their finance and tech companies could still muster conversation and fine handiwork.Four attendees appeared at poolside yoga early the next morning, seemingly fast friends, chatting and cheerful in their downward dogs. (In my own faraway youth, after 18 hours or more at work on the equivalent, then, of a start-up \u2014 a poorly funded local print product \u2014 I could do no more than fill a plastic tray with sesame chicken at the Vietnamese salad bar on Bleecker Street and shuffle home, alone, with a beer.)Up on the roof (squashy canvas beanbags), we could see a gaggle of yoga practitioners who swayed and dipped a few buildings away. \u201cIs this \u2018The Matrix\u2019?\u201d Ms. Evans wondered, before clapping her hands and gathering up the group. \u201cShould we say hello to our future selves?\u201d\u201cThat just meant that we weren\u2019t making out, though we were seeing each other every day,\u201d he said. Regular apartment life is boring, he continued, but there are challenges to co-living. \u201cPeople getting drunk and hooking up, there\u2019s more potential for drama to happen. And in a normal apartment you don\u2019t have 30 people who know what\u2019s going on in your relationship. If we have a fight,\u201d he said of Ms. Zhao, \u201ceverybody wants to know what it\u2019s about.\u201d\u201cScooby, scooby, guys,\u201d said Ms. Evans, \u201ccome along!\u201d It was time for the next port, the bistro Dirty French across the street, followed by one more: Max Fish, the beloved, art-inflected 1990s-era hangout on Ludlow Street that closed there in 2013 and reopened a year later on Orchard. I decided to skip that stop. I\u2019d been there before, after all.I liked my cubby bed, but apartments tucked into office buildings can be grim, despite the ferry terminal outside this one, the literary embellishments and the free coffee.Floors are organized into \u201cneighborhoods,\u201d with open staircases and unifying decorative schemes. There\u2019s a B.Y.O. whiskey bar, a library, and common kitchens are stocked with coffee and fruit water. The laundry room has a pool table. You can buy snacks there with the WeLive app, which also alerts you to group events, like family dinners, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d nights or kickboxing classes. It\u2019s all a bit bro-themed: On a blackboard panel were chalked the words \u201cDo You Have Ur Keys.\u201dBut there were women at family dinner that night, like Kimberly Cockrell, 37, newly arrived from Miami for a job in the shipping industry, and delighted, she said, to be rid of her three-bedroom house. The free wine and food was nice, too. \u201cI don\u2019t even have a broom here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels pretty great not to have to cut the grass.\u201dBlaine Ford, WeLive\u2019s community manager, said he encourages tenants to not join the WeWork offices in the building, but pick a location that\u2019s at least a few blocks away. \u201cIt\u2019s good for people to have a bit of a commute,\u201d he said, \u201cand just go outside.\u201dOn a scruffy block on Eldert Street in Bushwick, a renovated brick townhouse built around 1900 gleamed like a showplace in Brooklyn Heights. Inside, a parlor room was swathed in Brooklyn toile; there were vintage photographs of the neighborhood, and on the shelves, the requisite board games and other accouterments of the internet-weary.The apartments, fully furnished in a gender-neutral, post-West Elm manner, have plump blue Smeg refrigerators in their open-shelved galley kitchens. The backyard is propped with Brimfield finds \u2014 seats made from rusty milk cans, vintage signs \u2014 and above, a web of industrial light bulbs.I observed the impressive efforts of Peter and Gena Cuba, both 33 and graphic designers originally from the Midwest. They had moved to Node from Brooklyn Heights, as it happened, because they felt that the comforts of that neighborhood had become a trap. Ms. Cuba also had a hankering for a bathtub.

Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for \u2014 the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix\u2019s singular sense of innovation. The future of Shondaland at Netflix has limitless possibilities.\u201dThe deal was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Ms. Rhimes has been with ABC for more than a decade and has long been one of that network\u2019s biggest names. She\u2019s been a reliable generator of hits, including building an entire Thursday-night lineup that ABC\u2019s marketing department has dubbed #TGIT.Ms. Rhimes\u2019s development slate at ABC will not suddenly vaporize. In addition to keeping its Thursday lineup for the coming season, ABC still has a midseason show that is expected from Ms. Rhimes, \u201cFor the People,\u201d and a \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff that is in preproduction, among some other projects in development.Nevertheless, losing her is enormous for ABC and its corporate parent, Disney. The network finished in last place among the advertiser-coveted demographic for a second straight season, and though it is doing fine with comedies, it badly needs a hit drama. This fall, ABC is pinning its hopes on revivals, including \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cRoseanne,\u201d to help improve its standing in the ratings.In a statement, ABC\u2019s entertainment president, Channing Dungey, said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked-about shows on television. With the launch of a new season upon us, fans can rest assured that TGIT remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever.\u201dFor Netflix, this is more of the same.

The Four Seasons was a mess. The beaded curtain chains that rippled upward for 20 feet in endless waves like a waterfall running in reverse were coming apart, some of them missing or broken or lying on the floor like dead snakes. The bronze-rod Richard Lippold sculpture that hangs in midair over the towers of whiskey and gin bottles inside the square bar was furry with dust.A dinner I had in 2013 was a disaster, from the stale rolls to the zombified service to the dry and crumbly duck served with fruit compote that tasted like the filling in a grocery-store pie. It goes without saying that all this cost a pile of money.The Grill is confident, theatrical, retro, unsentimental, sharp and New Yorky. Like other projects from Major Food Group, it is packed with ideas and historical allusions. Unpacking it all is a lot of fun if you can afford it; preposterous expense is one reality of the old restaurant that the new tenants preserved.All that is in sharp focus again now that it\u2019s holding a restaurant with a full battery charge. The beads have been strung back together. Lippold\u2019s bronze glints again. The book-matched French walnut paneling is glossier and more radiant, the patterns in the grain more evocative of monumental abstract paintings, than before.Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick prepare for their restaurants the way Matthew Weiner or David Simon get ready for a new show, with a mountain of research. Taking over a high point of midcentury modernism gave them license to study James Beard, rolling trolleys, Jacqueline Kennedy, the martini, John Cage, club sandwiches, Joe Baum, continental cuisine, Delmonico\u2019s, green goddess dressing, Craig Claiborne and Catalina sauce.Some dish names are cryptic, as if written to invite a question the servers can answer with a story. The one about \u201cJack\u2019s Pie\u201d involves John F. Kennedy and comes in two parts. The second is a dubious dirty joke about Marilyn Monroe.This postmodern approach to modernism leads to some self-conscious nonsense. Next to the staircase is a buffet table set with a surreal cornucopia of vegetables, fruits and layer cakes. It\u2019s stunning to look at but it\u2019s purely decorative \u2014 \u201ca buffet in name only,\u201d the servers have to explain.Dinner sees a traffic jam of rolling carts parked tableside for various bits of stage business, some of which are pointless. Peach Melba doesn\u2019t get better when you set it on fire, and when a server painstakingly removes a pastry seal on a cocotte to reveal two pieces of endive, you have to wonder if Mr. Carbone hasn\u2019t lost his mind.But any doubts about his sanity vanish when you taste the spectacularly good guinea hen that the endive accompanies. Roasted and sauced with jus, Madeira and black truffles, it is among the most delicious things I\u2019ve eaten this year.So is the Seagram crab cake, very sweet and pure under a golden lid of potato coins.So is the prime rib, carved thick or thin at your elbow \u2014 this time, the ritual makes sense \u2014 and set in front of you along with a meaty barbecued bone in a dark mustard and spice crust.So are the lamb chops, brushed with curry oil and grilled, with yogurt sauce and a fantastic molded cone of apple-mint jelly.So is the honey-mustard duck breast, dry aged for a month until it is supernaturally tender.So is the larded squab in bittersweet orange sauce with a grilled candied orange; the lard is provided by a cloak of whipped fat that bathes the squab breast as it cooks.So is the slice of lemon chiffon cake confected by Jennifer Yee, who is serving as pastry chef until the restaurant is on solid footing. Perfectly tender and fluffy and just sweet enough, it is the kind of dessert that has almost disappeared from New York restaurants, and deserves to come back.I\u2019ll be thinking about those dishes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. At least half a dozen others are merely very, very good: the gently spicy salad called avocado crab Louis; the anchovy-laced steak tartare that finishes with a surprising riptide of chile heat; the broodingly dark crab gumbo; the \u201cNeptune\u2019s crown\u201d Dover sole under a Creole shellfish sauce; the hot pretzel twists and the griddled anadama bread and the nearly weightless dinner rolls brushed with butter that come around at the start of the meal.For all of this you pay prices that range from \u201cWow\u201d to \u201cAre you guys serious?\u201d The reassembled lobster Newburg (or Newberg, as the menu has it), in a reduced-fat sauce outfitted with dried cherry tomatoes and basil leaves, is marked \u201cMP\u201d on the menu; it\u2019s $98, about five times what you\u2019d pay for a live lobster of the same size.At least it\u2019s memorable, which is more than can be said for the $25 jumble of smoked wild mushrooms held together by a wafer-thin one-egg \u201comelet,\u201d or the $38 chicken \u201c\u00e0 la Queen,\u201d which is like chicken cacciatore that\u2019s been fancied up.Balanced against a few lapses of taste and judgment, though, is the real achievement of Mr. Carbone and his partners in breathing new life into the formal, French-derived style of dining. This used to be the only style chefs thought was suitable for expensive restaurants. But then tasting counters came along; suddenly the rituals of captains standing at attention above white tablecloths seemed antiquated.Some of the things they\u2019ve been replaced by are very good. Others are reasonably apt. A few are painful. The chunky brass bar coasters marked with a big capital G are a Trumpian touch. So are the napkins with \u201cTHE GRILL\u201d embroidered in gold thread.But coasters and napkins can\u2019t cause lasting damage to an interior this extraordinary. It was always one of the most beautiful dining rooms in New York. Now it\u2019s also one of its most exciting restaurants.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTableAdvertisement"}

Between the pale blue hydrangea bushes of that storied neighborhood and the shoreline of the Inkwell, a historically African-American beach on the island, I met seasoned black Vineyarders whose screen doors swung open in time-honored hospitality.Many lifelong connections to Martha\u2019s Vineyard began in Dr. Harris\u2019s kitchen. The moments spent communing over brimming picnic baskets, and the salty-sweet smell of serenity, bring people back time and again.At least five generations of the African-American creative and professional classes have spent summer breaks on this island off Cape Cod, from 19th-century whaling captains to the filmmaker Spike Lee. Every August, Barack Obama and his family sign the imaginary visitor log and devour New England\u2019s casual pace, long bike rides and ice cream pit stops.An African-American resort area that\u2019s more than 125 years old, Oak Bluffs has earned its seat at history\u2019s table. Black families stay all over the island now, huddling over lobster rolls or fried clams from Chilmark to Edgartown, but that was not always the case. \u201cOak Bluffs,\u201d Dr. Harris said, \u201cwas the hub of the island\u2019s black life.\u201dThe fact is, strivers are responsible for making Oak Bluffs a destination: Formerly enslaved people, or their descendants, bought property around Baptist Temple Park in the early 20th century, drawn by the religious services held there. Teachers, politicians, lawyers, doctors, artists, musicians and entrepreneurs all arrived and flourished for decades afterward.This summer was my seventh on the island, and I was itching for a proper tour of the African-American Oak Bluffs.We reached a large round stone marked \u201cShearer,\u201d announcing the inn founded by Henrietta and Charles Shearer, who had attended the school now called Hampton University and then moved to Boston, where Charles was the headwaiter at the Parker House Hotel.The cottage was their summer home starting in 1903; accommodations were added in 1912, along with a dining room, where Parker House rolls were present at all meals. In the 1963 edition of Ebony magazine\u2019s vacation guide, the Shearer Cottage listing speaks of its fine foods.Inside the inn, the brightest minds congregated for breakfast at small tables covered over with pancakes, bacon, sausage, fish cakes, hominy. Or they might have made reservations for dinner, said Lee Jackson Van Allen, the current owner and innkeeper, and a great-granddaughter of Henrietta and Charles. The dining room closed in the 1970s, but in its day you\u2019d rub elbows there with African-American luminaries: the singer and composer Harry T. Burleigh, the entrepreneur and philanthropist Madam C. J. Walker, the actors and singers Paul Robeson and Ethel Waters.\u201cMy great-grandparents were born in Virginia, and the food was very much Southern: macaroni and cheese, peach cobbler and candied sweet potatoes,\u201d Ms. Van Allen said. \u201cEverything was always very fresh \u2014 they went to the market every day.\u201dDaylight was fading. To fully experience the Vineyard vibe, a barbecue or clambake invitation is needed. Sometimes, frying scup (better known as porgy) and lingering for hours at home happens, too.But Dr. Harris was hosting a porch party: a throwback Vineyard \u201cfive to seven,\u201d a post-sunbathing social that marks the beginning of dusk. Some say the two-hour function died out decades ago, but her dainty white linen napkins, stacked alongside antique dishes filled with local cheeses, said otherwise.I met Martha Mae Jones, an artist who has been coming to the island for more than 35 years. \u201cThere\u2019s something called Vineyard magic,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll always meet someone from across the country that is connected to you.\u201d Crisp bubbly wine flowed; new bonds were forged.After a week of up-island farm stand-hopping and West Tisbury farmers\u2019 market-shopping, I felt like a bona fide seasonal dweller. My gray shingled rental house had an outdoor drop-leaf table, and I arranged platters of herb-rubbed grilled tuna and Southern succotash. It was the inaugural visit for my Brooklyn and Atlanta friends. They arrived and asked, \u201cWhat makes the place so special?\u201d The recipe is a secret.cookingAdvertisement"}

In most iterations, a fifth ingredient is added: sliced boiled potato. Customarily, octopus cooked this way is served on wooden plates.When octopus isn\u2019t available, I reasoned, maybe lobster could be a worthy replacement. It has a firm texture, a briny sweetness and a satisfying meaty succulence. I have made substitutions with shrimp or squid on occasion, too. But, with lobsters on hand the other day, using them made perfect sense.Once I had the Spanish octopus dish in mind, however, there was no turning back. Gorgeous cherry tomatoes and ripe red bell peppers at the market also beckoned. I envisioned a composed salad, with all the elements woven together and artfully arranged on a large platter. But, as I began to play with the presentation, simplicity seemed the wiser approach.I lined up potato slices on wooden plates, topping each with a piece of lobster, a strip of roasted pepper and a halved cherry tomato. Each morsel could be consumed in one or two bites.What started out as a sit-down lunch became a stand-up tapas party, and, for a little while at least, we were blissfully carefree.cookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Hunt for Ways to Combat Online Radicalization", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLaw enforcement officials, technology companies and lawmakers have long tried to limit what they call the \u201cradicalization\u201d of young people over the internet.The term has often been used to describe a specific kind of radicalization \u2014 that of young Muslim men who are inspired to take violent action by the online messages of Islamist groups like the Islamic State. But as it turns out, it isn\u2019t just violent jihadists who benefit from the internet\u2019s power to radicalize young people from afar.White supremacists are just as adept at it. Where the pre-internet Ku Klux Klan grew primarily from personal connections and word of mouth, today\u2019s white supremacist groups have figured out a way to expertly use the internet to recruit and coordinate among a huge pool of potential racists. That became clear two weeks ago with the riots in Charlottesville, Va., which became a kind of watershed event for internet-addled racists.Ms. Donovan and others who study how the internet shapes extremism said that even though Islamists and white nationalists have different views and motivations, there are broad similarities in how the two operate online \u2014 including how they spread their message, recruit and organize offline actions. The similarities suggest a kind of blueprint for a response \u2014 efforts that may work for limiting the reach of jihadists may also work for white supremacists, and vice versa.In fact, that\u2019s the battle plan. Several research groups in the United States and Europe now see the white supremacist and jihadi threats as two faces of the same coin. They\u2019re working on methods to fight both, together \u2014 and slowly, they have come up with ideas for limiting how these groups recruit new members to their cause.Their ideas are grounded in a few truths about how extremist groups operate online, and how potential recruits respond. After speaking to many researchers, I compiled this rough guide for combating online radicalization.Recognize the internet as an extremist breeding ground.The first step in combating online extremism is kind of obvious: It is to recognize the extremists as a threat.When it comes to fighting white supremacists, though, much of the tech industry has long been on the sidelines. This laxity has helped create a monster. In many ways, researchers said, white supremacists are even more sophisticated than jihadists in their use of the internet.After the horror of Charlottesville, internet companies began banning and blocking content posted by right-wing extremist groups. So far their efforts have been hasty and reactive, but Ms. Ramalingam sees it as at the start of a wider effort.\u201cIt\u2019s really an unprecedented moment where social media and tech companies are recognizing that their platforms have become spaces where these groups can grow, and have been often unpoliced,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really kind of waking up to this and taking some action.\u201dEngage directly with potential recruits. If tech companies are finally taking action to prevent radicalization, is it the right kind of action? Extremism researchers said that blocking certain content may work to temporarily disrupt groups, but may eventually drive them further underground, far from the reach of potential saviors.One factor is a skepticism of mainstream media. Whether on the far right or ISIS, people who are susceptible to extremist ideologies tend to dismiss outlets like The New York Times or the BBC, and they often go in search of alternative theories online.Another key issue is timing. There\u2019s a brief window between initial interest in an extremist ideology and a decision to join the cause \u2014 and after recruits make that decision, they are often beyond the reach of outsiders. For instance, Jigsaw found that when jihadists began planning their trips to Syria to join ISIS, they had fallen too far down the rabbit hole and dismissed any new information presented to them.Jigsaw put these findings to use in an innovative way. It curated a series of videos showing what life is truly like under the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The videos, which weren\u2019t filmed by news outlets, offered a credible counterpoint to the fantasies peddled by the group \u2014 they show people queuing up for bread, fighters brutally punishing civilians, and women and children being mistreated.Then, to make sure potential recruits saw the videos at the right time in their recruitment process, Jigsaw used one of Google\u2019s most effective technologies: ad targeting. In the same way that a pair of shoes you looked up last week follows you around the internet, Jigsaw\u2019s counterterrorism videos were pushed to likely recruits.Moonshot CVE, which worked with Jigsaw on the Redirect project, put together several similar efforts to engage with both jihadists and white supremacist groups. It has embedded undercover social workers in extremist forums who discreetly message potential recruits to dissuade them. And lately it\u2019s been using targeted ads to offer mental health counseling to those who might be radicalized.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s really effective to go beyond ideology,\u201d Ms. Ramalingam said. \u201cWhen you offer them some information about their lives, they\u2019re disproportionately likely to interact with it.\u201dStill, just about every hate crime and terrorist attack, these days, was planned or in some way coordinated online. Ridding the world of all of the factors that drive young men to commit heinous acts isn\u2019t possible. But disrupting the online radicalization machine? With enough work, that may just be possible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "James Murphy Wants to Justify LCD Soundsystem\u2019s Existence (Again)", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe musician James Murphy is the kind of guy who can \u2014 and will \u2014 tell an intimate David Bowie story, while also making it clear that he knows it\u2019s a bit embarrassing, or at least uncomfortable, to be the kind of guy who might drop a two-ton name like that out of nowhere. He can tell what you\u2019re thinking and he\u2019s thinking it, too.But the anecdote, like most of Mr. Murphy\u2019s, had a point, so he soldiered on explaining how Bowie, not long before his death, had convinced Mr. Murphy that it was acceptable to bring back his cult disco-punk band LCD Soundsystem just five years after making a big deal of its demise.\u201cI was talking to him about it and I was like, this is a really weird thing,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, slipping into a half-impression as he recalled Bowie\u2019s reply: \u201c\u2018Does it make you uncomfortable?\u2019 And I was like, yeah. He said: \u2018Good. If you\u2019re not uncomfortable, then you\u2019re not doing anything.\u2019\u201dThe challenge now for Mr. Murphy and his suddenly-more-famous band \u2014 which includes the core members Pat Mahoney on drums and Nancy Whang on keyboards, along with the guitarist Al Doyle \u2014 is to transcend the insta-nostalgia of a reunion tour while contending with those skeptical fans who felt betrayed by the Jay-Z-like retirement fakeout.\u201cThere was a moment when I was regretting it,\u201d Mr. Murphy said of the temporary goodbye. \u201cBut then I was like, no, because now if we\u2019re going to play again, we really have to justify it. That\u2019s a new, exciting problem and far more interesting to me. We\u2019ve got to do something good enough.\u201dThe rebirth also allowed Mr. Murphy, who did not approach rock-star status until his late 30s, to \u201cshift eras\u201d \u2014 here, again, he invoked Bowie, citing his chronic reinventing \u2014 in an organic way because his station in life had changed. \u201cI\u2019m 47, and I\u2019ve got a 2-year-old,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.While LCD Soundsystem had always positioned itself as \u201cslightly superior and slightly scary \u2014 a snarky record-jerk band that could outsnark even the most curmudgeonly, hyper-knowledgeable record dork,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is not what we are now.\u201dThe broader universe had changed in the meantime, as well. Although \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is \u201cnot overtly political,\u201d Mr. Mahoney, the drummer, said, \u201cI think it contains some of the turmoil that the world is experiencing right now\u201d on songs like the title track, \u201cHow Do You Sleep?,\u201d and \u201cCall the Police.\u201d Ms. Whang added of Mr. Murphy\u2019s songwriting: \u201cIt\u2019s much darker and much heavier,\u201d with \u201ca bit more gravity.\u201dThe album\u2019s sound is very much still LCD Soundsystem \u2014 with its layers of propulsive, syncopated repetition patiently approaching a boil \u2014 but the moments of release are less euphoric.Mr. Murphy said he had \u201cquickly realized that a wry wit from a distance would, at this point, be self-parody and a crutch,\u201d adding, \u201cTo try to sing more and to let go, to a certain degree, of my ironic distance was a terrifying thing and the best use of \u2018you should be uncomfortable\u2019 that I could make.\u201dAcross a trilogy of albums, concluding with \u201cThis Is Happening\u201d in 2010, LCD Soundsystem expanded its palette from brash and bratty (\u201cDaft Punk Is Playing at My House\u201d) to something approaching epic and sincere on songs like \u201cAll My Friends,\u201d \u201cNew York, I Love You but You\u2019re Bringing Me Down\u201d and \u201cHome.\u201dRecalling the 2011 goodbye, Mr. Klosterman said, \u201cThe idea of putting this much effort and thought into the alleged conclusion of your band does sort of illustrate a key characteristic of New York music from that period, which was hyper-self-awareness. Everything was considered. And he was the most considered of that.\u201dA furry, substantial teddy bear of a man with a never-ending string of opinions, Mr. Murphy has a reputation for being harsh and disagreeable. But these days, his voluble rants, during which he can sound like an art-school Louis C.K., are generally good-natured and self-effacing. And no one would accuse him of underanalyzing things, which made the undoing of his grand pronouncements about shutting down the band all the more curious.\u201cIt was sincere,\u201d Mr. Murphy insisted. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a ploy.\u201dBut his reasons for doing so range from the conceptual to the pragmatic, none completely satisfying. At first, \u201cLCD was a project,\u201d while DFA was everything, Mr. Murphy explained \u2014 \u201cthrowing parties, doing sound design, producing, building a recording studio, label.\u201d As the work began to catch on in the worlds of fashion and art, \u201cIt felt like we were invading,\u201d he said.But by 2010, LCD Soundsystem had cemented itself as a reliable critical favorite, and there was a growing sense among the band and its business partners that the next album was going to be huge. \u201cAs things mature \u2014 whether they be real estate, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, politics, festivals, radio \u2014 there\u2019s an efficiency that develops and with it, very often, comes some soul-crushing truths,\u201d Mr. Murphy said.\u201cIf you keep doing it, you get bigger even if the records get worse,\u201d he continued, invoking U2, the Cure, Talking Heads, R.E.M. and the Pixies. (\u201c\u2018Trompe le Monde\u2019 isn\u2019t better than \u2018Surfer Rosa,\u2019 but it\u2019s bigger.\u201d) \u201cIt was our turn,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd something about that turned my stomach.\u201dHe compared it to how he felt as a student at a good high school in New Jersey, who was expected to go to college after graduation. \u201cThe idea of it being \u2018next\u2019 was just unappealing,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be that band. I liked being the band that was relevant to me. I felt like we were about to be the band that was not relevant to me.\u201dThere were less heady reasons, too. The show at Madison Square Garden had been booked far in advance and the venue \u201cdidn\u2019t think we were going to sell well,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThey were trying to get a big opener for us,\u201d and suggested a nonsensical double bill with Big Boi from Outkast.\u201cMy theory was, if I make it our last show, we\u2019ll sell it out in two weeks,\u201d he said. The show sold out in minutes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a total lark, but it was a bit larky,\u201d Mr. Murphy admitted. \u201cBut I like making decisions. I find it easy.\u201dRallying his collaborators was a separate concern. \u201cIt definitely was an odd choice to quit at the top of our game,\u201d said Mr. Mahoney, who felt the time was right to return. \u201cBeing in your 40s in pop music makes you feel very old, but it\u2019s actually the prime of your career in any other field,\u201d he said.Ms. Whang was more ambivalent. Although she \u201cdidn\u2019t believe it for a second\u201d when the band ended, she assumed a reunion would come much later. \u201cI certainly had my hesitations,\u201d she said. \u201cBut James seemed very excited, so it didn\u2019t seem worth taking a strong stand when I didn\u2019t even really know what I was taking a stand for.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s crass to say that it was about the money, but it would be insincere to say that wasn\u2019t part of it.\u201dMr. Doyle, the guitarist, said the \u201cslightly unsavory tang\u201d to the decision was ultimately a motivating factor. \u201cThat was a huge impetus to work as hard as we could, to be so good that people forget.\u201d (Yes, Mr. Murphy \u201cwas self-conscious about it,\u201d Mr. Doyle added. \u201cHe\u2019s self-conscious about where he puts his glass down on the table.\u201d) To re-emerge at a higher level of notoriety, and on a major label, also meant \u201cresources that we never had,\u201d he said, to record and perform on a \u201cmore ambitious scale.\u201dNone of that was this. \u201cI love rock. I love the music that was born out of the latter part of the 20th century,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cIt means a lot to me.\u201d So the wave of major musician deaths over the last few years \u2014 Lou Reed, Bowie, Prince, Leonard Cohen, Lemmy Kilmister \u2014 proved to be a major preoccupation for him on \u201cAmerican Dream.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like when all your light bulbs start going out at the same time because you put them all in at the same time,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no one to replace them. That\u2019s really dark.\u201dYet when he addresses death directly, as on \u201cTonite\u201d from the new album, Mr. Murphy can\u2019t help but smirk. \u201cYeah, all the hits are saying the same thing,\u201d he sings. \u201cThere\u2019s only tonite, man/life is finite/but, [expletive], it feels like forever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "EBay\u2019s Founder Has a New Idea: Build a Dairy in Hawaii", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKAUAI, Hawaii \u2014 If Pierre Omidyar gets his way, 699 dairy cows will soon enjoy a glorious view of the Pacific Ocean, framed by a pristine beach.Mr. Omidyar, the founder of eBay, wants to build a dairy farm on the island of Kauai.He is one of many tech billionaires who have established a presence in Hawaii, which is only a five-hour flight from Silicon Valley. Others include Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder, who bought all but a tiny amount of the island of Lanai and turned it into a resort \u2014 investing millions, but frustrating some islanders by driving up rents \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who was called a \u201cneocolonialist\u201d after he sued some locals over beachfront land he bought. (He dropped the suits.)Some residents, though, object. They and the owners of the major resorts that line this island\u2019s famous beaches, just a little over one mile down the coastline from the dairy site, have worked to block the project.\u201cWe are concerned with odors and flies from the dairy,\u201d said Lisa Munger, a lawyer who represents the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa, which successfully sued to force the dairy to do an environmental assessment. \u201cEach dairy cow will produce 90.8 pounds of manure per day \u2014 whether there are 699 cows or 2,000 cows, that is a lot of manure.\u201dMs. Munger said biting flies can reach the Grand Hyatt, along with \u201coffensive dairy odors.\u201dSo far, courts have sided with opponents of the dairy. In a case brought by the Friends group, contending that the dairy would violate the federal Clean Water Act, a judge ruled that it had violated the law by failing to get the permits it needed for the construction it had already done on the site.Another lawsuit, brought by the owners of the Grand Hyatt, contended the dairy would have a negative effect on businesses and resorts along the coast. This year, Judge Randal G. B. Valenciano revoked all permits that had been granted to Hawaii Dairy Farms and ordered it to complete an environmental assessment before going further.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from an economy here that grew sugar cane and pineapples and had a large agricultural industry to one based largely on tourism and real estate development,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said. \u201cAll these interests are competing for the same resources and opportunities, and if we\u2019re not careful, agriculture is going to lose out and Hawaii will be without a safety net \u2014 not being able to grow our own food is a significant issue.\u201dResidents point out that one drinking-water well supplying the neighborhoods of Poipu and Koloa is within 700 feet of the pastures where the cows will graze, and other wells are within 1,200 feet.The dairy\u2019s representatives contend that the soil at the site can absorb and filter the manure runoff from 699 milk cows.The chosen number of cows is significant: If Hawaii Dairy\u2019s plans included one more cow \u2014 bumping the total to 700 \u2014 it would meet the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s definition of a \u201clarge concentrated animal feeding operation,\u201d or CAFO.That designation initiates the need for a permit under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. Because the dairy drew the line at 699 cows, avoiding the need for the discharge permit, it originally was able to describe itself as \u201czero discharge.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be zero discharge from the E.P.A.\u2019s perspective,\u201d Ms. Hennessey said. \u201cThere will be very little discharge, but I think it was a little confusing for some people in the community, so we\u2019ve stopped saying that,\u201d she said.The dairy plans to eventually have 2,000 cows on the property.Given Hawaii\u2019s proximity to Silicon Valley, it is little surprise that the islands have attracted many of America\u2019s new billionaires. Like everyone else, they appreciate the state\u2019s natural beauty. And they appreciate its generally laid-back approach to fame and fortune.Plus, it is easier to move around by boat and helicopter \u2014 avoiding paparazzi stakeouts. Marc Benioff, Paul Allen and Michael Dell, whose 18,500-square-foot hideaway there is known as the Raptor Residence, have homes here.While his improvements have driven up rents, displacing some residents \u2014 only about 3,200 people live there full time \u2014 Mr. Ellison has also paid for a new water filtration system for the island, a public pool and a movie theater.The suits touched on a particularly sensitive issue for native Hawaiians having to do with land that traditionally belonged to Hawaii\u2019s kings. Mr. Zuckerberg and Dr. Chan said in a letter printed in the local newspaper that they had been unaware of some of the issues involving such parcels and pledged to learn more.The Omidyars have lived in Honolulu more or less full time since the mid-2000s, and it is not the eBay billionaire\u2019s first run-in with the Kauai community. He previously planned to open a resort on the island\u2019s north shore on a property that was home to a Club Med. But he had to give up after about a tenth of the island\u2019s population signed a petition against the project, claiming its impact on the environment would be detrimental.He lived in Hawaii for two years when he was a teenager, and his wife, Pam, attended \u2019Iolani School in Honolulu. Today, he tends to keep a low profile. The couple has a private security staff that includes former Secret Service and State Department officers, and they keep a private plane at the ready at Honolulu Airport, which Mr. Omidyar has said is so that the family can escape a disaster quickly.He has also devoted $250 million to building a media business that includes online publications like The Intercept and Civil Beat, based in Honolulu, which tend to keep a weather eye on government and its secrets.Hawaii has at least three commercial dairies already \u2014 and making money is \u201can uphill battle,\u201d said Steve Whitesides, the owner of one of them, Big Island Dairy. Permits are hard to get, expenses are high and he has had to import more feed than he expected, he said. Mr. Whitesides, an Idaho-based dairy farmer, bought Big Island Dairy in 2012, when it was flirting with bankruptcy.Last September, heavy rains led to flooding in O\u2019okala, and some residents found themselves up to their ankles in wastewater carried down the mountain. They posted videos to YouTube documenting the experience and wrote letters to state officials. \u201cOlder people have told me they have a hard time eating dinner because of the smell, and homeowners have gotten E. coli and staph infections,\u201d said Valerie Poindexter, who represents the neighborhood on the Hawai\u2019i County Council.Mr. Whitesides said Big Island Dairy was built to \u201cproper specs\u201d and that he had continued to invest in its infrastructure to improve it. He said he did not believe manure was escaping from the two effluent ponds on the property, or the milking building. But the dairy does have some animals in pastures, he said, \u201cAnd that manure has to go somewhere.\u201dTo avoid any problems like that at Mr. Omidyar\u2019s dairy, Ms. Hennessey said, Hawaii Dairy will establish 35-foot setbacks, planted with dense vegetation, along a stream that runs through the property to prevent contamination of the waterway running through the property to the sea. The company also plans to introduce dung beetles to the property, Hawaii Dairy said, to help process manure.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Lanai. At least two of the Hawaiian archipelago\u2019s eight main islands \u2014 Niihau and Kahoolawe \u2014 are smaller, along with many other islands and atolls in the chain; it is not the smallest Hawaiian island.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Man Drives Car Through Activists Protesting Transgender Woman\u2019s Death", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe incident occurred as a crowd gathered to protest the death of Kiwi Herring, 30, a transgender woman who was fatally shot by the police on Tuesday after slashing an officer with a knife, according to law enforcement authorities. Activists said they believed the police had used excessive force.After attending a candlelight vigil for Ms. Herring on Wednesday night, dozens of demonstrators marched through St. Louis\u2019s streets, at one point stopping in an intersection in the Grove neighborhood.Videos posted to social media indicate that a car slowly approached the intersection, then inched through the crowd before accelerating. Photos by a St. Louis Post-Dispatch photographer show one activist on top of the car.Accounts of what led to the confrontation vary. The police said in a statement that the driver tried to drive around the protesters before they surrounded the car and hit it with their hands and a flagpole, according to The Post-Dispatch. The statement said the three protesters were injured when they jumped on to the car and fell off as it drove away.\u201cHe then began to drive forward, slowly hitting people,\u201d the Facebook post read. \u201cIt was only once he was already hitting people and increasing his speed that people began to hit his car. He continued to drive faster, deeper into the crowd, turning to his left as he went.\u201dA witness said in an interview that the activists had hoped their vigil would ensure that the wider community knew about Ms. Herring\u2019s death and about their questions over the police\u2019s version of events.After leaving the vigil, which was attended by about 100 people, the demonstrators chanted while walking through the streets. They stopped in the intersection seen in the video, and several cars turned around or found other routes when they saw the protesters there, said the witness, Jay-Marie Hill, 28.When the car drove directly up to the activists, they perceived it as a threat, the witness said.\u201cPeople went around the car and said, \u2018You need to turn around, this is a peaceful protest.\u2019 \u201dOn Tuesday, at a news conference about Ms. Herring\u2019s death, Lawrence O\u2019Toole, the acting police commissioner of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department, said officers arrived at a home shortly after 8 a.m. to find a person had been \u201cseverely cut.\u201d The person identified Ms. Herring as the assailant, he said.When an officer went to take Ms. Herring into custody, she slashed at that officer with a kitchen-type knife, hitting him on the arm, Mr. O\u2019Toole said. The officer was treated at a hospital for a minor injury.Advertisement"}

Add Shrimp", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteCreamed corn doesn\u2019t need any help.A perfectly simple dish of just two ingredients \u2014 corn and cream \u2014 simmered down into something rich, complex and just sweet enough, creamed corn asks for nothing else, not even salt and pepper.That said, as much as I adore its inherent minimalism, there are times when I cannot resist throwing something else into the pan.This summer, I took my cheesy creamed corn even further, and turned that side dish into a meal by using it as a base for saut\u00e9ed shrimp.Since I was playing fast and loose with the grits part of the equation, I kept the shrimp bit fairly straightforward. I started with a base of onions and peppers cooked down with ripe August tomatoes. Then I added the shrimp, seasoning it all with hot sauce, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. Classic flavors, simply wrought.As always when cooking shrimp, it is worth the effort to seek out excellent quality, preferably wild-caught crustaceans. You want extra-large shrimp; 12 to 16 to a pound is about right. Then take care not to overcook them. Just after they start turning pink all over, pull the pan off the stove and let the residual heat finish the cooking process. They should be succulent and not at all shriveled.As soon as the shrimp are done, spoon them onto the creamy corn.You could certainly stop there. But I didn\u2019t. First, I sprinkled on a handful of crumbled feta, which acts almost like creamy salt, bringing the flavors together. Then I added a heap of fresh basil and cilantro. If either garnish offends you, just leave it off.Or, try it once my way and then do it your way next time. There is plenty of corn season left this year to make this dish your own.cookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber Investor Sues Travis Kalanick for Fraud", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the heart of the suit is how Mr. Kalanick obtained outsize control of several Uber board seats in 2016, which Benchmark said he achieved through \u201cmaterial misstatements and fraudulent concealment\u201d of information. Mr. Kalanick\u2019s \u201coverarching objective is to pack Uber\u2019s board with loyal allies in an effort to insulate his prior conduct from scrutiny and clear the path for his eventual return as C.E.O. \u2014 all to the detriment of Uber\u2019s stockholders, employees, driver-partners, and customers,\u201d the suit said.The suit added that Mr. Kalanick\u2019s position on Uber\u2019s board \u201cis thus improper and inequitable, and should be invalidated.\u201dBenchmark\u2019s suit shows that the balance of power is delicate. Investors will go to great lengths to undercut a company founder if they believe their investment is endangered.A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.\u201d The spokesman said Benchmark was acting in \u201cits own best interests\u201d instead of those of Uber, and added that Mr. Kalanick \u201cis confident that these entirely baseless claims will be rejected.\u201dMr. Kalanick is not interested in returning to Uber as chief executive, according to a person involved in the proceedings, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to talk publicly. Others have said Mr. Kalanick wants to be a shadow leader without necessarily having the chief executive title.Benchmark invested in Uber six years ago, when the ride-hailing service was a minnow. Bill Gurley, a Benchmark partner, joined the company\u2019s board at the time. Benchmark\u2019s then-20 percent stake in Uber has now ballooned into one worth of billions of dollars.Benchmark currently owns a 13 percent stake in Uber, and Mr. Kalanick has a 10 percent chunk, according to the suit. Even so, Mr. Kalanick has significant clout over the company.That\u2019s partly because of a move he made in June 2016, which the suit hones in on. At the time, Mr. Kalanick got Benchmark to approve an amendment to the company\u2019s charter that gave him the right to nominate three new directors to add to Uber\u2019s eight-member board. According to the suit, Benchmark would never have agreed to the move had it known of Mr. Kalanick\u2019s \u201cgross mismanagement and other misconduct at Uber.\u201dYet Mr. Kalanick deliberately hid the problems at Uber, Benchmark claimed in the suit, and therefore he obtained the rights over the three new board seats fraudulently.After Mr. Kalanick stepped down in June, he also left the board seat that is designated for the chief executive, the suit said. Mr. Kalanick then immediately reappointed himself to one of the three new board seats that he controlled through the 2016 amendment. He has since refused to give up control of the other two board seats, according to the suit.In public, the board said there was a d\u00e9tente. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to serve with him on the board,\u201d said the board about Mr. Kalanick in a statement at the time.In the suit, Benchmark said it was seeking a judgment that the 2016 amendment to Uber\u2019s corporate charter should be voided, and asked for an injunction to stop Mr. Kalanick from participating in Uber board matters.\u201cKalanick\u2019s improper actions, if allowed to continue, would cause irreparable harm to Uber by exposing it to reputational, regulatory and other risks,\u201d Benchmark said in the suit.In bold, black lettering splayed across a PowerPoint slide behind Mr. Kalanick was the following phrase: \u201cV.C.s tend to kill founding C.E.O.s.\u201d\u201cThere are forces all around you to take you out,\u201d Mr. Kalanick said in his presentation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget Ratings. \u2018Orphan Black\u2019 Had the #CloneClub.", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "The BBC America show, which ends its five-season run on Saturday, found success by engaging with and empowering its small but dedicated fan base online.Supported by\u201cOrphan Black\u201d never had huge ratings. A July episode on BBC America, for example, garnered just 645,000 viewers, ranking it 33rd among scripted cable TV series that week.But what the show does have is the #CloneClub, the name its fiercely loyal fans collectively go by when they gather online. And BBC America has done everything it can to cultivate their dedication.\u201cTheir adamant vocal nature was the reason our show was anything \u2014 a success \u2014 and seen the way it was,\u201d said Tatiana Maslany, the star of \u201cOrphan Black\u201d who won an Emmy for best actress in a drama last year.Or as Sarah Barnett, the president of BBC America put it, \u201cEvery TV network, particularly at a time of surfeit of content \u2014 peak TV \u2014 is absolutely driven in wanting to create fandoms. Everybody is talking about it.\u201d\u201cOrphan Black\u201d will end its five-season run on Saturday with its final episode. As the show closes out, here\u2019s a look at how the show engaged with and leveraged that online fanbase. In this era of peak TV, it provides a window into how future shows could find and measure success.\u201cOrphan Black\u201d centers on a character named Sarah Manning who discovers she\u2019s one of a series of clones around the world. Ms. Maslany plays many of those characters. From the start, a certain number of fans were hooked, identifying with the show\u2019s themes of female empowerment and inclusiveness. The name #CloneClub came from a bit of dialogue in the first season.When \u201cOrphan Black\u201d made its debut four years ago, many TV networks were still unsure how to engage with fans talking about their shows on social media.Should the networks try to police the chatter or engage with the fans? And if they did try to connect with them, would it be with the kind of corporate-speak that is often used in news releases?After much consideration, BBC America came up with an answer: Just have a normal conversation.\u201cIt sounds like common behavior now but it was actually fairly radical in 2013,\u201d Ms. Barnett said. \u201cYou came to realize that you can\u2019t control this. You have to really understand it and embrace it.\u201dTo that end, BBC America decided to let fans create art and fan fiction based on the show, without any supervision from the network. And then it went a step further.The cable network wanted to signal to the fans that they were being heard, and to allow them to participate in the creative process.BBC America executives also saw that \u201cOrphan Black\u201d fans were particularly interested in drawing up art based on the show. The network\u2019s social media team took to Tumblr and asked fans to submit ideas that would help inform the marketing for the show. The #CloneClub happily obliged.\u201cWe had a competition and said \u2018we will use the fan art we select as the key art for marketing for the show,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barnett said. \u201cWe really saw it as a way to actually allow and invite the fans into the shaping of the conversation around the show.\u201d\u201cFans went crazy for it and said, \u2018OMG, you\u2019re listening to us, we\u2019re being heard,\u2019\u201d Ms. Barnett said of the #CloneClub.Though this might be anathema to many showrunners, the creators of \u201cOrphan Black\u201d did not have a problem with it, mainly because they were not asked to adjust the show\u2019s plot in any way.\u201cThey weren\u2019t putting pressure on us story-wise,\u201d Graeme Manson, one of the show\u2019s creators, said of BBC America. \u201cThese things weren\u2019t affecting the direction of the show. That\u2019s another issue: When you have all that feedback, it\u2019s easy for us to see what people like and don\u2019t like. Though we\u2019re not taking direction or changing story lines necessarily, it certainly gives you a direction and it tells you what people like about characters and what they want to see from characters.\u201dIn the last four years, as the number of scripted series on TV has ballooned, network executives have taken to saying that they\u2019re not trying to make everybody\u2019s favorite show. Instead they are trying to make shows that inspire a deep connection.\u201cThat\u2019s what we think is increasingly important for our business,\u201d Ms. Barnett said. \u201cNot just having a shallow breadth of viewers but actually having a really deep, passionate fanbase. As we move to a world with skinny bundles and more direct-to-consumers opportunities, I think mattering in the kind of ways 'Orphan Black\u2019 matters is actually as crucially important alongside\u201d ratings.There may be no greater example of the fans\u2019 dedication than Ms. Maslany\u2019s Emmy success.In 2014, Ms. Maslany failed to receive an Emmy nomination. The #CloneClub was not happy. The following year, she received a nomination. And last year, she won in an upset, besting actresses like Viola Davis, Robin Wright and Claire Danes.\u201cWhen you love a show and not everyone has seen it and not everyone cares about it the way you do, when it gets that recognition it\u2019s very bolstering,\u201d Ms. Maslany said. \u201cIt just meant so much to them.\u201dIt was a reminder of the power of fan loyalty, and with \u201cOrphan Black\u201d going off the air, Ms. Barnett said the key to her network\u2019s future will be cultivating that kind of dedication again and again.\u201cIt\u2019s not just size,\u201d she said of a show\u2019s audience. \u201cMattering matters.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the day that the series finale of \u201cOrphan Black\u201d will air. It will air on Saturday, not Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ode to the Buttered Roll, That New York Lifeline", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt can be hard to explain the appeal of a buttered roll.Unlike the breakfast sandwich or the cruller, the humble buttered roll makes no claims to lusciousness. It\u2019s not really greater than the sum of its parts: a round roll, sliced and slathered with butter. There is no alchemy involved.And yet, like many New Yorkers, I\u2019ve breakfasted all my life on buttered rolls, wrapped in plastic, foil or wax paper and sold for about a dollar at any corner deli, bodega or coffee cart.Do I love them? No. That is not really the point. I love that they exist, an unsung, charmingly ordinary hero of the city\u2019s mornings.Though of course bread and butter are eaten all over, the buttered roll (or roll with butter, as it is known in parts of New Jersey) is a distinctly local phenomenon. Mention its name outside the New York metropolitan area and you would very likely be met with blank incomprehension.\u201cNever heard of it growing up in Chicago,\u201d said Michael Stern, a chronicler of regional fare and an author of the \u201cRoadfood\u201d book series, \u201cand really not much beyond Fairfield County in Connecticut.\u201d (Indeed, one can roughly trace the expansion of the buttered roll to the migration of New Yorkers to surrounding commuter suburbs.)In New York City itself, buttered rolls are a perennial: Like a working character actor, they are everywhere you look without realizing it. No one has tried to reinvent the buttered roll, or jazz it up or export it \u2014 the idea just wouldn\u2019t occur. Still, it unobtrusively endures.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most popular things I sell, absolutely,\u201d said Peter Cherevas, who has had a coffee cart stationed at 86th Street and Broadway for the past 27 years. Sales, he said, are \u201cvery, very consistent \u2014 more than bagels.\u201d\u201cBagels have slacked off; buttered rolls have not,\u201d he continued. \u201cSmall coffee, milk one sugar, you\u2019re good.\u201dMr. Cherevas typically sells four dozen buttered rolls a day, to a diverse group of customers: young and old, suits and hard hats. \u201cEveryone!\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all New Yorkers, though, not tourists.\u201dPart of the appeal is that they\u2019re hard to screw up. Even if the roll is less than fresh, or prepared with margarine, or the filling is bizarrely distributed, the final product is somehow, magically, edible.\u201cYou can\u2019t go just anywhere in New York and get a decent breakfast sandwich,\u201d the chef Wylie Dufresne said. \u201cYou certainly can\u2019t guarantee a good bagel. But you can go into any bodega, get a buttered roll.\u201dIt\u2019s not that straightforward, though. If you ask New Yorkers about it, as I did, the effect can be practically Proustian. \u201cHang on, let me write a novel about this,\u201d responded one friend, who (apparently overcome with emotion) then failed to do so. Another friend\u2019s father recalled a song at a 1968 Hunter high school sing-in featuring the lyrics \u201cGristedes takes a cut a every roll and buttah.\u201d (Unconfirmed.) My husband, as a young editor at the book publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux, often saw Roger Straus Jr., one of the company\u2019s founders, buy a buttered roll and coffee regular from the coffee cart in front of the building, part of his morning routine.\u201cI loved and relied on them when I was very broke and young and coffee still only came from a cart or a deli,\u201d the chef Gabrielle Hamilton said. \u201cI was always annoyed that they didn\u2019t spread the butter evenly, so you had to eat a dry outer ring until you got to the center, where you got a gross mouthful of too much butter \u2014 if it even was butter. Still, it was a lifeline.\u201dPeter Elliot, an editor at Bloomberg, recalled that for his class-conscious father, buttered rolls were too unsophisticated, and banned in their East Side home.The origins of the buttered roll are cloaked in mystery, or perhaps mere lack of curiosity. I approached five historians of New York food, all of whom admitted they had never considered the roll\u2019s place in the city\u2019s foodscape. It belongs instead to a certain kind of anecdotal lore. That said, there are certain facts. The first such rolls would have arrived in New York in the 1870s, along with Louis Fleischmann\u2019s Vienna Model Bakery, which brought commercial yeasted bread to the city. The buttered roll apparently became popular with German Jews (and later, Eastern European Jews) as a filling, inexpensive dairy meal, in accordance with kosher law.When the 20th century brought us the commuter breakfast, the buttered roll was ready to take its place on office coffee carts and at takeout windows.Order a buttered roll and you\u2019ll invariably be handed a kaiser. But ask old-time New Yorkers, and they will swear up and down that today\u2019s model is a pale version of the remembered \u201cVienna\u201d or \u201chard rolls,\u201d a smaller, cornmeal-bottomed pastry with an open crumb and a shatteringly crisp crust.\u201cThe whole charm of these is that they were basically hollow,\u201d said the food writer Arthur Schwartz, a Brooklyn native. \u201cThe rolls really were crunchy, and very light. It\u2019s not so delicious anymore: The butter\u2019s not butter, and the roll\u2019s not crisp.\u201dToday\u2019s roll, true, is rarely fresh-baked. Often the crust is slackened by its plastic wrapping, which some feel imparts a chemical flavor. (Paper was de rigueur, once upon a time.) Most rolls sold at delis and coffee carts come from a few large distributors; New Yorker, a distributor based in Astoria, Queens, provides about half of the rolls sold by vendors. A manager there estimated the output at about 700 dozen rolls a day, five days a week.And then there is the butter. It\u2019s still possible to find a roll spread with the genuine article (Eisenberg\u2019s Sandwich Shop in the Flatiron district sells an admirable specimen), but many carts and bodegas stock a less expensive butter-flavored spread. Although plenty of vendors spread their rolls in advance for easy morning turnover, others prepare each roll to order from a large tub of spread, heavily daubing the roll\u2019s lower half with an expert flick of the knife.To some purists, a buttered roll made with \u201cspread\u201d is not worth eating. \u201cThe entire point is a roll spread with real, sweet butter,\u201d said Christina Harcar, a fifth-generation New Jerseyan. \u201cThe day they switched to margarine, in the \u201970s, is the day my grandmother ate her last buttered roll.\u201dStill, it\u2019s not a hard taste to acquire. A vendor who has run a coffee cart in Midtown East since 2009 said he had never had a buttered roll before moving to New York from Karachi, Pakistan. Now, though?\u201cI eat one every day,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall coffee and one buttered roll. It\u2019s easy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Parents Can Do to Nurture Good Writers", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySteve Graham, a professor at Arizona State University\u2019s Teachers College, has been researching how young people learn to write for more than 30 years. He is a co-author of numerous books on writing instruction, including \u201cPowerful Writing Strategies for All Students.\u201dHow does reading at home help children become better writers?Reading is really critical, but it\u2019s not enough. We don\u2019t have much evidence that if you just read more, you\u2019ll be a better writer. But analyzing text does make a difference. So when we read to kids, we can also have conversations with them about the author\u2019s craft. How did this author make this place seem real in terms of description? What words did they use? How did they present this idea or this argument?Should a parent correct a child\u2019s writing, or just be encouraging?Sometimes when kids come to you to share what they\u2019re writing, they\u2019re not coming for feedback. They are coming for affirmation. It\u2019s really important we emphasize first and foremost what we really like about it. And if you\u2019re going to give feedback, just pick one or two things. English teachers \u2014 and parents are guilty of this, too \u2014 sometimes overwhelm kids with more feedback than they can absorb all at once. The other thing that\u2019s really important, particularly for parents, is to remember that they don\u2019t own this piece. It\u2019s their child\u2019s. Asking questions, instead of saying \u201cDo this,\u201d can be a more effective approach. It gives the child the opportunity to make decisions about the text.Is social media hurting children\u2019s writing at school?I don\u2019t think so. Kids are constantly creating text when they are at home. They tweet, they text, they Facebook. Each of those has its own rules, and one of the advantages is that students learn that you write in different registers in different situations. We can use that to our advantage, working with kids on how we\u2019d put that writing in a more formal situation. Changing register is a skill kids need to learn.What should parents look for to assess the writing instruction at their child\u2019s school?After about third grade, very little time is devoted to explicit writing instruction. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve imagined that kids have acquired what they need to know to be good writers by then! In middle and high school, the most common activities are fill-in-the-blanks on worksheets, writing single sentences, making lists or writing a paragraph summary. When you start talking about persuasive essays or an informative paper, those things occur infrequently in English class and even less so in social studies and science.So the first questions are: \u201cIs my kid writing at school, and was he given writing assignments to work on at home?

{"Headline": "A Game You Can Control With Your Mind", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "A number of companies are working on ways to control machines simply with a thought. But they are likely to be met with skepticism.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When you pull the headset over your eyes and the game begins, you are transported to a tiny room with white walls. Your task is to break out of the room, but you cannot use your hands. There is no joystick or game pad. You must use your thoughts.You turn toward a ball on the floor, and your brain sends a command to pick it up. With another thought, you send the ball crashing into a mirror, breaking the glass and revealing a few numbers scribbled on a wall. You mentally type those numbers into a large keypad by the door. And you are out.Designed by Neurable, a small start-up founded by Ramses Alcaide, an electrical engineer and neuroscientist, the game offers what you might call a computer mouse for the mind, a way of selecting items in a virtual world with your thoughts.Incorporating a headset with virtual reality goggles and sensors that can read your brain waves, this prototype is a few years from the market. And it is limited in what it can do. You cannot select an object with your mind unless you first look in its general direction, narrowing the number of items you may be considering.But it works. I recently played the game, which has the working title Awakening, when Mr. Alcaide and two Neurable employees passed through San Francisco, and a few hundred others tried it this month at the Siggraph computer graphics conference in Los Angeles.The prototype is among the earliest fruits of a widespread effort to embrace technology that was once science fiction \u2014 and in some ways still is. Driven by recent investments from the United States government and by the herd mentality that so often characterizes the tech world, a number of a start-ups and bigger companies like Facebook are working on ways to mentally control machines. They are also looking for smoother ways to use virtual reality technology.\u201cNeurotechnology has become cool,\u201d said Ed Boyden, a professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at the M.I.T. Media Lab who advises one of those start-ups.\u201cWith the smartphone, we\u2019re starting to reach the limits of what we can do,\u201d said Doug Clinton, the founder of Loup Ventures, a new venture capital firm that has invested in Neurable. \u201cThese companies are the next step.\u201dAt Neurable, which is based in Boston, Mr. Alcaide and the members of his team are pushing the limits of EEG headsets. Although sensors can read electrical brain activity from outside the skull, it is very difficult to separate the signal from the noise. Using computer algorithms based on research that Mr. Alcaide originally published as a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, Neurable works to read activity with a speed and accuracy that is not usually possible.The algorithms learn from your behavior. Before playing the game, you train them to recognize when you are focusing your attention on an object. A pulse of light bounces around the virtual room, and each time it hits a small colored ball in front of you, you think about the ball. At that moment, when you focus on the light and it stimulates your brain, the system reads the electrical spikes of your brain activity.After you do this for a few minutes, the game learns to recognize when you are concentrating on an item. \u201cWe look at specific brain signals,\u201d Mr. Alcaide said, \u201cand once we understand them, we can use them.\u201dWhen you play the game, the same light bounces around the virtual room. When it hits the item you are thinking about, the system can identify the increase in brain activity.The technique works with equipment that already exists. Neurable\u2019s prototype uses virtual reality goggles from HTC, a consumer electronics company, and seven EEG sensors placed at specific spots around your head. But given the physical limits of what these sensors can read, an EEG-based game is unlikely to do more than slowly and simply select digital objects.Some companies are working to move beyond that. Facebook, for example, is exploring methods for optically reading brain activity from outside the skull. Such a system would shine light into the brain to directly read chemical changes.\u201cWhat if you could type directly from your brain?\u201d Regina Dugan of Facebook said this spring as she unveiled the company\u2019s efforts to build this kind of optical interface. \u201cIt sounds impossible, but it\u2019s closer than you may realize.\u201d In a few years, she said, Facebook hopes to have a system that allows people to type with their thoughts five times faster than they now type using a smartphone keyboard.That is well beyond the realm of current research, and a number of neuroscientists question whether it will ever be possible, arguing that such speed will only come with devices planted inside the skull.Several start-ups are now working to do just that. But some, including a Silicon Valley start-up called Paradromics, hope to do this as a way of treating people with medical conditions like blindness, deafness and paralysis.Implanting hardware in the brain is dangerous, but the reward for patients could outweigh the risks. For companies like Paradromics, the goal is to significantly refine and expand the current methods, providing a faster and more complete way for patients to operate machines with their thoughts.Mr. Musk\u2019s Neuralink is moving in a similar direction, but the company\u2019s ambitions appear to stretch much further, to eventually implanting chips in healthy people\u2019s brains.The dangers of brain surgery make this unlikely. But Mr. Boyden said there were some possibilities.\u201cI do find it implausible that an implant would go directly into the brain of someone with zero health problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if companies take the right approach in helping people with the greatest need, then there may be a way for this to spread into people with less severe conditions, and then eventually become a kind of brain augmentation.\u201dCertainly, many of these projects will be met with skepticism. And Silicon Valley\u2019s enthusiasm does not always mesh with the physical limitations of medicine and the human body.\u201cIn the physical sciences, there are physical boundaries,\u201d said Matt Angle, a neuroscientist and the founder of Paradromics. \u201cTo think that you\u2019ll be able to blow through fundamental laws by sheer ambition and enthusiasm is na\u00efve.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Female Lawyers Can Talk, Too", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAs a Federal District Court judge in New York, I often encountered this courtroom scene: A senior partner in a large law firm would be arguing a motion. I would ask a tough question. He (and it was usually a man) would turn to the young lawyer seated next to him (often a woman). After he conferred with her repeatedly, I would ask myself why she wasn\u2019t doing the arguing, since she knew the case cold.In the 22 years I spent on the federal bench before stepping down last year, not much changed when it came to listening to lawyers. The talking was almost always done by white men. Women often sat at counsel table, but were usually junior and silent. It was a rare day when a woman had a lead role \u2014 even though women have made up about half of law school graduates since the early 1990s.The report found that women were the lead lawyers for private parties barely 20 percent of the time in New York State\u2019s federal and state courts at the trial and appellate levels. Women were twice as likely to appear on behalf of public sector clients. The offices of the United States attorneys, district attorneys, the state attorney general and the corporation counsel of the City of New York, as well as Legal Aid offices and federal defenders, have achieved some level of gender equality in courtroom appearances.But the overall number was dismal: 25 percent in commercial and criminal cases in courtrooms across New York.Why has the private sector failed so badly? The survey was not designed to answer that question, so I can only speculate. But the statistics do tell part of the story. In private sector cases, the client, rather than the government or the court, picks the lawyer. The survey definitively showed that when there was a big, \u201cbet the company\u201d civil case, few clients were prepared to put their business\u2019s fate in the hands of a woman. The more complex the case, the less likely that a woman was lead counsel. The same was true when a criminal defendant retained private counsel.What can be done? Judges, clients and law firms all have a chance to improve this bleak picture. Let\u2019s start with judges. They can suggest that the lawyer who wrote the brief or prepared the witness should be the one to argue. Often it is a woman. Judges are generally more diverse than the lawyers who appear before them. They should bear some responsibility to ensure that the lawyers who speak in court are equally diverse.Clients, particularly corporate clients, can demand that their legal teams be diverse. They should recognize that diversity is an asset in the courtroom. Diverse teams reflect the community, and cases are argued to judges and jurors who reflect the community. Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Facebook, for example, have demanded that the firms representing them field a diverse team of lawyers. I hope other corporations will soon follow.Finally, law firms that hire large numbers of female lawyers, but who, statistics show, often don\u2019t pay them as well as the male lawyers, or promote them at the same rates, must stop paying lip service to diversity and take concrete steps to change.Firms can commit to guaranteeing that junior female lawyers participate in the same number of depositions as their male counterparts. They can ensure that every trial team has at least one woman; that women are meeting clients at the same rate as men; and that bright, aggressive women are given leadership positions in the firm as department heads and managing partners. If they do these things, they will more effectively serve their clients.The more things change, the more they stay the same. I have practiced law in one role or another for more than 40 years. I was only the second female judge on the Brooklyn federal court when I was appointed magistrate judge in 1982. I was the first chairwoman of the state bar\u2019s commercial and federal litigation group, which issued the recent report. I am now engaged in alternative dispute resolution, in which women obtain only 4 percent of international arbitration cases worth at least $1 billion, according to one survey, and between 15 and 25 percent of all arbitrations.Progress for women has been elusive. The barriers to real change have been more daunting than I expected. But if all judges \u2014 male and female \u2014 business leaders and the bar at large want to achieve real gender diversity in the legal profession, they have the power to make it happen. The road map to change is clear.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Think Beet and Goat Cheese Salad Is a Clich\u00e9? A New Recipe Proves It\u2019s a Classic", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. McFadden has a simple rule for seasoning: Everything should taste like a potato chip. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean earthy, crunchy and salty. It means that you want to take another bite, and another, because of what he calls the \u201ctension\u201d between salty and sweet, acidity and richness, and on and on. \u201cThat\u2019s how you make ordinary vegetables taste extraordinary,\u201d he said.This salad illustrates his point perfectly, vibrating with tension between salt and vinegar, softness and crunch, sweetness and tang. Beet and goat cheese salad may seem like a clich\u00e9, but when it\u2019s done right, it makes a convincing argument that it should be considered a classic.Beets are often described as \u201cearthy,\u201d a more lyrical way of saying that they taste like dirt. Earthy is a good flavor note, but it shouldn\u2019t push ahead of all the others. (The compound that produces the taste, geosmin, also flavors new potatoes, carrots and mushrooms, and it\u2019s present in the fresh smell of rain falling on earth, which has its own name: petrichor.)Vinegar and other acids break down geosmin, which is why vinaigrettes and beets are such a good marriage. Opening up that marriage to include cheese is almost always a good idea, especially the big-flavored ones like blue, feta and goat that make this classic recipe complex and satisfying.And yet, although beets, vinaigrette and cheese often inhabit the same bowl, they do not always achieve a lasting union. I have made many a beet and goat cheese salad at home that turned out badly: The beets, however nicely roasted, were bland and earthy; the cheese crumbly and dry.\u201cBeets are like sponges,\u201d he said immediately. \u201cThey soak up anything you throw at them.\u201dThat, he said, is the key to a good beet salad: Dress the beets warm, so the flavors are absorbed, and then dress them again when you serve them, to bring the beet-dressing combination to its peak. (The same rule applies to other root vegetables, like carrots and potatoes.)Similarly, to bring out the best in the cheese, he whips it with a little oil, salt, pepper and milk until loose and fluffy. \u201cIt still tastes like itself, but with a texture and flavor that brings the dish together,\u201d he said, reminiscing about the versions he\u2019s made over the decades. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a time when I wasn\u2019t making beet and goat cheese salad.\u201dThe combination turned up around the Bay Area in the early 1980s, and whizzed down the West Coast to Los Angeles, where Wolfgang Puck molded a camera-ready Hollywood version. He credits the arrival of multicolored and baby beets for turning the heads of the well-heeled crowd at Spago, who had probably never before seen a humble beet on a restaurant menu. His beet and goat cheese napoleons put Mr. Puck on the map, helped define modern California cuisine, and prompted a thousand copycats.Many cooks think of beets as seasonless, ever-present near the onions and carrots at the supermarket. But Mr. McFadden knows his vegetables, having worked on a farm in Maine for almost two years after passing through ambitious New York kitchens like Blue Hill and Momofuku Ssam Bar.The small beets you see at farmers\u2019 markets, early to midsummer, are harvested young. They have tall, appetizing leafy tops and, like baby carrots, they are thin-skinned, juicy and tender enough to eat raw. The hulking, tougher specimens harvested in the fall are around all year. They are the same beets but grown to full maturity and cold-stored for months after the harvest.Steamed early beets are wonderful in this recipe; roasted fall beets make it seasonless. Any color can be used for this recipe, but a combination \u2014 beets come in orange, yellow, white, purple and striped \u2014 produces the most tension. And that\u2019s a good thing.cookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cambridge University Press Removes Academic Articles on Chinese Site", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 One of the world\u2019s oldest and most respected publishing houses, Cambridge University Press, has bowed to pressure from Beijing and removed sensitive content on its site in China.The content is published in China Quarterly, an academic journal run by the press. In a letter made public on social media on Friday, the editor of the journal, Tim Pringle, said Cambridge University Press had informed him that the authorities had ordered it to censor more than 300 articles related to issues like the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the Cultural Revolution. The publishing house\u2019s site risked being shut down if it did not comply with the request, the letter said.In response to the government\u2019s actions, the journal issued a statement expressing its \u201cdeep concern and disappointment.\u201d\u201cWe note, too, that this restriction of academic freedom is not an isolated move but a further reflection of policies that have narrowed the space for public engagement and discussion across Chinese society,\u201d the statement said.Dr. Pringle said in a telephone interview that Chinese academics, who had been publishing in the journal in increasing numbers, would suffer the most. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a retrograde step in principle, but it affects Chinese scholars in particular\u201d he said, because they will not have access to global scholarship on the country.\u201cIt\u2019s a real pity that as China goes out to the world, it is accompanied by restrictions on academic freedom,\u201d he added.Cambridge University Press confirmed the deletions in a statement, saying it had done so to safeguard its other publications. It also vowed to raise censorship with the authorities at meetings next week. \u201cWe will not change the nature of our publishing to make content acceptable in China, and we remain committed to ensuring that access to a wide variety of publishing is possible for academics, researchers, students and teachers in this market,\u201d the publishing house said.Some of the censored articles date from the journal\u2019s founding in the 1960s. They are available to subscribers outside China, but searches in China omit them.In addition, the press voluntarily removed more than 1,000 e-books from its site, according to Dr. Pringle\u2019s letter.Until now, foreign academic presses were largely immune to this sort of censorship. In recent years, the websites of most foreign news organizations have been blocked in China, as have social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and the search engine Google.But because of their small readership, and high subscription costs (one China Quarterly article costs more than $20), academic journals were not targeted.The new measures seem in line with announcements made by President Xi Jinping in February 2016 that all media content on any platform must come under the Communist Party\u2019s \u201cguidance.\u201d\u201cThe same rules apply to any foreign content, academic or otherwise, that is accessible within China,\u201d said David Bandurski, the co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin. \u201cGiven Xi Jinping\u2019s determination to rein in dissenting views in the information space, foreign publishers are misleading themselves if they believe they can escape pressure like that facing China Quarterly.\u201dPerforming the same search within China, however, yields only five hits, either tangential mentions or urban-planning articles about the square.The block appears to go beyond Cambridge University Press\u2019s website to include searches through third-party databases, including JSTOR, a digital library that academics around the world use to perform full-text searches of nearly 2,000 journals, including China Quarterly.As of Friday night, it was unclear whether all JSTOR access was now blocked in China.After news of the censorship spread, academics inside and outside China expressed alarm.\u201cThis is unprecedented that the censorship has reached out to the academic sphere,\u201d said Zhan Jiang, a professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, adding that for Chinese scholars, \u201cThis means that there will be limits and more hardships on their research.\u201dThe block can be bypassed by using software known as a virtual private network, or VPN, which makes it seem as if the user is in a different location. VPNs are commonly used by foreigners and a small minority of Chinese internet users to reach blocked sites.But the vast number of Chinese internet users, including academics, do not have access to reliable VPNs, which require some sort of foreign payment method, like a credit card.Such decisions underline the difficulties of doing business in China while offering any sort of delicate content. Already, foreign media companies including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times have had to ratchet back business plans in China because the government has blocked access to their services, making it hard to attract Chinese readers and slowing advertising revenue.Advertisement"}

The upheaval threatened schools across the state, even ones unaffected by the storm itself, as families flee to San Antonio, Austin, Dallas and other cities with school systems already dealing with their own financial and academic challenges.At an Austin sports arena being used as a shelter, Shirelle Franklin, 31, sat on a cot near her four children, three of whom attend schools in the Coastal Plains town of Victoria, Tex. Ms. Franklin said her family\u2019s apartment complex sustained extensive damage, so she was unsure when she would be able to return home.

Inland schools, too, were closed on Monday, including many east of Austin.A number of local districts, including Houston\u2019s, the state\u2019s largest and the seventh-largest district in the nation, said they hoped that Tuesday, Sept. 5, would be the first day of class. But local and state officials acknowledged that they could not predict exactly when buildings would be safe to re-enter and roads to schools would be passable.\u201cI don\u2019t think we know for sure when everybody will be back,\u201d said Lauren Callahan, a spokeswoman with the Texas Education Agency. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell how many schools have sustained physical damage.\u201dDoug Harris, director of the Education Research Alliance for New Orleans at Tulane University, is an expert on how school systems react to natural disasters. It will be important, he said, for the State of Texas and local schools to be flexible in terms of where displaced or homeless students enroll, and to make sure that struggling families \u2014 including Texas\u2019 many undocumented immigrants \u2014 are comfortable turning to public schools for help.\u201cThe highest priority has to be getting students back to school,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cAnd counseling. There was a lot of trauma after Katrina.\u201dRichard Carranza, superintendent of the Houston Independent School District, estimated that as of Monday afternoon, 35 of the city\u2019s school buildings \u2014 more than 10 percent of the total \u2014 had power failures or had flooded. With rain forecast for days, the damage could get much worse.\u201cIt\u2019s a Houston-wide tragedy, so everybody is being impacted, our employees and our families,\u201d Mr. Carranza said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really transparent that weather conditions and, quite frankly, city infrastructure are going to determine whether we are going to safely be able to open\u201d on Sept. 5, as planned.Charter schools, which educate about a fifth of the city\u2019s public school students, were also affected. Harmony Public Schools, which operates 15 charter schools in the Houston metropolitan area, said that one of its campuses sustained major flood damage. At KIPP Houston, which operates 28 charter schools serving 14,000 students, officials said they were still unable to access many of their buildings to make a full damage assessment. About 40 KIPP Houston families had lost their homes and many had been evacuated.Dawn Kotecki, a teacher at Cesar Chavez High School in southeast Houston, was setting up her social studies classroom with a group of student volunteers on Friday morning, when the principal directed everyone to evacuate the building within minutes \u2014 the hurricane was coming, and the school year would not begin as expected.After Harvey, Chavez students and teachers will face a host of challenges. A bayou behind the building overflowed and reached school grounds, Ms. Kotecki said. And an unknown number of students and teachers were evacuated or had lost their homes.Ms. Kotecki, who was safe at her own home in suburban Pasadena, Tex., said she was raising money and collecting clothing, personal hygiene items and school supplies via Facebook. When Chavez opens for the year, \u201cwe will do a daily check-in\u201d with students, she said. \u201cIs everything O.K. at home? Did you get a good night\u2019s rest? Did you have a good breakfast? If not, we will make sure that they do.\u201dThose 15 struggling schools are clustered in the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, and two to three of their buildings are among those with serious physical damage, according to Mr. Carranza, the superintendent.It is not yet clear if Houston and other Texas school districts have sustained comparable physical damage. Mr. Harris noted that Houston schools are in stronger condition than New Orleans schools were before Katrina: Houston\u2019s buildings were constructed much more recently and are in better shape.Mr. Carranza, the Houston superintendent, said that after the crisis of Hurricane Harvey passes, the district would resume its work turning around the low-performing schools on the state\u2019s watch list.In the short term, however, \u201cI haven\u2019t spent a lot of time thinking about\u201d the potential for a state takeover, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in lifesaving mode.\u201dDavid Montgomery contributed reporting from Austin and Stephanie Saul from New York.Advertisement"}

A Kerfuffle in St. Louis.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sweet story about a grand slam and a cute cat who seemed to inspire it has somehow turned sour in St. Louis. The ownership of the animal is in dispute, and the Cardinals and a local shelter have exchanged, well, catty comments on social media.It all started last week when a bases-loaded situation for the home team at Busch Stadium was interrupted when a small cat raced onto the field. A groundskeeper, Lucas Hackmann, chased the cat down, only to be bitten twice as he tried to carry it off the field, much to the mirth of viewers at the stadium and at home, but probably not to himself.When play finally resumed, Yadier Molina promptly hit a grand slam, and the Cardinals won. The cat was given the name Rally Cat, and in the superstitious ways of baseball received an inordinate share of the credit for the blast.Unfortunately after she left the park, the cat got loose. The Cardinals released a statement hoping that the cat would be found so the team could \u201cproperly care for it.\u201d\u201cRally Cat will be cared for by our team, making the Cardinals clubhouse his home,\u201d Watermon said. \u201cMike and our players are looking forward to loving and caring for him.\u201d That refers to Mike Matheny, the Cardinals manager.It added a slam at Watermon\u2019s \u201cold-school PR tactics,\u201d which prompted him to tell The Post-Dispatch on Thursday \u201cIt is personally hurtful to me, irresponsible and, frankly, childish.\u201dThe Cardinals had planned a \u201cWelcome Home\u201d event for the cat, but its future seems to remain in limbo.It is not the first time a sports team has adopted an animal as a totem of good luck.

Amazon did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.Beijing has become increasingly emboldened in pushing America\u2019s internet giants to follow its local internet laws, which forbid unregistered censorship-evasion software. Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn.The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts.Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues.Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon\u2019s cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall.While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale. In particular Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba runs its own cloud services, which have grown rapidly in China.

Each was recently at the center of a roiling controversy about what it means for white artists to make work about black people\u2019s suffering. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss., the creators of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d recently announced their next project: a series for HBO called \u201cConfederate,\u201d which imagines life in the United States if slavery had never been abolished. The news triggered a firestorm on Twitter, with some people calling for the show\u2019s cancellation. \u201cDetroit,\u201d a new film about racial oppression and police brutality during the 1960s, made by Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, has also caused controversy. When asked by Vanity Fair if she was the ideal person to tell this story, Bigelow said: \u201cNo. However, I\u2019m able to tell this story.\u201d Earlier this year, \u201cOpen Casket,\u201d an impressionist rendering of the viciously beaten body of Emmet Till by the painter Dana Schutz, enraged some visitors to the Whitney Museum of American Art, where it was featured as part of the annual Biennial. And now protesters are calling for the I.C.A. in Boston to cancel a retrospective of Schutz\u2019s work. Questions of who can tell stories about blackness, and specifically, black history and black pain, are being asked all over the place this summer, and we wanted to ask them, too.What right do these creators, who all happen to be white, have to tell black stories? And are these even black stories, or are they American stories? And what of artistic freedom and imagination? Are there instances when this work can be seen as a form of activism, or at the very least, a social good? Are there any criteria by which white creators can successfully make work about blackness?

Welcome back to our show, our pop culture confession booth.WM: Hello.JW: So, what\u2019s on your bucket list this week?WM: Well, okay, I\u2019m just going to throw this out there because I think a lot of people are having a similar problem. Every house I\u2019ve ever been to has this. It\u2019s the, what people call the utility drawer \u2014 that drawer in your kitchen that has rubber bands and screws and braces, and menus and a bunch of other stuff you never, ever, ever, ever use except one time a year when you need the one thing in that drawer of mess. Make the drawer go away. This is my goal for the summer. That drawer is leaving my house. It is just going to be empty. It is going to be a memorial drawer to the utility crap drawer that it used to be. I think everybody should think about doing that this summer. I actually want to know what other people have in that drawer because I think it\u2019s simultaneously amusing and horrifying. It\u2019s a total drawer gone to total waste. Solve your utility drawer, people. Sam Shepherd died. In addition to being a fine actor, he was one of America\u2019s greatest playwrights. I just am so struck by his legacy and his explorations of masculinity and how that has sort of been misapprehended by other artists. And I think he was such an original talent, and the things he was exploring were so specific and native to him that they didn\u2019t \u2014 as much as they commented on American life, they were also these commentaries and these therapy sessions for himself. Basically, my point is people who want to be Sam Shepherd, do not try that at home.JW: Noted.WM: And lastly, I\u2019m in a really bad mood about this Confederate business. The HBO show that was announced last week...I\u2019m trying to figure out where the wrongness line is. I\u2019m not actually opposed to its existence, I just don\u2019t know why you\u2019d want to do it. I don\u2019t have an answer, but I would like to talk to you about trying to arrive at one at some point, if that\u2019s possible.JW: Of course.WM: What\u2019s going on with you?JW: Well, this weekend, I went to see the new Spiderman movie.WM: Yes!JW: And...I really loved it! So, Spiderman: Homecoming was directed by Jon Watts, and you know, for the last couple years, these big superhero movies have been really morose, really depressing, really dark looks at these tormented, existential questions of what does it mean to be a lone man against the world, trying to save it from itself. And this movie did away with all of that. It very much was super lighthearted and fun. It followed Peter Parker as a high school student \u2014 super goofy, a lot of social media. There are a lot of great cameos, including one by Zendaya, who is a former Disney star. The movie itself is very inclusive feeling. There\u2019s a couple of classmates in hijabs, and there\u2019s a lot of brown students. I mean, it feels like a well rounded film. I mean, the main person is still just like a young white dude, so it\u2019s like, don\u2019t give them too many props. But I don\u2019t know. It was just a very nice antidote to the superhero fatigue I\u2019ve been feeling in general. And so, I was very happy to go and it was a great, a great watch.WM: Yes.JW: I also want to shout out the Moon app, which is just the Moon app in the iTunes store, which just tells you where the moon is at in its various lunar cycle. So, it will be like, today, it\u2019s a waxing crescent, or whatever. And as someone who always tries to orient the moon in the sky, it\u2019s also nice to have a little thing on my phone that tells me exactly where it is in its cycle, and I think about where my body is in its cycle, and this app in particular is really cute because it sends you little updates like, hey, girl. It\u2019s like, you know that feeling, half full, half empty? Me too. And it\u2019s like halfway. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s like a funny, it turns the moon into a cute little Pixar character. I just enjoy it very much, so everyone should check it out. It\u2019s cute, it\u2019s free, it\u2019s a lot of fun. Wesley, in our continued search, in our continued quest to think about what the song of the summer might be, I have to tell you that there\u2019s a new contender.WM: Mm mm.JW: I\u2019ve heard this song at the beach, in the grocery store, coming off of people\u2019s bikes. It has a good beat. I\u2019ve been using the lyrics as Instagram captions.[CARDI B SONG PLAYING]JW: So, I just have to shout out Cardi B \u2014 Instagram celebrity, former...you know, character or persona or whatever on Love and Hip Hop: New York, from the Bronx, now a rapper. Like, that song is popping. Like the first time I heard it, I was sort of like, eh, but I\u2019m telling you now, it\u2019s an ear worm. It\u2019s in the running. It\u2019s in the running.WM: I\u2019ll keep it in the running.JW: Put it in your rotation.WM: I\u2019m not a fan. But \u2014JW: I hear you, and I feel like maybe the way you feel about Khaled is how I used to feel about Cardi B, but no, it\u2019s over. She\u2019s legit. Like, that song comes on, and every single woman in the room just starts doing a little...WM: Can I tell you, can I tell you something?JW: What?WM: I thought that was Iggy Azalea the first time I heard it.JW: Shut your face.WM: I...listen, I did. I was like, she\u2019s back? Iggy\u2019s back?JW: Oh my God. It sounds nothing like Iggy. Well, now you know. Cardi B, 24. Fierce. Amazing. Known for such truisms such as, when asked about global warming, says, oh, it never gets cold. I mean, she\u2019s just a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. She\u2019s amazing. Here for it.WM: Maybe she should have recorded that instead.JW: I am also thinking a lot about toxic masculinity, and there have been a lot of comments made by various people including our president about transgendered bodies and transgendered people, and already we\u2019re in this mode of what feels like a tinderbox of violence just waiting to happen. You have that viral video of this woman talking to Somali-American kids about how they\u2019re going to kill all these Muslims. You also have the president talking about police brutality and basically endorsing it, and then you have the president talking about transgender people being a burden. And then you have Charlamagne Tha God on The Breakfast Club basically endorsing the misgendering of Janet Mock, and not saying anything when a guest on the show suggests violence against trans people who don\u2019t disclose that they\u2019re trans. I just \u2014 I feel very gross inside, and my anxiety is ratcheting up and I\u2019m just deeply worried about what\u2019s going on and the state of the country. And I don\u2019t condone any of this violence or any suggests of violence, and I feel like we may not be able to talk about it on this show, but it\u2019s something we all have to keep in the back of our minds and just the ways in which we can be more accommodating to people who are not like us. We can be more accommodating in our workplaces. We can be more advocates. We can go on GLAAD\u2019s website for suggestions on how to advocate for a gender neutral restroom. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of things that we can do in our day to day lives to make other people\u2019s lives easier that are a huge priority, but I\u2019m deeply distressed. Deeply, deeply, deeply distressed right now.WM: So, this administration is doing some crazy stuff to our brains. It is continuing to do crazy stuff to the country. It has got us keyed up in ways that we previously were not, and it has put us on alert for all kinds of offenses and affronts, and they\u2019re all legitimate. This guy never stops. You never know what you\u2019re going to get from him.JW: Ever.WM: You never know who in the administration is going to have a job.JW: So, high key, we\u2019re on high alert.WM: And we kind of should be. Because we have been living in a time during which the people who supported Donald Trump, for instance, were very much interested in combating what they saw as a kind of political correctness. Conversely, there is a real effort underway \u2014 and it\u2019s been underway for years \u2014 to make political corrections when they\u2019re needed.JW: To the historical record.WM: Right. To the historical record, to the living record. I mean, we\u2019re talking about removing Confederate signs from places like New Orleans. We\u2019re talking about removing slaveowners names\u2019 from college campuses, which is what happened to Calhoun College, Yale University, where I went. All of these energies are sort of tempesting around each other, and one of those tempests has boiled over this summer. You have the controversy over this HBO show, Confederate, which has not even been made yet.JW: Just a press release went out. Just a press release went out, which also, you know...next time, do better, guys. Don\u2019t run a press release about a show called Confederate. Anyway. Continue.WM: So, you\u2019ve got that, and then you have this question of whether or not Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, a white woman filmmaker and a white male screenwriter, whether they should have made Detroit, which is set during the 1967 Detroit riots and features a predominantly black cast \u2014 although you need racist police officers, so they\u2019re played by white people. And then this, the controversy that is still not dead over Dana Schutz, her painting of Emmett Till that was featured in the Whitney biennial, and the questions around whether or not she had the right to paint it \u2014 or not so much even whether she had the right to paint it, but what the Whitney museum\u2019s responsibility to its public were in displaying it, in exhibiting it, in including it in the Whitney biennial. So, with that being the kind of summer we\u2019re having, with this movie opening this weekend, it\u2019s going wider this weekend; with Confederate, people still fighting over that \u2014 people are now using \u2014JW: They\u2019re protesting it during Game of Thrones.WM: Game of Thrones!JW: #NoConfederate, which HBO is just like, doesn\u2019t care about.WM: So, what we should try to talk about is the question of...who is right and who\u2019s wrong?JW: The thing is, what we have to talk about though is why these items are flash points right now. Because this is not a new dilemma. This is not a new problem. It\u2019s particularly poignant right now because we are having all these discussions around PC culture, anti-PC culture, political discourse. We also live in a time of hypercommentary in real time and never ending, whereas \u2014 I mean, we live in a time where HBO has to pay attention to a hashtag started on Twitter about a show that is still a twinkle in its creators\u2019 minds. I think there \u2014 it\u2019s a very exciting dialogical time between creators and consumers that we\u2019ve never seen before, and so we may not be able to figure out who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, but at least we can figure out why everyone\u2019s so feisty over it all. And I think there\u2019s a lot to unpack there about what the feelings are that are coming up around a painting by one artist at a moment in time that may not be remembered in the grand, the grandiose scale of art history, and a movie at a point in time that is trying to show something about police brutality when we\u2019re still very much living in that moment.WM: We have no promise to have any questions answered, all we can do is promise to try to work them out. So, when we come back, we\u2019re going to have a conversation focused primarily around the Confederate/Detroit question. And then, we\u2019ll just sort of push out a little bit and talk about history, like a brief history of this problem, and then what institutions and capitalist entities or corporate entities, what responsibility they have in either delimiting it, or having it proliferate. And it is not an absolute yes or no answer to the question of like, who...does X person get to do Y because of their race? We\u2019ll be right back.JW: There are a lot of things we want to talk about. Let\u2019s also just break it down, though. What happened when? Because there\u2019s a lot we want to touch on, but let\u2019s just sort of like lay it out.WM: So, March 16th, the Whitney biennial opens. It features Dana Schutz\u2019s Open Casket, a painting of Emmett Till from the waist up, laying horizontally in the casket. Protests erupt. There was an artist who showed up many, many days.JW: The artist, Parker Bright, shows up with a shirt that says on the back, handwritten, black death spectacle, and just stands in front of the work during the the show.WM: And then, July 19th, fast forward \u2014 this went on all summer, by the way, these back and forths \u2014 Zadie Smith wrote a piece basically expressing a sort of bafflement at the response because a group of artists, including a woman named Hannah Black, wrote a petition, gave it to the Whitney, that basically called for not simply the removal of the painting, but its destruction.JW: Correct.WM: Not only should it not have been made, it no longer needs to exist. That began this series of responses from people like Zadie Smith, who were very thoughtful on the matter of what Dana Schutz should be able and allowed to do as a white woman painting about like a critical aspect of the black experience. But I would also say that it\u2019s not just the black experience. It\u2019s the American experience, and this is one of the things we\u2019re going to have to talk about, too, in terms of who gets to say and do what.JW: Of course.WM: July 19th.JW: HBO announces a show called Confederate from two show runners, Game of Thrones, Game of Thrones is winding down, so in theory, people are interested, what are they going to do next? So, they\u2019re excited that this is what they\u2019re working on, which is very confusing. HBO says in a press release, the show will chronicle the events leading up to the third American civil war. Okay, takes place in an alternative timeline. Southern states have seceded successfully from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution. So, in their description of what the show will contain, there\u2019s like, there\u2019s going to be a Mason-Dixon demilitarized zone, there\u2019ll be freedom fighters, slave hunters, politicians, abolitionists, journalists, the executive slaveholding conglomerate, and families of the people in their thrall. So, after this press release goes out, people on Twitter go nuts, including a woman named April Reign, who was the person behind Oscars So White, the hashtag movement, and essentially, they say, we want HBO to cancel the show and make a different set of series that uplift and showcase marginalized voices.WM: Alright. We\u2019ll come back to that. But the next day \u2014JW: The very next day.WM: There were nine concerned protestors who had written to the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, which was on the verge of opening a Dana Schutz show. The show had been in the works for two years. They had written to the ICA to basically get them to reconsider exhibiting her work. Open Casket is not featured in the show, but nonetheless, they feel that Dana Schutz just showing her work at all is an affront to not only artists of color but people of color and poses a real problem for the city of Boston. Their exact wording in their six page letter was, they wanted to discuss the implications of this exhibit on the community, on the Boston community.JW: Okay. And then, a few days later, on July 26th, the Schutz show opens in Boston. Detroit also opens in New York and LA, and there are a lot of mixed reactions to it. One review called it cathartic. A critic at rogerebert.com essentially said that this movie was a travesty \u2014 not for the reasons portrayed in the film, but because they never want to see a white gaze on black pain again, sparking this debate about who gets to make what film and whether or not Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal had the right to make this movie to begin with, or would it have been in better, more capable hands, I\u2019m using air quotes here, \u201ccapable hands\u201d in the hands of a black director and a producer. So, that\u2019s where we are.WM: And stuff feels like it\u2019s about to start burning.JW: Start popping off. They\u2019re about to pop off, as Barack said. We miss you, Barry.WM: That\u2019s a lot.JW: It\u2019s a lot.WM: The thing that makes it a lot is it meets up with in all of these different ways a whole history of moments in which the question of whether or not a white person can accurately, sufficiently, fairly...not just see from the point of view of an oppressed people, but whether or not that person, that white artist, director, producer, studio, etc., whether that white infrastructure should be able at all to tell the stories of non-white people without the participation of a member of that race \u2014 the prominent participation of a member of that race.JW: And it always feels like the obvious answer should just be like, well, yeah, anyone can make a film about anything. I mean, in theory, right? Like anyone sort of could tackle a topic or tackle a subject or make a piece of art or a film, or write a book, or whatever about another person\u2019s experience. That should be able to be fully and totally rendered. But, at the same time, that\u2019s also assuming that the creator is aware of their own...unconscious biases or their own lens, or their own racialized ideas or stereotypes \u2014 that they may not even been super tapped into themselves \u2014 that they then project onto this narrative that reinforce characters, that reinforce stereotypes. And I think when we were watching Detroit, I was deeply, deeply, deeply uncomfortable with how many lingering shots there were on people looting, close up shots of black skin that wasn\u2019t really that well rendered. Like you couldn\u2019t really see the skin very well, which says something about who is doing the shooting that they\u2019re not familiar with shooting darker skin tones. There were lots of moments where you see black men talking with white women, and the camera work makes it feel vaguely threatening. I mean, there are lots of things that are happening that are reinforcing this, or making you sort of project this idea that blackness is threatening onto the screen. And so, when you\u2019re doing that, capped within a larger film about, that\u2019s trying to take down or eradicate, or throw attention to, throw a light on police brutality, when you watch the police going through Detroit under siege, you\u2019re kind of worried about the police\u2019s safety. And so, when you find yourself \u2014WM: Oh, the D.W. Griffith, Birth of a Nation trick where you\u2019re rooting for the KKK to stop those pesky, awful, demonic, mutant, dehumanized slaves.JW: Right. And so, for me, it\u2019s less of a question about should she have made this film. It\u2019s more of a question, well, can you separate your own white gaze from the subject matter enough to be able to tell it without doing all the things, falling into all the trappings that so many films about blackness already fall into.WM: I was very struck by who the movie was interested in. Like which characters the movie was interested in. Two of the characters are these two white women who are at the hotel, looking for fun, hoping to get lucky with these Negros running around, and they do. But at the same time, they wind up hostages in this house. And I was uncomfortable with the choice \u2014 like with having to sit through a movie called Detroit, but really set in the hallway, as far as I can tell.JW: Right. It could have been anywhere.WM: It could have been anywhere. It\u2019s just set in the back of some staircase, in a couple of rooms, but it\u2019s called Detroit.JW: Right.WM: It was annoying to me that they found the characters they found interesting interesting.JW: Clearly this film, they\u2019re searching for some meaning, and they\u2019re searching for a way to get us to care about this thing that happened at this particular point in time and relate it to where we are in 2017, but it doesn\u2019t quite translate. Like, the film never manages to successfully kind of make you \u2014 and you care about police brutality, sure, but you don\u2019t really ever see yourself fully, I feel anyway, like which character do you empathize with the most? Or which would you align yourself with the most? And I don\u2019t know that you walk out of there aligned with any of them. So what gets lost in translation for this movie, or why was this so hard for them to map on the universal human experience onto the lives of these black men?WM: Because ultimately, they make movies about bureaucrats and soldiers. And in this case, they can\u2019t find a bureaucrat or soldier that\u2019s really interesting and to me, worth caring about. But really, the most interesting people in the movie are the cops.JW: Of course.WM: So, we know that Detroit doesn\u2019t work. We know that it doesn\u2019t work in very particular ways. But we also know that in some ways, one of the things that you don\u2019t quite think is working is the point of view of the movie itself, partially because it doesn\u2019t really have one, but also because it continues to do a lot of what a lot of these movies do, which is to only see black people in terms of their relationship with the police. In terms of \u2014JW: Whiteness.WM: In terms of, well, in terms of whiteness, but also, right. Those guys in the hotel aren\u2019t really that interesting to the movie until these white women become involved too.JW: And really, the juxtaposition of how the white women are treated as brutally as the men more or less kind of serves the purpose of, well, if they\u2019re willing to do that to white women, then my God. You know? And there must be \u2014 they must, they\u2019re animals. And that\u2019s when you know the film is wonky. Like that\u2019s actually when you know the film is wonky. But I had this feeling halfway through the film \u2014 towards the end of the film, I should say, actually \u2014 if you\u2019re a well to do or a well meaning white person, and you\u2019re trying to shed light on a criminal injustice and you have a platform like Kathryn Bigelow and you have the attention of that name, you have the Oscars behind you, I mean...do we just accept this as her kind of social justice warrior offering because no one else is taking that on? I mean, I don\u2019t know. I felt \u2014WM: This is a great question.JW: I felt really desperate at the end of the movie because there is very much still a context for brutality and death at the hand of the police and even with more documentation. Like, we actually happen to know that even if you have it, video footage, if you have body cam footage, it does not lead to a conviction, so we go from a hypothetical scenario where, well, we don\u2019t know what happened to actual real life concrete scenarios where, yeah, in 2017, oftentimes, we know what happened, and it still doesn\u2019t matter. The police still aren\u2019t convicted when they brutalize black bodies that they have in custody. They abuse their power all the time, nonstop. So, when you have someone like Kathryn Bigelow who is like, I\u2019m going to try to put light on this and bring it to the forefront, bring it to the consciousness, I don\u2019t want to fault her for that, as flawed as it is. But then I feel like I\u2019m begging for table scraps.WM: Yes. But this is where it meets up with all this other stuff, right? This is the fight that we\u2019re having over Dana Schutz, in this one painting and now, her entire career basically. And this is also the question that you have to ask about a work like Confederate, which in theory \u2014 because we don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t exist yet \u2014 could it do all of those things that you were hoping and expecting Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s movie to do, right? What problem does it set out for itself, and how does it solve that problem? And is the Game of Thrones model one that you want to see applied to slavery? I don\u2019t know. I feel like there\u2019s got to be some criteria by which to determine whether these works are \u201callowed\u201d to live or die.JW: Well, part of that criteria also has to be one of density, right? Like, part of the reason that people are upset about a show like Confederate is because HBO, they have not historically done a great job of showcasing black life outside of crisis. Outside of tragedy. Outside of dire straights and pain. So, I think part of the outrage comes from, if you\u2019re going to invest a Game of Thrones like budget into a show about black people, if you\u2019re choosing to prey on a fantasy that a lot of people frankly still have in this country \u2014 like, you can\u2019t avoid the fact that we are living under an administration where a lot of people would not be mad if there were Confederate flags everywhere. You know what I mean? That\u2019s what they want.WM: How often do we hear somebody still say, you know, I think they\u2019d be better off as slaves? I mean...JW: So, I think that\u2019s part of the criteria that is, under what circumstances is this work existing? Is it a work in which there are lots of other alternatives to the version of black life that it\u2019s presenting, or not?WM: But it does strike me as peculiarly privileged \u2014 to use like a term I hate \u2014 for these two guys to dream up this story. And now, since the controversy has heated up, they have found two other black people who are involved with the making of the show \u2014JW: I know. Who are producers...WM: Who are producers, who \u2014 those people at that line level never get credit for anything when a show doesn\u2019t even exist yet. And so now, they\u2019re being trotted out not unwisely \u2014JW: I know, I was going to say that. I was like, I thought better of using the word trot out, but they are \u2014WM: But they\u2019re being trotted out!JW: And they said in a statement \u2014 so, there\u2019s two producers, Nichelle Spellman and Malcolm Spellman, who are working on this show, and they said, the four of us are very thoughtful, very serious, and not flip about what we are getting to in any way...I would have loved an opportunity for the conversation to start once the show is on the air. Now, you and I texted about this article back and forth. The one thing we both noticed that was missing from all of this is why? But why do you want to tell this story, and why are you interested in it? We can\u2019t really work with speculation, and we can\u2019t worth with the hypothetical, but tell us more about what you hope to achieve. We don\u2019t know that.WM: Right. They are asking us \u2014 and this is the crazy thing \u2014JW: To trust them.WM: They \u2014 I mean, can you imagine if Dana Schutz had to deal with a press release about a painting she hadn\u2019t even remotely begun to do yet, and the outrage was so intense, you tried to shut her down before she even starts? I\u2019d much, in theory...I\u2019d rather just get the work and deal with the work. And if you don\u2019t, if you think you have something to say about slavery in 2017, bring it. Let me see what you got. But where we are right now is we don\u2019t even want things that get made that run into this problem to exist anymore. The outrage over Dana Schutz, it\u2019s officially reached the point with this ICA show that she shouldn\u2019t even be exhibited anymore.JW: They want to erase her. They want to erase her.WM: She needs to go away.JW: She needs to go away. I think the protests, I think the protests are important, and I think they\u2019re valid. And I think they\u2019re, I don\u2019t think any artist should be erased because they make work that\u2019s controversial whatsoever, but I also think that the response to it does illuminate a bigger deficit or a bigger feeling of lack of attention that\u2019s paid \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the exact same thing that happens with Detroit. People are mad because they don\u2019t understand why this work of art gets so much attention when so many other works of art don\u2019t get any attention that also look at black life that is not necessarily about this particular instance in time. I mean, I think that is...that\u2019s, again, that\u2019s like the politics of scarcity. People feel like there aren\u2019t enough black artists who get to make work about just regular black life, you know? I see you rolling your eyes. I\u2019m not saying this is my point of view, I\u2019m just saying that this is the argument.WM: No, no, no. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m hearing what you\u2019re saying and I\u2019m thinking, and one of my responses to this whole outcry over Open Casket is it completely short circuits the other paintings that are in the biennial that speak to the modern problem of, I don\u2019t know, Henry Taylor had a piece in the biennial of Philando Castile that was eerily reminiscent of another painting. I mean, it had a very sort of Kerry James Marshall feel to it.JW: Yes, absolutely.WM: The piece was called The Times, They Ain\u2019t Changing Fast Enough. And it is similar in some ways to Open Casket, but more imaginative in a sense. Philando Castile is a living being. He is either in an afterlife or a life before this, the incident that took his life. And basically, making Dana Schutz a negative star is almost as troublesome to me as not celebrating Henry Taylor \u2014JW: For his work, or Dana Lawson, who also had a catalogue of amazing, gorgeous photographs.WM: I mean, it was a rich show.JW: It was a very rich show.WM: And black bodies, black life mattered to it.This gets us into a question of the sort of meta politics versus the work itself. I would say in the case of Open Casket, it is an unsuccessful painting on its own terms, but I actually think she\u2019s a really good artist generally. I think the failure of this painting is that it actually is, it is a failed attempt at empathy, and I think her work generally sort of has a much bigger scope to it. And this is not her first painting about death, but its intimacy is cold to me.JW: There is a bit of a cognitive dissonance from when you\u2019re looking at the painting because it is rendered in various abstract forms, and there\u2019s a moment of looking at it and trying to understand what you\u2019re looking at, and then the moment of realization is what distances you from the work.WM: Right.JW: The moment of realization of what you\u2019re looking at, this interpretation of a mangled face that\u2019s represented by like a smear of paint, and who it\u2019s supposed to be \u2014WM: It\u2019s a literal gesture.JW: It\u2019s a literal gesture, and I think that\u2019s to me what\u2019s made it, what made it unsuccessful, embedded within all these other works about black life.WM: There\u2019s also the \u2014 the point for me is, are we talking about the quality of a painting? Are we even allowed to talk about the quality of a painting or the quality of Detroit? Or if \u2014 if God forbid Confederate is good \u2014 what do we do with that? Can it even be good at this point?JW: Can it even be good?WM: And what would good even mean?JW: I\u2019m like deeply skeptical that it\u2019s even going to come out. I feel like the amount of backlash even before this thing comes out is going to...WM: So, I ultimately think they should be allowed to do it, and just have it speak to HBO\u2019s politics, to the creators\u2019 politics, their interests...it says something to me that these two people want to spend their vast Game of Thrones capital on this show. And what upsets me about it is that...I don\u2019t know how you could think this wouldn\u2019t upset people.JW: We live in a society that still disempowers black people, where we\u2019re still recovering from the legacy of slavery. There\u2019s still a lot institutional racism in place that\u2019s started with the institution of slavery and so there is a possibility for a thoughtful commentary on that. We don\u2019t know. HBO has made some great shows. We don\u2019t know what they\u2019re trying to do. But the fact that we still don\u2019t know what they\u2019re trying to do, it\u2019s evident that maybe they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re trying to do, and that certainly no one was really thinking that deeply about what the response would be, which I think is part of the problem that we\u2019re trying to talk about here.JW: So, we\u2019re back, and we just spent a long time arguing \u2014 not arguing \u2014 but just heatedly discussing a couple of very important cultural products that were made by white people or will be made by white people in theory, trying to deal with very particular aspects of the black experience and our discomfort around it. But look, the way the numbers shake out, the odds are always in their favor. There are always probably going to be more white people taking on the black experience and we can\u2019t speculate about motives. We can\u2019t speculate about intentions, really, other than to say that this is something that is so of our time that maybe if you are a white filmmaker/artist/musician/whatever, you feel you have to grapple with these parts of the American experience because it\u2019s coming up, and it\u2019s evoking something in you and maybe you\u2019re well meaning and you\u2019ve got a lot of extra empathy and you want to put your, you want to use some of your power for good. So, so where do we go from here? I mean, I think this question that we\u2019re dancing around is not necessarily who gets to make what and why, but what does it mean to try to do something successfully? Like do we have any examples? I mean, are most examples just total failures?WM: I\u2019m much more interested in some ways in the attempt, and I think that the problem for me isn\u2019t so much that white people can\u2019t have feelings. I mean, the whole thing we\u2019ve been arguing about before this period was that white people weren\u2019t engaged enough with the problem of race, and they didn\u2019t have enough feelings about like, what black people deal with, suffer on a daily basis. And now, we have \u2014 I\u2019m not going to call it a proliferation of such culture \u2014 but I mean, the Drive By Truckers put out an album last year. It was called American band and explicitly dealt with the black experience, so to speak.[DRIVE BY TRUCKERS SONG PLAYING]WM: It is fair to be suspicious of everybody.JW: Yes.WM: It is completely fair. You\u2019d be a fool if you weren\u2019t.JW: Can I just say something really quickly, though?WM: Yes.JW: You just encapsulated the problem, okay? If you\u2019re the Drive By Truckers and you\u2019re most interested in capturing the black experience, maybe that\u2019s the problem, because you\u2019re still not thinking about yourself as white. You\u2019re still obsessing with blackness, so think about whiteness.WM: Well, right. You were correct. I should have reframed that, because that is exactly correct. The thing about that project to me that was so interesting was it was white southerners thinking about black people as white people and not as racists, right. I don\u2019t know that the album really worked. I mean, it\u2019s very specific in its imagery, but it is a real attempt at looking at black people as a white person looking at black people. And that is the thing that we\u2019re actually kind of missing, right? There\u2019s a degree to which the biggest movie of the year \u2014 we\u2019re going to return to it, yet again! \u2014 is Get Out, and the thing that identifies and the reason that it keeps coming the eff up is because it pinpoints something that white people have denied has existed at all, which is liberal racism, which is like good white people doing racist stuff that they don\u2019t think is racist because it doesn\u2019t involve a Confederate flag and it doesn\u2019t involve having a great, great grandfather who was a slave owner. And it doesn\u2019t involve voting for Donald Trump. The language around how we talk about this has focused almost exclusively on one type of white person, and this year, it has shifted. It isn\u2019t just Jeff Sessions. It\u2019s your father in law.JW: It\u2019s your friendly, local neighborhood...white person.WM: It\u2019s the family you marry into.JW: Yeah.WM: And I think that one of the things that we\u2019re really dealing with now in terms of white representation of black anything is the awareness that you are implicated in that. Because that\u2019s not what was happening before. Before, you get people like Rob Reiner making movies about Medgar Evers death from the point of view of the lawyer fighting for Merle Evers in the trial, and the best thing in the movie is James Woods\u2019 depiction of the racist who shot him. So, I do think that there is a shift in terms of not so much how these filmmakers identify as white filmmakers \u2014 because that\u2019s the thing that I think you\u2019re right is missing. These people still don\u2019t think of themselves as white the way we think of ourselves as black.JW: Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Which is why they most could identify with black pain, I think, or historical moments, because it\u2019s the easiest to sort of, I think so, I think it\u2019s the easiest \u2014WM: But isn\u2019t it also like, they are the source of that pain?JW: Right, and they\u2019re not acknowledging it.WM: That\u2019s the guilt, right.JW: There\u2019s the lack of indictment, the lack of willingness to take the next step and really process what that means.WM: What does it mean for a person like Steven Spielberg, who takes a movie like, takes a book like The Color Purple, turns it into a film that lots of black people like and have no superficial problem with, what does it mean to love that movie, and can you tell that a white person made it?JW: We all know a white person made it. It just goes back to hashtag table scraps. We take it because \u2014 no, but for a lot of people...WM: In 1985...JW: That is a real representation of black girlhood and black femininity and there are parts of it that are uncomfortable to watch and parts of it that speak to the black female experience in uncomfortable ways, and when you don\u2019t have anything else, you\u2019ll take what you can get, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. But I also think there\u2019s another shift that\u2019s happened as well, right. Two things are happening. One, we have a hyperawareness of how everybody feels at every single moment, right? Like before, if you didn\u2019t like The Color Purple, who cares? Throw the newspaper out. You don\u2019t have to read the reviews. No one\u2019s coming after you. No one\u2019s sending pizzas to your house and harassing you about it on Twitter. You\u2019re not getting at replied. No one cares. Now, you know right away how people feel about something and you have to wrangle with those opinions. You have to be held accountable. And I think that\u2019s an interesting difference of a word versus censorship, right, and I think people are trying to move towards that as sort of the thing they\u2019re hanging this around, which is that we\u2019re going to hold you accountable to what it means to promote this artist, for what it means to make this movie. I\u2019m not saying you have to listen to everyone\u2019s opinions, but you do have to pay attention them in a way. Or, you don\u2019t have to act on everyone\u2019s opinions, because people have an opinion about everything, but you do, there is a way in which, yeah, HBO now has to deal with this Twitter campaign that\u2019s going to be going on every Sunday until the end of Game of Thrones where people are pissed off. I actually don\u2019t know why the hashtag is #NoConfederate. It should be #GameofThrones \u2014 infiltrate the stream, people, from my brain to yours \u2014 infiltrate the stream. But I\u2019m just saying, at this point, we have a proliferation of opinions. We also have a proliferation of a lot of really meaningful and interesting and evocative and super, super introspective black art, where we didn\u2019t have that before. So, we do have examples of things like Get Out that do raise this question.WM: Well, but we have had this version of black art, but it was cordoned off as black music. And now, what we used to call in the \u201970s black music \u2014 your Steve Wonders, your Parliaments, your music, right \u2014 but now that black music is, I mean, it was in the \u201970s, but now we can only acknowledge it as being only American music, and being pop music. And that means that white people more than they were in the \u201970s are so much more aware of the content of such music. And we co-own all of this stuff, and there\u2019s a way in which only some fingerprints are going to unlock that code. And you might think that yours is good enough to do as a white person, but it probably isn\u2019t.JW: Especially if you are someone who has not grappled with your own identity and you haven\u2019t grappled with the ways in which your people have taken away a humanity and dignity from the people you\u2019re trying to represent. Like, I\u2019m not saying that Kathryn Bigelow isn\u2019t a good white person. She very well might be. I don\u2019t know her. But I\u2019m just saying that making a movie about police brutality that puts you in a position where you have sympathy for the chief of police who is trying to wrangle these guys is not a very effective way to make a film about police brutality. Because what you end up with is a situation in which viewers can go, well, they did their best. And to me, that\u2019s insufficient. So, I do feel like we need more black people in the rooms, we need more non-black POCs in the room, we need more people who have the ability to say, it would be more interesting or maybe more provocative if you rendered this this way, or if you thought about this scene. And it just feels like we don\u2019t have that.WM: Right. Okay. So, to this point, I would just like to quote Henry Taylor who did the Philando Castile painting that was at the Whitney. He was asked in Cultured, this sort of art and architecture culture magazine, by Hamza Walker, about Dana Schutz and whether or not he found the attention that she got upstaging to his work. The gist of his speaking right now, what I\u2019m about to read is in response to the notion of white creation. And basically, he says, I remember cutting that out of the newspaper. He\u2019s talking about Bob Dylan\u2019s song about George Jackson. And he was surprised that Bob Dylan could have written that song. You know, he thought it worked and he thought it was powerful. And so, he asks, should Dylan not have written that song about Ruben Hurricane Carter? Which is The Hurricane, another Bob Dylan song. Should Dylan not have written about Hattie Carroll? So, that\u2019s what I asked myself when Dana did that painting of Emmett Till. People always talk about when is white America going to come to terms or whatever with their history. I don\u2019t know. Is that a start? When I was at the Whitney, I talked to Dana. There was no controversy then. I was just happy to meet her. I like Dana. But I think it has to do with sincerity. Like when I did Sean Bell, a New Yorker who was killed in a hale of bullets by New York police officers, but that effing hit me. Maybe as a mother, she really felt, you know, empathy for this person, you know? We\u2019re all on the same page that there...to the degree that we\u2019re permitting anybody to do anything, the permission stands. Two things matter ultimately. One is the infrastructure that allows everybody to do everything. Right? We could be sitting here having this conversation about why there aren\u2019t enough Asian people doing X, Y, or Z. Why aren\u2019t there more Native Americans doing anything?JW: Indigenous anything, yeah.WM: Why aren\u2019t there more queer people who are just out, making stuff about day to day queer life? More trans people? Etc., etc., etc., etc.JW: We could go on forever. The playing field is not even. This is part of the reason why the outrage is so high.WM: Open the floodgates on the infrastructure.JW: Yes!WM: Thing number one. Right, but it\u2019s easy for me to say that, but one group controls the floodgate.JW: Yes, but that\u2019s what it comes down to. Sorry to interrupt, it\u2019s not just one group, it\u2019s one group\u2019s comfort level, one group\u2019s set of preferences, one group\u2019s set of interests, one group\u2019s priority. One group\u2019s aversion to what they perceive as risk.WM: As threat. Financial risk.JW: Yeah.WM: But also as identity threat. And that is a thing that we do not talk enough about, which is the underpinning of our current government and certain administration. The current president and the people who support him, to some extent, feel threatened by Issa Rae.JW: By everyone else. No, it\u2019s not even \u2014 it\u2019s everyone else. It\u2019s Issa, but it\u2019s \u2014WM: I was throwing a rock!JW: I know you were, but I\u2019m just saying, it\u2019s like...go on, throw a rock. Go on.WM: So, part two: is the work good? Is it good?JW: Right.WM: I think that there\u2019s a way you can do it so that it works.JW: Of course. Absolutely.WM: But the idea that if you fail once that your career ends is insanity to me.JW: Yeah. Well, that\u2019s a new thing, though. That\u2019s a new thing, because \u2014 I\u2019m just saying though, that is a new thing, because \u2014WM: But that is a Trump era thing, right? Because when Mapplethorpe, when Robert Mapplethorpe was taking those pictures of those black men in the 1980s and the late \u201970s, the conversation wasn\u2019t about \u2014 I mean, it was about black pain and his capitalization off of it, but he still got exhibited and he won and everything else.JW: Of course. I just want to say one thing though, quickly, that I think part of what we\u2019re talking about a little bit too is how memory has changed. And memory is a lot more collective now, and so if you weren\u2019t in the art work when Mapplethorpe was taking those pictures or you weren\u2019t privy to them or you encountered them and they made you feel weird and you weren\u2019t sure why, where you would go to find out about that? Where would you go to talk about it? I mean, we live in an era where what bubbles up in social media becomes objects of national attention, because national stories. Like, we\u2019re tapped into a collectiveness and we\u2019re remembering things a lot more collectively and with a lot more longevity, I think, which stands in strange, it feels incongruous considering how much stuff we\u2019re consuming on a day to day basis. But I think we are influenced more by popular opinion and each other than we have been in a very long time. For years, if you \u2014 controversial opinions were published in very particular places, and if you happened to miss them, you probably missed them until you came across them again in college or someone gave you a book of essays, or something that...you know what I mean? There had to have been a system of cultural criticism that found its way to you or you found your way to it in order to engage with it and have a critical thought that maybe you hadn\u2019t encountered before. That\u2019s not the case anymore. So, I do think artists are responsible for their entire body of work. I actually think they are. I don\u2019t think you should \u2014 I mean, you get to do whatever you want to do as many times as you can in your lifetime. I actually fully believe that, but I also think that work is in conversation with itself all the time, and the artist and the whole body. It\u2019s true. Like, Dana Schutz is now being held accountable because memory is collective. Is that a bad thing? I don\u2019t think so. She just has to be able to decide whether she\u2019s going to talk about it or not. Or let people speak on her behalf. There\u2019s no other way around it. But I think that\u2019s good. I think that culturally speaking, that is a very good thing, because ultimately, America is not in the business of saying...ICA is going to let her have her show in Boston. Maybe they\u2019ll have some panels around it, they\u2019re going to do programming.WM: They promised \u2014 yes.JW: Bring in dialogue. That\u2019s the appropriate response. The Whitney hosting tons of panels with Claudia Rankine about the response that work invoked is the right response. The response is not ban her, put her on Shelter Island. And that\u2019s how we move forward. That\u2019s how we move forward, is we have these conversations that are then live streamed on Facebook. Anyone can watch. We use the collapsing of distance that social media, as evil as it can be sometimes, has allowed us \u2014 yeah, we collapse time and space in order to allow more people access to having these conversations and their voices to be heard. That\u2019s one way forward, in my opinion.WM: I think the takeaway is we are not going to shake these problems, and I mean, fundamentally, we belong to each other.JW: And we\u2019re accountable to each other. And America, like that\u2019s the thing where we\u2019re finally figuring out.WM: Guess that\u2019s our show again.JW: No real answer, but hopefully some entertainment along the way.Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine.

What should working women wear to beat the heat? Linen, perhaps a romper. Or you could don the Refugee Dress.Uzi\u2019s co-founder Mari Gustafson said that the dress, priced at $119, was named during the height of the financial crisis, \u201cat a time when we couldn\u2019t see ourselves escaping the reality of a global economy falling apart,\u201d adding that the company wouldn\u2019t name the dress \u201crefugee\u201d today.This week a student at Oxford posted a picture of the sleeveless cotton dress on Facebook, and within hours the company was being barraged by critics on social media.Still, Ms. Gustafson stands by the decision to give the garment a politically charged name. \u201cWhen you create something, you have to give it a name,\u201d she told me on Thursday. \u201cMost of fashion has the most boring names ever because people don\u2019t want to have serious conversations in that realm, but it\u2019s important that we talk about these issues in fashion.\u201dShe\u2019s right about that last point: Fashion can and should engage with political and humanitarian issues. But Uzi went about it the wrong way. It\u2019s just the latest case in the fashion world\u2019s long tradition of tone-deaf branding and promotion.\u201cThe disparity between the media representation and the reality was astounding,\u201d said Mike Snelle, one of the artists. \u201cThese were people, many of them children, escaping untold horrors of war and persecution, living in desperate squalor, abandoned by everyone and vilified in the media.\u201dIn addition to returning to the Jungle several times and raising money to build shelters, mostly for unaccompanied children, the Connor Brothers responded the best way they know how: by creating edited versions of magazine covers and posting them around Britain.As consumers, we should support the brands that are not just talking about the important humanitarian issues of our day but are also contributing to bettering the lives of those affected.\u201cFashion carries meaning, and meaning carries action,\u201d Ms. Semaan said.Advertisement"}

A chorus of gasps rang out among the scattered crowd of about a hundred still gathered at Government Point as the sun disappeared. Then a cheer went up as all dropped into darkness.Tina Foster, here with her family, was nearly in tears.\u201cThat was so amazing \u2014 to witness that in real life,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was kind of life-changing, especially for the kids.\u201dElsewhere in the state\u2019s zone of totality, electronic signs along the highways flashed warnings that stopping was not permitted. The rule was ignored. As the moon swallowed the sun, a rest stop along Interstate 5 overflowed with cars.In Salem, Ore., there were hugs, screams and tears, punctuated by cheers when the planet Venus became visible just before totality.Some viewers expected disappointment as clouds filled skies on their parcel of the path of totality.At Homestead National Monument of America in Beatrice, Neb., the whole thing seemed in doubt.\u201cGo away, clouds,\u201d people chanted briefly as totality approached with the sun mostly obscured by a storm cloud. A few minutes later, when the sun became partially visible, the crowd cheered loudly.When totality started, the sky turned dark, a few sparrows fluttered past and a star became visible. But it was several seconds until the sun poked through a gap in the clouds, prompting gasps and applause.To the southeast, at Rosecrans Memorial Airport near St. Joseph, Mo., many visitors had traveled a long way to be disappointed by cloudy weather.Daniel and Miriam Taylor from Auckland, New Zealand, reached the area around 5 a.m. Eastern time, Monday after a 36-hour trip, and sought to maintain an upbeat attitude.\u201cIt\u2019s out of our control,\u201d Mr. Taylor said.\u201cYeah, we\u2019re pretty chill about it,\u201d Ms. Taylor chimed in. \u201cObviously, it\u2019d be amazing to see it. We were driving into this thunder lightning storm, and we\u2019re just like, \u2018This is part of it. Just being here is part of the atmosphere.\u2019\u201dA few minutes later, when totality hit, the eclipse was visible for a few fleeting seconds, and people all around cheered.But Alex Shaller, 35, said he spent $800 to get to St. Joseph from Worcester, Mass., and that the weather was a bit of a letdown.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as good as it could have been,\u201d he said when asked about the experience. \u201cI feel O.K. Not horrible, just O.K.\u201dIn Charleston, S.C., the last city on the eclipse route before it headed out over the Atlantic, heavy clouds obscured totality.But the hundreds of students gathered at the College of Charleston were ready for a final party anyway, as classes start tomorrow. They hooted and hollered as the moon slowly worked its way across the sun \u2014 a sight that, with glasses, was visible through the clouds. And they screamed again after totality, when a crescent sun again made an appearance.Total solar eclipses offer marvelous opportunities to study Earth\u2019s intimate relationship with the sun. The eclipse\u2019s passage across the United States offered unprecedented opportunities for astronomers and other scientists to study the sun\u2019s mysterious corona and Earth\u2019s ionosphere.But in Carbondale, Ill., where many scientists had gathered because of the duration of the eclipse there, weather almost deprived them of their chance for research.In the football stadium at Southern Illinois University, gigantic, cotton-candy clouds seemingly appeared out of nowhere to block the sun just one hour before totality.\u201cWe\u2019re all excited to be here right now \u2014 as long as that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said as she was interrupted by the first of many giant clouds to shroud the stadium.Anxiety spread across the crowd of thousands in the stadium as clouds queued up to cover the sun.It wasn\u2019t until the second minute and 37th or 38th second that thinner clouds finally passed the eclipse, revealing a sensational diamond ring-like flash that drew deafening cries of excitement throughout the stadium.Ms. Kovac was disappointed, but optimistic.\u201cWe\u2019re backing up our data and hopefully we got at least a second or two because we can get an image out of that, we can still do science with it,\u201d she said.Back in Salem, Ore., students from Williams College had greater fortune with the weather, and said they had succeeded in their goals for gathering data.\u201cIt could not have been better,\u201d said Dr. Pasachoff, who led their team.In Washington, where the sun was about 80 percent obscured by the moon, President Trump, Melania Trump and their son, Barron Trump, took in the scene from the Truman Balcony just after 2:30 p.m. Eastern time.By then, a busybody town had come to a quiet. Government workers clustered outside office buildings while tourists mingled next to the White House, unsure when, and where, to look.Just before the first family appeared, Secret Service agents blew whistles to clear away pedestrians at the southern gates of the White House. Most scattered toward the Washington Monument.A vendor outside the White House grounds selling Trump merchandise said people had come all morning looking to buy glasses for the eclipse, which he did not have.The president waved to the onlookers at the White House and gave a thumbs-up gesture when a reporter inquired about the view. He observed the eclipse at its apex wearing glasses with Mrs. Trump for about 90 seconds.Cathy and Jerry Hickey were laying on their backs in the shadow of the monument, looking to the sky through eclipse glasses. Ms. Hickey had planned to be at the Washington Monument ever since she heard of the eclipse.\u201cIt stands for our country,\u201d she said. And \u201cit points at the sun.\u201dFarther north in New York, where the partially eclipsed sun appeared fitfully behind clouds, a positive mood swept over viewers at the American Museum of Natural History.Nicole Yong, 30, said the event felt like an extension of the weekend and noted that the eclipse seemed to be bringing people together, with \u201ceveryone sharing their glasses, making room for others to sit down, taking only what they need so there\u2019s enough for everyone else.\u201dAt the New York Hall of Science in Queens, children and their parents were in the majority among the hundreds gathered to take in the celestial phenomenon.Patrick Rooney, 45, a New York firefighter from Bayside, arrived at the hall with his welding mask \u2014 protective gear equipped with auto-dimming goggles strong enough to filter out damaging sunlight.He occasionally handed the mask to his son, Patrick, 3, and daughter, Catherine, 4, who all but disappeared from the shoulders up under the adult-sized headgear.Phoebe Flanigan contributed reporting from Depoe Bay, Ore.; Thomas Fuller from Eugene, Ore.; Dennis Overbye from Salem, Ore.; Dave Phillips from Jackson, Wyo.; Julie Turkewitz from Glendo, Wyo.; Mitch Smith from Beatrice, Neb.; Tim O\u2019Neil from St. Louis; Nicholas St. Fleur from Carbondale, Il.; Hollie Deese from Gallatin, Tenn.; Kenneth Chang from Loudon, Tenn.; Henry Fountain from Charleston, S.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Said Bring Your Own BEER", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI Was MisinformedThere is a bear problem in the Catskills these days. Thirty years ago you never saw them. Now they\u2019re pawing through garbage and destroying bird feeders, although a sighting is still special enough to post on Facebook for cool points: \u201cOur bear, last night, in driveway.\u201dThen the inevitable one-upper: \u201cYeah? Well, the other day I found the whole bear family lounging around the pool. Papa bear was firing up the grill.\u201d Naturally when I rented a house in the woods outside of Woodstock this July, I wondered if I had a chance of spotting a bear, too.My landlord, who has lived here for 50 years and was once a wilderness guide, hasn\u2019t seen them much on this property. He saw one once in the woods behind the yard. There was a bear in Woodstock this spring that broke into a house, he says. The conservation guys \u201csent it to heaven.\u201d The problematic critter around here is a woodchuck that\u2019s been destroying the garden. He plans to send the woodchuck to heaven also.He runs through the usual landlord instructions: how not to burn the house down, the owner-specific intricacies of the compost heap. His method: Toss the food waste over the fence into the woods.I settle into country life. Much of that involves battling the kitchen ants, which are the sea gulls of the Catskills \u2014 they see the tiniest crumb, they\u2019re on it. These ants are specks themselves. I thought they were coffee grounds until one of them yelled, \u201cCharge!\u201dI also keep an eye on the woodchuck, which runs like a fat man. I have grown fond of it, and I am relieved to see it is not the garden perp. All it eats is the lawn.I forget about bears. Then, early one morning, I look out my bedroom window and there one is, just a few feet from the house.It\u2019s dark brown and much, much bigger than I expected \u2014 my estimate, based on a full-length mink I once owned, is 400 pounds. It\u2019s enormous; a Smart car with fur. I run upstairs to wake my guest but by the time we come down the bear is gone.I text my landlord:\u201cThe brown ones are afraid of us, right?\u201dHe texts right back:\u201cYes, they are afraid to the extent that they don\u2019t need to protect their young. It was probably looking for ants among the rocks, although compost can attract them. If I were very concerned I would not have a compost pile. It may have been dark brown, but we only have the black bear species here. I would not try cornering it or running past it in a bunny outfit.\u201dThese ants are tiny \u2014 what nutritional value or taste could they have? Bears must have some palate. Still, I hate those ants. If the enemy of my enemy is my friend, does that mean the bear is on my side and we should go for lunch?I also find a lot of vitriol about stupid city people who don\u2019t dispose of garbage properly and even feed wild animals, which annoys me. I might have put out a few cherries for the woodchuck, but we were pals.You know how things get scarier at night, particularly when there are no streetlamps? This is how it goes with me.What I can\u2019t stop thinking about are those bear break-ins. I am not in my 15th-story Manhattan apartment with a doorman who would say to the bear, \u201cIs Joyce expecting you?\u201d and then the wily creature would say, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a surprise. I want to chase her around the house while she hollers. I hear she likes that.\u201d I am in a house in the woods, with a flimsy back door that is mostly glass.Doing a Google search for \u201cbear break-ins\u201d is not helpful. A bear broke through a window into a kid\u2019s bedroom in Alaska; others have smashed through screen doors. Bears have an acute sense of smell; one ripped open a car to get to an empty potato chip bag. There are peaches ripening on my living room table; to a bear three miles away that\u2019s probably like walking past Fairway. If confronted by a black bear stand your ground and speak calmly to it, establishing that you are not prey. If it attacks, use bear spray. (Oh, darn, I forgot to pack it.)I call my college roommate, who for many years had a house in the woods.\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to be afraid of noise,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could put a pot next to your bed and bang on it.\u201d\u201cYou mean like New York in the \u201970s, when you\u2019d hear a noise in the hall and put a kitchen knife next to the pillow?\u201d I say.\u201cYou could also go home,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s your vacation. You don\u2019t have to stay if you\u2019re scared.\u201d\u201cThis was a very expensive house,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not going home because of some stupid irrational fear.\u201dI get off the phone. I put the fragrant peaches in the refrigerator. I lock the flimsy back door. I go to the kitchen and get a big blue Cuisinart pot and a spoon and put them next to my bed.

{"Headline": "\u2018Everyone Deserves an Equal Chance to Get Into College\u2019: Readers React", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere are comments, some edited for length and clarity.Several minorities shared stories about what they perceived as common misconceptions about affirmative action and race-based admissions policies.I\u2019m a black woman who EARNED a double-major from a top 10 school in four years, while working 20 hours during the school year and 60 hours during summers, and went on to EARN an MBA.Nevertheless, I\u2019ve spent my entire adult life having barely-educated white people question my qualifications and would gladly take on the burden of whiteness. Of course, I doubt you would gladly give it up.Really great news for all the Jareds and Beckys with the 3.2s. In a freshman year UCLA course, the professor asked us to raise our hands if we thought black kids were admitted to fill a quota. Most of the class raised their hands.Growing up in Orange County, Calif., it was very common to hear people say it\u2019s \u201cso easy\u201d to get into college if you\u2019re black. Meanwhile, my freshman class at UCLA (2006, 17,872 students), was 2.9 percent black.Do you know how many white people truly and genuinely believe that black people get to go to college for free? I spent the summer between my senior year of high school and freshmen year of college teaching wilderness survival at a boy scout camp.One day I\u2019m sitting at the lunch table taking notes in my course catalog, and one of my fellow counselors asks me what I\u2019m doing. I tell him that I\u2019m trying to figure out which classes I want to take in the fall. He says, \u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t even apply for college.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy?\u201d, and he literally says, \u201cCan\u2019t afford it. I\u2019m white, so you know, it isn\u2019t free for me.\u201d Y\u2019all I just stared at him.Other readers, many who identified themselves as minorities, said they disagreed with race-conscious affirmative action policies.I\u2019m a Black man. As a person, I would like to go to a college not because I\u2019m Black, but because I deserve to be there. If there should be an affirmative action, let it be in favor of the poor, through investment in early education, after school programs, etc.Obviously I\u2019m biased because, look at my name! I\u2019m Asian. My Asian roommate in college works her butt off to maintain a 3.9 for med school but a black friend of mine got into med school with a 3.3 GPA (we are from the same university, mind you).Someone tell me that this is not reverse discrimination. Universities/med schools/institutions alike should disclose these information so that people like my roommate are not left in discouragement.I always felt affirmative action was reverse racism, and this is obviously coming from a Latino. Everyone deserves an equal chance to get into college!Long overdue. Ever since I was 16 and applying for college, I never understood the logic behind \u201cfighting racism with racism.\u201dPositive discrimination is still a discrimination. This is why we voted for Trump.Some readers questioned the administration\u2019s motives and whether the issue merited such attention.Maybe you should consider the idea that the problem isn\u2019t Asian-Americans vs. blacks/Latinos but whites vs non-whites? Yes, the system might be unfair against Asian-American students, but decreasing the number of black and Latino students in our colleges is NOT the solution.Perhaps affirmative action isn\u2019t the best solution; however, Asian-Americans who make this issue about themselves need to open a history book and realize that the Trump administration isn\u2019t throwing them a bone.It\u2019s also a bit sad the most pressing concern for so many of us Asian-Americans is the possibility we might have to go to Duke instead of Harvard. Talk about a first world problem.As an Asian-American who also fled a war and made it by conventional standards in America, I have always believed that if you are truly the cream of the crop, you will succeed despite affirmative action.I also get annoyed at Asian-Americans who are against affirmative action because, we should acknowledge that and realize that when other ethnic minorities are discriminated against or lose, we will too.Remember when Trump told black voters, Vote for me! What have you got to lose! Apparently a lot.Some called into question legacy admissions \u2014 giving preference to students whose parents had attended the same school \u2014 and whether an investigation by the Justice Department would look into those policies. Those policies, readers suggested, benefited Trump, his children and their spouses, including Jared Kushner.Is Trump going to investigate how his son-in-law was mysteriously admitted to Harvard after his father made a multimillion dollar donation?Would the Trump children have gained admittance to Wharton without Trump\u2019s deep pockets? That\u2019s the real scandal in all of this.Advertisement"}

Change comes with dogged, on-the-ground work, not a list of demands, according to Harvard Resistance School.Marshall Ganz, shirt sleeves rolled up, spread his arms wide with a \u201cjoin me.\u201d Hands came together, slowly at first, then in a flurry of rapid, synchronized thwacks. A member of the old left \u2014 he dropped out of Harvard in 1964 to fight for civil rights in Mississippi and for California farmworkers with Cesar Chavez \u2014 Dr. Ganz was teaching the unity clap, the audible calling card of the United Farmworkers of America 50 years earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s not a trivial thing at all,\u201d said Dr. Ganz, who had returned to his studies and is now a Harvard professor. Clapping is a collective action that builds cohesion and gets attention, and chanting is \u201ca way of celebrating and honoring the values that are being enacted through this work.\u201dThis was the fun stuff. Political organizing is tedious. It involves gathering people, setting group norms, defining roles and goals. And dogged on-the-ground labor.These also happen to be the core aims of Dr. Ganz\u2019s audience, members of an unsanctioned \u201cschool\u201d created last spring by Harvard graduate students cold-cocked by the Trump victory. For those on the left, the election yanked away the scrim of sweet reason.\u201cFor a long time we have been able to think that things have been pretty O.K.,\u201d said Yasmin Radjy, one of 11 founders of the Resistance School, four sessions on political advocacy and action held in a lecture hall at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Opposing forces now look more threatening. It is what spurred the students to invite professors and political veterans to lecture on the tools necessary to drive sustainable political change. Semester two is in the works.The Resistance School focuses on \u201cpractical skills for taking back America\u201d at a moment when front-porch politicking seems lost to likes and shares, online memes and long lists of diversity demands.A 50-person army, many in their navy blue Resistance School T-shirts, operated in teams with elflike efficiency at the Kennedy School, working at odd hours to produce video highlights, lecture notes, syllabus materials and homework assignments. During lectures, students gathered in the \u201cwar room,\u201d its conference table dotted with room-temperature pizza slices, to live tweet and select questions for the speaker from Facebook submissions.In a wave of interest that surprised the founders, the videos have had more than 175,000 views; Yale and Grinnell students held \u201cwatch parties.\u201dThe point of the Resistance School is to support groups like Ms. Vyedin\u2019s in promoting progressive values, including in city councils and state legislatures. \u201cWe feel it is a mistake to make it all about the presidency,\u201d said Ms. Radjy, who graduated in May. Yet the election made clear that, \u201cas a generation, we are not as politically trained as we should be.\u201d\u201cPolitics requires in-person, face-to-face interactions,\u201d she said, which is why homework assignments call for live conversations and group gatherings. \u201cIf you are not used to negotiating and listening to the other side, it\u2019s easy to caricature the other side,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Germany Accuses Vietnam of Abducting Asylum-Seeking Executive", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Trinh Xuan Thanh, a high-powered construction executive in Vietnam, fled the country last year amid accusations of economic mismanagement and ended up in Germany, where he applied for asylum. Officials in Berlin were scheduled to hear his case on July 24, but he didn\u2019t show up.Mr. Thanh, 51, became the subject of an unusual and mysterious diplomatic spat on Wednesday, when Germany publicly accused Vietnam of abducting Mr. Thanh and forcibly returning him to Vietnam.On Thursday, Vietnamese officials offered a vague statement of regret, and in the evening, state-run television broadcast images of a haggard-looking Mr. Thanh.\u201cWith encouragement from my family and friends, I came back to Vietnam and turned myself in to seek the forgiveness of the party, the government and the law,\u201d Mr. Thanh said in the broadcast, referring to the ruling Communist Party.It was not clear if his statement was sincere or coerced.The two countries have growing trade ties but strong disagreements over Vietnam\u2019s approach to human rights. Critics say that the case illustrates how Vietnam\u2019s one-party government is apparently willing to pursue its domestic enemies overseas.In Berlin on Wednesday, a spokesman for Germany\u2019s Foreign Office, Martin Sch\u00e4fer, told reporters that there was \u201cno longer any serious doubt\u201d that Vietnamese diplomats and intelligence agents had participated in what he said was Mr. Thanh\u2019s kidnapping.\u201cWe reserve the right to draw further consequences if necessary at a political, economic and development policy level,\u201d Mr. Schaefer said.Mr. Thanh\u2019s lawyer, Victor Pfaff, told Reuters that he was abducted on July 23 outside a Sheraton Hotel in the Tiergarten district of Berlin and driven away in a car with Czech plates. Mr. Pfaff said that Mr. Thanh arrived in Germany in August 2016, after a four-day journey through Laos, Thailand and Turkey, and that his wife and two children were in Berlin while another son stayed in Vietnam.Vietnamese officials offered a generic statement on Thursday that did little to clear up the mystery.Le Thi Thu Hang, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said the statement by Germany\u2019s Foreign Office was \u201cvery regrettable.\u201d She added that Vietnam \u201calways attaches great importance\u201d to Vietnamese-German strategic relations.The two countries also have a cultural connection in part because some Vietnamese people lived and worked in East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The German Embassy is a major sponsor of the arts in Vietnam, and the Foreign Office says that Vietnamese people who lived in Germany are a bridge to what it calls a \u201cunique relationship in Asia.\u201dBut among foreign governments in Vietnam, Berlin has long been among the most outspoken about Hanoi\u2019s human rights record. Human rights officers from the German Embassy are in regular contact with Vietnamese political dissidents, and the embassy regularly posts about human rights issues on social media.Rights activists have said for years that Vietnam imprisons many of its domestic critics under vague national security laws, and that Vietnamese plainclothes officers regularly intimidate and harass dissidents and their families.Mr. Thanh\u2019s case has received widespread attention on Vietnamese-language social media this week. Many were skeptical that he had returned voluntarily; others applauded the government for arresting Mr. Thanh, saying it was an important step in a long battle against corruption.Mr. Thanh was dismissed from Vietnam\u2019s National Assembly last year and accused of economic mismanagement that resulted in losses of about $147 million. He had been a senior official in the southern province of Hau Giang and the chairman of PetroVietnam Construction, a subsidiary of the state oil giant PetroVietnam.He had been unpopular in Vietnam ever since local newspapers reported that he drove a luxury car and owned a large property.\u201cHe could not buy them with the income of an S.O.E. official,\u201d said Ngo Quy Nham, a senior lecturer in management at the Foreign Trade University in Hanoi, referring to state-owned enterprises.Le Ngoc Son, a doctoral candidate in crisis communication management at Ilmenau University of Technology in Germany, said that while he did not care for Mr. Thanh, he worried about how he was apprehended.The technique of the arrest is \u201csomething that needs to be discussed,\u201d Mr. Son wrote on Facebook on Thursday evening. \u201cCompliance with German and international law is a must for any civilized country.\u201dChau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi, Vietnam.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney, Ditching Netflix, Grabs a New Key to the Kingdom", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIs content still king?It was Bill Gates of Microsoft who declared it so in 1996, but the proposition has been repeated so often by Disney executives that it could have served as the company\u2019s corporate slogan.When AT&T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said the deal proved yet again that \u201ccontent is king.\u201d\u201cIs the network \u2014 the platform \u2014 now most important?\u201d asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution \u2014 and a potential new revenue source.These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\u201cAnyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,\u201d said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.\u201dNetflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney\u2019s popular children\u2019s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney\u2019s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming \u2014 especially in the coveted children\u2019s market long dominated by Disney.Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children\u2019s programming.\u201cDisney served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix \u201chas reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn\u2019t really need Disney anymore.\u201dThe question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.And it\u2019s hedging its bet. For now, Disney\u2019s Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn\u2019t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s Disney \u2014 and only a few others.\u201cAfter Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\u201cDisney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cBut they\u2019re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they\u2019ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.\u201dAs Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney\u2019s move is putting \u201ca very settled and successful part of the business model\u201d at risk and \u201cmore aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dMr. Olson agreed. \u201cIf anyone can do it from a content perspective, it\u2019s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming from way behind.\u201dInvestors didn\u2019t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney\u2019s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company\u2019s move wasn\u2019t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. \u201cWe can both do really well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no zero-sum game here.\u201dAlthough it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney\u2019s move into direct-to-consumer distribution \u2014 not to mention the tech world\u2019s rush into original programming \u2014 demonstrates that \u201ccontent is everything these days.\u201dUnlike the old world of cable and broadcast, \u201cthe barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,\u201d he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. \u201cAll the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We\u2019re already good at both.\u201d (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)In short, from Disney\u2019s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, \u201ccontent is more king than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gun Rights and Foster Care Restrictions Collide in Michigan", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "A couple have challenged a state law that bars foster parents from carrying concealed weapons in a case that may have nationwide implications.Supported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Bill Johnson\u2019s grandfather taught him how to shoot when he was just 9 years old, and gave him his first gun \u2014 a Mossberg 16-gauge, bolt-action shotgun \u2014 when he turned 14. When Mr. Johnson joined the Marines at 17, he was issued an assault rifle. And he has carried a concealed handgun, with a permit, for the past decade.But now Mr. Johnson says he has been forced to give up carrying his gun \u201cunder duress.\u201d The reason? He wants to become a foster parent to his grandson.In a case that could have implications for gun owners nationwide, Mr. Johnson and his wife, Jill, are suing their home state, Michigan, which bars foster parents from carrying concealed weapons. At issue is whether the state\u2019s rules amount to a \u201cfunctional ban\u201d on owning a firearm, in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment.\u201cThis is not a case that\u2019s outlandish or off the wall,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of a book on the gun rights movement. \u201cFoster parents do have constitutional rights, and they don\u2019t forsake those rights just because they become foster parents.\u201dMost states have regulations governing gun ownership for foster parents; having guns locked and stored in safes, with ammunition locked and stored separately, is a standard requirement. The goal is to ensure the safety of children, many of them troubled, in foster care.But around the country, some foster parents and lawmakers, as well as gun rights advocates, are pushing back, especially in states that bar concealed permit-holders from carrying their weapons if they are caring for foster children.In 2011, Texas lawmakers passed a measure explicitly allowing foster parents to carry weapons in their cars. In Nevada, the State Legislature adopted a bill in 2015 that overturned state regulations and explicitly allowed foster parents to possess guns if they are law enforcement officers or have permits to carry concealed weapons.\u201cWe felt that it wasn\u2019t right for them to have this ridiculous ruling, because there are so many families out there that use firearms for protection,\u201d said Valerie Wilson, 42, who, along with her husband, Brian, was denied a foster license in Las Vegas because Mr. Wilson carried a gun with a concealed carry permit.The couple successfully lobbied the Legislature to change the law, but have been barred from reapplying under the new rules, Ms. Wilson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get our family,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know we\u2019ve helped a lot of kids and families.\u201d\u201cBecoming a foster parent is not a right, it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d Mr. Santana said.The Michigan lawsuit has set off intense debate in foster parent circles, said John DeGarmo, a consultant to foster care agencies. When he posted a news article about the case on his Facebook page, he said, \u201cthe discussion was very, very heated among foster parents, and I found that foster parents are very much in agreement that they deserve to have guns in their home.\u201d\u201cFoster families have been able to have guns in the house to go hunting, that sort of thing, so long as they\u2019re locked up and the bullets are in a separate room,\u201d she said. \u201cBut personal carry is a whole different thing.\u201dThe first suit, against the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, was dismissed by a federal judge in May; the court deemed the case moot because the state had abandoned a requirement that foster parents sign a \u201cweapons safety agreement.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Oklahoma agency said the agreement, drafted by an employee, did not constitute official policy; the agency is now reviewing and updating its gun regulations.A second case, in Illinois, is set for a court hearing next year. It is similar to the Michigan case, which argues that the state\u2019s regulations \u2014 including a requirement that ammunition be stored separately from unloaded weapons \u2014 are tantamount to an unconstitutional ban on gun ownership for foster parents.In its handbook for foster and adoptive parents, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services requires that firearms be \u201cstored in a locked metal or solid wood gun case, or trigger-locked and stored without ammunition in a locked area.\u201d The agency also requires that all ammunition be locked up and that handguns be registered.\u201cThis is not about coffee tables, this is not about leaving it on the nightstand,\u201d said David Sigale, the lawyer for the Johnsons. \u201cThis is about being able to carry it on your person both in and out of the home.\u201dA spokesman for the Michigan agency declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.The Johnsons\u2019 suit, filed in July in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, raises \u201cpretty significant constitutional concerns,\u201d said Clark Neily, an expert on the Second Amendment at the Cato Institute, a libertarian-leaning research organization in Washington.For the Johnsons, who live in a rural hamlet in northwest Michigan near Lake Superior, guns are a way of life. Bill Johnson is a disabled veteran; Jill Johnson owns a fishing tackle shop. Mr. Johnson said he had fond memories of hunting with his grandfather, who hunted and fished to feed his family. He has already purchased a BB gun for his 5-year-old grandson, and hopes to teach him how to use it.\u201cIt\u2019s a tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cMy grandfather taught me, and my grandfather\u2019s grandfather taught him.\u201dThe Johnsons say the state asked them to become foster parents to the child, who was removed from his mother\u2019s care. Mr. Johnson said he had nine weapons, which he keeps for self-defense, not only against humans, but also against the animals \u2014 coyote and bear \u2014 that roam the woods near his home. With the exception of his handgun, his practice has been to keep all the weapons locked up, he said.In court documents and in an interview, he described heated exchanges with state officials over it.\u201cThey told me flat out, \u2018You are going to have to give up some constitutional rights here if you want to keep that boy,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an expert on the Second Amendment at the Cato Institute.

It was the sharpest daily decline in the benchmark S.&P. 500 since May 17.Gold held at $1,283.70 an ounce after its strong run of late, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan steadied from its fall on Wednesday, closing at 19,730. The relative safety of United States Treasury securities continued to appeal, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 2.20 percent from 2.25 percent on Wednesday. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions from each other.)At the root of investors\u2019 nervousness was a jump in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the index measures investor expectations that stocks will experience sharp moves in the future.On Thursday, the VIX surged 44 percent from its historically low levels to close the day at 16.04, its highest close since Election Day in November.For many weeks this year, the VIX hovered persistently in single-digit territory, unusual for a barometer that historically trades around 20.The index\u2019s long period of placidity amid constant upheaval in Washington has posed a persistent riddle for Wall Street prognosticators.Some analysts warned that expectations of low volatility had lured a rush of recent investment, particularly from retail investors piling into exchange traded funds tied to the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and other indexes and strategies.A sharp upward trend in the VIX could well prompt many of those newcomers to flee at the same time, which could turn a market downturn into something more severe.The potential risks extend beyond those who are new to the party. In recent years, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into risk parity and other machine-driven funds that are programmed to start selling stocks and bonds once volatility rises sharply.In a period of investment calm and artificially low interest rates, automated funds, which churn out consistent if unspectacular returns, have become very popular among yield-hungry investors.\u201cBy definition, investors tend to be long the most risk when volatility is at its lowest levels,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investments. \u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201dAfter many years in which investors made a mint by betting against the VIX, a number of investors have begun to argue that the time has come to wager on the VIX \u2014 not against it.Of course, it may be too early to predict the end of one of the longest bull markets in financial history. The global economy continues to grow, and companies in the United States remain highly profitable, with earnings and sales in the quarter that ended in June handily beating expectations.The VIX\u2019s sharp move could also simply be a reversion to its mean and not a sign of panic in the markets.Analysts noted that a long period of stock market calm is highly unusual and that a correction should not come as a shock.Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm, said that before today\u2019s sell-off, the S.&P. 500 had experienced only two down days of more than 1 percent this year; the last similarly long period of financial calm was in 1964.That reserve of buying power, be it retail or institutional, has cushioned stock market drops in the past, and optimists are hoping that it will do so again.Advertisement"}

But it has that same creamy-chunky texture, with each piece of potato coated in a highly seasoned dressing that\u2019s thicker than usual. The starch in those overcooked tubers helps the dressing cling to the potato chunks, instead of falling off like so many vinaigrettes can.Because the potato salad is so delightfully soft, the scallions here provide the only textural contrast. Make sure to get crisp ones, and use the full amount. Or substitute crunchy shallot, onion or even celery, if you are avoiding alliums.The key to achieving the right ratio of chunks-to-pur\u00e9e is mostly in the mixing. After adding the soft potatoes to the dressing, stir them vigorously with a spoon, but don\u2019t break out the masher (or a fork). You want the majority of potatoes in bite-size pieces for texture against the fleecy dressing.Also, be sure to cook the potatoes just past when you would drain them for salad, about two minutes longer, until a fork plunged into the flesh is met with no resistance.If your potatoes turn out a bit firmer than that, and don\u2019t begin to fall apart when you mix, fear not. You\u2019ll just end up with a lovely bowl of regular potato salad. You could even say you planned it that way.cookingAdvertisement"}

Two customers from Japan had just spent $1,800. The average Burning Man customer spent $600, Mr. Geist said.Kostume Kult arranged for five shipping container loads to be trucked from Brooklyn to Nevada this year and charged Burners to transport their stuff in them, round-trip. \u201cConsidering you\u2019d have to drag your luggage all over God\u2019s creation,\u201d said Mr. Glaser, \u201cIt\u2019s much easier.\u201dAccording to Mr. Glaser, costumes tend to break down into two broad categories: the fabulous, which take the Burning Man style to extravagant heights; and the thematic, which, like cosplay, are more about fantastical characters, like a Darth Vader bunny. He called the categories \u201cchic\u201d and \u201cgeek.\u201dAll costumes have to be \u201cde-MOOPed\u201d for the event, Mr. Glaser said, explaining that MOOP is short for Matter Out Of Place, like feathers, sequins and glitter, that make it harder to clean the desert after the event.\u201cI\u2019m a ski instructor in Utah in the winter, so I travel a lot, I thrift,\u201d Ms. Coniglio said. \u201cThe unusual stuff is just sitting there waiting for me.\u201d She held up a long shimmering tube with a round opening for a face. \u201cIt\u2019s a giant spoon.\u201dWhether chic or geek at heart, the majority of last-minute Burning Man shoppers had one thing in common, according to clothes sellers: They were men.\u201cI guess guys don\u2019t think about it until it\u2019s really the last minute,\u201d said Ms. Coniglio. Now they were running around the city in August, looking for the perfect fur coat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Was an Italian Graduate Student Tortured and Murdered in Egypt?", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "FeatureThe strange twists in the case of Giulio Regeni\u2019s disappearance in Cairo.Supported byLeggere in ItalianoHe arrived in Cairo a few months earlier to conduct research for his doctorate at Cambridge. Raised in a small village near Trieste by a sales manager father and a schoolteacher mother, Regeni, a 28-year-old leftist, was enthralled by the revolutionary spirit of the Arab Spring. In 2011, when demonstrations erupted in Tahrir Square, leading to the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, he was finishing a degree in Arabic and politics at Leeds University. He was in Cairo in 2013, working as an intern at a United Nations agency, when a second wave of protests led the military to oust Egypt\u2019s newly elected president, the Islamist Mohamed Morsi, and put Sisi in charge. Like many Egyptians who had grown hostile to Morsi\u2019s overreaching government, Regeni approved of this development. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s part of the revolutionary process,\u2019\u2019 he wrote an English friend, Bernard Goyder, in early August. Then, less than two weeks later, Sisi\u2019s security forces killed 800 Morsi supporters in a single day, the worst state-sponsored massacre in Egypt\u2019s history. It was the beginning of a long spiral of repression. Regeni soon left for England, where he started work for Oxford Analytica, a business-research firm.From afar, Regeni followed Sisi\u2019s government closely. He wrote reports on North Africa, analyzing political and economic trends, and after a year had saved enough money to start on his doctorate in development studies at Cambridge. He decided to focus on Egypt\u2019s independent unions, whose series of unprecedented strikes, starting in 2006, had primed the public for the revolt against Mubarak; now, with the Arab Spring in tatters, Regeni saw the unions as a fragile hope for Egypt\u2019s battered democracy. After 2011 their numbers exploded, multiplying from four to thousands. There were unions for everything: butchers and theater attendants, well diggers and miners, gas-bill collectors and extras in the trashy TV soap operas that played during the holy month of Ramadan. There was even an Independent Trade Union for Dwarfs. Guided by his supervisor, a noted Egyptian academic at Cambridge who had written critically of Sisi, Regeni chose to study the street vendors \u2014 young men from distant villages who scratched out a living on the sidewalks of Cairo. Regeni plunged into their world, hoping to assess their union\u2019s potential to drive political and social change.But by 2015 that kind of cultural immersion, long favored by budding Arabists, was no longer easy. A pall of suspicion had fallen over Cairo. The press had been muzzled, lawyers and journalists were regularly harassed and informants filled Cairo\u2019s downtown cafes. The police raided the office where Regeni conducted interviews; wild tales of foreign conspiracies regularly aired on government TV channels.He spent hours interviewing street vendors in Heliopolis and at the small market behind the Ramses train station. To win their trust, he ate from the same grubby street carts as his subjects; his academic supervisor at American University warned he would get food poisoning. Regeni didn\u2019t care: He glided through Cairo with a quiet sense of purpose.By chance, Valeriia Vitynska, a Ukrainian he met in Berlin four years earlier, had come to Cairo for work. They reconnected. \u2018\u2018She was more beautiful than I remembered,\u2019\u2019 he texted a friend. They took a trip to the Red Sea, and when she returned to her job in Kiev, they kept the relationship going over Skype. \u2018\u2018It was very intense and beautiful,\u2019\u2019 Regeni\u2019s friend Paz Z\u00e1rate told me. \u2018\u2018He was so joyful, so full of hope for the future.\u2019\u2019Yet Regeni was also conscious of Cairo\u2019s dangers. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very depressing,\u2019\u2019 he wrote Goyder a month into his stay. \u2018\u2018Everyone is superaware of the games that are going on.\u2019\u2019 In December he attended a meeting of trade-union activists in central Cairo and wrote about it, under a pseudonym, for a small Italian news service. During the meeting, he told friends, he spotted a veiled young woman taking his picture with her cellphone. It was disconcerting. Regeni complained to friends that some street vendors were hassling him for favors, like new cellphones. Then his relationship with his main contact, a burly man in his 40s named Mohamed Abdullah, took a strange turn.Two weeks later, on the fifth anniversary of the 2011 uprising, Cairo was in lockdown. Tahrir Square was deserted except for 100 or so government supporters bused in to wave Sisi signs and take selfies with the riot police. The security services had been rounding up potential protesters for weeks, raiding downtown apartments and cafes. Like most Cairenes, Regeni spent the day at home, working and listening to music. Once darkness fell he deemed it safe to leave the apartment: An Italian friend had invited him to a birthday party for an Egyptian leftist. They\u2019d arranged to meet at a cafe near Tahrir Square.Before heading out, Regeni listened to a Coldplay song \u2014 \u2018\u2018A Rush of Blood to the Head\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and texted Vitynska. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out,\u2019\u2019 he announced at 7:41 p.m. It was a short walk to the subway. But by 8:18 Regeni still had not arrived. His Italian friend began trying to contact him \u2014 at first with texts, then with frantic calls.State Security was renamed the National Security Agency, but it remained under the control of the powerful Interior Ministry, which was thought to employ at least 1.5 million police officers, security agents and informants. Officers who had been fired were reinstated and the torture chambers reopened. Opposition leaders, fearing arrest, fled the country. Human rights monitors started to count the numbers of the \u2018\u2018disappeared\u2019\u2019 \u2014 critics who vanished into state custody without arrest or trial \u2014 until the monitors, too, began to disappear.Today, Egypt is arguably a harsher place than it ever was under Mubarak. After seizing power, Sisi was elected president in 2014 with 97 percent of the vote. Parliament is stuffed with his supporters, and the jails are filled with his opponents \u2014 40,000 people, by most counts, primarily from the banned Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist organization founded in 1928, but also lawyers, journalists and aid workers. Sisi justifies these measures by pointing to the danger from extremists. Islamic State militants have been fighting Egyptian soldiers in Sinai since 2014; this year they sent suicide bombers into Coptic churches, killing dozens. A good number of Egyptians worry that without a firm hand, their nation of 93 million could become the next Syria, Libya or Iraq. Most of the country\u2019s elites, fearing the kind of upheaval that followed the Arab Spring, are firmly with Sisi; many of its intellectuals, dismayed by their short-lived experiment with democracy, admit that they are out of ideas.Unaffiliated with a political party, Sisi draws his authority from the totems of the state \u2014 generals, judges and security chiefs \u2014 who are increasingly powerful. The guiding principle of this incipient police state is to prevent a recurrence of the events of 2011, one Western ambassador, who asked to remain unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the subject, told me as we sat in his garden last winter. In his final decade in power, Mubarak made a number of concessions. The Muslim Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Parliament; the press enjoyed a measure of freedom; some labor strikes were grudgingly permitted. But none of this saved Mubarak \u2014 in fact, in the view of Sisi officials, his laxity hastened his demise. The lesson was clear: \u2018\u2018To give an inch is a mistake,\u2019\u2019 the ambassador said, listing the characteristics of the Sisi regime, \u2018\u2018secrecy, paranoia, the sense that you assert power by looking strong and not showing weakness or building bridges.\u2019\u2019Deciphering the inner workings of the three major security agencies has become a fixation of Egypt watchers. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s very opaque, like a black box,\u2019\u2019 Michael Wahid Hanna of the Century Foundation, a policy institute based in New York, told me. \u2018\u2018But there are clues.\u2019\u2019The security agencies are loyal to Sisi, Hanna explained, but are always jockeying for position. National Security, thought to have 100,000 employees and at least as many informants, remains the most visible. Its emergent rival is Military Intelligence, which traditionally steered clear of politics but has expanded under Sisi, who led the agency from 2010 to 2012. The General Intelligence Service is Egypt\u2019s equivalent of the C.I.A. Hugely powerful under Mubarak, it is now viewed as somewhat diminished.Together, these agencies enjoy inordinate influence. They own TV stations, control blocs in Parliament and dabble in business; their agents patrol the streets and the internet. They draw the red lines in Egyptian society between what is permissible and what is not. That makes Egypt a perilous place to navigate for critics: One wrong move, or even a misjudged joke (Egyptians have been jailed for their Facebook posts), can lead to imprisonment or to being barred from leaving the country. Amnesty International puts the number of disappeared at 1,700 and says that extrajudicial executions are common.When Regeni arrived in 2015, foreigners were thought to be subject to different rules. It was true that some had run into trouble. Earlier that year, the Australian journalist Peter Greste of Al Jazeera was finally freed after 13 months in jail on charges of \u2018\u2018damaging national security\u2019\u2019; a French student was expelled for interviewing democracy activists. Regeni\u2019s academic advisers warned him to avoid contact with members of the Muslim Brotherhood. \u2018\u2018The situation here is not easy,\u2019\u2019 he messaged a friend a month after he arrived. But on the whole, Regeni, his supervisor later told me, believed that his passport would protect him. His abiding fear was that he would be sent back to Cambridge before he could finish his research.News of Regeni\u2019s disappearance was rippling across Cairo. His friends had started an online search campaign with the hashtag #whereis\u00adgiulio. Regeni\u2019s parents had flown in from Italy and were staying at his apartment in Dokki. A rumor circulated that Regeni had been snatched by Islamist radicals \u2014 a terrifying prospect because, six months earlier, a Croatian engineer kidnapped on the outskirts of Cairo was beheaded by Islamic State militants. The ambassador\u2019s anxiety was amplified by the response of Egyptian officials. The Italian intelligence station at the embassy had no leads, so he sought out the foreign minister, the minister of military production and Sisi\u2019s national-security adviser Fayza Abul Naga. All claimed to know nothing of Regeni. The most disquieting encounter was with the powerful interior minister, Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, who took six days to agree to a meeting only to sit impassively as the Italian diplomat pleaded for help. Massari left perplexed: Abdel-Ghaffar, a 40-year veteran of the security services, had an army of informants on the streets of Cairo. How could he be in the dark?The police started a missing-persons investigation but seemed to be pursuing some odd lines of inquiry. When detectives interviewed Amr, a leftist university professor and a friend of Regeni\u2019s who asked that his last name not be used to protect him from retaliation, they repeatedly asked if Regeni was gay. \u2018\u2018I told them he has a girlfriend,\u2019\u2019 Amr said when we met over coffee near his home in the suburb of Maadi. \u2018\u2018Then the next guy goes: \u2018Are you sure he is straight? Maybe he\u2019s one of these bisexuals.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018I said, \u2018You should just find him.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019The crisis was compounded by the arrival of a high-level Italian trade delegation. Since 1914, Italy had maintained diplomatic ties with Egypt, embracing the country even when others kept their distance. Italy was Egypt\u2019s biggest trading partner in Europe \u2014 nearly $6 billion in 2015 \u2014 and Rome prided itself on its close ties to Cairo. In 2014 Matteo Renzi, then the Italian prime minister, became the first Western leader to welcome Sisi in his capital, and Italy continued to sell weapons and surveillance systems to Egypt even as evidence of rights abuses mounted.The day after Massari\u2019s meeting with the interior minister, Italy\u2019s investment minister, Federica Guidi, flew to Cairo with 30 Italian executives, hoping to strike deals in construction, energy and the arms trade. Now Regeni was at the top of the agenda. The group went straight to Al-\u00adIttihadiya, the main presidential palace, where months earlier, Regeni had helped the street vendors during the police raid outside its back gates. Massari and Guidi were ushered into a private meeting with Sisi, who listened gravely as the Italians outlined their concerns. But he, too, offered only sympathy.That evening Massari hosted a reception for the trade delegation and Egyptian business leaders at the embassy. About 200 people mingled in the reception hall, sipping wine as they waited for dinner to be served. Among them was Egypt\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Hossam Zaki, who pushed through the crowd to Massari, wearing a dark expression. \u2018\u2018Don\u2019t you know?\u2019\u2019 he said.\u2018\u2018Know what?\u2019\u2019 Massari replied.\u2018\u2018A body has been found.\u2019\u2019Early that morning, the driver of a passenger bus traveling the busy Alexandria Desert Highway, in western Cairo, noticed something on the side of the road. When he got out, he discovered a body, naked from the waist down and smeared in blood. It was Regeni.Massari rushed to the Four Seasons hotel, where Guidi was staying, and together they phoned Renzi and the foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni. They canceled the reception, sending puzzled guests home without explanation. Then Massari and the minister went to Regeni\u2019s apartment in Dokki, where Regeni\u2019s parents were staying. When the ambassador embraced Regeni\u2019s mother, Paola Deffendi, her worst fears were confirmed. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s all over,\u2019\u2019 she later told the press. \u2018\u2018The happiness of our family was so short.\u2019\u2019Massari arrived at the Zeinhom morgue in central Cairo after midnight. A small team from the embassy, including a policeman, accompanied him. At first, morgue officials refused them entry. \u2018\u2018Open the door!\u2019\u2019 yelled Massari, visibly agitated. Massari was finally led into a chilled room where Regeni\u2019s body was laid out on a metal tray.Regeni\u2019s mouth was agape and his hair was matted with blood. One of his front teeth was missing and several were chipped or broken, as if they had been struck with a blunt object. Cigarette burns pocked his skin, and there were a number of deep wounds on his back. His right earlobe had been sliced off, and the bones in his wrists, shoulders and feet were shattered. A wave of nausea washed over Massari. Regeni appeared to have been extensively tortured. Days later, an Italian autopsy would confirm the extent of his injuries: Regeni had been beaten, burned, stabbed and probably flogged on the soles of his feet over a period of four days. He died when his neck was snapped.In the early hours of the investigation, Nagy spoke with astonishing bluntness. He told reporters that Regeni suffered a \u2018\u2018slow death\u2019\u2019 and allowed that the police might be involved: \u2018\u2018We don\u2019t rule it out.\u2019\u2019 But soon after that, the chief detective on the case suggested that Regeni died in a car crash. Lurid theories appeared in the papers and on TV: Regeni was gay and had been murdered by a jealous lover. He was a drug addict or a Muslim Brotherhood pawn. He was a spy. Several reports noted his work at Oxford Analytica, which had been founded by a one-time Nixon administration official, as a probable sign of employment by the C.I.A. or Britain\u2019s M.I.6. At a news conference, the interior minister, Abdel-Ghaffar, dismissed suggestions that the security forces had detained Regeni. \u2018\u2018Of course not!\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018This is the final say in the matter: It did not happen.\u2019\u2019Egyptian officials have a long record of facing crises in just this way: denial, then obfuscation, followed by running the clock in hopes that the problem will fade away. In September 2015, the month Regeni arrived, an Egyptian helicopter gunship shot dead eight Mexican tourists and four Egyptians as they picnicked in the Western Desert, having mistaken them for terrorists. Instead of apologizing, the authorities tried to blame the tour guides, then promised an investigation that has never reported any findings. The government of Mexico was furious. A month later, Egypt initially refused to admit that an Islamic State bomb had downed a Russian jetliner over Sinai, killing 224 people, even though both Russia and the Islamic State said it had.Renzi\u2019s fury was based on more than a hunch. In the weeks after Regeni\u2019s death, the United States acquired explosive intelligence from Egypt: proof that Egyptian security officials had abducted, tortured and killed Regeni. \u2018\u2018We had incontrovertible evidence of official Egyptian responsibility,\u2019\u2019 an Obama administration official \u2014 one of three former officials who confirmed the intelligence \u2014 told me. \u2018\u2018There was no doubt.\u2019\u2019 At the recommendation of the State Department and the White House, the United States passed this conclusion to the Renzi government. But to avoid identifying the source, the Americans did not share the raw intelligence, nor did they say which security agency they believed was behind Regeni\u2019s death. \u2018\u2018It was not clear who gave the order to abduct and, presumably, kill him,\u2019\u2019 another former official said. What the Americans knew for certain, they told the Italians, was that Egypt\u2019s leadership was fully aware of the circumstances around Regeni\u2019s death. \u2018\u2018We had no doubt that this was known by the very top,\u2019\u2019 said the other official. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know if they had responsibility. But they knew. They knew.\u2019\u2019Weeks later, in early 2016, John F. Kerry, then secretary of state, confronted Egypt\u2019s foreign minister, Sameh Shoukry, during a meeting in Washington. It was a \u2018\u2018pretty contentious\u2019\u2019 conversation, one Obama official told me, although the Kerry team couldn\u2019t figure out if Shoukry was stonewalling or simply didn\u2019t know the truth. The blunt approach \u2018\u2018raised eyebrows\u2019\u2019 inside the administration, another said, because Kerry had a reputation for treating Egypt, a fulcrum of American foreign policy since the 1979 Egypt-\u00adIsraeli peace treaty, with kid gloves.By then a team of seven Italian investigators had arrived in Cairo to help with the Egyptian investigation. They were hindered at every turn. Witnesses appeared to have been coached. Surveillance footage from the subway station near Regeni\u2019s apartment had been deleted; requests for metadata from millions of phone calls were refused on the grounds that it would compromise the constitutional rights of Egyptian citizens. Some brave Egyptian witnesses visited the investigators at their temporary office in the basement of the Italian Embassy. But even there the Italians were uneasy.Massari, the ambassador, became concerned about embassy security after Regeni\u2019s death; soon he stopped using email and the phone for sensitive matters, resorting to an old-fashioned paper-based encryption machine to send messages to Rome. Italian officials worried that Egyptians who worked in the Italian Embassy were passing information to Egyptian security forces; they noticed that the lights were permanently off in an apartment across from the embassy \u2014 a good spot to place a directional microphone. Massari, still traumatized by the memory of Regeni\u2019s injuries, had become a recluse, avoiding meetings with other ambassadors. His relationship with the Egyptian government was deteriorating; Egyptian officials, infuriated by an interview he gave to an Italian TV station, determined that he was trying to pin the murder on them. \u2018\u2018We deduced he had already taken sides,\u2019\u2019 Hossam Zaki, the deputy foreign minister, told me later. \u2018\u2018He was kind of moot. Useless.\u2019\u2019 When Massari did venture out, people noted that he looked exhausted. Friends said he was struggling to sleep.International pressure was building on the Egyptians. Italian newspapers sent their most dogged investigative reporters to Cairo. A website called RegeniLeaks sprang up, soliciting tips from Egyptian whistle-blowers. Regeni\u2019s mother began her own campaign to uncover the truth, relating in a news conference that she was able to recognize his battered body only by \u2018\u2018the tip of his nose.\u2019\u2019 Italian actors, TV personalities and soccer players rallied to her side. Egyptians told Deffendi that her son had \u2018\u2018died like an Egyptian\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a badge of honor in Sisi\u2019s Egypt. The European Parliament passed a stinging resolution condemning the suspicious circumstances under which Regeni had died; in London, campaigners presented a petition with more than 10,000 signatures to Parliament, calling for the British government to ensure a \u2018\u2018credible investigation.\u2019\u2019 The F.B.I. was also assisting in the Italian investigation; when an Egyptian friend of Regeni\u2019s landed in the United States, on vacation, agents pulled her aside for an interview.This time stonewalling wasn\u2019t going to work. \u2018\u2018We are in deep [expletive],\u2019\u2019 observed a leading TV host, Amr Adeeb, on his show.He paused and looked up for effect.\u2018\u2018That is what we see in Egypt: the dark side of those institutions; the secrets in their hearts.\u2019\u2019The senator was referring to Egypt\u2019s security agencies, but what he didn\u2019t mention was that the Regeni investigation was also exposing painful rifts inside the Italian state. There were other priorities. Italy\u2019s intelligence services needed Egypt\u2019s help in countering the Islamic State, managing the conflict in Libya and monitoring the flood of migrants across the Mediterranean. And Italy\u2019s state-controlled energy company, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, or Eni, had its own stake. Weeks before Regeni arrived in Cairo, Eni announced a major discovery: the Zohr gas field, 120 miles off the north coast of Egypt, which contained an estimated 850 billion cubic meters of gas \u2014 the equivalent of 5.5 billion barrels of oil.Italy is one of Europe\u2019s most energy-vulnerable countries, which makes Eni more than just a $58 billion titan with operations in 73 countries; it makes it an integral part of Italian foreign policy. In 2014, Renzi acknowledged as much, calling Eni \u2018\u2018a fundamental piece of our energy policy, our foreign policy and our intelligence policy.\u2019\u2019 In many countries, Eni\u2019s chief executive Claudio Descalzi \u2014 a towering Milanese oilman, who has driven recent exploration efforts across Africa \u2014 knows the leaders better than Italy\u2019s ministers do.As the pressure to solve Regeni\u2019s murder mounted, Descalzi, a regular visitor to Cairo, assured Amnesty International that the Egyptian authorities were \u2018\u2018putting in maximum effort\u2019\u2019 to find Regeni\u2019s killers. He discussed the case at least three times with Sisi. According to one official at Italy\u2019s Foreign Ministry, diplomats came to believe that Eni had joined forces with Italy\u2019s intelligence service in a bid to find a speedy resolution to the case. Eni has a long history of hiring retired Italian spies to staff its internal security division, says Andrea Greco, a co-author of \u2018\u2018The Parallel State,\u2019\u2019 a 2016 year book on Eni. \u2018\u2018They have a strong collaboration,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I\u2019m sure they may have collaborated in the Regeni case, although it\u2019s not for certain that their interests are aligned.\u2019\u2019 A spokeswoman for Eni says that the company was \u2018\u2018horrified\u2019\u2019 by Regeni\u2019s death and while it had no responsibility to investigate, it continued \u2018\u2018to follow the matter very closely\u2019\u2019 in its interactions with the Egyptian government.The perceived cooperation between Eni and Italy\u2019s intelligence services became a source of tension inside the Italian government. Foreign Ministry and intelligence officials turned guarded with one another, sometimes withholding information. \u2018\u2018We were at war, and not only with the Egyptians,\u2019\u2019 one official told me. Diplomats suspected that Italian spies, in an attempt to close the case, had brokered an interview by the Italian newspaper La Repubblica with Sisi six weeks after Regeni\u2019s death. (The editor of La Repubblica maintains that the request for the interview came from the newspaper.) In it, Sisi sympathized with Regeni\u2019s parents, calling his death \u2018\u2018terrifying and unacceptable,\u2019\u2019 and vowed to find the culprits. \u2018\u2018We will get to the truth,\u2019\u2019 he said.On March 24, eight days after the interview appeared, the Cairo police opened fire on a minivan carrying five men, several with criminal records or histories of drug abuse, as it drove through a well-to-do suburb. All five were killed, and the police issued a statement calling them a gang of kidnappers who had been targeting foreigners. In a subsequent raid on an apartment linked to the men, the police said they discovered Regeni\u2019s passport, credit card and student identity card. Soon, state media was reporting that Regeni\u2019s killers had been identified. The Italian investigators, who were at the Cairo airport to fly home for Easter, were recalled, and the Interior Ministry thanked them for their cooperation.In Italy, news of the shooting met with skepticism \u2014 the hashtag #noncicredo, I don\u2019t believe it, circulated on Twitter. The Egyptian account quickly fell apart. Witnesses told several journalists (including me) that the men had been executed in cold blood. One was shot as he ran, his corpse later positioned inside the van. \u2018\u2018They never stood a chance,\u2019\u2019 one man told me, shaking his head. The men\u2019s link to Regeni crumbled: Italian investigators used phone records to show that the supposed gang leader, Tarek Abdel Fattah, was 60 miles north of Cairo the day he supposedly kidnapped Regeni.Last fall, Egypt\u2019s chief prosecutor told his Italian counterpart that two police officers had been charged with murder in connection with the five deaths. But an awkward question remained: If the dead men hadn\u2019t killed Regeni, then how did his passport get into their apartment?Italians had little doubt that the whole episode was a crude cover-up, so badly bungled that the Egyptians had incriminated themselves. Yet it had worked. The Italian detectives left Cairo, and the investigation stalled. Massari was replaced with a new ambassador who was ordered to remain in Rome. In Egypt, \u2018\u2018Regeni\u2019\u2019 became a word to be whispered. \u2018\u2018Everyone who cares about Giulio is afraid,\u2019\u2019 Hoda Kamel, a union organizer who helped Regeni in his research, told me. \u2018\u2018It feels like all of the state, with all of its strength, is trying to kill the story.\u2019\u2019Muhammad Abdullah, Regeni\u2019s contact in the street vendors\u2019 union, was an informant for the National Security Agency. Using a hidden camera, he had taped his conversation with Regeni about the \u00a310,000 grant (the Egyptians handed over the video). He made a statement detailing his meetings with his handler, Col. Sharif Magdi Ibrahim Abdlaal, who, he said, had promised him a reward once the Regeni case was closed.The identity of the second person was perhaps more surprising. Italian officials came to believe that in the month before Regeni vanished, his lawyer roommate, Mohamed El Sayad, allowed officials from the National Security Agency to search the apartment. In the weeks that followed, phone records showed, Sayad spoke with two National Security Agency officials.Sayad did not respond to requests for comment, but I had a long exchange, over Facebook, with Regeni\u2019s other roommate, Juliane Schoki. Her account was symptomatic of the climate of mistrust in Sisi\u2019s Cairo. According to Schoki, Sayad voiced suspicions of Regeni within days of his moving into their flat. \u2018\u2018I think Giulio is a spy,\u2019\u2019 she recalled him saying.After Regeni disappeared, she began to share that view. The two speculated that he was working for Mossad. (Regeni, she said, told her he once had an Israeli girlfriend and had visited Israel.) Schoki, who has since left Egypt, relayed this theory to Egyptian intelligence officers. \u2018\u2018They were surprised because they had the same idea,\u2019\u2019 she recalled.After Regeni died, she would sit with Sayad watching thrillers on TV, saying, \u2018\u2018That\u2019s exactly how it is!\u2019\u2019 \u2014 something that, in retrospect, \u2018\u2018looks a bit ridiculous,\u2019\u2019 she admitted. \u2018\u2018But a year ago it made perfect sense.\u2019\u2019The Italians used Egyptian phone records to make other connections and discovered that the police officer who claimed to have found Regeni\u2019s passport had been in touch with members of the National Security team that had been following Regeni. Suddenly, Regeni\u2019s parents dared to hope the truth might surface. \u2018\u2018The evil is unraveling slowly, like a ball of wool,\u2019\u2019 his parents wrote in a letter published in La Repubblica on the first anniversary of his disappearance.But although the Egyptians admitted to surveilling Regeni, they insisted they had not abducted or killed him. And even if that could be proved, the core mystery remained: Why had he been \u2018\u2018killed like an Egyptian\u2019\u2019? One common theory pointed to the work of a rogue officer. At the Interior Ministry, which controls National Security, even low-level officers enjoy considerable autonomy yet are rarely held to account, according to Yezid Sayigh, a senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. \u2018\u2018Things may happen that Sisi does not approve of,\u2019\u2019 he said. But there was much else that made little sense. Which Egyptian official figured that torturing a foreigner was a good idea? Why dump his body on a busy highway, instead of burying it in the desert where it might never be found? And why produce his body as a high-level Italian delegation arrived in Cairo?An anonymous letter sent to the Italian Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, last year and later published in an Italian newspaper, offered another explanation: Regeni had been caught in a shadowy turf war between National Security and Military Intelligence, with one group seeking to use his death to embarrass the other. The details suggested that the author of the account was intimately familiar with Egypt\u2019s security apparatus, yet it also seemed improbable that one person could know so much. Senior American officials told me the letter was consistent, however, with broader intelligence reports of the fierce jockeying for power among rival security agencies. \u2018\u2018They try to use cases as a lever to embarrass one another,\u2019\u2019 one said.No senior Egyptian official agreed to speak to me for this article. But Hossam Zaki, the former deputy foreign minister who is now assistant secretary general at the Arab League, told me that Egyptian officials believe that the murder was the work of an unidentified \u2018\u2018third party\u2019\u2019 seeking to sabotage Egypt\u2019s relations with Italy. \u2018\u2018Egyptians do not treat foreigners badly, full stop,\u2019\u2019 he said.Italians have what Carlo Bonini, a journalist for La Repubblica who has written extensively on the Regeni case, calls \u2018\u2018the last bullet.\u2019\u2019 Under Italian law, they could press charges in an Italian court against the handful of Egyptian security officials they believe to be responsible. But that might be a Pyrrhic victory: Egypt would never extradite anyone for trial. And there seems little chance that Sisi can be pressured into revealing the truth. In Rome last month officials admitted that the investigation was now little more than geopolitical kabuki; politics and not police work would determine its conclusion. In the 18 months since Regeni was killed, Sisi has had dinner with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, in front of the pyramids, and in April he received a rapturous welcome at the White House from President Trump. On Aug. 14, the Italian government announced it intended to send its ambassador back to Cairo. The Zohr gas field is on track to start production in December.In Fiumicello, Regeni lies buried under a line of cypress trees. Flowers, devotional candles and plastic-wrapped volumes of Spinoza and Hesse are piled on his grave, and a small photograph shows him speaking to a crowd, clutching a microphone, his face open and earnest. But unlike the elaborate neighboring tombs that surround it, Regeni\u2019s gravestone is just a plain marble slab. Because the investigation is still open, the parish priest explained, officials might yet need to exhume his remains.Declan Walsh is the Cairo bureau chief for The Times. This is his first article for the magazine.Advertisement"}

But in Mr. Earley\u2019s early days, it was quiet.\u201cTennis was the game where the chair umpire would say, \u2018Shhh! Shhh!\u2019 and they\u2019d have to wait for everything to be quiet for somebody to hit a serve,\u201d he said. \u201cSome players still like it to be that way, but we ain\u2019t waiting for it.\u201d\u201cThe New York crowd has always been the most vocal,\u201d he added, \u201cbut the music and all of the festivities that surround the event, that guy up in the stands who dances on the changeovers, people screaming and yelling during the point \u2014 20 years ago, that just didn\u2019t happen.\u201dTechnology has been another major change. When Mr. Earley began working at the tournament, there were no big screens and electronic review boards. \u201cPlayers would have to live with the call of the officials, and sometimes, it was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s an electronic world of electronic review and being able to challenge a line call.\u201dAnd the change in court color in 2005, from muted green to bright blue, gave the game new life, Mr. Earley said. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more colorful event now, just because of that.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:It\u2019s a splendid day to watch some tennis.The rest of the week is looking much the same, but as always, the ball\u2019s in Mother Nature\u2019s court.So are there any plans to move the tournament out of New York? Nope, according to Chris Widmaier, a spokesman with the United States Tennis Association.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Storm Has Car Dealers Doing Swift Business, if They Can Open", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAs Harvey moved on and patches of blue sky finally appeared over Houston on Thursday, hundreds of car dealerships began reopening across the rain-soaked region \u2014 and at least a few were doing a brisk business.By noon on Thursday, AutoNation Ford in Katy, Tex., had sold 30 new vehicles, mostly pickup trucks to contractors and other tradesmen who were scrambling to get to work repairing the devastation caused by the torrential rains and flooding.\u201cWe have stores where the phone is ringing off the hook,\u201d said Michael J. Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation, the country\u2019s largest auto retailer, which owns 17 showrooms in the Houston area.South of Houston, in Alvin, the Ron Carter group of four dealerships had customers coming in shortly after the doors opened at 7 a.m. \u201cThere are some people looking to buy,\u201d said Cary T. Wilson, the owner of the franchises. \u201cBut you\u2019re also going to have a long list of service work for people whose cars have water damage and need to get back on the road.\u201dHarvey destroyed or damaging tens of thousands homes across hundreds of square miles in the Houston area and ruined a vast number of vehicles in a region that relies heavily on them.As many as 500,000 vehicles \u2014 already on the road or still on dealer lots \u2014 will need to be replaced, according to an estimate by Cox Automotive, a research firm. That estimate, if confirmed, would be more than are typically sold in all of Texas in a year and exceed the combined losses from Hurricane Sandy (250,000) and Hurricane Katrina (200,000).At McRee Ford in Dickinson, Tex., the entire stock of 500 new and used cars and trucks was damaged by water, according to a notice posted on the franchise\u2019s website. \u201cThe inventory displayed here on our website and other sites on the web are no longer available for sale,\u201d the notice said.The amount of water was also overwhelming: some parts of Texas received more than 47 inches of rain.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this rain, holy cow,\u201d said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president for manufacturer relations at Group 1 Automotive, which is based in Houston and owns 228 new car franchises across the country, including 28 that were hit by Harvey.\u201cSome hurricanes are mainly wind,\u201d Mr. DeLongchamps said. \u201cBut this was a water event, and that means a lot of cars got totaled.\u201dGroup 1 reopened a few franchises on Wednesday, and by Thursday it was delivering a stream of new cars to customers. \u201cPeople need cars to get around, get to work, get paid,\u201d he said.On Friday, automakers will report their new-car sales for August, and analysts expect a decline, in part because Harvey wiped out sales in the final weekend of the month \u2014 typically a time when a rush of deals are closed \u2014 in Texas, the country\u2019s second-largest auto market after California.Eventually, Houston-area auto dealers will see a swell of sales as people look to replace vehicles that were damaged or destroyed by Harvey. \u201cPeople first have to get back on their feet, and then it takes time to settle with their insurance company,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cIt will probably be the fourth quarter before we begin to see replacement business in volume.\u201dAlthough Harvey\u2019s effects on the auto industry are significant, they are expected to be relatively localized. The two auto plants in Texas \u2014 a General Motors truck plant in Arlington and a Toyota pickup plant in San Antonio \u2014 were largely unaffected. And while flooding of highways and rail lines is expected to slow the shipment of cars, engines and parts produced in Mexico, dealers around the country have enough inventory to allay any concerns about shortages, according to Black Book, a provider of auto industry data.Many dealers count themselves among the victims of the storm. About 50 AutoNation employees have been left homeless. AutoNation has a crisis team of about 50 people on the ground in Houston to help them find housing, get new cellphones and provide meals for their families.Group 1, which has some 3,000 employees in the area, organized email and text chains to stay in touch and provide assistance if any were flooded or in danger. It also set up a disaster recovery fund to help any displaced employees.Mr. Wilson, the owner of the Ron Carter dealerships, was among those hit hard. His home ended up with about six feet of water in the garage and about three feet in the living room, kitchen and hallways.\u201cI\u2019ve got contractors tearing out Sheetrock,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the appliances have to be pulled out of the house. All my tools and the lawn mower are a total loss. It\u2019s a pretty massive cleanup.\u201dHis Ford, Toyota, Buick and GMC franchises \u2014 with a combined inventory of more than 2,200 new vehicles, worth about $60 million \u2014 fared better.To protect them, Mr. Wilson had his staff park the vehicles on the highest ground of his 26-acre site \u2014 \u201cdoor handle to door handle,\u201d he said \u2014 to reduce damage from windblown debris.He estimated that 400 to 500 of his vehicles had been in water less than a foot deep \u2014 shallow enough that they had most likely suffered no lasting damage. \u201cThose can be cleaned and sold,\u201d he said. Still, Mr. Wilson said he would provide customers with copies of any repair orders.Perhaps 25 or 30 others that were in deeper water are too damaged to repair, Mr. Wilson said. \u201cWe are very fortunate there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could have been much worse.\u201dBoth AutoNation and Group 1 own dealerships across the Gulf states, where hurricanes are common, and are experienced in battening down. Days before the storm hit, both companies began bracing themselves.Like Mr. Wilson, the two companies moved cars to high ground, in some cases to storage lots away from their dealerships. At AutoNation\u2019s two Mercedes franchises in Houston, the priciest models were stored on service lifts to preserve them even if the buildings were flooded.\u201cThis is a historic, epic rainfall,\u201d said Mr. Jackson of AutoNation. \u201cIt\u2019s caused incomprehensible suffering for the people of Houston. We\u2019ve dealt with hurricanes before, but this one\u2019s unique.\u201dAdvertisement"}

My \u2026 son is 31. I\u2019ve had \u2018the talk\u2019 with my son and he\u2019s making it both easier for me and more difficult. He wants nothing. I am fairly certain that it\u2019s all going to end up in a Dumpster somewhere, and that makes me sad. Yet, I also don\u2019t want to burden him with a bunch of unwanted (from his perspective) junk. This is an emotionally fraught issue and I don\u2019t there are no easy answers.\u201d\u201cMy generation used to scrimp and resourcefully use everything. My 20-something children prefer to have kits from Ikea rather than castoffs I put aside.\u201dMany younger readers countered that they live in smaller spaces far longer than their parents did, and they simply lack space. \u201cWe all live in studio or one bedroom apartments well into our 30s. Now we\u2019re supposed to buy houses we can\u2019t afford just to store your stuff?\u201d\u201cGen X-ers and older millennials are also contending with as many as four households of parental belongings, if a young couple are both children of divorce. It ... makes us want to curl into a ball and plead \u2018no room for any of it, at all.\u2019If both sides can feel slighted, where to begin? Readers of all ages chimed in with thoughts on having \u201cthe conversation\u201d about what to pass down and what to throw out. \u201cI\u2019m only 27 and I have this conversation almost every time I go to their house. I think it\u2019s a process that needs to start well before parents retire or are beginning to ail. My parents know their stuff isn\u2019t special, they\u2019ve just accumulated it and feel like parting with it is a waste of the money they spent on it.\u201d\u2014 Vanessa Ceballos, via Facebook\u201cA friend of mine took three years and five estate sales to get rid of all of the stuff his parents left behind. My daughter asked me to please not do that to her. Together we downsized my home and went through all of the stuff I got from my mom, and now she has the stuff that is meaningful to HER. Don\u2019t place this unwanted burden on your kids just because you can\u2019t break with traditions.\u201dSome suggested to start sorting through items before moving plans are made or people fall sick or die in order to mitigate the emotional aspect of deciding what to keep. \u201cMy father passed away in May and it took me six weeks to sort through everything in my parents\u2019 house, garage, and yard. Six weeks of four to eight hours working on that project daily. It was an awful, awful, awful, filthy, distressing, boring, time-consuming, backbreaking job. I have vowed NOT to do that to my own children.\u201d\u201cWhen my stepmother passed away unexpectedly, I had all the grandchildren tag the books and art they wanted with sticky buttons. It gave my dad the comfort of having [those items] until he died. One of the most inspired ideas I had in that stage of sadness.\u201dScan old photos to save space, and photograph heirlooms to keep a record, many readers advised.\u201cOne way to preserve everything for family history is to photograph it all. This could include photos of whole rooms as well as individual objects. I wish I had done this with my parents stuff.\u201d\u201cAs an only child I inherited many cartons of photographs from my parents (some of which were their own parents\u2019 photos). Now in my 60s I still have those plus even more boxes of photos of our own three children. I started scanning and digitizing some but it is a long slow process, one photo at a time.

Don\u2019t wait until someone dies to pull out the good china, which seemed to be one of the biggest points of contention among generations. \u201cI have inherited a ton of china and crystal. Instead of keeping it for big occasions I use it on a daily basis.\u201d\u201cJust use the china and silver for everyday use. It doesn\u2019t need to sit in a closet.\u201dWhen you decide what not to keep, where should you take it? Readers had many suggestions about parting with heirlooms. \u201cI am 62 years old. My husband and I still work full time and are too old to be bothered with garage or estate sales, so the easiest option for us was to call 1-800-Got-Junk. They sent five guys who cleared the six rooms in six hours, and took it all away for $1200.\u201d\u201cWe are in our early 60s. Four years ago we moved from a large house in Iowa to a smaller home in the mountains of Colorado. Our children didn\u2019t want any of our furnishings, including several antique pieces. So we decided to sell almost all of our furniture and many other furnishings through Craigslist.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with donating directly to the charities that support our new refugee immigrants? They come here with nothing and need to furnish their apartments here.\u201dMany readers with relevant professional experience offered advice to their generational cohorts.\u201cI\u2019m a probate lawyer. In 25 years, I\u2019ve seen more arguments over Tupperware, jewelry and guns than I have over money. Money\u2019s easy to divide (assuming there\u2019s no fraud or malfeasance), but the \u201cstuff\u201d is what triggers the sibling dysfunction, for sure. Add in siblings-in-law, and bring popcorn for the show.\u201d\u201cI will say that as a hospice nurse, I have witnessed fights breaking out between siblings and other family members over seemingly trivial things and the patient in the home had not even died yet. The best thing to do is to give away treasures while you are very much alive as gifts. And pets need to be considered \u2014 so many go to shelters after a death. It is sad to see an elderly dog or cat or bird end up that way.\u201d\u201cAs a professional art appraiser, I do see this all the time.

{"Headline": "What to Say When People Ask Why You Aren\u2019t Having Children", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNothing could have prepared me for the invasiveness I face about my fertility plans as a married woman in my late 30s.What was once an occasional topic of conversation five years ago when I first dated Mike, now my husband, has become a full-blown speculative crisis since we tied the knot in April.I understand the concern. In our youth, many of us were taught, \u201cFirst comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby in the baby carriage.\u201d There\u2019s no asterisk after the ditty clarifying \u201cthese milestones might never be accomplished in this order, or at all.\u201dWell-meaning relatives touch my arm and ask when we\u2019ll start a family. I bristle at the suggestion, as if me, my sweet fella and our delightful cat aren\u2019t already a complete family. Their faces drop when I break the news that we plan to be child-free.\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d they say. \u201cYou\u2019d make such a great mom.\u201dAcquaintances are more blunt: When are you going to pop out a kid? \u201cTwo minutes after never,\u201d I reply, which sucks the air out of the room. I pretend I don\u2019t notice them exchanging worried looks. Even my primary care physician has an opinion on the matter, advising me last year to \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d about having kids.I was never sure what to say when people put me on the spot. After alternating between arguing, brooding and stewing, I now realize I don\u2019t have to react in such a negative way. So when I want to keep my friendships (and my doctor), I take a breath and try to keep the following five things in mind:Most of my closest friends \u2014 all city-dwelling creative types \u2014 don\u2019t have biological children. In fact, we rarely discuss our reasons for why we chose our child-free lifestyles.I assume it\u2019s for some of the same reasons as me, which range from the inane to the intense: We cherish our flexible lifestyles, children are time-consuming and expensive, child care costs are prohibitive, and we all have varying degrees of anxiety about our future. Why take the leap when so many aspects of parenthood feel so risky?I\u2019m lucky to be surrounded by so many like-minded women. If I still lived in my hometown, a tiny suburb outside of Albany, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have the same support. I moved away the summer before eighth grade and haven\u2019t been back since. A quick scroll through my Facebook feed shows all my childhood friends with little ones in tow. I imagine the pressure to have children would\u2019ve been much stronger if I\u2019d stayed.But when strangers ask about my plans for a child-free life, it can come off as if they\u2019re really asking what kind of person I am.It takes effort to keep my cool. After a few deep breaths, I run through my usual answers in a measured tone: Yes, I love children, but I don\u2019t feel an urgent need to have my own. No, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m a selfish jerk.I then politely assert that my husband and I are making decisions based on what\u2019s right for us as a couple. I don\u2019t elaborate more than that if I don\u2019t want to.When people push back about it, they seem to be more upset at having their sense of order questioned. Sometimes that can lead to interactions that feel hostile.Many people assume that having children after marriage is the natural progression of life. They may even see my reluctance to have kids as a personal affront, as if I\u2019m criticizing their choices.Not only is it exasperating to justify myself to people who have no stake in the process, but people have rarely been enthusiastic about my decision unless they\u2019ve decided to be child-free too.It gives me comfort to know more women than ever are choosing the same course as me.And while I feel compelled to articulate my reasons more than my husband does to other people, to be clear, this is a decision we arrived at together.\u201cPeople should not ask women about their fertility choices,\u201d Dr. Kelly said. \u201cThis includes mothers, sisters, close friends, acquaintances and other family members. This is a highly personal topic and should be considered off limits unless someone brings it up.\u201dIn light of the subject\u2019s sensitive nature, Dr. Kelly recommends following the lead of the individual: \u201cIf she wants to discuss, do so on her terms and remain highly supportive and free of judgment.\u201d\u201cIf someone does confide\u201d in you, she said, \u201cdo not bring up how easy it was for you or compare that individual\u2019s struggles or decisions to yourself or anyone else.\u201dHaving these painful discussions has heightened my sympathy for my loved ones struggling with their own fertility issues. I do my best to offer unconditional support for whatever outcome they are hoping for.Sometimes I picture another version of me with children living in a parallel universe. She juggles play dates, organizes nap schedules and indulges requests to screen \u201cMoana\u201d several times in a row.I imagine this woman in a quiet moment wondering what her life would\u2019ve been like if she\u2019d never had kids.I would tell her as fulfilled as she is being a parent, I\u2019m as satisfied with the child-free path I\u2019ve chosen too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Perch\u00e9 un ricercatore universitario italiano \u00e8 stato torturato e ucciso in Egitto?", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "Le stranezze del caso della scomparsa di Giulio Regeni.Supported byGiulio era arrivato al Cairo pochi mesi prima per condurre ricerche per il suo dottorato a Cambridge. Cresciuto in un piccolo paese vicino a Trieste da un padre rappresentante e da una madre insegnante, Regeni, un ventottenne di sinistra, era rimasto affascinato dallo spirito rivoluzionario della Primavera Araba. Nel 2011, quando erano esplose le manifestazioni di Piazza Tahrir che condussero alla caduta del Presidente Hosni Mubarak, stava finendo il suo corso di laurea in arabo e scienze politiche all\u2019universit\u00e0 di Leeds. Si trovava al Cairo nel 2013 come stagista per un\u2019agenzia delle Nazioni Unite, quando una seconda ondata di manifestazioni portarono le forze armate a cacciare il presidente egiziano recentemente eletto, l\u2019Islamista Mohamed Morsi, e a mettere al potere al-Sisi. Come molti egiziani divenuti ostili al governo troppo invadente di Morsi, Regeni apprezz\u00f2 questo sviluppo. \u201cFa parte del processo rivoluzionario,\u201d scrisse ad un amico inglese, Bernard Goyder, all\u2019inizio di agosto. In seguito, meno di due settimane dopo, le forze di sicurezza di al-Sisi uccisero 800 sostenitori di Morsi in un solo giorno, il peggior massacro voluto dallo stato nella storia dell\u2019Egitto. Fu l\u2019inizio di una lunga spirale di repressione. Regeni presto part\u00ec per l\u2019Inghilterra, dove cominci\u00f2 a lavorare per Oxford Analytica, un\u2019azienda di analisi e ricerca.Da lontano, Regeni seguiva con attenzione il governo di al-Sisi. Scriveva rapporti sul Nord Africa, analizzando tendenze politiche ed economiche, e in capo a un\u2019anno aveva risparmiato abbastanza soldi da poter iniziare il dottorato in studi dello sviluppo a Cambridge. Decise di concentrarsi sui sindacati indipendenti egiziani \u2014 la cui serie di scioperi senza precedenti iniziati nel 2006 aveva predisposto il popolo egiziano alla rivolta contro Mubarak. Adesso con la Primavera araba a pezzi, Regeni vedeva i sindacati come fragile speranza per la maltrattata democrazia egiziana. Dopo il 2011, il loro numero era esploso, passando da quattro a migliaia. C\u2019erano sindacati per ogni cosa: macellai, assistenti di teatro, scavatori di pozzi e minatori, addetti alla riscossione delle bollette del gas e comparse nelle telenovelas trash che andavano in onda durante il mese santo del Ramadan. C\u2019era anche un sindacato indipendente dei nani. Guidato dalla sua relatrice, una nota professoressa egiziana di Cambridge che aveva scritto in modo critico su al-Sisi, Regeni scelse di studiare i venditori ambulanti \u2014 giovani uomini provenienti da paesini lontani che si ingegnavano per sopravvivere sui marciapiedi del Cairo. Regeni si immerse nel loro mondo sperando di valutare il potenziale del loro sindacato nella guida del cambiamento politico e sociale.Per\u00f2 con l\u2019arrivo del 2015 quel tipo di immersione culturale, preferito a lungo da arabisti in erba, non era pi\u00f9 facile come prima. Una coltre di sospetti era caduta sul Cairo. La stampa era stata ridotta al silenzio, avvocati e giornalisti venivano regolarmente molestati e gli informatori riempivano i caff\u00e8 del centro del Cairo. La polizia fece un blitz nell\u2019ufficio in cui Regeni conduceva le sue interviste; folli storie di cospirazioni straniere andavano regolarmente in onda sui canali televisivi del governo.Regeni non si fece scoraggiare. Parlava cinque lingue, era insaziabilmente curioso e aveva un fascino poco appariscente che gli aveva attirato un\u2018ampia cerchia di amici. Dai 12 ai 14 anni, era stato il sindaco dei piccoli della sua cittadina natale, Fiumicello. Teneva molto alla sua capacit\u00e0 di navigare culture diverse e gli piaceva la vita disordinata delle strade del Cairo: i caff\u00e8 fumosi, l\u2019attivit\u00e0 frenetica e infinita, le barche colorate come caramelle che la sera navigavano sul Nilo. Si registr\u00f2 come ricercatore esterno presso l\u2019American University del Cairo e trov\u00f2 una stanza a Dokki, un quartiere strozzato dal traffico tra le piramidi ed il Nilo, dove condivideva un appartamento con due giovani professionisti: Juliane Schoki, che un insegnante di tedesco, e Mohamed El Sayad, avvocato in uno dei pi\u00f9 antichi studi legali del Cairo. Dokki non era una zona alla moda, per\u00f2 si trovava a due sole fermate di metropolitana dal centro del Cairo, con i suoi labirinti di alberghi economici, bettole e isolati di appartamenti fatiscenti che circondano Piazza Tahrir. In breve, Regeni aveva fatto amicizia con scrittori ed artisti e perfezionava il suo arabo da Abou Tarek, un emporio di quattro piani illuminato con luci al neon che \u00e8 il posto pi\u00f9 famoso del Cairo per il koshary, il piatto tradizionale egiziano di riso, lenticchie e pasta.Passava le ore a intervistare venditori di strada a Heliopolis e nel piccolo mercato dietro la stazione Ramses. Per ottenere la loro fiducia, mangiava dagli stessi carretti sporchi dei suoi interlocutori; il supervisore accademico di Regeni all\u2019American University lo avvert\u00ec che si sarebbe procurato un\u2019intossicazione alimentare. A Regeni non interessava: si muoveva attraverso il Cairo con una tranquilla aura di determinazione.Per caso venne al Cairo per lavoro Valeriia Vitynska, un\u2019ucraina che Giulio aveva conosciuto a Berlino quattro anni prima. I due riallacciarono i rapporti. \u201cEra pi\u00f9 bella di quanto ricordassi,\u201d scrisse in un messaggio ad un amico. Fecero un viaggio sul Mar Rosso e quando lei torn\u00f2 al suo lavoro a Kiev, continuarono la loro relazione via Skype. \u201cEra molto intenso e bello,\u201d mi ha detto l\u2019amica di Regeni Paz Z\u00e0rate, \u201cLui era gioioso, pieno di speranza per il futuro.\u201dTuttavia Regeni era cosciente dei pericoli del Cairo. \u201c\u00c8 molto deprimente,\u201d scrisse a Goyder dopo un mese di soggiorno. \u201cTutti sono super-consapevoli dei giochi in atto.\u201d A dicembre partecip\u00f2 ad un incontro di attivisti sindacali e scrisse di questa esperienza per una piccola agenzia di stampa italiana. Durante l\u2019incontro, disse ad amici di aver notato una ragazza velata che gli scattava foto con il cellulare. Era stato inquietante. Regeni si lament\u00f2 con i suoi amici che alcuni venditori ambulanti lo infastidivano per chiedergli favori, come per esempio cellulari nuovi. E poi il rapporto con il suo contatto principale, un uomo massiccio di circa quarant\u2019anni di nome Mohamed Abdullah, prese una strana piega.Abdullah, che prima di salire al vertice del sindacato dei venditori ambulanti aveva lavorato per una decina di anninella distribuzione di un tabloid del Cairo, era la guida di Regeni. Gli offriva consigli e gli presentava uomini da intervistare.Una sera ai primi di gennaio dell\u2019anno scorso, i due si incontrarono in un ahua \u2014 un caff\u00e8 in cui spesso gli uomini fumano il narghil\u00e8 \u2014 vicino alla stazione Ramses. Mentre bevevano t\u00e8, parlarono di una borsa di studio di 10.000 sterline per \u201cricercatori attivisti\u201d messa a disposizione da un gruppo non-profit inglese chiamato Antipode Foundation. Regeni si offr\u00ec di fare domanda per il contributo. Abdullah aveva altre idee. Potrebbe essere usata per \u201cfreedom projects\u201d \u2014 cio\u00e8 attivismo politico contro il governo egiziano? No, non era possibile, rispose risolutamente Regeni. Abdullah cambi\u00f2 tono. Sua figlia doveva operarsi e sua moglie era malata di cancro. Abdullah \u201cavrebbe fatto qualunque cosa\u201d per soldi. Regeni, esasperato, gesticolava in modo teatrale mentre si sforzava in arabo. \u201cMish mukin,\u201d disse. Non \u00e8 possibile. \u201cMish professional.\u201dDue settimane dopo, nel quinto anniversario della rivolta del 2011, il Cairo era quasi totalmente chiuso per motivi di sicurezza. Piazza Tahrir era deserta, eccetto per un centinaio di sostenitori del governo portati l\u00ec a sventolare striscioni di al-Sisi e scattarsi selfie con la polizia antisommossa. Per settimane i servizi di sicurezza avevano messo dentro potenziali manifestanti, facendo blitz negli appartamenti del centro e nei caff\u00e8. Come quasi tutti gli abitanti del Cairo, Regeni pass\u00f2 la giornata a casa, lavorando e ascoltando musica. Al calar della notte, decise che era sicuro uscire dall\u2019appartamento: un amico italiano lo aveva invitato a una festa di compleanno per un egiziano di sinistra. Avevano concordato di incontrarsi in un caff\u00e8 vicino a Piazza Tahrir.Prima di uscire, Regeni ascolt\u00f2 la canzone dei Coldplay \u201cA Rush of Blood to the Head\u201d \u2014 e mand\u00f2 un messaggio a Vitynska. \u201cSto uscendo,\u201d scrisse alle 19:41. La stazione della metropolitana distava solo pochi passi. Ma alle 20:18 Regeni ancora non era arrivato. Il suo amico italiano cominci\u00f2 a tentare di raggiungerlo \u2014 all\u2019inizio con dei messaggi sul cellulare, poi con chiamate frenetiche.La Sicurezza dello stato cambi\u00f2 nome in agenzia di sicurezza nazionale ma rimase sotto il controllo del potente Ministero degli Interni, che si stimava impiegasse pi\u00f9 di un milione e mezzo di poliziotti, agenti di sicurezza e informatori. Gli agenti che erano stati licenziati furono reintegrati e le camere di tortura vennero riaperte. I capi dell\u2019opposizione, temendo l\u2019arresto, fuggirono dal paese. Gli osservatori dei diritti umani cominciarono a contare il numero di persone \u201csparite\u201d \u2014 critici che scomparivano mentre si trovavano in custodia statale senza aver subito arresto o processo \u2014 finch\u00e9 anche gli osservatori cominciarono a loro volta a svanire.Oggi, l\u2019Egitto \u00e8 probabilmente un posto pi\u00f9 duro di quanto non fosse mai stato sotto Mubarak. Dopo aver preso il potere, al-Sisi ha vinto le elezioni presidenziali del 2014 con il 97% dei voti. Il Parlamento \u00e8 pieno dei suoi sostenitori e le carceri sono piene dei suoi oppositori \u2014 40.000 persone, secondo la maggior parte delle fonti, principalmente i Fratelli Musulmani, l\u2019organizzazione islamista fondata nel 1928, ma anche avvocati, giornalisti, e volontari di agenzie umanitarie. Al-Sisi giustifica queste misure con il pericolo che viene dagli estremisti. Fin dal 2014 militanti dello Stato Islamico combattono i soldati egiziani nel Sinai; e quest\u2019anno hanno mandato kamikaze nelle chiese copte, uccidendo dozzine di persone. Molti egiziani temono che senza un\u2019autorit\u00e0 forte e stabile il loro paese di 93 milioni di abitanti potrebbe diventare la prossima Siria, Libia o Iraq. In maggioranza, le \u00e9lite del Paese, paventando il caos che era seguito alla Primavera araba, stanno risolutamente dalla parte di al-Sisi; molti intellettuali, costernati dalla breve vita dell\u2019esperienza democratica, ammettono di essere a corto di idee.La decifrazione dei meccanismi interni delle tre principali agenzie di sicurezza \u00e8 diventata una fissazione per gli osservatori dell\u2019Egitto. \u201c\u00c8 tutto molto opaco, come una scatola nera,\u201d mi ha detto Michael Wahid Hanna della Century Foundation, un istituto politico di New York. \u201cPer\u00f2 ci sono degli indizi.\u201dLe agenzie di sicurezza sono fedeli ad al-Sisi, mi ha spiegato Hanna, per\u00f2 manovrano in continuazione per guadagnare migliori posizioni. L\u2018Agenzia di sicurezza nazionale, che si pensa abbia 100.000 impiegati e almeno altrettanti informatori, rimane la pi\u00f9 visibile. La sua rivale emergente sono i servizi segreti militari, che tradizionalmente evitano la politica ma che si sono ingranditi sotto al-Sisi, che ne \u00e8 stato a capo dal 2010 al 2012. Il Servizio di Intelligence Generale \u00e8 l\u2019equivalente egiziano della CIA. Immensamente potente sotto Mubarak, \u00e8 adesso considerata un po\u2019 sminuita.Nel loro complesso, queste agenzie esercitano un\u2019influenza fuori misura. Possiedono stazioni televisive, controllano blocchi di parlamentari e si muovono nel mondo degli affari; i loro agenti sorvegliano sia le strade sia Internet. Sono loro a determinare la linea di separazione tra ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 lecito nella societ\u00e0 egiziana e ci\u00f2 che non lo \u00e8. Questo rende l\u2019Egitto un luogo pericoloso per i critici: una mossa sbagliata, o perfino una battuta considerata fuori posto (alcuni egiziani sono finiti in prigione per un post su Facebook) pu\u00f2 portare all\u2019incarcerazione o al divieto di lasciare il paese. Amnesty International stima che il numero di persone scomparse sia di circa 1.700 e sostiene che le esecuzioni extragiudiziali siano un fatto comune.Quando Regeni arriv\u00f2 nel 2015 si pensava che gli stranieri fossero soggetti a regole diverse. \u00c8 vero che alcuni avevano avuto problemi. All\u2019inizio dell\u2019anno il giornalista australiano Peter Greste di Al Jazeera era stato finalmente rilasciato dopo tredici mesi in carcere, accusato di aver compromesso la sicurezza nazionale; uno studente francese era stato espulso dal paese per aver intervistato attivisti democratici. I relatori accademici di Regeni lo avevano avvisato di evitare contatti con membri dei Fratelli Musulmani. \u201cLa situazione qua non \u00e8 facile,\u201d Regeni aveva scritto ad un amico un mese dopo l\u2019arrivo. Ma, come mi disse poi il suo supervisore, tutto sommato Regeni era convinto che il suo passaporto lo avrebbe protetto. La sua vera paura era essere obbligato a tornare a Cambridge prima di riuscire a finire la sua ricerca.La notizia della scomparsa di Regeni si era diffusa in tutto il Cairo. I suoi amici avevano lanciato una campagna online con l\u2019hashtag #whereisgiulio (#dov\u2019\u00e8giulio). I genitori di Regeni, che erano arrivati dall\u2019Italia, dormivano nel suo appartamento a Dokki. Circolava la voce che Regeni fosse stato sequestrato da radicali islamisti \u2014 una possibilit\u00e0 terrificante perch\u00e9 sei mesi prima un ingegnere croato rapito alla periferia del Cairo era stato decapitato da militanti dello Stato Islamico. L\u2019ansia dell\u2019ambasciatore era amplificata dalla risposta degli ufficiali egiziani. La sezione di intelligence dell\u2019ambasciata italiana non aveva piste, cos\u00ec Massari chiese di vedere il ministro degli Esteri, il ministro della Produzione Militare e il consigliere egiziano per la Sicurezza Nazionale, Fayza Abul Naga. Tutti affermarono di non sapere nulla. L\u2019incontro pi\u00f9 inquietante fu quello con il ministero dell\u2019Interno, Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, che impieg\u00f2 sei giorni per concordare un incontro \u2014 per poi rimanere impassibile mentre il diplomatico italiano implorava il suo aiuto. Massari se ne and\u00f2 perplesso: Abdel-Ghaffar, veterano di quarant\u2019anni anni nei servizi di sicurezza, aveva un esercito di informatori. Come poteva essere all\u2019oscuro?La polizia avvi\u00f2 una ricerca per persona scomparsa, per\u00f2 sembrava seguire strane piste di indagine. Quando gli investigatori intervistarono Amr, un professore universitario di sinistra amico di Regeni, che ha chiesto che il suo cognome non fosse usato per questo articolo per paura di ripercussioni, gli venne chiesto ripetutamente se Regeni fosse gay. \u201cDichiarai che Giulio aveva una fidanzata,\u201d Amr mi disse quando ci incontrammo per un caff\u00e8 vicino alla sua casa nel sobborgo di Maadi. \u201cPoi un altro poliziotto fa: \u2018Sei sicuro che \u00e8 etero? Forse \u00e8 uno di quei bisessuali.\u2019\u201d\u201cIo gli ho detto \u2018Trovatelo e basta.\u2019\u201dLa crisi si intensific\u00f2 con l\u2019arrivo di un\u2019importante delegazione commerciale italiana. Fin dal 1914 l\u2019Italia ha mantenuto legami diplomatici con l\u2019Egitto, restando vicina al paese anche quando altri ne prendevano le distanze. L\u2019Italia \u00e8il maggior partner commerciale europeo dell\u2019Egitto \u2014 quasi sei miliardi di dollari nel 2015 \u2014 e Roma \u00e8 fiera dei legami con il Cairo. Nel 2014, l\u2019allora presidente del Consiglio Matteo Renzi fu il primo leader occidentale ad accogliere al-Sisi nella propria capitale, e l\u2019Italia ha continuatoa vendere all\u2019Egitto armi e sistemi di sorveglianza nonostante l\u2019aumento delle prove di abusi dei diritti umani.Il giorno dopo l\u2019incontro di Massari con il ministro dell\u2019Interno, il ministro italiano dello Sviluppo Economico Federica Guidi arriv\u00f2 al Cairo con trenta imprenditori italiani, sperando di firmare accordi nei settori dell\u2019edilizia, dell\u2019energia e delle armi. Adesso era Regeni il primo punto dell\u2019agenda. Il gruppo and\u00f2 subito ad Al-Ittihadiya, il principale palazzo presidenziale, l\u00ec dove mesi prima Regeni aveva aiutato i venditori ambulanti durante il blitz della polizia fuori dai cancelli sul retro. Massari e Guidi furono ammessi ad un incontro privato con al-Sisi, che ascolt\u00f2 seriamentementre gli italiani delineavano le loro preoccupazioni. Ma anche al-Sisi si limit\u00f2 a offrire solidariet\u00e0.Quella sera, Massari dette un ricevimento all\u2019ambasciata per la delegazione commerciale e per uomini d\u2019affari egiziani. Circa duecento persone si mescolarono nella sala dei ricevimenti, sorseggiando vino in attesa della cena. Tra di loro c\u2019era il vice ministro degli Esteri, Hossam Zaki, che con uno sguardo cupo si spinse attraverso la folla fino a Massari. \u201cNon lo sai?\u201d disse Zaki.\u201cSapere che cosa?\u201d Massari rispose.\u201cHanno trovato un corpo.\u201dQuella mattina presto, l\u2019autista di un pullman che viaggiava sulla strada del deserto Cairo-Alessandria nella parte ovest del Cairo, not\u00f2 qualcosa sul ciglio della strada. Quando scese scopr\u00ec un corpo, nudo dalla vita in gi\u00f9 e cosparso di sangue. Era Regeni.Massari si precipit\u00f2 all\u2019albergo Four Seasons, dove soggiornava Guidi. Assieme telefonarono a Renzi e al ministro degli Esteri Paolo Gentiloni. Poi cancellarono il ricevimento, mandando a casa gli ospiti confusi e senza una spiegazione. Poi Massari e il ministro andarono all\u2019appartamento di Regeni a Dokki, dove erano i suoi genitori. Quando l\u2019ambasciatore abbracci\u00f2 la madre di Regeni, Paola Deffendi, le peggiori paure della famigliavennero confermate. \u201c\u00c8 tutto finito\u201d avrebbe detto alla stampa pi\u00f9 tardi. \u201cLa felicita della nostra famiglia \u00e8 stata cos\u00ec breve.\u201dMassari arriv\u00f2 all\u2019obitorio Zeinhom al centro del Cairo dopo mezzanotte. Lo accompagnava una piccola squadra dall\u2019ambasciata, con un poliziotto. Inizialmente, i funzionari dell\u2019obitorio gli rifiutarono l\u2019ingresso. \u201cAprite la porta!\u201d url\u00f2 Massari, visibilmente agitato. Massari fu finalmente portato dentro una sala refrigerata dove il corpo di Regeni giaceva steso su un tavolo di metallo.La bocca di Regeni era spalancata e i suoi capelli erano impastati di sangue. Mancava uno dei denti anteriori e molti altri erano scheggiati o rotti, come se fossero stati colpiti con un oggetto contundente. La sua pelle era butterata da bruciature di sigaretta, e c\u2019erano ferite profonde sulla schiena. Il lobo dell\u2019orecchio destro era mozzato e le ossa di polsi, spalle e piedi erano frantumate. Un\u2019ondata di nausea colp\u00ec Massari. Regeni sembrava essere stato torturato a lungo. Giorni dopo, l\u2019autopsia italiana avrebbe confermato l\u2019entit\u00e0 delle sue lesioni: Regeni era stato picchiato, bruciato, pugnalato, e probabilmente frustato sulle piante dei piedi per un periodo di quattro giorni. Era morto quando gli avevano spezzato il collo.Nelle prime ore dell\u2019indagine, Nagy parl\u00f2 con una franchezza sorprendente. Disse ai giornalisti che Regeni aveva sofferto una morte lenta, e lasci\u00f2 aperta la possibilit\u00e0 che la polizia potesse essere coinvolta. \u201cNon lo escludiamo.\u201d Ma poco dopo l\u2019investigatore responsabile del caso sugger\u00ec che Regeni potesse essere morto in un incidente d\u2019auto. Teorie sconvolgenti apparvero sui giornali e in televisione: Regeni era omosessuale ed era stato ucciso da un amante geloso. Era un tossicodipendente o una pedina dei Fratelli Musulmani. Era una spia. Parecchi articoli sottolinearono il suo lavoro presso Oxford Analytica, che era stata fondata da un ex-funzionario dell\u2019amministrazione Nixon, come segno probabile di un suo impiego da parte della CIA o del MI6 britannico. In una conferenza stampa, il ministro degli Interni, Abdel-Ghaffar, rigett\u00f2 l\u2019ipotesi che i servizi di sicurezza avessero detenuto Regeni. \u201cCerto che no!\u201d disse. \u201cQuesta \u00e8 la mia ultima parola in materia: Non \u00e8 successo.\u201dMa se i funzionari egiziani avevano creduto di poter bluffare per tirarsi fuori dalla crisi Regeni, si erano sbagliati. Pi\u00f9 di 3.000 persone assisterono al suo funerale nel suo paese d\u2019origine, Fiumicello; in tutta l\u2019Italia, il lutto si trasform\u00f2 in indignazione quando emersero i dettagli delle torture atroci che aveva subito. Sulla stampa, Regeni fu spesso raffigurato con una foto in cui sorrideva con un gatto in braccio. Striscioni gialli con lo slogan \u201cVerit\u00e0 per Giulio Regeni\u201d comparvero nelle citt\u00e0 grandi e piccole. \u201cCi fermeremo solo quando avremo trovato la verit\u00e0,\u201d disse Renzi ai giornalisti. \u201cLa verit\u00e0 vera, non una verit\u00e0 di comodo.\u201dLa rabbia di Renzi si basava su qualcosa di pi\u00f9 di una sensazione. Nelle settimane successive alla morte di Regeni, gli Stati Uniti ricevettero dall\u2019Egitto informazioni di intelligence esplosive: la prova che funzionari di sicurezza egiziani avevano rapito, torturato e ucciso Regeni. \u201cAvevamo prove incontrovertibili della responsabilit\u00e0 ufficiale egiziana,\u201d mi disse un funzionario dell\u2019amministrazione Obama \u2014 uno dei tre ex funzionari che hanno confermato le prove. \u201cNon c\u2019era dubbio.\u201d Su raccomandazione del Dipartimento di Stato e della Casa Bianca, gli Stati Uniti passarono questa loro conclusione al governo Renzi. Ma per evitare di identificare la fonte, gli americani non condivisero i dati originali, n\u00e9 rivelarono quale agenzia di sicurezza pensavano fosse responsabile della morte di Regeni. \u201cNon era chiaro chi aveva dato l\u2019ordine di rapirlo e, presumibilmente, ucciderlo,\u201d mi disse un\u2019altro ex funzionario. Quello che gli americani sapevano per certo, e lo dissero agli italiani, fu che la leadership egiziana era completamente a conoscenza delle circostanze della morte di Regeni. \u201cNon avevamo alcun dubbio che questo fosse noto ai livelli pi\u00f9 alti,\u201d disse l\u2019altro funzionario. \u201cNon so se avevano responsabilit\u00e0. Ma sapevano. Sapevano.\u201dSettimane dopo, all\u2019inizio del 2016, l\u2019allora Segretario di Stato John F. Kerry affront\u00f2 il ministro egiziano degli Esteri, Sameh Shoukry, in un incontro a Washington. Fu una conversazione \u201cdecisamente accesa\u201d, mi disse un funzionario dell\u2019amministrazione Obama, sebbene lo staff di Kerry non avesse potuto capire se Shoukry stesse facendo muro di gomma o se semplicemente non conoscesse la verit\u00e0.\u201d Questo approccio diretto \u201csuscit\u00f2 qualche perplessit\u00e0\u201d all\u2019interno dell\u2019amministrazione, mi disse un altro funzionario, perch\u00e9 Kerry aveva la reputazione di trattare con i guanti di velluto l\u2019Egitto, un fulcro della politica estera americana dall\u2019epoca del trattato di pace Egitto-Israele del 1979.Una squadra di sette investigatori italiani era ormai arrivata al Cairo per assistere l\u2019indagine egiziana. I sette furono ostacolati in ogni modo. I testimoni sembravano essere stati imboccati. I filmati delle telecamere di sorveglianza della stazione della metropolitana vicina all\u2019appartamento di Regeni erano stati cancellati; le richieste di avere i metadati di milioni di telefonate vennero respinte perch\u00e9 ci\u00f2 avrebbe compromesso i diritti costituzionali dei cittadini egiziani. Alcuni coraggiosi testimoni egiziani parlarono con gli investigatori nel loro ufficio temporaneo nel seminterrato dell\u2019ambasciata italiana. Ma persino l\u00ec gli italiani si sentivano a disagio.Dopo la morte di Regeni, Massari, l\u2019ambasciatore, inizi\u00f2 a preoccuparsi per la sicurezza dell\u2019ambasciata; poco tempo dopo smise di usare email e telefoni per trattare argomenti sensibili, facendo invece ricorso, per mandare messaggi a Roma, ad una vecchia macchina per cifratura su carta. I funzionari italiani temevano che gli egiziani impiegati dall\u2019ambasciata italiana passassero informazioni alle forze di sicurezza egiziane; notarono anche che le luci di un appartamento di fronte all\u2019ambasciata erano sempre spente \u2014 un buon posto per mettere un microfono direzionale. Massari, ancora traumatizzato dal ricordo delle ferite di Regeni, era diventato un eremita ed evitava gli incontri con altri ambasciatori. Il suo rapporto con il governo egiziano si stava deteriorando; i funzionari egiziani, furiosi per un\u2019intervista che Massari aveva dato ad una stazione televisiva italiana, erano sicuri che egli stesse cercando di incolparli dell\u2019omicidio. \u201cAvevamo dedotto che lui si era gi\u00e0 schierato,\u201d mi disse poi Hossam Zaki, vice ministro degli Esteri. \u201cEra diventato abbastanza irrilevante. Inutile.\u201d Quando Massari usciva, la gente not\u00f2 che sembrava esausto. Gli amici dicevano che aveva difficolt\u00e0 a dormire.Le pressioni internazionali sugli egiziani crescevano. I giornali italiani avevano inviato al Cairo i loro giornalisti pi\u00f9 determinati. Apparve un sito web dal nome RegeniLeaks, per sollecitare le soffiate dagli informatori egiziani. La madre di Regeni cominci\u00f2 una sua campagna per ottenere che venisse rivelata la verit\u00e0, ed afferm\u00f2 in una conferenza stampa che aveva potuto riconoscere il corpo martoriato di Giulio soltanto dalla punta del naso. Attori, personaggi televisivi, e calciatori italiani vennero in suo aiuto. Degli egiziani dissero alla signora Deffendi che suo figlio \u201cera morto come un egiziano\u201d, un attestato di stima nell\u2019Egitto di al-Sisi. Il Parlamento Europeo pass\u00f2 una severa risoluzione che condannava le circostanze sospette in cui era morto Regeni; a Londra, degli attivisti presentarono al Parlamento una petizione con pi\u00f9 di 10.000 firme, chiedendo al governo britannico di assicurarsi che si effettuasse \u201cun\u2019indagine credibile\u201d. Anche l\u2019FBI stava aiutando l\u2019indagine italiana; quando un\u2019amica di Regeni atterr\u00f2 negli Stati Uniti per una vacanza, gli agenti la fermarono per farle alcune domande.Stavolta, l\u2019ostruzionismo non avrebbe funzionato. \u201cSiamo nella [espletivo] fino al collo,\u201d osserv\u00f2 un importante presentatore televisivo, Amr Adeeb, durante il suo programma.Fece una pausa e mi lanci\u00f2 uno sguardo ad effetto.\u201cCi\u00f2 \u00e8 quanto stiamo vedendo in Egitto: il lato oscuro di quelle istituzioni; i segreti al loro cuore.\u201dIl senatore si riferiva alle agenzie di sicurezza egiziane, ma quello che non diceva era che l\u2019indagine Regeni stava portando alla luce dolorose incrinature all\u2019interno dello stato italiano. C\u2019erano altre priorit\u00e0. I servizi di intelligence italiani avevano bisogno dell\u2019aiuto dell\u2019Egitto per contrastare lo Stato Islamico, gestire il conflitto in Libia e monitorare il flusso di migranti attraverso il Mediterraneo. La societ\u00e0 energetica controllata dallo stato italiano, l\u2019Eni, Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, aveva i propri interessi. Settimane prima che Regeni arrivasse al Cairo, l\u2019Eni aveva annunciato una grande scoperta: il giacimento di gas naturale Zohr, a 193 chilometri dalla costa egiziana settentrionale, che conteneva circa 850 miliardi metri cubi di gas \u2014 l\u2019equivalente di 5.5 miliardi di barili di petrolio.L\u2019Italia \u00e8 uno dei paesi pi\u00f9 vulnerabili in campo energetico, cosa che rende l\u2019Eni pi\u00f9 di un gigante da $58 miliardi, con operazioni in 73 paesi; lo rende anche una parte integrante della politica estera italiana. Nel 2014, Renzi lo riconobbe, definendo l\u2019Eni \u201cun pezzo fondamentale della nostra politica energetica, della nostra politica estera, e della nostra politica di intelligence.\u201d In molti paesi, l\u2019amministratore delegato di Eni, Claudio Descalzi \u2014 l\u2019altissimo petroliere milanese che ha recentemente guidato gli sforzi di esplorazione in Africa \u2014 conosce i leader locali meglio dei ministri italiani.Mentre montava la pressione per risolvere l\u2019omicidio di Regeni, Descalzi, un ospite regolare al Cairo, assicurava ad Amnesty International che le autorit\u00e0 egiziane \u201cstavano facendo il massimo sforzo\u201d per trovare gli assassini di Regeni. Aveva discusso il caso almeno tre volte con al-Sisi. Secondo un funzionario del ministero degli Affari Esteri italiano, i diplomatici cominciarono a credere che l\u2019Eni si fosse unita ai servizi di intelligence italiani nel tentativo di arrivare velocemente ad una soluzione del caso. L\u2019Eni ha storicamente assunto spie italiane in pensione nel la sua divisione di sicurezza interna, dice Andrea Greco, coautore di \u201cLo Stato Parallelo,\u201d un libro del 2016 sull\u2019Eni. \u201cHanno una forte collaborazione. Sono sicuro che possono aver collaborato sul caso Regeni, anche se non \u00e8 sicuro che i loro interessi siano stati allineati.\u201d Una portavoce dell\u2019Eni dice che l\u2019azienda \u00e8 stata \u201csconvolta\u201d dalla morte di Regeni e che pur non avendo alcuna responsabilit\u00e0 nelle indagini, ha sempre continuato \u201ca seguire la questione molto da vicino\u201d nelle sue interazioni con il governo egiziano.La presunta collaborazione tra l\u2019Eni e i servizi di intelligence italiani divenne una fonte di tensione all\u2019interno del governo italiano. Funzionari del ministero degli Esteri e dell\u2019intelligence cominciarono a diffidare gli uni degli altri e, a volte, a non condividere informazioni. \u201cEravamo in guerra, e non solo con gli egiziani,\u201d mi ha raccontato un funzionario. I diplomatici sospettavano che alcune spie italiane, in un tentativo di chiudere il caso, avessero organizzato l\u2019intervista di al-Sisi al giornale italiano La Repubblica sei settimane dopo la morte di Regeni. (Il direttore de La Repubblica afferma che la richiesta per l\u2019intervista sia arrivata dal giornale stesso.) Nell\u2019intervista, al-Sisi espresse solidariet\u00e0 per i genitori di Regeni, definendo la sua morte \u201cterrificante e inaccettabile,\u201d e giur\u00f2 di trovare i colpevoli. \u201cArriveremo alla verit\u00e0,\u201d disse.Il 24 Marzo, otto giorni dopo la pubblicazione dell\u2019intervista, la polizia del Cairo apr\u00ec il fuoco contro un minivan che attraversava un sobborgo benestante con a bordo cinque uomini, alcuni con fedine penali sporche o storie di tossicodipendenza. Tutti e cinque vennero uccisi, e in una dichiarazione della polizia vennero definiti una banda di rapitori che aveva come bersaglio cittadini stranieri. In un successivo blitz in un appartamento collegato agli uomini uccisi, la polizia disse di aver scoperto il passaporto, la carta di credito e la tessera universitaria di Regeni. Poco dopo, i media di stato egiziani riportarono che gli assassini di Regeni erano stati identificati. Gli investigatori italiani, che si trovavano all\u2019aeroporto per tornare in Italia per la Pasqua, furono richiamati, e il ministero dell\u2019Interno egiziano li ringrazi\u00f2 per la loro collaborazione.In Italia, la notizia della sparatoria venne accolta con scetticismo \u2014 su Twitter cominci\u00f2 a circolare l\u2019hashtag #noncicredo. La versione egiziana si smont\u00f2 velocemente. Dei testimoni dissero ad alcuni giornalisti (me incluso) che gli uomini erano stati giustiziati a sangue freddo. Uno era stato colpito mentre correva e il suo cadavere posizionato pi\u00f9 tardi dentro il minivan. \u201cNon hanno avuto nessuna possibilit\u00e0,\u201d mi disse un uomo scuotendo la testa. Il loro collegamento con Regeni croll\u00f2: gli investigatori italiani usarono i tabulati telefonici per mostrare che il presunto capo della banda, Tarek Abdel Fattah, era a pi\u00f9 di novanta kilometri a nord del Cairo il giorno del presunto rapimento di Regeni.L\u2019autunno scorso, il procuratore capo egiziano ha detto alla sua controparte italiana che due poliziotti erano stati accusati di omicidio in relazione alla morte dei cinque. Per\u00f2rimaneva una domanda imbarazzante: se gli uomini morti non avevano ucciso Regeni, come era finito il suo passaporto nel loro appartamento?Gli Italiani avevano pochi dubbi che l\u2019intero episodio fosse stato un rozzo tentativo di insabbiamento, eseguito in modo cos\u00ec inetto che gli egiziani si erano incriminati da soli. Eppure funzion\u00f2. Gli investigatori italiani lasciarono il Cairo, e l\u2019indagine si blocc\u00f2. Massari fu sostituito da un nuovo ambasciatore a cui venne ordinato di restare a Roma. In Egitto, \u201cRegeni\u201d, divent\u00f2 una parola che poteva essere solo mormorata. \u201cTutti quelli che tengono a Giulio hanno paura,\u201d mi disse Hoda Kamel, una sindacalista che aiutava Regeni con le sue ricerche. \u201cSembra che tutto lo stato, con tutto il suo potere, stia tentando di far morire l\u2019intera storia.\u201dMuhammad Abdullah, il contatto di Regeni nel sindacato dei venditori ambulanti, era un informatore dell\u2019agenzia di sicurezza nazionale. Usando una telecamera nascosta, aveva registrato la sua conversazione con Regeni sulla borsa di studio da \u00a310.000 sterline (gli egiziani hanno consegnato il video). In una dichiarazione, ha descritto i suoi incontri con il suo contatto, il Colonnello Sharif Magdi Ibrahim Abdlaal, che, afferma, gli aveva promesso una ricompensa alla chiusura del caso Regeni.L\u2019identit\u00e0 della seconda persona era forse pi\u00f9 sorprendente. I funzionari italiani sono arrivati alla conclusione che nel mese precedente la sparizione di Regeni, il suo coinquilino, l\u2019avvocato Mohamed El Sayed, permise a funzionari dell\u2018agenzia di sicurezza nazionale di perquisire il loro appartamento.Nelle settimane successive, come risulta dai tabulati telefonici, Sayad ha avuto contatti con due funzionari dell\u2018agenzia di sicurezza nazionale.Sayad non ha risposto alle richieste di commento, ma ho avuto un lunga corrispondenza su Facebook con l\u2019altra coinquilina di Regeni, Juliane Schoki. La sua versione riflette il clima di diffidenza nel Cairo di al-Sisi. Secondo Schoki, gi\u00e0 dopo pochi giorni dal suo trasloco nel loro appartamento Sayad esprimeva sospetti su Regeni. Ricorda che diceva \u201cPenso che Giulio sia una spia.\u201dDopo la scomparsa di Regeni, lei cominci\u00f2 a condividere quell\u2019impressione. I due supponevano che Regeni lavorasse per il Mossad. (Mi disse che una volta Regeni le aveva raccontato di aver avuto una fidanzata Israeliana e di aver visitato Israele.) Schoki, che ha poi lasciato l\u2019Egitto, aveva raccontato questa sua idea a funzionari di intelligence egiziani. Ricordava che \u201cerano sorpresi perch\u00e9 avevano la stessa idea\u201d.Dopo la morte di Regeni, seduti con Sayad a guardare un thriller in televisione, avrebbe esclamavano, \u201cE\u2019 esattamente cos\u00ec!\u201d \u2014 una cosa che ammette, ripensandoci, \u201csembra un po\u2019 ridicola.\u201d \u201cMa un anno fa sembrava avere perfettamente senso.\u201dGli italiani hanno usato i tabulati telefonici egiziani per stabilire altri collegamenti e hanno scoperto che il poliziotto che sosteneva di aver trovato il passaporto di Regeni era stato in contatto con membri della squadra dell\u2019agenzia di sicurezza nazionale che pedinava Regeni. All\u2019improvviso, i genitori di Regeni hanno osato sperare che la verit\u00e0 potesse venire a galla. \u201cIl male continua a svelarsi piano piano come un gomitolo di lana,\u201d hanno scritto i suoi genitori in una lettera pubblicata su La Repubblica nel primo anniversario della sua scomparsa.Tuttavia, nonostante gli egiziani abbiano ammesso di aver sorvegliato Regeni, hanno sempre insistito di non averlo n\u00e9 rapito n\u00e9 ucciso. E anche se ci\u00f2 potesse essere provato, rimane il mistero principale: Perch\u00e9 venne \u201cucciso come un egiziano\u201d? Una teoria semplice si rif\u00e0 all\u2019opera di un agente deviato. Nel ministero dell\u2019interno, che controlla l\u2019agenzia di sicurezza nazionale, anche agenti di basso livello godono di considerevole autonomia, e tuttavia raramente sono tenuti a rispondere dei propri atti, afferma Yezid Sayigh, senior associate della Carnegie Middle East Center di Beirut. Secondo lui, \u201cpossono accadere cose che al-Sisi non approva\u201d. Per\u00f2 c\u2019era molto altro che non aveva senso. Quale funzionario egiziano ha creduto che torturare un straniero fosse una buona idea? Perch\u00e9 scaricare il suo corpo sul ciglio di un\u2019autostrada trafficata, invece di seppellirlo nel deserto dove poteva non essere mai pi\u00f9 trovato? E perch\u00e9 far trovare il corpo al momento dell\u2019arrivo al Cairo di una delegazione italiana di cos\u00ec alto livello?Una lettera anonima inviata all\u2019ambasciata italiana a Berna, in Svizzera, l\u2019anno scorso e poi pubblicata su un giornale italiano, ha offerto un\u2019altra spiegazione: Regeni si \u00e8 trovato nel mezzo ad una guerra per il territorio condotta nell\u2019ombra tra agenzia di sicurezza nazionale e servizi segreti militari, nella quale un gruppo ha usato la sua morte per mettere in imbarazzo l\u2019altro gruppo. I dettagli suggerivano che l\u2019autore del resoconto avesse una conoscenza intima dell\u2019apparato di sicurezza egiziano, per\u00f2 appariva improbabile che una sola persona potesse sapere cos\u00ec tanto. Tuttavia funzionari americani di alto livello mi hanno detto che la lettera era coerente con pi\u00f9 approfonditi rapporti di intelligence sulle feroci lotte interne per il potere tra agenzie di sicurezza rivali. Uno di loro ha affermato che \u201cusano i casi come leva per mettersi in imbarazzo a vicenda.\u201dLa possibilit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 allarmante \u00e8 che la morte di Regeni sia stata un messaggio intenzionale \u2014 un segnale che, sotto al-Sisi, anche un occidentale pu\u00f2 essere soggetto agli eccessi pi\u00f9 brutali. A Roma, un funzionario mi ha detto che quando il corpo di Regeni fu scoperto, era appoggiato ad un muro. \u201cVolevano che lo trovassero?\u201d Il funzionario dell\u2019amministrazione Obama ha detto di credere che qualcuno negli alti ranghi del governo egiziano possa aver ordinato la morte di Regeni \u201cper mandare un messaggio agli altri stranieri e ai governi stranieri di smettere di giocare con la sicurezza dell\u2019Egitto.\u201dNessun funzionario egiziano di grado elevato ha accettato di parlare con me per quest\u2019articolo. Ma Hossam Zaki, l\u2019ex vice ministro degli Esteri che adesso \u00e8 l\u2019assistente segretario generale della Lega Araba, mi ha detto che i funzionari egiziani credono che l\u2019omicidio sia stato l\u2019opera di una non identificata \u201cterza parte\u201d che cercava di sabotare le relazioni tra Egitto e Italia. \u201cGli egiziani non trattano male gli stranieri, punto.\u201dNonostante tutto ci\u00f2, la morte di Regeni ha gettato un\u2019ombra sulla sempre pi\u00f9 ridotta comunit\u00e0 di espatriati del Cairo. Mi ha detto un diplomatico europeo: \u201cpoche cose mi hanno sconvolto cos\u00ec profondamente.\u201d Prima che parlassimo, il diplomatico mi aveva chiesto di depositare il mio cellulare in una scatola blocca-segnale \u2014 cos\u00ec che la nostra conversazione non potesse essere monitorata. La morte di Regeni, continuava il diplomatico, ha segnalato la direzione generale dell\u2019Egitto: Regeni \u00e8 stato vittima della paranoia verso gli stranieri che ora scorre attraverso la societ\u00e0 egiziana; dopo la rivoluzione, anche piccole interazioni potevano essere pericolose. Il diplomatico ha ricordato un pranzo nel quartiere islamico del Cairo: un uomo agitato si lamentava con un altro ospite che aveva scattato una foto del pasto \u2014 fagiolini, pane e tamiyya, il falafel egiziano. Cominci\u00f2 ad urlare: \u201cSei un straniero. Userai questa foto per mostrare che mangiamo solo fagioli e pane!\u201dGli italiani hanno ci\u00f2 che Carlo Bonini \u2014 un giornalista de LaRepubblica che ha scritto molto sul caso Regeni \u2014 chiama \u201cl\u2019ultima pallottola.\u201d Secondo la legge italiana, si potrebbero iscrivere nel registro degli indagati presso la procura di Roma i pochi funzionari della sicurezza egiziana che si ritengono responsabili. Ma anche questa potrebbe essere una vittoria di Pirro: l\u2019Egitto non estraderebbe mai nessuno per essere processato. E sembrano esserci poche possibilit\u00e0 che al-Sisi venga spinto a dire la verit\u00e0. A Roma il mese scorso, alcuni funzionari hanno ammesso che l\u2019indagine \u00e8 poco pi\u00f9 che un kabuki geopolitico; la politica, e non il lavoro della polizia, potrebbe determinare la sua conclusione. Nei 18 mesi dalla morte di Regeni, al-Sisi ha cenato con la Cancelliera tedesca, Angela Merkel, davanti alle piramidi, e in Aprile \u00e8 stato accolto entusiasticamente alla Casa Bianca dal Presidente Trump. Il 14 Agosto, il governo italiano ha annunciato l\u2019intenzione di rimandare il proprio ambasciatore al Cairo. Il giacimento di gas naturale, Zohr, pu\u00f2 cominciare la produzione a dicembre.A Fiumicello, Regeni riposa sotto una fila di cipressi. Fiori, candele, volumi di Spinoza e Hesse ricoperti di plastica sono accumulati sulla sua tomba, ed una piccola foto lo raffigura mentre parla ad una folla, tenendo un microfono, il suo viso aperto ed onesto. Al contrario delle altre tombe che la circondano, la tomba di Regeni \u00e8 una semplice lastra di marmo. Perch\u00e9 l\u2019indagine \u00e8 ancora aperta, il prete della parrocchia spiegava, i funzionari potrebbero avere ancora bisogno di riesumare i suoi resti.Quest\u2019articolo \u00e8 stato tradotto dall\u2019inglese da Lauren Cater Di Martino.Declan Walsh \u00e8 il caporedattore del New York Times presso la sede del Cairo. Questo \u00e8 il suo primo articolo per la rivista.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Best Way to Let Summer Fruit Shine", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteWhat do you picture when you hear the word cobbler?(If your first thoughts have to do with cocktails or shoemakers, you\u2019ve obviously not eaten enough cobblers in your life. Read on.)Regardless of the version being served, the common feature of this pastry is plenty of fruit \u2014 preferably fresh, dead ripe and picked at the height of the season. It\u2019s this fruit that\u2019s critical to a cobbler\u2019s excellence. No matter whether it\u2019s baked with pie dough, biscuits or cake batter, the fruit needs to release enough juice to boil up, forming all those wonderfully condensed, sticky pockets.For biscuit cobblers like this one, the simmering juices have another advantage: They keep the biscuit bottoms supple and soft, basically steaming them tender. Then the tops, exposed to the dry heat of the oven, turn golden and crisp. It\u2019s this juxtaposition of the soft, syrup-soaked caky layer crowned with a very crisp surface that makes biscuit cobblers my favorite of the three.Here, I\u2019ve kept the topping and filling as simple as possible so that the fruit shines.You can use almost any fruit as long as it\u2019s juicy. Summer fruit works best: berries, peaches, plums, cherries, nectarines, apricots, pears or a combination. Save your apples, figs and bananas for other projects. You\u2019ll want a little more than a cup of cut fruit per person.Then sweeten the fruit to taste. Tart berries and sour cherries may need more sugar than gentle, low-acid peaches and pears. Start with a few tablespoons and go from there, tasting along the way. Bear in mind that as the juices cook down and the water evaporates, the fruit will become even sweeter.A little instant tapioca in the filling helps thicken it. Be sure to let the cobbler bake until you see those juices bubble up. This is a sign that they are boiling, a necessary step to activate the gelling power of the tapioca.Before covering the fruit with the biscuits, you\u2019ll need to chill the dough. This helps the biscuits keep their shape. Twenty minutes will do it, though if it\u2019s more convenient to make the biscuit dough a few hours in advance, you can. Just keep it well chilled until baking.A little ice cream, whipped cream or a dollop of sour cream on the side is always welcome when serving a cobbler \u2014 at least for the majority of its incarnations.cookingAdvertisement"}

We all have our things.\u201dMr. Hilton is unfazed. \u201cI certainly have experienced a degree of curiosity, yes,\u201d he said.Now he is Fox News\u2019s newest host, representing its first major foray into the tech world, and the network is experimenting with Mr. Hilton\u2019s more esoteric take on the brash Fox News style.\u201cTraditional television anchors might ask more shorter, pointed questions; they might try to trap their guests,\u201d said John Finley, senior vice president for development and production at Fox News. \u201cSteve\u2019s about having an intellectual discussion.\u201dCan it work? \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of finding out,\u201d Mr. Finley said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something different.\u201dOn a recent Sunday in Los Angeles, Mr. Hilton arrived for breakfast a little late, wearing a gray T-shirt, neon green shorts and flip-flops. He is petite but muscular, clean-shaven and with bright blue eyes. On his wrists were worn-out festival bracelets from Glastonbury and Coachella.He had chosen one of the trendiest places in the city, Rose Cafe (with a menu featuring avocado tartine and lemonade made with tangerine oil and filtered water), to talk populism. Mr. Hilton ordered shakshuka, beet hummus and tea with milk.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on for half the country? Who\u2019s lost out? The victims of elitist agenda; standing up for them, being a voice for them,\u201d Mr. Hilton said. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea behind positive populism, that\u2019s what drives the content.\u201dMr. Hilton\u2019s mission with his Fox News program, he said, is to create a working-class coalition uniting supporters of Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders with the rage that fueled the Brexit movement.\u201cMy argument is: Let\u2019s blame the people who are responsible,\u201d he said. Those people, he added, are the \u201cglobal elite.\u201dIt\u2019s an ironic position for Mr. Hilton to take given that he is part of that global elite \u2014 he and his wife live in a $12.5 million home in one of America\u2019s richest ZIP codes.But Mr. Hilton insisted he is not one of the elites he targets in his show. Over a subsequent meal in Menlo Park, Calif., he hit the table with his fist as he described how being elite \u201cis about what you believe in \u2014 those people, I see them as my enemy. They have taken control of the levers of power.\u201dSome of that sense of being an outsider may come from his childhood. The son of Hungarian refugees, Mr. Hilton was raised by his stepfather, who was a construction worker, and his mother, a clerk, in the seaside town of Brighton, England. As a child, he won a scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital School in Horsham, a school for children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201cHe was a scholarship boy,\u201d said Michael Gove, a British Conservative politician. \u201cSheer talent brought him into that orbit, but he wasn\u2019t really cut from the Savile Row cloth. To call him an outsider would be an exaggeration, but he\u2019s certainly not an insider.\u201dMr. Hilton does not think his childhood was the factor. \u201cIt\u2019s no hard-luck story,\u201d he said.Mr. Hilton attended Oxford University and afterward took a job at the Conservative Central Office in 1990. Mr. Cameron was then head of the political unit, and Ms. Whetstone had joined three months earlier. In 1992, Mr. Hilton coordinated the advertising in a surprise general election in which the Conservatives won.Over time, Mr. Hilton became Mr. Cameron\u2019s closest adviser and godfather to his first son. With Mr. Hilton\u2019s advice, Mr. Cameron softened his look, ditching his tie and hugging a husky on a trip to highlight global warming.Mr. Hilton soon developed a reputation as the quirky, secretive figure behind a radically conservative agenda and was often featured in the tabloids for his casual clothes, bare feet and sweaty post-bike-ride look. In 2008, he married Ms. Whetstone.\u201cDavid Cameron was immensely able and charismatic,\u201d Mr. Gove said, \u201cbut it was Steve who was the idea dynamo.\u201dYet by 2012, their relationship was fraying. Mr. Hilton thought Mr. Cameron was compromising too much with the European Union and moving too slowly on their vision to cut bureaucracy. The two began to drift apart, and Mr. Hilton moved to California. The fallout was complete when Mr. Hilton returned to Britain last year to campaign against Mr. Cameron in favor of Brexit. The two no longer speak, Mr. Hilton said.When Mr. Hilton landed in Silicon Valley, he was known locally as the eccentric husband of Ms. Whetstone, who later left Google for Uber\u2019s top communications and policy job. (She left Uber this year and has joined Facebook.)Mr. Hilton took a teaching job at Stanford\u2019s design school. Then he had an idea for a website that makes it easier to find and give to small-time political campaigns.Crowdpac, which has raised $8.5 million from investors like Index Ventures and SV Angel, has since become part of the tech world\u2019s sometimes shaky efforts to engage with politics.For Mr. Hilton, Crowdpac is where his conservative leanings stand out the most. He said the company isn\u2019t excited to be part of \u201cthis whole thing,\u201d referring to his Fox News program. \u201cWe\u2019re nonpartisan, but most of our employees are very liberal,\u201d he said.\u201cI literally don\u2019t know any others,\u201d he said, before clarifying that he doesn\u2019t quite identify himself as a supporter of the president but rather of the populist movement that Mr. Trump rode to the White House. Mr. Trump is \u201cjust the start,\u201d Mr. Hilton said.His friends said they see the fiery conservative as an unusual and fun addition to a typically homogeneous social scene, especially in Silicon Valley.\u201cSteve wants to disrupt the political status quo, and that\u2019s what Silicon Valley is good at doing,\u201d said Joanna Coles, chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, who is a frequent guest at his dinner parties. She said that she doesn\u2019t agree with his politics but that his dinner parties are \u201cfabulous.\u201d\u201cYou just have to smile,\u201d Juliet de Baubigny, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, said of Mr. Hilton. \u201cI hope that we\u2019ll always have different points of opinion around the table. I hope that we will always have Trump supporters in the mix.\u201dAre there a lot of Trump supporters in the mix?\u201cAt the moment, sadly, he\u2019s the only one,\u201d Ms. de Baubigny said. \u201cBut I\u2019m grateful for the fact that we have one.\u201dMr. Hilton said the tech industry\u2019s lack of interest in politics gives it the potential to be radically conservative. \u201cA lot of the foundational philosophical approaches of tech leaders are actually all about decentralization of power,\u201d he said.Mr. Hilton\u2019s program has also become a surprising landing spot for liberals.\u201cWhen I went on the show, a bunch of progressive friends of mine were complaining, like, \u2018Why would you go on this right-winger\u2019s show?\u2019\u201d said Zack Exley, a former senior staff member for Mr. Sanders, who appeared on the program last month. \u201cWhat Fox does all day every day is they point at immigrants, they point at activists, whipping up racism, that\u2019s what they do all day long. But Steve for an hour points at corporate power. If we can\u2019t engage with somebody who\u2019s doing that, that\u2019s crazy.\u201dMr. Hilton said he\u2019s staying for the long haul.\u201cWe didn\u2019t move here so I could save American democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve embraced it with the zeal of a convert.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Art for a Post-Surveillance Age", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPaglen is currently at work on his most radical project yet. This spring, he plans to send a satellite \u2014 a reflective, faceted Mylar inflatable \u2014 into low orbit, where it will be visible at night from Earth for eight weeks or so, literally twinkling like a diamond in the sky before it disintegrates in the atmosphere. If all goes according to plan, it will be the world\u2019s first space sculpture, unprecedented in contemporary art.The Orbital Reflector, as Paglen calls it, seems at first glance almost romantic, even deliberately na\u00efve. It has no scientific purpose; it doesn\u2019t even carry a camera. But under closer scrutiny, it can be seen as an elaboration of the artist\u2019s ongoing thesis about art, technology and the impossibility of separating either from a specific moment in time. \u2018\u2018It began as a thought experiment in which we imagined that spaceflight was the opposite of what it actually is,\u2019\u2019 he explains over lunch at Soho House, at a table overlooking the Berlin TV tower, with its iconic dome evoking Sputnik, Earth\u2019s first satellite. In the American mind, space is a frontier: \u2018\u2018We imagine going to the moon and planting a flag, going to an asteroid and mining, going to Mars and setting up a colony,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018And I think that expansionist mentality is very self-destructive, especially given the kind of precarious relationship we now have to the ecosystem here on Earth, because it allows us to imagine that Earth is disposable.\u2019\u2019 Billionaire entrepreneurs may dream of colonizing Mars, but in fact, space is not going to save us. Aliens are not going to grant us absolution. \u2018\u2018People expect this kind of profound cosmic altruism, which is very religious in a way. Space is completely wrapped up with this kind of stuff, which is what makes it interesting.\u2019\u20196 PhotosManaging the project is Zia Oboodiyat, a retired engineer who ran large communications satellite programs for the San Francisco-based Space Systems/Loral. He first met Paglen in 2011 while the artist was working on the time capsule; Oboodiyat oversaw the construction of the satellite the disc was attached to and advocated for the project. When Paglen approached him about the Orbital Reflector, Oboodiyat immediately recognized its potential lyricism. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t have to be rich to see it; you don\u2019t have to be tall to see it,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u2018\u2018You don\u2019t have to be American. Anybody anywhere on Earth has equal opportunity to see something that gives humanity hope.\u2019\u2019Paglen moved to Berlin partly for financial reasons \u2014 \u2018\u2018I wanted to hire people, not spend $10,000 a month on a studio in Sunset Park\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but seems to have found a home amid the city\u2019s young expat artists and WikiLeaks types. At a Vietnamese restaurant, he bumps into a hacktivist friend who looks all of 17. \u2018\u2018These guys have guts,\u2019\u2019 Paglen notes, after saying hello. \u2018\u2018He was way up the butthole of the F.B.I. I probably shouldn\u2019t talk about it.\u2019\u2019Paglen doesn\u2019t describe himself as a dissident \u2014 \u2018\u2018I\u2019m as American as it gets, a product of these contradictions\u2019\u2019 \u2014 but it\u2019s impossible not to connect the themes in his work to a childhood spent on military bases. His father was an Air Force ophthalmologist; his mother, one of the first female Episcopalian priests. In third grade, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Paglen got in trouble for skipping school to sneak into lectures on dinosaurs at Berkeley \u2014 the same lecture halls in which he\u2019d later be working toward his doctorate. The family moved to Wiesbaden, Germany, when he was 12, and he spent two years in a German school in a nearby village, where, as a foreign student, he was ostracized. \u2018\u2018When you\u2019re not the beneficiary of privilege, suddenly you see it for what it is,\u2019\u2019 he says.An ongoing theme in Paglen\u2019s more satirical work is the puerile machismo of military culture\u2019s symbology and nomenclature, \u2018\u2018the collective unconscious of this world of secrecy and violence,\u2019\u2019 as he puts it. One afternoon, Hanna Mattes, who oversees Paglen\u2019s studio and helps manage its external production, is consulting with the artist on one of the sculptures he\u2019s making for the fall show: an enormous dragon inspired by the small trophy in his studio. The trophy, Paglen explains, is presented to members of the 315th Network Warfare Squadron upon retirement. Paglen\u2019s version will be a 12-foot sculpture inscribed in fetishistic detail, like medieval armor for the cyber age. The best way to preserve the details, they conclude, will be to 3D-print the mold in four sections, lightly polishing them to remove any marks. Another concern is the weight: The finished dragon, cast in bronze, will weigh two tons. Paglen mentions a crane. Mattes looks at him. \u2018\u2018Maybe we should just paint the form for the exhibition.\u2019\u2019The dragon will be included in the 2018 Smithsonian exhibit. This year\u2019s Metro Pictures exhibit will showcase Paglen\u2019s ongoing work with different kinds of artificial intelligence technologies, taking viewers down a rabbit hole of imagery, from the now quaint-seeming pictures first made by humans in the early 1990s to train military facial recognition software, to the kind of \u2018\u2018invisible images\u2019\u2019 computers hallucinate for themselves \u2014 say, when we post an image on Facebook \u2014 in order to make sense of the external world. \u2018\u2018This is how an A.I. brain sees a shark,\u2019\u2019 Paglen says back in his studio, looking at a weirdly beautiful Abstract Expressionist-like swath of blues and grays that results from a computer creating a visual amalgam of thousands of images of the animal in water. The exhibit invites critical questions about the extent to which artificial intelligence algorithms, with their potential for programmed-in bias, are governing our reality. It\u2019s also aesthetically provocative: \u2018\u2018Man,\u2019\u2019 a distillation of figurative imagery, vaguely recalls a Francis Bacon portrait; \u2018\u2018Rainbow\u2019\u2019 \u2014 a blend of cosmic-like rainbows \u2014 a Dali-esque dreamscape. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s like I\u2019m relearning art history,\u2019\u2019 Paglen says.So how does an artist who has devoted his career to empirical scrutiny of those things that will shape our future, from artificial intelligence to the annexation of space, respond rationally to a time in which reason itself \u2014 when it comes to political discourse, at least \u2014 seems to be increasingly endangered? \u2018\u2018Those are foundational questions for me,\u2019\u2019 Paglen says. \u2018\u2018Nothing that you make in the world exists in isolation from the social and political and ecological dimensions of it.\u2019\u2019 He hasn\u2019t given up on art\u2019s ability to spark the imagination \u2014 and to make us see the things we might prefer not to. The Orbital Reflector presented an opportunity to \u2018\u2018get messy .\u2009.\u2009. to make something that\u2019s beautiful, but also self-contradictory, and tries to challenge common sense.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s Carl Sagan meets Dada for a new millennium\u2019s inhumanity.As we talk, the sky darkens in Berlin, and the first blinking glimmerings appear. \u2018\u2018For me, there\u2019s something very romantic about going and looking at the stars and trying to photograph spy satellites,\u2019\u2019 Paglen says. \u2018\u2018Ultimately, what it comes down to is looking at the sky and trying to understand something about one\u2019s place in history. People have been doing this for tens of thousands of years. This is kind of a variation on that. What if we could imagine a sky that wasn\u2019t out to get us, you know?\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Six-Second Commercials Are Coming to N.F.L. Games on Fox", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new kind of advertising is coming to N.F.L. games and other programming on Fox Sports this fall: the six-second television commercial.\u201cWhen the six-second ads are placed in unique positions, it has the potential to gain even more attention than a traditional unit,\u201d Eric Shanks, president of Fox Sports, said in an interview.N.F.L. fans will first see the ads on Fox on Sept. 10 just before kickoff in the network\u2019s games on the regular season\u2019s opening weekend, and Mr. Shanks said they were also being offered for the World Series and other \u201cmarquee events.\u201d The network is working to integrate them sparingly into some in-game breaks with 15- and 30-second spots; it may also place them through new formats, like in a box adjacent to players on a field during pauses. The hope is that they will eventually help reduce the overall commercial time that people sit through.\u201cSo, for example, if a pitching coach comes to the mound just to have a conversation and you know that conversation is going to last 30 seconds, is a six-second unit in there going to add to the experience and then be able to decrease the amount of ad inventory somewhere else?\u201d Mr. Shanks said.The effort underscores the new strategies that broadcasters are deploying to keep the attention of consumers who often clutch a smartphone or tablet \u2014 or both \u2014 while watching their shows, or avoid ads entirely through Netflix. It\u2019s a major shift from the typical spots that TV networks sell and will put a new burden on marketers to not only attract viewers\u2019 attention but also pitch a product in less time than it takes to read this sentence out loud.On network television, the trend has been toward shorter commercials: In the first half of this year, 36 percent of national TV ads were 15 seconds long while 49 percent lasted 30 seconds, Nielsen data shows. In 2014, 29 percent of ads were 15-second spots, while 61 percent were 30 seconds long.Part of the network\u2019s pitch with the Teen Choice Awards was the messaging around the shorter commercials, such as telling viewers that their programming would return in less than 30 seconds, then airing several of the short ads. That improved the odds people would stay in their seats while fostering some good will with a quicker interruption.That rationale helped Fox charge roughly as much for the six-second spots on the show as it did for 15-second ads, according to people familiar with the negotiations, and reduced the program\u2019s overall commercial time.Similarly, Fox has been able to maintain the premium for the six-second ads it is selling now by pointing to lucrative placements, like just before kickoff for an N.F.L. game, the people said. While the ads are being sold as part of broader packages, a six-second spot could cost, at the high end, around $200,000, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s a long enough amount of time to actually tell a story, whether it\u2019s to convey an emotion or deliver a product message or a piece of news, and yet short enough that the consumer is not irritated by being forced to watch an ad,\u201d said Tara Walpert Levy, vice president of agency and media solutions at YouTube and Google.Mr. Marchese is aware of the challenges but unperturbed. \u201cThe brands and agencies that are able to buy these new models, not stuck in legacy-only buying structures, will be the ones that get to take advantage,\u201d he said in an email.Dave Penski, who oversees media investments as chief executive of Publicis Media Exchange Americas, said that while six-second ads might not work for brands aiming to sell complicated products, he anticipated interest from large sports advertisers that want to reinforce longer messages or simply remind consumers about already recognizable goods.\u201cIt\u2019s an innovation that\u2019s more cross-screen than others because there\u2019s already, certainly in the digital world, a huge amount of six-second advertising that\u2019s going on out there,\u201d he said.Dave Campanelli, who oversees video investments at Horizon Media, an ad-buying firm, said he would explore Fox Sports\u2019s six-second TV ads but was skeptical that the unit would become a new standard, partly because of the constraints around crafting messages of that length.He agreed, though, that broadcasters needed to find more ways to shorten commercial breaks and the number of brands featured there.\u201cWith so many different ways to record and fast-forward, or look at your phone during the commercial break and not pay attention, or just change the channel, that\u2019s hurt commercial retention and hurt commercial viewership,\u201d he said. \u201cPlaying with pods and commercialization will definitely change over time and become a bigger piece of what we do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Netanyahu Investigators Close In, Some Ask: How Long Can He Hold On?", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Political cartoons depict flames licking at the foundations of the fortresslike household of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Commentators say the noose is tightening around his neck.A day earlier, in a legal document pertaining to the negotiations with Mr. Harow, the police said in writing, for the first time, that Mr. Netanyahu was suspected of bribery, as well as fraud and breach of trust.In light of these developments, analysts say, it appears likely that Israel\u2019s longest-serving prime minister after David Ben-Gurion will ultimately face charges, injecting his fourth term with a new level of turbulence and intrigue. The question now, his critics say, is how long he can stave off what they view as his looming political demise.Any actual indictment could still be many months off, and most analysts, including Ms. Kadmon, doubt that Mr. Netanyahu, a political survivor who has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, will be going anywhere soon.Under Israeli law, a prime minister does not have to resign even if convicted, said Prof. Barak Medina, an expert in constitutional law at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. If the police recommended filing charges, the state prosecutor and attorney general would still have to agree, after granting the prime minister a hearing. There is no precedent in Israel for a sitting prime minister being charged.Still, if the police were to recommend serious charges, like bribery, against Mr. Netanyahu, it would be \u201chard to survive,\u201d Professor Medina said, because the political and public pressure would grow.In broadcast remarks before the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu spoke of hosting the president of Togo and a coming visit to Africa. His office and his supporters have denounced the investigations as a political witch hunt intended to topple him from power.\u201cAt this stage, by law, every Israeli citizen, and certainly the prime minister, must be presumed completely innocent,\u201d Tzachi Hanegbi, a minister from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party, said on Israeli radio. \u201cSo he is running the state and in parallel, he is managing his legal battle.\u201dMichael Ganor, the Israeli agent for the German shipping company, has also signed a state\u2019s witness deal with Israeli investigators. His lawyer, David Shimron, who is also Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s personal lawyer and second cousin, recently spent several days under house arrest.Adding to the Netanyahu family troubles, the police questioned Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s wife, Sara, this past week for a fourth time as part of an investigation into accusations that public funds were misused at the Netanyahus\u2019 residences.And rather than keep a low profile, the couple\u2019s older son, Yair Netanyahu, has been drawing public fire for crude behavior and getting into a social media spat with one of Mr. Olmert\u2019s sons.Critics of the Netanyahus have long portrayed Yair, 25, as a spoiled heir apparent who still lives with his parents in the official residence and lives lavishly at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. When he was out walking with Kaya, the family dog, late last month, a woman from the neighborhood asked him to pick up his dog\u2019s waste.

Systems to Behave Themselves", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting inside OpenAI\u2019s San Francisco offices on a recent afternoon, the researcher Dario Amodei showed off an autonomous system that taught itself to play Coast Runners, an old boat-racing video game. The winner is the boat with the most points that also crosses the finish line.The result was surprising: The boat was far too interested in the little green widgets that popped up on the screen. Catching these widgets meant scoring points. Rather than trying to finish the race, the boat went point-crazy. It drove in endless circles, colliding with other vessels, skidding into stone walls and repeatedly catching fire.That\u2019s a concern as these techniques move into online services, security devices and robotics. Now, a small community of A.I. researchers, including Mr. Amodei, is beginning to explore mathematical techniques that aim to keep the worst from happening.At OpenAI, Mr. Amodei and his colleague Paul Christiano are developing algorithms that can not only learn tasks through hours of trial and error, but also receive regular guidance from human teachers along the way.With a few clicks here and there, the researchers now have a way of showing the autonomous system that it needs to win points in Coast Runners while also moving toward the finish line. They believe that these kinds of algorithms \u2014 a blend of human and machine instruction \u2014 can help keep automated systems safe.For years, Mr. Musk, along with other pundits, philosophers and technologists, have warned that machines could spin outside our control and somehow learn malicious behavior their designers didn\u2019t anticipate. At times, these warnings have seemed overblown, given that today\u2019s autonomous car systems can even get tripped up by the most basic tasks, like recognizing a bike lane or a red light.But researchers like Mr. Amodei are trying to get ahead of the risks. In some ways, what these scientists are doing is a bit like a parent teaching a child right from wrong.Many specialists in the A.I. field believe a technique called reinforcement learning \u2014 a way for machines to learn specific tasks through extreme trial and error \u2014 could be a primary path to artificial intelligence. Researchers specify a particular reward the machine should strive for, and as it navigates a task at random, the machine keeps close track of what brings the reward and what doesn\u2019t. When OpenAI trained its bot to play Coast Runners, the reward was more points.This video game training has real-world implications.If a machine can learn to navigate a racing game like Grand Theft Auto, researchers believe, it can learn to drive a real car. If it can learn to use a web browser and other common software apps, it can learn to understand natural language and maybe even carry on a conversation. At places like Google and the University of California, Berkeley, robots have already used the technique to learn simple tasks like picking things up or opening a door.All this is why Mr. Amodei and Mr. Christiano are working to build reinforcement learning algorithms that accept human guidance along the way. This can ensure systems don\u2019t stray from the task at hand.The field is small, but it is growing. As OpenAI and DeepMind build teams dedicated to A.I. safety, so too is Google\u2019s stateside lab, Google Brain. Meanwhile, researchers at universities like the U.C. Berkeley and Stanford University are working on similar problems, often in collaboration with the big corporate labs.In some cases, researchers are working to ensure that systems don\u2019t make mistakes on their own, as the Coast Runners boat did. They\u2019re also working to ensure that hackers and other bad actors can\u2019t exploit hidden holes in these systems. Researchers like Google\u2019s Ian Goodfellow, for example, are exploring ways that hackers could fool A.I. systems into seeing things that aren\u2019t there.That becomes problematic when neural networks are used in security cameras. Simply by making a few marks on your face, the researchers said, you could fool a camera into believing you\u2019re someone else.\u201cIf you train an object-recognition system on a million images labeled by humans, you can still create new images where a human and the machine disagree 100 percent of the time,\u201d Mr. Goodfellow said. \u201cWe need to understand that phenomenon.\u201dAnother big worry is that A.I. systems will learn to prevent humans from turning them off. If the machine is designed to chase a reward, the thinking goes, it may find that it can chase that reward only if it stays on. This oft-described threat is much further off, but researchers are already working to address it.Mr. Hadfield-Menell and others at U.C. Berkeley recently published a paper that takes a mathematical approach to the problem. A machine will seek to preserve its off switch, they showed, if it is specifically designed to be uncertain about its reward function. This gives it an incentive to accept or even seek out human oversight.Much of this work is still theoretical. But given the rapid progress of A.I. techniques and their growing importance across so many industries, researchers believe that starting early is the best policy.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around exactly how rapid progress in A.I. is going to be,\u201d said Shane Legg, who oversees the A.I. safety work at DeepMind. \u201cThe responsible approach is to try to understand different ways in which these technologies can be misused, different ways they can fail and different ways of dealing with these issues.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article identified the three people in the picture in the wrong order. They are Dario Amodei, standing, and from left, Paul Christiano and Geoffrey Irving.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gunmen Kill 18 at Restaurant in Burkina Faso", "Date": "2017-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAKAR, Senegal \u2014 At least 18 people were killed in Burkina Faso when gunmen stormed a popular cafe and sprayed diners with bullets, including a family celebrating a 9-year-old\u2019s birthday, the authorities said Monday.Officials said the gunmen in Sunday\u2019s attack arrived at the Aziz Istanbul cafe by motorcycle around 9 p.m., and first opened fire on patrons in an outdoor area before moving inside.Capt. Guy Herv\u00e9 Y\u00e9, a military spokesman, said that at least two assailants had been killed.Hyacinthe Sanou, a journalist in Ouagadougou who visited the scene shortly after the attack, said a family had been in the restaurant celebrating the birthday of their 9-year-old son. The boy was struck by a bullet and has been hospitalized.The restaurant, on a busy commercial strip not far from the airport, is popular with both locals and foreigners. Seven of the victims were from Burkina Faso, with others from Nigeria, Senegal, Kuwait, Lebanon, Turkey, Canada and France. Three were yet to be identified.President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 released a statement on Monday condemning the attack and offering condolences to the victims.\u201cThe fight against terrorism is a long-term struggle. That is why I appeal to the vigilance, solidarity and unity of the whole nation to face the cowardice of our adversaries,\u201d Mr. Kabor\u00e9 said. \u201cBurkina Faso will recover from this ordeal because its valiant people will oppose uncompromising resistance to terrorism and to all enemies of democracy and the progress of our homeland.\u201dHis sentiments were repeated by other leaders in the region, as well as by the president of France, who all issued statements denouncing terrorism and supporting Burkina Faso.The cafe is less than two blocks from the Cappuccino Cafe and the Splendid Hotel, the sites of the January 2016 attack, which left more than 25 people dead and dozens more injured. Groups affiliated with Al Qaeda were blamed for the assault.Burkina Faso is a target of terrorism because it contributes more troops than any other West African nation to the peacekeeping mission in Mali, according to Sean Smith, senior Africa analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, a global risk consultancy firm.\u201cAttacking soft targets is an easy route to instill fear into millions of people,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cTargeting civilians in more cosmopolitan locations generates far more media coverage than attacking U.N. peacekeepers.\u201dAziz Istanbul serves Turkish dishes, pizza, ice cream and drinks adorned with lemon wedges, maraschino cherries and umbrellas. It\u2019s known for elaborate cakes: Soccer-ball-shaped cakes, sneaker-shaped cakes, and cakes decorated with \u201cCongratulations Miss Burkina 2017\u201d are featured on its Facebook page. The page also shows photographs of teenagers celebrating high school graduation, and men at a bachelor party.Many of the businesses along the strip that includes Aziz Istanbul had increased security after the attack last year.

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s in a Name? For Taiwan, Preparing for the Spotlight, a Lot", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySomething similar has confronted Taiwan, the self-ruled island that is officially known as the Republic of China, but that has long been compelled to compete in international sporting events as \u201cChinese Taipei.\u201d In recent days, however, it has pushed back against an attempt to apply that label to its actual territory.The I.O.C. had suggested that the Republic of China could compete as Taiwan. But that was unacceptable to the Kuomintang, which, in the wake of its retreat to the island after its defeat by the Communists in 1949, insisted on retaining a connection to China in whatever name was used. These days, however, any change to the Chinese Taipei name in sports events is opposed by Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its territory and rejects any gesture that might suggest formal independence from China.Some statements in the English-language guide met with particular ridicule, such as \u201cChinese Taipei is a special island and its capital Taipei is a great place to experience Taipei\u2019s culture\u201d and \u201cChinese Taipei is long and narrow that lies north to south.\u201dFISU, when asked why it had inserted \u201cChinese Taipei\u201d to refer to the island in the media guide, said Wednesday in an emailed statement that it was trying to \u201cachieve a coherent and easily understandable application of the rules established when the Chinese Taipei University Sports Federation was admitted to FISU in 1987, together with those of the I.O.C.\u2019s Nagoya resolution\u201d of 1981 that brought Taiwan into the Olympic fold.\u201cAs a member of the Olympic Movement, FISU is generally bound by the resolution to refer to Taiwan as Chinese Taipei,\u201d FISU said.

Individual athletes will compete.A Taiwan newspaper, United Daily News, quoted Mayor Ko of Taipei as saying that China\u2019s stated reason not to send teams was a scheduling conflict with its own National Games, which run Aug. 27 through Sept. 8 in the northeastern city of Tianjin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his. I proposed that I escort him in the game. Soon after that, we had the contract signed.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong. Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.

While not all of those were alumni \u2014 some were journalists reporting on the protest \u2014 Georgia Hamann, one of the organizers, said a conservative estimate was 50 people so far planning to send their diplomas back.\u201cIt felt like a shocking yet appropriate response to shocking and inappropriate comments,\u201d said Ms. Hamann, 31, who graduated from Liberty in 2006 and is a lawyer in Phoenix.\u201cAs alums, we have the power to say something,\u201d the Facebook group\u2019s description says, urging alumni to mail their diplomas to Mr. Falwell\u2019s office on Sept. 5, along with explanatory letters. \u201cOur voices carry weight for the school, for its donors, for its board, staff and students. Our public demonstration of revoking all ties, all support present and future, and urging the Board of Trustees to remove Falwell from the administration of L.U. will send a message to the school that could jeopardize future enrollment, finances and funding.\u201dChris Gaumer, 34, another 2006 graduate, called the decision to participate \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d\u201cThe president of the United States was defending Nazis and white supremacists,\u201d said Mr. Gaumer, the assistant director of the M.F.A. program at Randolph College in Lynchburg, Va., eight miles from Liberty. \u201cIt felt like Jerry Falwell Jr. was making the university somewhat complicit in that.\u201dIn a statement on Monday, Liberty University said it \u201cstrongly supports our students\u2019 right to express their own political opinions, including any opposition they have to their school leader\u2019s relationship with this president of the U.S., just as other students may have opposed leadership of liberal institutions supporting previous presidents.\u201d\u201cThe tactic of returning diplomas has been used by students of many other schools to draw attention to various causes,\u201d the statement added, \u201cbut let\u2019s also remember that those same diplomas are quite helpful in helping these graduates secure well-paying jobs.\u201dHe went on to laud Mr. Trump for not being \u201cpolitically correct\u201d or \u201crehearsing and focus grouping every statement he makes.\u201d\u201cThe Fake News should listen to what he had to say,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.Alumni interviewed Sunday evening said they were not swayed.\u201cI was disheartened by his comments on ABC,\u201d Ms. Hamann said of Mr. Falwell. \u201cInstead of paying more than lip service to the idea of the severity of this misstep, he kind of said, \u2018Yes, yes, of course we condemn racism, but what I like about Trump is that he\u2019s not politically correct.\u2019 You\u2019re still missing the point. It shouldn\u2019t be \u2018politically correct\u2019 to extend kindness to the hurting, condemnation to the wrongdoers. That shouldn\u2019t be negotiable.\u201dMembers of the Facebook group worked together to write an open letter to Mr. Falwell. They encouraged fellow alumni to sign, or to write their own letters if they preferred.Laura Honnol, a banking officer who graduated in 2013, drafted her own letter, which she shared with The New York Times. In it, she wrote that she had \u201cgrieved privately\u201d at some of Mr. Falwell\u2019s previous actions, including his endorsement of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign.But after Charlottesville, Ms. Honnol, 32, wrote, \u201cI can no longer grieve privately when you repeatedly and uncritically escalate your commitment to adulation of our sitting president as a hero to the faith and to the cause of Christ \u2014 a man who refuses to unequivocally call out the blatant, blasphemous sin of racism in the face of clear and incontrovertible evidence of white supremacist, neo-Nazi incitement.\u201dShe concluded: \u201cI no longer wish to be associated with an institution which uses the name of Jesus Christ to support a political agenda, and knowingly or inadvertently promulgates oppression. My integrity will not allow me to align myself with anything that distorts the Gospel in this manner.\u201dPhillip Wagner, who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Liberty in 2010 and a master\u2019s in 2012 and now works at the University of South Florida, said Mr. Falwell had put alumni in the painful position of having to defend or disavow the source of their academic credentials.Having made his career in academia, Mr. Wagner, 27, said he would not return his diplomas. But he planned to write to Mr. Falwell to voice his opposition to racism, and to what he described as the inappropriate politicization of an educational institution.\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of my L.U. credentials,\u201d Mr. Wagner said, but added that he and other alumni \u201cdidn\u2019t sign up for this political affiliation that comes with our degrees now.\u201dIn the Facebook group and in interviews, others said bluntly that they were embarrassed to identify themselves as Liberty alumni. Amber Smith, a 2008 graduate, said she often identified her alma mater as Seattle Pacific University, where she earned her master\u2019s degree.The university \u201cwas always identified with certain things,\u201d said Ms. Smith, 31, a marriage and family therapist in Seattle. \u201cBut I feel like the negative parts of those things have been really enforced in the past few years, and I don\u2019t want to be associated with that.\u201dThe diploma protest, she said, is an opportunity to encourage Mr. Falwell to act in a way that will allow her and other alumni to be proud of their alma mater again.Advertisement"}

In Kansas, they\u2019re more likely to visit Germany. And for Virginians? Bolivia is the top destination.These are the findings in new data from Facebook, which has tracked where users \u201ccheck in\u201d when they\u2019re traveling abroad during the summer since 2012.The results don\u2019t necessarily reflect the most popular destinations outside the United States \u2014 those are overwhelmingly Mexico and Canada \u2014 but instead show which locations are unusually popular with people in a given state, compared with where most Americans travel during the summer.For many states, the most distinct travel spots are simply whatever is nearby, namely Canada and Mexico. But for others, it\u2019s tied to immigrant populations in the state. Tonga might seem like an unusual choice for Utahns, but there are more Tongans living there than in any other state, which helps explain why the tiny Polynesian island ranks so high.Viewed together, the distinct destinations reveal the hidden patchwork of global travel that can be found only in a country as big and diverse as the United States.Below, select your state to see the top-five list and more details about travel habits during summer months.Among all destinations on the list, none were more surprising than Tonga, a tiny Polynesian island in the South Pacific with a population of just 107,122.Germany held the top spot in Colorado and Kansas, where about a quarter of all residents have German ancestry. There is a large German-American population in the Midwest, especially upper Midwest states like North Dakota.Despite Britain\u2019s being the third-most-popular destination for Americans traveling abroad, it snagged the top spot in just one state: West Virginia. Since there isn\u2019t a particularly large share of British immigrants in West Virginia, tourism is a more likely reason for the high ranking.Bosnians make up the largest Eastern European group in Missouri. The Bosnian population is so prominent that St. Louis has a neighborhood called Little Bosnia. Immigration from Bosnia swelled during the early 1990s as refugees fled the war there.Panama is an unusually popular summer destination for Americans living in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee. There is a relatively small number of Panamanians living in the United States \u2014 just 105,000 in 2015 \u2014 so tourism is the more likely draw.Brazil held the top spot for Massachusetts, fitting the demographic profile of the region. More than 60,000 Brazilians lived there in 2015, a larger number than in any other Central or South American country. About 47,000 Brazilians lived in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan area in 2013, according to the United States Census Bureau.Travel in the summer months can best be explained by migrants visiting family and friends back home. About half of all Dominicans in the United States lived in New York state in 2015, with almost all of them residing in New York City.There were about 84,000 Somalis living in the United States in 2015, and about 30 percent of them live in Minnesota. Ryan Allen, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied the Somali population in the state, said immigrants have continued to travel home despite an ongoing civil war.\u201cThey saw an opportunity \u2014 once they\u2019d become established in the United States and specifically in Minnesota \u2014 to go back, not only to reconnect with family and friends, but also to try and help the country,\u201d he said.Mexico was the most distinct destination for many states, especially those along the southern border. The cause can be traced to larger Hispanic populations there. New Mexico, California, Texas and Arizona had the highest share of Hispanic populations in 2015. The one outlier, at least in terms of population, was Oklahoma. It had a Hispanic population of just 10.1 percent in 2015.Source: FacebookAn earlier version of this article misidentified which state had Bolivia as its top disproportionately popular destination. It is Virginia, as indicated in the map and table accompanying the article, not North Carolina. In addition, the article misstated the surname of a professor at the University of Minnesota. He is Ryan Allen, not Ryan Lee.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Stay, Hide or Leave? Hard Choices for Immigrants in the Heartland", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "Edith Rivera loved her life in Hampton, Iowa, but for many undocumented immigrants like her, this summer has been a season of fear or flight.Supported byHAMPTON, Iowa \u2014 It was quitting time. Edith Rivera took one last lunch order, dropped off a basket of tortilla chips and set off from work, heading out to the farm roads where other immigrants feared to drive.Like them, Ms. Rivera, 33, had no legal status in the country where she had lived for 18 years. She had no driver\u2019s license, apart from the long-expired North Carolina identification she held safe, like a talisman, in her wallet.But as she skimmed past the northern Iowa cornfields on her way to her son Steven\u2019s seventh-grade track meet, she did not share other immigrants\u2019 fears. Not of being pulled over. Not of raids or deportation. Not of the man in the White House. Not of the new Franklin County sheriff\u2019s quest to make sure this rapidly diversifying community of hog barns and egg farms would never again be known as an immigrant sanctuary.Her American journey was waning, and she had little left to lose.Her husband, Jes\u00fas Canseco-Rodriguez, was already gone \u2014 deported to Mexico in 2015. Ms. Rivera had jettisoned their apartment and sold off what the family had built here in Hampton: their small business power-washing hog barns, Mr. Canseco\u2019s work truck, their furniture.Now, at this tense juncture for immigrants and their adoptive hometowns across the conservative swaths of rural America, Ms. Rivera planned to sever one last tie. She was returning to Mexico \u2014 and to her husband \u2014 with Steven, 13 years old and American-born.Some politicians call it \u201cself-deportation.\u201d She called it her family\u2019s only hope of being together.The heartland is freckled with Hamptons and Ediths. In small agricultural towns that supported President Trump by 20-point margins, residents are now seeing an immigration crackdown ripple through the families that have helped revive their downtown squares and transform their economies.In Hampton, Latinos make up 51 percent of the elementary-school rosters and sit in the next pews over at the bilingual Easter Mass.Like Ms. Rivera, many are weighing whether to stay, hide or leave altogether.As she angled her gray Camry north, farms and silos whipping by under a sunny spring sky, Ms. Rivera scrolled through memories and fears as if they were pictures on her phone. The apartment by the golf course where she used to chase Steven through the grass. The curling prairie trails where they walked after school. The quiet blacktops where she went jogging.\u201cI love the days like today,\u201d she said.And when their departure date finally arrived, could she bring herself to get on that Delta flight and leave?The most indelible American stories are often road trips of one kind or another, whether they end at Plymouth Rock or in Hampton, Iowa. Ms. Rivera\u2019s first journey whisked her away from her poor home in southern Mexico when she was 14, across the Arizona border illegally, to join relatives looking for jobs in North Carolina. Another road trip brought her to Iowa with her husband and child, then a toddler.In the decade the family spent in Hampton, they drove to Minneapolis, where her husband played first base in the Liga Latina de B\u00e9isbol, and where young Steven began, as one friend said, to \u201cbreathe baseball.\u201d They drove to horse races and to a water park in Des Moines.After Mr. Canseco\u2019s arrest in 2015 on charges of illegally re-entering the country, there were trips to jail and to a federal courthouse.Now, one final road trip waited: The drive from Hampton to a 5:45 a.m. flight out of Des Moines. The itinerary: Atlanta to Mexico City to Veracruz, and the start of an uncertain new life.\u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to provide everything,\u201d Ms. Rivera said. \u201cIt\u2019s no work, no opportunities there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid at how she\u2019s going to face all this,\u201d Mr. Canseco said in a telephone interview from Mexico. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how different it is.\u201dSome nights, as Steven fell asleep in the bedroom he and his mother shared, Ms. Rivera called her husband to talk about the home he was building for them on her family\u2019s ranch in the village of Joach\u00edn, and the world of cows, sheep, lime trees and poverty that waited.Hampton, population 4,400, rises from the rolling fields of northern Iowa, a courthouse clock tower and grain elevator forming its simple skyline.It is a place where neighbors catch up at the Fareway market\u2019s butcher counter; where the economy revolves around corn, hog confinements and egg farms, and where Latino immigrants do more and more of the work as the white population dies off or moves away.The town tumbled into the nation\u2019s immigration debate early this year when the newly elected county sheriff, Linn Larson, told the community he was ending policies that had added this tiny county to national lists of immigrant safe havens. Sheriff Larson said he would share arrest information with immigration officials and cooperate with them when asked.\u201cThe only sanctuary I plan on offering is to the law-abiding people that want a safe place to raise their families and work,\u201d he promised.The county commissioners backed up the sheriff, and many residents said they liked his stance.At the Hardee\u2019s along Highway 3, where tables of machinists, farmers and retirees sip 99-cent coffees each morning and hash out the day\u2019s news, many said they supported a harder line on immigration.There was talk of signs in Mexico directing immigrants to Hampton. Some complained about Hampton\u2019s being lumped in with liberal sanctuary cities like Seattle and New York.If the sheriff reported undocumented immigrants who landed in his custody to the federal authorities, \u201cIt could make our county safer,\u201d said Fran Foland, 69.Others said they got along fine with their immigrant neighbors. They ate at the Mexican restaurant, La Amiguita, where Ms. Rivera worked, and admired immigrants who cleaned out reeking livestock pens for $10 to $15 an hour.But why, they asked, couldn\u2019t the immigrants learn English and come here legally, like their own German and Norwegian ancestors?For many immigrants in town, it was a season of fear. Some papered over windows and front-door peepholes. Parents who dreaded being detained drew up contingency plans for what should be done with their children and cars.Hundreds filled the high school gym to press the sheriff about his new approach. What would happen if they were pulled over? Would his deputies conduct immigration raids? Sheriff Larson tried to reassure people that his officers would not target immigrants.Conversation by conversation, longtime Hampton residents struggled to reconcile their support for the president with the values they cherished: compassion, kindness and charity for their neighbors and friends.Or in Steve Pearson\u2019s case, for his namesake.Mr. Pearson, 63, moved to Hampton 30 years ago because it was the biggest town in Iowa without a certified public accountant.When he and a partner bought a building for their accounting firm, they rented rooms upstairs to Mexican families. Mr. Pearson called them \u201cthe amigos\u201d and started carrying a Spanish-English dictionary. He helped them get loans and wire money home.\u201cThe fact that we were renting to illegals, that bothered some people,\u201d Mr. Pearson said. \u201cMy thought was, why not tell the politicians to change it? It\u2019s in Exodus: Be kind to foreigners because you were foreigners once in the land of Egypt.\u201dOne of the amigos stood out. He was a teenager from Veracruz who had arrived with his father and younger brother. His name was Jes\u00fas.Jes\u00fas grew up, spent several years working in North Carolina, and returned to Hampton with a woman named Edith who had been attracted to his athleticism, work ethic and quiet humility. They had a son: Steven.Steven, named for the mustachioed landlord who had treated the Canseco family so kindly.Now living 2,000 miles away, Mr. Canseco still says that \u201cthe greatest man I know in the U.S.A.\u201d is Mr. Pearson.But times have changed.And last year, Mr. Pearson, a conservative Republican, yearned for a change in the White House, despite his misgivings about the candidate promising it.\u201cSo why not vote for Trump?\u201dSix months into Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, Mr. Pearson said he still thought the country\u2019s immigration system was broken. He was angered by the fate of the Canseco-Rivera family, though he noted that Mr. Canseco had been deported on President Barack Obama\u2019s watch, not Mr. Trump\u2019s.Give people like them work permits, Mr. Pearson said. Give them residency. \u201cI\u2019m angered by the stupidity of it all,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s 10 million people \u2014 \u2018Let\u2019s grab this one.\u2019 It\u2019s very sad.\u201dLives are braided together in Hampton. After Mr. Canseco was arrested, the city\u2019s police captain, a retired school principal and Mr. Pearson all wrote to the court on his behalf.Another letter came from Megan Pearson Rosenberg, 37, Mr. Pearson\u2019s daughter \u2014 who is also one of Ms. Rivera\u2019s closest friends.The two women met through their children when Steven Canseco was not yet school age.Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s son, Mickey, now 14, is a few months older than Steven, and her daughter, Lily, 9, shares Steven\u2019s athletic, adventurous side. When they played, Lily and Steven would scramble and climb around the yard while Mickey sat in a tree reading.For the grown-ups, the friendship was an easy fit. Ms. Rosenberg, a lawyer, did legal work for Mr. Canseco\u2019s business. She accompanied Ms. Rivera to court to deal with a traffic ticket.Ms. Rivera went with her husband and son to Ms. Rosenberg\u2019s home for Thanksgiving, where Steven announced that he had never eaten turkey.The Rosenbergs, in turn, experienced Mexican Christmases with their friends, eating until they could barely move. Ms. Rivera introduced them to her homemade green chile and cast a skeptical eye on the Rosenbergs\u2019 version of Mexican cooking \u2014 Old El Paso tacos.Steven showed up unannounced in the Rosenbergs\u2019 backyard to play on the swing set. He and Mickey made pizza and watched baseball movies together. And Steven revealed a sly sense of humor.He once told the Rosenbergs they were his white family. Another time, Ms. Rosenberg asked him if he followed politics. No, Megan, he deadpanned: I follow my dreams.On July 22, 2015, Ms. Rosenberg got an urgent Facebook message from Ms. Rivera: Call me.That morning, Mr. Canseco had been arrested by immigration agents at a gas station on Hampton\u2019s west side as he, his father and an employee were heading to wash out a hog barn.It was not Mr. Canseco\u2019s first encounter with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He had been deported in 2005 after being caught using a false Social Security number to obtain work, but returned to his family a week later after another illegal border crossing.That morning in 2015, Mr. Canseco said, the immigration agents told him, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take you.\u201dMs. Rivera feared visiting her husband in jail because of her own immigration status.Steven did visit his father, and felt proud for not crying in front of him.That September, Mr. Canseco pleaded guilty to one count of illegally re-entering the United States. He was back in Mexico when Ms. Rivera and Steven went to the Rosenbergs\u2019 house for Thanksgiving dinner.As he reconciled himself to staying in Mexico, Mr. Canseco had to recast his sense of national identity. He said he used to feel a surge of belonging when he heard \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d before baseball games. \u201cI felt myself as an American,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in a dream. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not.\u201dUnited States law also viewed Mr. Canseco differently now: He wasn\u2019t just an immigrant in the country illegally. He was a repeat offender.He tried to return to Iowa even after his second deportation. He said he swam across the Rio Grande with a small group but turned back when immigration agents surrounded them. He then tried to cross the Arizona desert, where according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he was caught this April and immediately sent back to Mexico on an \u201cexpedited removal.\u201dTo the family, it was becoming clear Mr. Canseco would never be able to rejoin them. So Ms. Rivera made up her mind to join him in Mexico. She decided to leave on July 21, a day before the second anniversary of his arrest.Iowa\u2019s spring ripened to summer. Corn shot up. Volunteers repainted the 19th-century storefronts of Hampton\u2019s recreated prairie downtown to ready them for the county fair. Ms. Rivera\u2019s last American days were slipping by.As she waited for Steven\u2019s relay race at a track meet, Ms. Rivera agonized over money and time. She wanted to save up while she could, so she worked lunch shifts at La Amiguita, where she averaged $40 in tips, then drove 90 miles to Des Moines to work weekends at another restaurant.But she felt torn. She wanted to spend more time with her friends in Hampton. And she found herself indulging her son with expensive sunglasses, sneakers and a baseball bat.She just wanted things to feel normal.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m doing right,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to be strong all the time and be positive. It\u2019s so hard.\u201dAnother warm evening, and the families were together at the Rosenbergs\u2019 house, talking about the future of their friendship. Ms. Rivera, an artist with an eyeliner pencil, spends hours practicing her makeup skills. She wondered if she could find the same makeup in Mexico.\u201cCan you still send me my Chanel?\u201d Ms. Rivera asked.\u201cYou\u2019re overestimating my abilities,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said.The Rosenbergs have talked about visiting Veracruz one day, but are wary of the security conditions. The families have talked about whether Steven might come back to Iowa for high school, and maybe live with the Rosenbergs. Ms. Rivera hoped she could get a tourist visa and return from time to time.It was getting late. Time to put the kids to bed. The women hugged.\u201cBye, amiga,\u201d Ms. Rivera said as she headed out the door.\u201cBye, amiga,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said. \u201cLove you.\u201dAnother day closer to their departure, Steven cracked open the back of a white trailer. It held the last artifacts of their American lives. A microwave oven, boxes of clothes, golf clubs, Mr. Canseco\u2019s tools, an artificial Christmas tree. \u201cMy dad wanted to have Christmas in Mexico,\u201d Steven said.After his father\u2019s arrest, Steven cried nearly every night for months. But as his reunion with Mr. Canseco got closer, friends said Steven seemed excited. He savored his time with friends, confident that he would be able to return to the United States. It was like the lesson his father taught him about being lost.\u201cWhenever I\u2019m in the woods, I try to break a stick and leave it hanging and make it really obvious,\u201d he said one morning. \u201cSo if I were to get lost, I know I\u2019ve been there already.

Abuse Follows.", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 When a Pakistani lawmaker said this past week that she had received \u201cinappropriate text messages\u201d from a male colleague, she was met with a wave of vitriol on social media.On Tuesday, the lawmaker, Ayesha Gulalai Wazir, from Pakistan\u2019s tribal South Waziristan region, accused Mr. Khan of sending her \u201cobjectionable\u201d text messages, and said women were not respected in his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The party denied that Mr. Khan had sent any such text messages to Ms. Wazir.In a country where 33 million people use Facebook and at least five million are on Twitter, social media has become a frequent platform for obscene and virulent outbursts. In some cases, online abuse has incited physical violence.\u201cInstead of responding to my accusations or proving that I am wrong, people are saying throw acid on me?\u201d Ms. Wazir said in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they have fallen to this level, but it is just part of a larger culture encouraged by the society and political parties here.\u201dMs. Wazir said she was afraid to publicly share the objectionable text messages out of fear of further antagonizing Mr. Khan\u2019s followers. But she said she was prepared to present the messages to a judge or an investigating authority on the condition that they remain confidential.Maria Waqar, an Indiana University graduate student who has interviewed dozens of female lawmakers in Pakistan for her research on the legislature, said the abuse directed at Ms. Wazir was not surprising. She said that \u201cthe web is littered with websites, videos and message boards dedicated to objectifying and degrading women parliamentarians in particular and women in general.\u201dMany women reported threats of physical violence and vandalism, blackmail, sexual remarks and false accusations meant to humiliate, threaten or discredit them. Seventy percent of the women surveyed said they were afraid to post their pictures on social media websites.In July, a man was sentenced to 12 years in jail for blackmailing a woman in the northern city of Peshawar. And in two cases still to be decided, a university professor in the port city of Karachi was arrested on charges of setting up fake Facebook pages and publishing doctored pictures of a female colleague, and two boys were arrested in 2015 on charges of using a fake Facebook profile to harass and blackmail up to 50 girls in Peshawar.Nighat Dad, the executive director of the Digital Rights Foundation, a Pakistani internet advocacy group, said, \u201cThere is a culture of violence against women that already exists in the home, the workplace, in public places, and now it is increasingly manifesting itself in online spaces as well.\u201dIn another case, Saman, a 19-year-old university student from Lahore who asked to be identified by only her first name to protect her safety, said her sister\u2019s husband had propositioned her for years before spraying her with acid, disfiguring her, in January 2016.When she filed a case against her attacker, he threatened to post what she says are doctored nude pictures of her online. Last month, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison, but Saman said the harassment persisted.\u201cEven from behind bars, the threats continue,\u201d Saman, who has seen the photos, said in a telephone interview. She said she had told the authorities about the images, \u201cbut they say they can\u2019t do anything until the pictures are actually published.\u201dMarvi Sirmed, a Pakistani journalist, said people on social media had called for her to be publicly raped and killed over her views on the rights of women and minorities.\u201cWomen who are opinionated, who are professionals doing jobs traditionally done by men, who are entering politics and media, of course they are going to be in the line of fire on the internet,\u201d Ms. Sirmed said. \u201cAnd when they fight back, the abuse just gets worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Week Without Trumps \u2026", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo much outcry about chaos at the White House. Who\u2019s in? Who\u2019s out? Yet we\u2019ve failed to consider one important question.What happens to the Weeks?They\u2019ve been such an administration highlight. Who can forget White House Infrastructure Week? Or Energy Week? Or the current American Dream Week, which the president celebrated by calling for a 50 percent cut in legal immigration?Reince Priebus was said to have been a big Week maven, and he\u2019s been, um, disappeared. Which is why I\u2019m sort of worried about the end of a great new national tradition.We still haven\u2019t heard what the next Week is supposed to be. Do you think John Kelly got rid of them? That man cannot stop cleaning house.All modern presidents have promoted themes they want us to think about, but the current administration has been a pioneer in packaging things into Weeks and then staging lots of events to remind us about their topic. President Trump also generally proposes a bill on the same subject, which Congress promptly rejects.This happened even during Infrastructure Week \u2014 who among us doesn\u2019t like infrastructure? But Trump hasn\u2019t been able to get his act together on a package of projects, so he started the week off with a call for privatizing the air traffic control system, which the Senate commerce committee cheerfully vetoed.Also, to be fair, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders read a letter from a 10-year-old boy from Virginia who wants to mow the White House lawn. And that\u2019s going to happen. \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to keep the American dream alive for kids like Frank,\u201d she told the media.Because this administration has been so danged exciting, it\u2019s easy to merge the Weeks with unrelated presidential events of the moment. So we\u2019ll also remember Infrastructure Week as the one when the fired F.B.I. director testified before Congress. And that during American Dream Week, a golfing story revealed that Trump had called the White House \u201ca real dump.\u201dBut even when the White House is in control of the timing, the Weeks tend to go awry.Obviously, the idea of having the president give a speech to the Boy Scouts during Heroes Week was planned. But it\u2019s a good bet the planners didn\u2019t expect him to brag to the kids about winning the election, snipe at his political opponents and tell a really long story about a friend who sold his business and bought a big yacht.Scout leaders were somewhat unnerved by the performance, but Trump, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said \u201cthe head of the Boy Scouts\u201d had called him to say \u201cit was the greatest speech that was ever made to them.\u201d The head of the Boy Scouts immediately denied that. Sanders told a press briefing that the president was talking about someone else.So that was American Heroes Week. Plus the speech to law enforcement officials in which Trump appeared to advocate police brutality. Which Sanders told a press briefing was just a joke.\u201cThe president went out of his way this week to give a special honor to some very special people,\u201d said Lara Trump, the host of a brand-new news program on the president\u2019s Facebook site, as she recounted some of the White House events. She is the wife of Eric Trump, otherwise known as the adult son not currently under investigation for talking with Russians.Until now we have known Lara as an animal rights activist. Perhaps she could get us a White House Be Kind to Animals Week, in which her father-in-law would have to appear in public with a dog or a cat. This is the first president since James K. Polk who does not have a pet. All this could change in a wink of a Week.There are all kinds of ways we could turn the Weeks around to the national interest. For instance, the State Department appears to be struggling to get the normal day-to-day business done for lack of staff. Perhaps we could have a Who Wants to Be Ambassador to Norway Week. The press secretary could read letters from 10-year-old volunteers, and on Friday the president could draw a name from a hat.One of my favorite Weeks was Energy Week, when Trump and Rick Perry went around vowing to make the nation \u201cenergy dominant,\u201d a concept so much more manly than energy independent. But still educational. \u201cHere\u2019s a little economics lesson: supply and demand,\u201d Perry said during a coal mining promotion. \u201cYou put the supply out there and the demand will follow.\u201dAnd then, of course, there was Made in America Week, which Trump observed by requesting visas to hire foreign workers for Mar-a-Lago.And Workforce Development Week, when Trump and daughter Ivanka met with C.E.O.s to discuss worker training. And Tech Week, when Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with top executives of technology companies.\u201cI bet you haven\u2019t heard about all the accomplishments the president had this week because there\u2019s so much fake news out there,\u201d Lara Trump told her audience.What about a Take Your Daughters and Sons to Work Week?Nicholas Kristof is off today.Advertisement"}

Isolation Can Make It Unbearable.", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by The New Old AgeFor years, Marcy Sherman-Lewis went to a beauty salon in St. Joseph, Mo., every few weeks for a haircut and highlights.It had become something of an ordeal to prepare her husband, Gene Lewis, for this outing; he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, at 79, and helping him shower and dress, insert hearing aids and climb into the car was a very slow process.But she could no longer leave him at home alone. And once at the salon, \u201che just sat, watched TV, slept \u2014 didn\u2019t bother anybody,\u201d said Ms. Sherman-Lewis, 62. Her stylist kindly trimmed his hair, too.Then last month, the salon owner took Ms. Sherman-Lewis aside. \u201cMarcy, he makes my other patrons awfully uncomfortable,\u201d she said.\u201cI was dumbfounded,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s O.K. for other people\u2019s little grandchildren to be running around sometimes. What am I supposed to do, keep him in a crate in the car?\u201dLike so many caregivers, she has discovered that along with the abandoned career, the hands-on tasks, the medical scheduling, the insurance tussles and the disrupted sleep, she faces another trial: social isolation.\u201cIt\u2019s hurtful,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need friends more than ever.\u201dBut where are they? Betsey Brairton, 48, cares for her mother, Sue, in rural Olean, N.Y. The elder Ms. Brairton, 79, suffers from spinal stenosis, arthritis and lingering damage from a stroke, so she has limited mobility. \u201cWe hardly go anywhere, and nobody comes here,\u201d said her daughter. When she does leave for an hour or two, she\u2019s afraid to put down her cellphone.Though a couple of friends occasionally invite her out for dinner, \u201cI can\u2019t commit to anything, in case my mom is having a bad day,\u201d Ms. Brairton said. She has begun to worry that when she does spend time with others, her narrowing life leaves her with nothing interesting to say.Those who work with caregivers know this phenomenon well, especially when the cared-for person has dementia, a particularly arduous responsibility.\u201cCaregiving is done with a lot of love and affection, but there\u2019s a lot of loss involved,\u201d said Carey Wexler Sherman, a gerontologist at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. \u201cPeople talk about friends disappearing, about even family members not wanting to be involved. It\u2019s a lonely business.\u201dSometimes, caregivers isolate themselves. Barbara Moscowitz, senior geriatric social worker at Massachusetts General Hospital, hears clients lament that with a loved one whose dementia-related behavior can be startling, venturing out in public creates more apprehension than pleasure.\u201cThey say, \u2018I\u2019m exhausted trying to explain to people why she\u2019s doing what she\u2019s doing, why they shouldn\u2019t be angry or afraid,\u2019\u201d Ms. Moscowitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to stay home.\u201dWe\u2019ve long thought of these factors as dangers for the people being cared for. But they also imperil caregivers, who are often older adults as well.Years of caring for his wife, now deceased, who had early onset Alzheimer\u2019s, left Les Sperling, 65, so despondent that \u201cI\u2019d stay in my room in the dark and sleep all day,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come out.\u201dMr. Sperling, of Lake Worth, Fla., went into therapy and took antidepressants until he felt able to function again.We know something about how to help caregivers feel less alone. Researchers have shown that even modest-sounding interventions can reduce their sense of isolation and improve their mental and physical health.\u201cHaving someone outside who is paying attention and who cares is more important,\u201d she said.Caregivers already gather in Facebook groups and on websites, but experts have mixed feelings about online chats and groups. \u201cThey provide anonymity, and that may permit more honesty,\u201d said Dr. Wexler Sherman, the gerontologist. \u201cSometimes you need to vent at 2 a.m.\u201d\u201dBut we need skills,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing a caregiver is a job.\u201d Online, is the information passed along accurate and useful? Is there a trained, knowledgeable moderator?\u201cIt\u2019s important to have a leader to monitor and validate,\u201d said Ms. Moscowitz, who leads several support groups for Mass General employees and for community members. Besides, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing like a real person to hug you.\u201dIndividuals can also play a role. It\u2019s too easy to let caregiving friends slip off our radar with a general call-if-you-need-anything.\u201cDon\u2019t put the pressure on the caregiver to tell you what to do,\u201d Ms. Moscowitz said. She suggests asking what would be helpful, making a list of specific tasks and parceling out assignments.\u201cDon\u2019t invite me for lunch \u2014 you know I can\u2019t go,\u201d Ms. Sherman-Lewis said. \u201cJust bring a pizza and a bottle of wine and come by.\u201dThough tangible help counts \u2014 and let\u2019s acknowledge that an aging country can\u2019t rely solely on families, friends and volunteers to provide everything dependent elders need, however well supported they are \u2014 so do regular texts, calls or visits. They help keep caregivers from feeling invisible and forgotten.Counselors in the NYU program once had the friendly inspiration, since they kept caregivers\u2019 information in their database, to send clients a card on their birthdays.It sounds sweet, if trivial. But often, Dr. Mittelman said, \u201cthey\u2019d call up, so grateful, and say, \u2018You\u2019re the only one who remembered.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Free Alaskan Salmon: Just Bring a Net and Expect a Crowd", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by11 PhotosKENAI, Alaska \u2014 Wenceslous Fru, a physician assistant from Anchorage, stood on the sandy shore of the Kenai River and imagined the dinner he would put together once he felt the jostle of a salmon in his long-handled dip net. He would make it the way they do back home in Cameroon, splitting it down the belly and opening it like a book, rubbing it with ginger, garlic and spices, and then slipping it under the broiler.Fishing nearby, Raviwan Dougherty, an Anchorage restaurant worker from Thailand, envisioned steaming hers and bathing it in fish sauce, lime juice and chiles.Lyubov Miroshnick, who works in a dental office in Wasilla, planned to smoke her catch after a soak in her Ukrainian grandparents\u2019 brine recipe.\u201cMainly, we fish for the winter,\u201d said Ms. Miroshnick, who had a dozen family members with her. \u201cThat\u2019s how most people survive here. It\u2019s the cheaper way.\u201dThere is no more popular fishery in Alaska than the Kenai (KEEN-eye), a three-hour drive southwest of Anchorage, where millions of sockeye salmon ripple through the silty turquoise water each summer to spawn.And there is most likely no more democratic fishing spot in America \u2014 a place where any Alaska resident, from an oil company executive to a carwash attendant, can fill a freezer with premium salmon for only the cost of gas and gear.Most of the Kenai\u2019s fish are caught by commercial boats and sold around the world. The rest go to sport fishermen, who catch them with a rod and reel, and, increasingly, a wildly diverse group of mostly urban dip-netters, who crowd the river\u2019s mouth for three weeks in July, hoping to score a winter\u2019s supply of wild salmon that most can\u2019t afford to buy. In the roughly 20 years since the state started regulating dip-net fishing in the region, the number of permits it issues has doubled, to more than 30,000.Now, when the dip-netters descend, the beach takes on the motley, slightly claustrophobic feel of a music festival. Whole families set up camp in the sand, hauling tents, chairs, dogs, children and nets by four-wheelers from the packed parking lot.This year, a church group brought in a bouncy house and grilled hot dogs. A cart sold espresso. People on the beach spoke Hmong, Korean, Tagalog, Spanish and Thai. They played Christian rock, reggaeton and Pacific Island R&B.July\u2019s dip-net army lifts the economy in the town of Kenai, but it also clogs the highway and litters the beach with fish heads and guts that have to be raked to the water at night by special tractors. Hundreds of gulls cry overhead, diving to feast on entrails. On weekends, when crowding is at its worst, there are dust-ups over fishing territory, tangled gear, pilfered bags of ice and stolen coolers. Differences in culture, language and notions of personal space sometimes fuel the conflicts.\u201cIt used to be 200 people \u2014 now it\u2019s 5,000\u201d on a given day, said Scott Turney, an Anchorage telecommunications engineer who has been fishing on the beach for more than 30 years. \u201cThere never used to be any conflicts, but the newcomers don\u2019t have the same courtesy. As soon as you drag a fish out, one or two people will come take your place.\u201dEven with the crowds, he said, landing a big haul of fish is worth the hassle: \u201cl still love it. I\u2019ll never stop.\u201dTo fish, most people stand elbow to elbow along the shoreline, wearing waders, chest-high in the cold river. Each holds a long steel pole with a five-foot-wide net basket on the end. When a fish hits the net, the fisher drags it onto the beach and bonks it on the head with a short bat. Some people also fish by boat to avoid the crowd, holding their nets overboard as they drift with the current.Occasionally, a commercial boat putters by. There\u2019s always a little tension.Commercial fishermen catch salmon by stretching large nets in the inlet near the mouth of the river. When things are slow, dip-netters grumble that the larger boats take too many fish.The commercial fishermen, on the other hand, must sometimes stop work for a few days at the direction of state biologists who monitor the number of fish in the river for conservation purposes. They don\u2019t love watching the dip-netters filling their coolers.\u201cIt\u2019s always hard to not be catching fish,\u201d said Hannah Heimbuch, who runs a 32-foot aluminum commercial boat, Salmon Slut, in the inlet. \u201cI feel like our harvest is pretty responsible and pretty moderate.\u201dA single dip-netter is allowed to take home 25 sockeye, or red, salmon, and an additional 10 for each family member per season \u2014 limits enforced by state officers who patrol the beach.An estimated 90,000 people, fishers and their families, share about 400,000 sockeye annually, Mr. Gease said, which breaks down to 2.4 million meals, the majority of fish coming from the Kenai. Food-bank workers in Anchorage say salmon has also become a supplemental source of protein for the city\u2019s hungry.\u201cOutside the revenues generated from oil,\u201d Mr. Gease said, \u201cthis is the largest single shared natural resource in Alaska for residents.\u201dOver the years, the town has become better at managing the parking, the trash and the fish waste. The number of dip-netting permits has dropped a bit the past few years, leading to speculation that the fishery has reached its saturation point.She planned to bake her fish with mayonnaise, lemon pepper and green onion, she said. Her Anchorage church, Manai Fou Assembly of God, holds services in Samoan. About 30 church members were catching fish that day to share with the congregation, she said.They used the Samoan word \u201cmafutaga\u201d \u2014 fellowship \u2014 to describe what it feels like to be on the beach with so many people.\u201cSome of our elders cannot fish, so we fish for them,\u201d Ms. Tulimasealii said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about fishing, though. It\u2019s about having fun.\u201dcookingcookingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "India\u2019s Supreme Court Strikes Down \u2018Instant Divorce\u2019 for Muslims", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn India, Muslim men have been able to end their marriages by saying the word \u201ctalaq\u201d \u2014 Arabic for \u201cdivorce\u201d \u2014 three times. They could do this in person, by letter or even over the phone. By contrast, a Muslim woman in India seeking a divorce must generally gain the permission of her husband, a cleric or other Islamic authorities.The method of divorce was available only to men, who in many cases ousted their wives from their homes without alimony or other financial support. The practice is frowned on by many Muslims worldwide, and the case was being closely watched in India.On Tuesday, by a 3-to-2 vote, a Supreme Court panel declared unlawful the provision that had allowed for Muslims\u2019 instant divorce. Of those who voted against, two said the practice was unconstitutional and one said it went against Islamic law.One of the dissenters was a Muslim judge; the other was the court\u2019s chief justice, who urged Parliament to come up with a new provision.The Muslim women who were plaintiffs had argued that the provision violated their fundamental right to equality under the Constitution. And while India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, hailed the court decision as a \u201cpowerful measure for women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d some legal analysts were not so sure, saying the all-male panel had used language that was quite degrading toward women.\u201cThe patronizing tone towards Muslim women in all the opinions is quite breathtaking,\u201d Ratna Kapur, a law professor and author of a forthcoming book on gender and human rights, wrote on Facebook. \u201cWomen are talked about as if they are in need of protection, not in terms of their rights.\u201dShe added, \u201cNearly every reference to the Muslim woman in the majority and dissenting opinions reduces Muslim women to \u2018suffering victims.\u2019 \u201dAlthough India\u2019s Constitution guarantees equal rights to all citizens regardless of their religion, matters dealing with marriage, divorce, alimony and inheritance are handled differently by members of different religions. India does not have a uniform set of laws on marriage and divorce that applies to all citizens.India is predominantly Hindu, but it has a sizable Muslim population. Many Hindus, seeing the practice of ending a marriage by uttering three words as an insult to women, welcomed the decision on Tuesday. Several Muslim groups, however, had been intent on preserving it, suspicious of any government efforts to chip away at what they see as their fundamental religious rights.Against this backdrop, some Muslim groups saw the instant divorce judgment as yet another setback. Some critics suspect that the Modi government\u2019s position had less to do with supporting Muslim women than pleasing Hindu nationalists, who have long argued that the same laws on marriage and divorce should apply to all religious groups.\u201cThis matter is not just about triple talaq but also about the religious sentiments of the minorities of this country,\u201d said Arshad Madani, president of the Muslim group Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind. \u201cMuslims should be ready.\u201dThere are no official statistics on the prevalence of instant divorce in India, but one study found that among a sample of more than 4,700 women, 525 had divorced, 404 of them through triple talaq.The Quran makes no mention of the talaq method. The practice is outlined in the hadiths, or sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, which are regarded as less authoritative than the Quran but are influential in shaping Islamic doctrine.Instant divorce is fading in most parts of the Muslim world. In many predominantly Muslim countries, religious leaders frown on the practice, noting that the Quran recommends that couples make a genuine effort to reconcile and resolve their differences before parting ways.The National Congress party, which casts itself as secular and the guardian of minority rights and counts Muslims as a main constituency, has resisted challenging Muslim divorce practices.In 1985, the Supreme Court ordered the husband of a 62-year-old divorced Muslim woman to pay her alimony of about $15 a month.The Congress party, in power at the time, moved to nullify the court\u2019s decision and pushed Parliament to adopt a new law shifting responsibility for supporting a divorced wife away from her husband after three months and to her relatives or Muslim charities.That law was a grave disservice to Muslim women, according to Noorjehan Safia Niaz, co-founder of the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, one of the Muslim women\u2019s advocacy groups that filed a brief in the Supreme Court case.Ishrat Jahan, a plaintiff in the Indian case, said she had been crushed when her husband divorced her over the phone from Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.\u201cThen he remarried in the village and snatched my children from me,\u201d she said in a television interview.She said she was extremely happy with the court decision. \u201cI never thought this would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cMy lawyers are also very happy.\u201dGeeta Anand contributed reporting from Mumbai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still Processing: Anguish and Anger Over Charlottesville", "Date": "2017-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStill ProcessingExpressions of white supremacy in this country aren\u2019t new. But what happened in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend was the largest public melee during a presidential administration that includes men with white nationalist ties. Three people were killed, dozens of people were injured and the country was thrown into a state of anguish and shock. The show was on vacation, but we came back early to talk about Charlottesville and why the violence there isn\u2019t surprising, what it means to remove totems of the American Confederacy and what a verbal apology from President Trump is really worth.From a desktop or laptop, you can listen by pressing play on the button above.Or if you\u2019re on a mobile device, the instructions below will help you find and subscribe to the series.On your iPhone or iPad:On your Android phone or tablet:This unedited transcription from the podcast may contain errors.

We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.JW: I mostly write about how humans relate to technology.WM: And I mostly write about how popular culture and movies relate to humans.JW: This is...Still Processing.WM: Hi.JW: How are you doing?WM: I\u2019m sad, actually. I mean, it\u2019s an existential sadness. I\u2019m not going to hitch my sadness to what happened over the weekend, but...I was on vacation. The show was on vacation. For some reason, all hell breaks loose in Charlottesville, Virginia.JW: For many reasons, which we\u2019re going to get into.WM: And I don\u2019t know. I feel like we had to come back and talk to each other about it because it seemed crazy not to. What is the point of having the show if when things like this happen we can\u2019t talk about them? And every time these things come up, I get down because it forces me to remember how little people understand about the history of this country that they want to fight for.JW: Willfully don\u2019t understand.WM: What\u2019s going on with you? How are you?JW: I\u2019m recovering from this surreality. Is that a word? Surreality.WM: Sure, yeah.JW: Of looking at the lawn in Charlottesville at the University of Virginia that I streaked the night before graduation, woke up the morning of graduation on, and then walked down later that afternoon to graduate and enter into the real world being transformed into a white nationalist/supremacist rally. I can\u2019t get over that. Although I shouldn\u2019t be surprised given what I know about UVA\u2019s history, which is that it had its own chapter of the Ku Klux Klan which also donated money many times over that school\u2019s history, and that UVA was once the site of one of the best known eugenics research programs in the country during the first half of the 20th century.WM: Oh, boy. With that, let\u2019s actually talk about what is going on right now.JW: Let\u2019s do it.WM: I guess...what happened? What is happening? We\u2019re having this conversation on Tuesday, the Tuesday after the Friday of the precipitating events in which a group of white supremacists went on a march with tiki lamps and heil Hitler signs in Charlottesville. That was Friday, and then Saturday, a rally turned into a melee between the supremacists and the anti racists and the anti fascists and some other groups that were there to allegedly keep the peace.JW: A lot of people were hurt, a woman was killed, and now we\u2019re all let scratching our heads going, what\u2019s going on in America? What\u2019s going on in our country?WM: Yeah. And I think part of the reason that we\u2019re having this conversation right now \u2014 like, the two of us are having this conversation right now \u2014 is that nobody seems to know what to do. I mean, there\u2019s a camp of people that thinks this is some kind of turning point. I\u2019m not sure for whom and for what.JW: Right. I\u2019ve definitely seen online people talk about this being the marker of some sort of larger social revolution, but it\u2019s not clear which way we\u2019re turning and whether things are turning for the better or for the worse.WM: Well, first of all, you lived in Charlottesville for more than a minute.JW: Ugh, I did. Well, I was an undergraduate at UVA until 2004.WM: So what happened over the weekend isn\u2019t necessarily new to you?JW: No. I think what\u2019s been really interesting \u2014 I found out about what was happening in Charlottesville via a series of texts. My mom happens to live right outside of Charlottesville and her partner needs medical treatment in Charlottesville, so they go there quite regularly. And this outburst was precipitated by a couple of other events that happened in Charlottesville. There was a KKK rally. There\u2019s been heightened racial tensions in that town in May and July. For those of us who live in Charlottesville, none of this really feels that surprising. When I was there as an undergraduate, there were multiple blackface events. There were racial attacks. One of the first black student body presidents \u2014 or a black student to run for student body president, I guess \u2014 was attacked and told there will never be an n word for president. I looked at her Facebook yesterday and she was just like, of course this is Charlottesville. This is UVA. This is America. Which has been this common refrain to come out of this, right? People keep saying, well, this isn\u2019t our country. It\u2019s actually the most American thing about America, this kind of racialized violence.WM: It is America. America was founded on this very thing.JW: Right. If you were a student of color at UVA \u2014 and I would say, during my time, but any time because subsequent graduates have reported the same thing, you know \u2014 it was not uncommon if you were a black male to be racially profiled on campus. A good friend of mine was walking home one night from studying at the library and was stopped by the police and they took a DNA sample from him to put it on file, which is a violation of so many rights. And he was a student, and they didn\u2019t believe him. But you comply, right, because what else are you taught to do? You\u2019re a student. You don\u2019t know any better. It was a very oppressive feeling place, and it was the kind of place too that really prided itself on a certain kind of southern gentility, which is really important in the context of why Charlottesville matters and also why Robert E. Lee matters. And if you were a student there, it was very common \u2014 people dressed up for football games, boys wore suits, the girls wore pearls. Charlottesville and UVA, of course, is the home and university built by Thomas Jefferson who is seen as this great founder of American modern democracy. When you\u2019re a student there, you get to take a tour of the Jefferson plantation, and they definitely, there\u2019s like a little wink, wink, nod about his relationship to Sally Hemmings. On Valentine\u2019s Day, there are all these signs that go up that say, like T.J. loves Sally. I mean, there\u2019s a way in which that town \u2014WM: Shut up.JW: Mm hmm. There\u2019s a way in which that town \u2014WM: Sally Hemmings, for anybody who doesn\u2019t know, was one of Thomas Jefferson\u2019s many slaves and his most prized. He had a relationship with her for many years.JW: And it\u2019s part of this larger rewriting of a historical narrative and a historical record, right, that slaves had it good, and that slavery was actually kind of benevolent. And it wasn\u2019t that bad. How bad could it have been? And that town really exists as a weird fantasy of what it was like to be part of the Confederacy. The campus is absolutely beautiful. It does have this slow, syrupy feeling of what it meant when America was great again, before, you know? And it does feed into this idea that if you come there and you fit in and you do the things that make you part of the culture, which is there\u2019s a very much a code of conduct, there\u2019s very much a code of dress, then somehow that makes you more American. But it\u2019s really subversive, and it\u2019s really disastrous. It\u2019s why I didn\u2019t really last there for more than a semester or two before I had to go abroad, and then I immediately moved downtown \u2014 and it\u2019s just confusing, too, because you\u2019re just like, this is colloquial college experience. This is what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. And you don\u2019t realize how you get coopted into this way of thinking, and...kind of like...you just get really pushed into believing the myth of the south, right. But when you look closer, there\u2019s a history of erasure and disappearance of blackness in all of Charlottesville, and especially in downtown Charlottesville where this park is. The Robert E. Lee park, which has since been renamed Emancipation park. And by the way \u2014 the groups just wanted to move the statues. They weren\u2019t saying melt them down and turn them into, I don\u2019t know, cool footwear.WM: The city council agreed to just move the statues somewhere else and change the name of the part.JW: Which is what incited all this stuff. But I guess the point I wanted to make is, the people who believe that this heritage, this southern way of life \u2014 which, by the way, includes the minimization and marginalization of people of color, black people and anyone else that\u2019s not white \u2014 are part of this larger group that really believes in this lost cause, the Confederacy. That there was this sort of, you know, if you google lost cause, it comes up that the war that was lost was like a noble one, a heroic one, and a lot of that in part of inspired by the conciliatory speech that Robert E. Lee made when he was announcing defeat. So, it\u2019s all weirdly very connected and Robert E. Lee has become, I think in a lot of ways, very emblematic to this struggle for what was once good. And I\u2019m using air quotes. It was not good for us. It was not good. But I think that\u2019s important to remember. That these groups have effectively rewritten the past, and they\u2019re fighting to preserve what they believe was the past for the present and for the future. And on the other side of it, you have people that are saying, oh, no, no, no, we have to aggressively rethink the past now, otherwise we\u2019re going to be screwed in the future. And that\u2019s actually really what the fight is coming down to: the way we want to think about what happened in the past.WM: I think that thinking about the future and the past in the context of the present is really useful. I think that one thing about being a black American is that you carry that around with you all the time. I think you are always aware of your physical place in any space. I\u2019m always aware of my blackness, whether I\u2019m among other black people and I can feel how special in some ways that is, or if I\u2019m in predominantly white environments as I frequently am and you are very quietly bracing yourself for something that probably won\u2019t even happen, but could.JW: And that\u2019s actually the point of those statues, and the Confederate memorials that are both very visible and not. There was a huge boom after the civil rights movement to build these memorials because this was the point. Just this subtle reminder of the racial terrorism that had happened in the past and that it could happen again at any moment. Gone but not forgotten.WM: Right. So, I think that there are really two important events that kicked off this current situation that we\u2019re in. Well, I mean, there are three, the first of which is the election of Barack Obama in 2008. But I also think that within that context, I think Dylann Roof\u2019s murder of nine people at the Emanuel AME church in June of 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 that same month, Donald Trump announces his presidential campaign. And he doesn\u2019t just announce his presidential campaign. He basically kicks it off with this announcement that Mexicans are \u2014 you know, the famous, now infamous Mexicans are rapists and murderers speech, or observation, or lie. It sets a climate that never goes away, but the storm clouds keep gathering. They\u2019ve been gathering for two years. And frankly, they\u2019ve been gathering since \u2014 well, I mean, in the Donald Trump context, because really, Donald Trump\u2019s relationship to all of this, in my mind, he and Barack Obama are nationally, psychically conjoined. Obama becomes elected, Trump starts his birther campaign. The constant nagging question that he creates in people\u2019s minds about Barack Obama\u2019s \u2014JW: Legitimacy.WM: Legitimacy as an American citizen. Constantly otherizing him. It really satisfied a lot of white people. That seed of doubt has flowered, I think, into this awful organism that showed up in Charlottesville over the weekend.JW: Right.WM: It\u2019s not that it\u2019s new. But it is the first active, violent manifestation of what Donald Trump is about, like the vessel that he is. And that\u2019s the part that\u2019s really upsetting. It\u2019s not so much that what happened is necessarily new. It\u2019s now, you are seeing these physical manifestations in the real world of what was going on at his rallies as egged on by him. In February, in suburban Kansas City, a white man shot an Indian man under the assumption that he was a Muslim from the Middle East. A few months later, there was a stabbing on a train in Portland. A man stabbed two men who were trying to protect a couple Muslim women.JW: Muslim American women.WM: Muslim American women, sorry, from him, who was just defiant in the courtroom about what he did. I hope they all die, he said. I\u2019m going to say that on the stand. I\u2019m a patriot, and I hope everyone I stabbed died.JW: I think it\u2019s easy for people to view that man and his views as an anomaly, as an abnormality. But he\u2019s not. It\u2019s becoming the new norm. Southern Poverty Law Center reported recently that the number of hate groups in the U.S. rose for the second year in a row. The most dramatic growth was the near tripling of anti Muslim hate groups, which went from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year. The FBI also said that hate crimes against Muslims grew by 67 percent in 2015, the year in which Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign. So, it\u2019s a clear correlation between the two things, and it feels really terrifying to have a president who won\u2019t come out and say, these are deplorable acts. And so, it now perpetuates this feeling of very state sponsored and government sponsored violence of racial terror. That if you are a person of color walking around these United States, at any moment, you could be a target of racial violence or racial terrorism that is essentially state and government sponsored. Very few of the people who have perpetuated crimes against black people, whether they be police officers or anybody else, have been prosecuted for it.WM: Right. That\u2019s a fact. Okay, we\u2019re going to take a break here, and we\u2019ll be right back. I think that one of the striking things about what happened on Saturday was that a lot of the clashing was being done between white people.JW: Right.WM: I was talking to a number of people who found those images confusing because they couldn\u2019t tell who was which, and that was really fascinating to me, because in the history of battles against white supremacy in this country, it\u2019s been black people confronting white people or white state controlled or government controlled apparatus turned against black people. And so, in a sense, there is something new about a race melee featuring more white people fighting each other than black people and white people.JW: I found it comforting.WM: It was perversely comforting.JW: It was perversely comforting to see how many white people showed up.WM: Because \u2014 and this gets to this idea that people don\u2019t want to hear about white supremacy, because they aren\u2019t white supremacists \u2014 but you are white. And I think part of the problem with the conversation around white supremacy is that white people might not feel like they\u2019re white supremacists at all. In fact, most aren\u2019t. But there\u2019s a system by which white supremacy operates, and it is set up to benefit white people. Now, you don\u2019t have to be a practicing racist to benefit from racism.JW: It\u2019s basically just interest on whiteness, you just collect the checks.WM: You have, as a beneficiary, as a permanent beneficiary of that system, a duty to challenge it when it loses its mind and actively begins to start doing things like taking away people\u2019s rights and actively harming people, which is what this administration seems intent on doing from policy proposal to policy proposal to policy proposal.JW: Mm hmm. And there are a lot more anti fascists in this country, too, than I think we realize, and I think that\u2019s why a lot of the signs that were making the rounds on social media \u2014 there was that older woman holding a sign that was like, I escaped the Nazis once, I\u2019m not going to do it again. You know, and I think that\u2019s also closely aligned with other Americans in this country who are just like, I am not for this racism either. I think those two groups are coming together in a really significant way, which is encouraging to me.WM: Yes. I\u2019m a little bit of a wimp when it comes to this, like the violence. I don\u2019t want to see anybody hurt, killed, whatever. I understand that for some people, it took the death of Heather Heyer who was killed by the crazy person who \u2014 I mean, I can\u2019t even give him the benefit of being crazy \u2014 the racist who drove a car into the crowd on Saturday afternoon. It\u2019s going to take something like her death to galvanize people to understand that \u2014JW: That next time it could be them.WM: It could be you. I also find it \u2014 and this is the point at which I think it\u2019s really important to talk about Donald Trump in like a real way, because his refusal to say anything on Saturday was unsurprising to me. But his failure to acknowledge the deaths of three people involved in this, and the many injured people...the very least a president can do is condemn racism, racists, and white supremacists. The second easiest thing to do as president, and crucial, I would say, is to acknowledge the pain and suffering of people who didn\u2019t have to die \u2014 over the weekend, for instance \u2014 but did.JW: Instead, we got a tweet from Ivanka Trump, which made her the highest ranking official in the White House to acknowledge.WM: The failure of this man to lead in any direction is...it\u2019s a travesty of American democracy in the most perverse sense. I would have more respect for him if he went up there and said, you know what, guys? Thanks for doing my bidding out there. I\u2019m so glad to see you guys come out.JW: Jesus. I understand but \u2014WM: But wouldn\u2019t that be something? Rather than like, this non answer. And then, so like two days later, we this B.S. thing where he condemns all racism as evil? Donald Trump, you don\u2019t fool me for one second. First of all, I mean, the idea that we can\u2019t talk about Donald Trump being a racist and all the racist energy is being directed at Stephen Bannon, who is one of his advisors? And Stephen Miller, who also is advising Donald Trump? Uh uh. That\u2019s lunacy to me. He\u2019s as racist as anybody.JW: But it feels like the beginning of a tide, though.WM: Oh? What kind of tide?JW: I don\u2019t know. Like purging, like the purge.WM: You know what? Purge Donald Trump. Because getting rid of Steve Bannon does nothing for me. It\u2019s not like \u2014 I mean, Steve Bannon didn\u2019t deny anybody the right to live in a Trump building in 1970 something. Stephen Bannon didn\u2019t take out an ad in 1989 to condemn the Central Park Five, who were accused of raping a woman they didn\u2019t actually rape, were exonerated like 25 years later, and Donald Trump then takes out an editorial in the same newspaper saying that the settlement and the exoneration were stupid and bogus.JW: Look, I know the rod goes all the way up to the top. I know. I know. I know. However, the purge has to start somewhere, and at least it feels there are now starting to be some checks and balances, whereas before there were none. And if it takes Google and AirBnB and tech companies who have pushed back and said, you know, we\u2019re not going to host the websites of these companies, we\u2019re not going to host neo-Nazis...when the president won\u2019t say it, if the people around him are saying it, even if it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m the most cynical person about when tech companies and CEOs and various people do things in their own interest, because it\u2019s always in their own business interest, but when they make these stands, they\u2019re highly public, they\u2019re highly visible. They\u2019re the most visible signs we can get, since the president won\u2019t say this is deplorable and I condemn this behavior. When we have CEOs who are \u2014 frankly, the CEO of Google is as powerful as the president in a lot of ways \u2014 saying I don\u2019t condone this behavior, I\u2019ll take it, because we\u2019re not getting much else right now. We\u2019re not getting anything else right now.WM: Well, you know what we got on Saturday at about like 8 PM?JW: What?WM: Speaking of presidential. Barack Obama went on Twitter.JW: What\u2019d he say?WM: He just basically quoted Nelson Mandela, and he had this quote about \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ll read the whole thing. \u201cNo one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate. And if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.\u201d Ah...I just can\u2019t believe that nobody in that administration could find it in their hearts to like...JW: Yeah.WM: It\u2019s so crazy to me. This is like insane.JW: But look, they will be \u2014 I honestly am starting to believe, though \u2014 there will be more Bree Newsome, who is the woman who shimmed up the pole to take down the Confederate flag. There will be more Mitchell Andrews, who was the mayor of New Orleans who facilitated the taking down of Confederate statues. And when we were in New Orleans, people were saying to me, well, we need more Mitches. Because we\u2019re going forward. We\u2019re not going back. Change is violent. The transition from the last century was violent, too. This one\u2019s also going to be violent. We\u2019re moving forward.WM: Well, we\u2019re moving forward, but he still can\u2019t fix the water pumps to keep the flooding out of New Orleans. So...I know, I don\u2019t expect anything from this administration, and it doesn\u2019t really matter what they say, as long as they\u2019re trying to repeal affirmative action policy. As long as they\u2019re trying to stop people from entering this country lawfully or to escape persecution in other places. As long as they are trying to do any of the other number of things \u2014 like take back voting rights from people? Like all the stuff that our ancestors marched and died for. To repeal those things like it\u2019s nothing. I don\u2019t care what they say. They can say whatever they want. They can get rid of whoever they want, as long as there are people in place to keep those policies from being enacted or to repeal them or to water them down. Donald Trump can condemn racism every day for the rest of his administration as long. As long as he\u2019s trying to get this other stuff done, that contradicts \u2014 any statement against white supremacy he can, he is still practicing white supremacy in his presidency.JW: These are dark times. I\u2019m not trying to sugarcoat it. There are dark times. The outcome can\u2019t be, this is only bad when it gets bloody. Because the blood is invisible but it\u2019s everywhere all the time. And that\u2019s what I was trying to say earlier in a very muddled way about people who are posting on social media. Like, white silence is violence. I\u2019m like, my dude. Your Facebook post is white silence. Organize a dinner. Raise money. Do something. Support an organization. If you\u2019re a journalist, write a story. Don\u2019t...like, I had to go to yoga yesterday and really work out some emotions, because the number of people posting on Facebook ... I also saw, I will say, an equal number of people actively protesting at Trump power \u2014 oh my God! I saw, I saw as many if not equal or more posts from white friends in my feeds who were protesting at Trump Tower, which makes me feel good because I\u2019m like, that is an active action, not a passive one to me, but I\u2019m, I need people to take action. Because the administration is not going to do it. A Facebook post is not going to do it. All the attention that was focused on Charlottesville has energized white supremacists, has energized right wing supremacists, many of whom are organizing various satellite versions of exactly what went down. They\u2019re going to San Francisco to protest Google. They\u2019re going to Berkeley. The flames are being fanned.WM: Mm hmm. Yeah. The rallies are coming to your town, so fasten your seatbelts.JW: There\u2019s a quote from a guy in the article the Times ran today that said, every city needs to watch out. We are everywhere.WM: I think Make America Great Again is ... you know, one of the most savagely brilliant marketing campaigns ever. I mean, it\u2019s the sieg heil of the 21st century.JW: Absolutely.WM: Well, one of the crazy things I\u2019ve been thinking was \u2014 I mean, this is kind of grim, but I think about it all the time when you see these white nationalists co-opt the language of oppressed people. The optics of what happened on Friday with that march with the tiki lamps to me looked like a Take Back the Night rally on a college campus. And...I think a lot about like, what do these people, what do they want? And it\u2019s kind of a miracle that you and I are even sitting here, given all the other people who have died over the course of the last 200 years. Well, beyond 200 years. It\u2019s amazing like they didn\u2019t just kill us all and just make us all go away. I mean, it\u2019s not so much that I want to die or like, I just think it\u2019s a miracle that they didn\u2019t just round us up in 1865 when there was just, there was no more...there was no more slavery, basically, and just kill us all because otherwise, to incorporate us into society would just be impossible. And as it turns out, it\u2019s still kind of impossible to get total peace. And, of course, they couldn\u2019t do that because slavery was part of a capitalist system and they still needed the work. They needed labor. But I think about the American Indians all the time, and how \u2014 I mean, you and I have like cried about this on the show before...JW: I know. Which has also gotten rewritten in this whole thing, where there was a Times story taking first person accounts from the various events on Friday and Saturday in Charlottesville, and someone who came out to support the white nationalist party said, well, America is for white people. Africa is for black people. Forgetting that before that, America was for brown people! It\u2019s like, so your memory only goes back a century or two? Like, what the hell?WM: You know, I just \u2014 and I also don\u2019t mean to make it seem like freed slaves would have allowed themselves to be killed, like willy nilly, but I think that, as campaigns go, I object to calling these guys Nazis, because...JW: It affords a kind of distancing.WM: It creates a very safe distance from actual white nationalist, KKK racists. There are a lot of young people \u2014 I mean, many people have noted the number of young people who have been out there on Friday and Saturday \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what you do about that.

The offbeat, candy-packed ice creams will get a tweak in texture, becoming creamier and smoother.Best of all, fans will get a chance to sample them at the source in October, when a scoop shop opens, with windows offering a clear view into the plant. By next spring, Mr. Smith said, visitors will be able to go on self-guided tours of the factory, and walk through various ice cream-themed installations.Ample Hills, which opened its first shop is 2011, currently makes its ice cream in Gowanus, using a batch-freezing method. But the new dairy plant, beside Erie Basin, will use a continuous freezing method: Milk will run steadily through a gleaming network of tanks and pipes \u2014 pasteurized, pumped through homogenizers and swirled through a hopper with flavorings \u2014 before it is uniformly aerated and frozen in the tireless spin of industrial dasher blades.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.Mix-ins are now folded into semi-frozen ice cream by hand, but the new plant will mechanically add brownies and honeycomb candies, ensuring that the crunch and sweetness are more evenly distributed. Most of the confections will be produced at a bakery in the factory.Another Brooklyn producer, OddFellows Ice Cream Co., plans next year to open a factory, along with a soda fountain in Bushwick. Sam Mason, Mohan Kumar and Holiday Kumar will start with a series of batch freezers, then add a continuous freezer, and the churning process will be on full view when the factory opens for tours.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Bad Drinks Go Good", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust as the cocktail renaissance has brought renewed fame to classics like the martini, the manhattan and the Negroni, it has heaped fresh infamy on a rogues\u2019 gallery of less classy concoctions, most of which emerged during the final decades of the last century.Now a backlash of sorts has begun, as some high-end bartenders apply their skills to a new challenge: doing bad drinks well.\u201cI hate pretense,\u201d he said. \u201cI particularly hate the dividing of products that happened for a time in our industry. \u2018Here\u2019s something we carry and celebrate for reasons; and here\u2019s something we don\u2019t carry and don\u2019t celebrate for other reasons.\u2019\u201dJeffrey Morgenthaler, the bar manager of P\u00e9p\u00e9 Le Moko and Clyde Common (also in Portland), is arguably the high priest of this populist trend. His new-and-improved rendition of the lowly amaretto sour, now served at bars around the world, began as a secret, under-the-bar special he would serve only to friends.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t cool to say you liked amaretto sours,\u201d Mr. Morgenthaler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be excommunicated from the cocktail world for serving it.\u201dWhen P\u00e9p\u00e9 Le Moko opened in 2014, however, he let his democratic colors fly. \u201cWe had reached the maximum density on cocktail snobbery,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were getting fed up with the cocktail nerd who would judge your drink order.\u201d Joining the amaretto sour on the menu were reimagined recipes for the Grasshopper and the Blue Hawaii.Just referring to any cocktail as bad is enough to get Mr. Morgenthaler\u2019s back up. (\u201cThere are no bad drinks, only bad bartenders,\u201d he has said.) But generally speaking, in mixology circles, cocktails are deemed subpar for any number of reasons: a lack of subtlety or balance; an overreliance on alcohol or sugar; the past use of poor ingredients, including spirits with artificial colors or flavors; silly names; or just a negative reputation as a favorite of undiscriminating bars and drinkers.The new versions of these shady drinks, however, are not the cocktails your parents knew. While some bartenders may champion underdog cocktails, they are also aware that the drinks need a little work under the hood. Mr. Morgenthaler\u2019s amaretto sour is bolstered by a dose of bourbon. Mr. Dauermann\u2019s Midori sour calls for gin, homemade lime cordial and egg white. And the hue of the blue margarita at the Automatic comes not from blue Cura\u00e7ao but from butterfly pea flower.\u201cI can\u2019t do it poorly,\u201d said Dave Cagle, an owner of the Automatic. \u201cI can\u2019t look people in the face and sell them an $11 cup of food coloring and corn syrup.\u201dThe Long Island iced tea may be the cocktail that most often inspires quixotic bartenders to don their lifeguard gear. Mr. Morgenthaler improves his with Mexican Coke, which contains cane sugar, not corn syrup. The Long Island iced tea at Holiday Cocktail Lounge uses vodka infused with actual tea, and has no Coke in it at all.If a cocktail requires so much surgery to make it suitable, why bother with it at all?\u201cI\u2019m someone who thinks you can get more out of something by adding more to it,\u201d Mr. Dauermann said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying my Midori sour is a way to showcase the potential of the flavor in Midori in a way that does it more service than just serving Midori.\u201dAlso, customers order the things.\u201cWe sell so much of it,\u201d Mr. Cagle said. \u201cMudslides, blue margaritas, Miami Vices.

At a news conference Tuesday, the city manager, Maurice Jones, cited safety concerns and the large number of people expected at the rally as the reasons for the request.\u201cWe believe that the proposal to move the demonstration to McIntire Park strikes an appropriate balance between Mr. Kessler\u2019s right to organize a demonstration, on the one hand, and the City\u2019s obligations to maintain public safety and protect public and private property, on the other,\u201d Mr. Jones said in a statement.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Kessler said he believed that \u201chundreds of people have been put out of their accommodations\u201d by Airbnb.

{"Headline": "Spain Looking for Moroccan Man in Barcelona Attack Investigation", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 The Spanish authorities said on Saturday that they were hunting for a 22-year-old Moroccan-born man who they now suspect was the driver of the van that plowed through central Barcelona this past week, in the country\u2019s worst terrorist attack in more than a decade.A counterterrorism source who has been briefed on the investigation, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share information learned in confidence, said that investigators believed the plot had been in the works for almost a year.The suspects appear to have sought to build a bomb that would be placed inside a vehicle, and to have turned to the small seaside town of Alcanar to assemble it, the source said.The police found the remains of two people in the rubble of a house in Alcanar that had been used as a bomb factory, after a blast leveled the structure late Wednesday. They also found traces of the Islamic State\u2019s signature explosive, TATP, which is relatively cheap but highly volatile because it explodes at low temperatures.Javier Marti Meix, a deputy inspector who is leading the investigation there for the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, the Catalan police, said that it was possible that others could be buried in the rubble, which is in one of the poorer parts of Alcanar.The suspects were living in the house illegally, he said, and other homes in the area have been occupied by squatters. The house had been repossessed by Banco Popular in a foreclosure, he said.The counterterrorism expert said the police had recovered around 100 gas canisters from the property, a number that he found bewilderingly high. Neighbors said they had seen young people going in and out of the property, as well as cars with gas canisters, since December.The authorities in Alcanar carried out controlled explosions Saturday morning \u2014 \u201cIf you hear detonations DO NOT be alarmed,\u201d the Catalan police said on Twitter \u2014 because of concerns that there might still be more explosives and gas canisters in the rubble.So far, seven people believed to be part of the cell have been killed, and four have been arrested. But with at least one more suspect still unaccounted for, Spaniards remained on edge, even though the authorities said on Saturday that the cell had been broken up and that there was no imminent threat of another attack.While officials agreed on the threat level, there appeared to be some disagreement about the status of the investigation. Spain\u2019s interior minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, announced that the terrorist cell had been dismantled, but his regional Catalan counterpart, Joaquim Forn, told reporters later on Saturday that \u201cwe can\u2019t say the investigation is finished until we locate or detain all those who we think form part of this terror cell.\u201dThe cell, Mr. Forn added, cannot be described as \u201cabsolutely dismantled.\u201dThe focus of the manhunt on Saturday was Younes Abouyaaqoub, who is believed to have fled on foot after weaving a van through Las Ramblas, a central pedestrian area of Barcelona.There was no indication that Mr. Abouyaaqoub or the other young men, ages 17 to 34, who were believed to be part of the cell had any connection to extremist or terrorism-related activities.The counterterrorism expert said that investigators were looking into the possibility that the suspects had lived double lives, noting that some of their Facebook pages demonstrated an interest in clubbing, girls, selfies and hair gel.Mr. Abouyaaqoub became the focus after the police explored the possibility that the driver of the Barcelona van may have been Moussa Oukabir, a 17-year-old from Morocco who died early Friday in a shootout with the police in Cambrils.Instead, the police are now investigating whether Mr. Abouyaaqoub fled the van after it came to a halt near a Joan Mir\u00f3 mosaic on Las Ramblas, hijacked another car, killed its driver and forced his way through a police checkpoint.The police later found the body of a Spanish man who had been stabbed to death in an abandoned Ford Focus about three kilometers, or less than two miles, from the city center, and they believe there was a connection with the attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils.At the same time, Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero, a senior Catalan police chief, told the local news media on Friday that it was too early to rule out the possibility that Mr. Abouyaaqoub was among the two men killed in the Alcanar explosion Wednesday night.The attack in Barcelona was the worst in Spain since 2004, when a series of bombs ripped through commuter trains in Madrid, killing 192. The authorities suspect that the terrorist cell had been planning an even more deadly assault, but that it had to scale back plans after that explosion.Mr. Abouyaaqoub was living in Ripoll, the Catalan town that was also home to two of the five men \u2014 Mr. Oukabir and Mohamed Hychami \u2014 who were shot and killed by the police in Cambrils.On Friday, investigators raided an apartment in Ripoll that was the home of Abdelbaki Essati, the imam at a local mosque.Ali Yassini, who leads the Islamic association that runs the mosque where Mr. Essati served as imam, was surprised to learn that Mr. Essati might be connected to the suspects in the attacks.\u201cDuring the time the imam was with us, Moussa came maybe once or twice and the other guys about the same,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we never, ever saw the boys with the imam outside the mosque. We didn\u2019t realize there was any relationship between them.\u201dMr. Oukabir\u2019s older brother Driss is among the four people who have been detained, although his role in the plot is unclear. He was taken into custody when he walked into a police station and said that his identity documents had been stolen.The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, claimed responsibility on Saturday for the attack in Cambrils, saying it had \u201ckilled and wounded more than 120 citizens of the Crusader coalition\u201d in the two assaults.The statement was disseminated on the group\u2019s official Nashir channel, and it included erroneous material, most likely taken from news reports that were later corrected, stating that the perpetrators had used small arms to attack a bar near Las Ramblas.Separately, the authorities continued with the grim task of identifying the victims of the attacks and notifying their families. In a statement on Saturday, the Catalan authorities said that a total of 108 people had been wounded in the two attacks \u2014 100 in Barcelona \u2014 and that 12 people were in critical condition.The Philippine Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that it had offered its assistance to a 43-year-old woman who was seriously injured and whose 7-year-old son has been missing since the attack. (The Catalan police said later in the day that all of the dead and wounded had been found.)The woman, who has not been publicly identified, is married to a British citizen and lives and works in Australia. She had traveled to Barcelona with her son for the wedding of a cousin from the Philippines, according to the statement.An Irish man of Philippine descent and his 5-year-old son were also wounded in the attack, the statement said, adding that surgery on the boy\u2019s leg had been successful.An earlier version of this article misspelled, in one instance, the surname of a Moroccan teenager who died in a shootout with the police in Cambrils. He was Moussa Oukabir, not Oubakir.Raphael Minder reported from Barcelona, Spain, and Rukmini Callimachi from Erbil, Iraq.

Lee, many could not help noticing the product illuminating the faces twisted into sneers of hate: Tiki torches.Those innocuous bamboo beacons, produced by Tiki Brand, a 60-year-old company, and known primarily for their presence at family barbecues, poolside cabanas, lush resort grounds and Pacific-island themed restaurants, were now lighting the way for racists.Tiki, which is owned by the Wisconsin-based Lamplight Farms, denounced the white nationalists in a Facebook post on Aug. 12. \u201cWe do not support their message or the use of our products in this way,\u201d it said. \u201cOur products are designed to enhance backyard gatherings and to help family and friends connect with each other at home in their yard.\u201dMark Werner, vice president of marketing at Lamplight Farms, issued an addendum to the statement that read: \u201cThe feedback that we have received from the public regarding our earlier statement has been very positive. We will continue to reinforce that Tiki Brand products are to be enjoyed by friends and family outdoors in a loving environment.\u201dA spokeswoman for the company declined to comment further.Still, marketing specialists and risk management consultants predicted that it would be difficult for Tiki to move past the perception that it had been embraced by racist organizations.Andrew D. Gilman, who has consulted with companies like Johnson & Johnson, General Motors and Pepsi during crises, described Tiki as essentially \u201cminding its own business\u201d when it found itself caught up in the Charlottesville demonstrations.\u201cYou hope that people are rational enough not to blame the innocent with the association that others are taking for it,\u201d Mr. Gilman said. \u201cBut you cannot sit back passively and let this happen.\u201dHe added, \u201cWhen you have these things happen, it just hits you in the tummy and in the heart. You say, \u2018We weren\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u2019 \u201dThis is not the first time that white nationalists and other members of the so-called alt-right have chosen particular products to co-opt or endorse. For years, the British clothing line Fred Perry has been dogged by its affiliation with skinheads, who seemed to favor its polo shirts as a sort of uniform, along with Dr. Martens, the makers of steel-toed boots. Fred Perry has denounced racist groups.Even the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League issued a statement after an adaptation of its team logo appeared on posters in the Charlottesville rally, reportedly wielded by members of a Michigan white nationalist group calling itself the Detroit Right Wings.\u201cThe Detroit Red Wings vehemently disagree with and are not associated in any way with the event taking place today in Charlottesville, Va.,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cWe are exploring every possible legal action as it pertains to the misuse of our logo in this disturbing demonstration.\u201dThe Tiki torches were probably just a matter of convenience, said Joan Donovan, lead researcher in media manipulation at the research institute Data & Society, who studies hate groups and white supremacists. Torches have long been associated with the Ku Klux Klan, but those used in the past were far more likely to be homemade.Ms. Donovan said that the best way to counter any perception of being embraced by extremist groups is for brands to avoid even mentioning the people or groups that are trying to use their products.\u201cIf you acknowledge and promote their existence and validate their actions in a way that even says \u2018We disavow you,\u2019 then it doesn\u2019t give room to talk about the things you do support or find to be positive ways forward,\u201d she said.However, Scott Farrell, a specialist in crisis management and the president of Golin Corporate Communications, said that the use of the Tiki torches by racist groups in Charlottesville was so egregious and antithetical to the product\u2019s good-natured image that \u201ca swift and decisive response is the only way to go.\u201d\u201cI think they did absolutely the right thing,\u201d Mr. Farrell said. \u201cTheir messaging came out fast on Saturday, it had the right tone and tenor. It\u2019s a page of the playbook that other people should be looking at right now.\u201dThat playbook is rapidly being rewritten, forcing chief marketing officers to remain abnormally vigilant about how their products are being perceived and adopted in the marketplace.\u201cHistorically, risk management centered on two questions: what\u2019s possible and what\u2019s probable,\u201d Mr. Farrell said. \u201cToday, to answer what\u2019s possible, marketers have to push themselves to the extreme margins of reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tom Colicchio Changes His Restaurant\u2019s Racially Tinged Name", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an age of careful branding, restaurateurs put a lot of thought into choosing just the right name. Rarely will they go to the trouble and expense of changing it.Yet the chef Tom Colicchio is dropping the name of his newest Manhattan restaurant, Fowler & Wells, after learning that it has historically racist connotations. The new name is Temple Court.Fowler & Wells, which opened last October, was named for a publishing company and scientific institute that once operated in a building on the same site in the financial district; that building was later torn down, replaced by Temple Court, the building that stands there now. The men who started the company, Lorenzo and Orson Fowler and Samuel Wells, were proponents of phrenology, a popular 19th-century belief that the shape of one\u2019s skull revealed characteristics like mental aptitude and personality.Mr. Colicchio, who has emerged as a strong liberal voice in food policy, and frequently uses his Twitter account to criticize President Donald J. Trump, said that when he and his team were developing ideas for a name, they understood that phrenology \u201cwas used for nefarious reasons\u201d but had only a passing knowledge of it.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a bad idea to start with because we didn\u2019t have any of the information we have now,\u201d Mr. Colicchio said. \u201cI have a fairly liberal persona and never in a million years would consider myself a racist, so it never crossed my mind.\u201dMr. Colicchio said those implications were eye-opening and he immediately knew the name could not stand. Though customers and social media remained quiet on the issue, several staff members came to him to discuss it.\u201cVery quickly, internally, we told people we were changing the name of the restaurant,\u201d he said.Once everyone agreed, designers had to create a new sign and logo. New menus have been created and new business cards have been printed.Complicating matters, Mr. Colicchio had named the restaurant\u2019s private dining room Temple Court, which had a set of its own materials that needed to be redone.Before selecting the new name, he said, his staff did research to make sure it didn\u2019t pose any problems.Eugene Kelly, an Irish immigrant who built his wealth from retail sales and banking, originally commissioned the building. Its construction began in 1881, and the building was modeled after one in London that was part of the Inns of Court, a series of compounds where British barristers lived and trained.An article last Wednesday about the chef Tom Colicchio\u2019s decision to change the name of his restaurant Fowler & Wells because of its connections to phrenology misidentified the members of the Fowler family who helped Samuel Wells found the Fowler & Wells publishing company in the 19th century. They were Lorenzo and Orson Fowler, not Edward Fowler. The article also misidentified which Fowler family member wrote a passage suggesting that African-Americans were racially inferior. It was by Orson, not Edward.Advertisement"}

Three?\u201d A half-hour into the much-anticipated episode the doorbell rang, so he stopped the show again when the Domino\u2019s delivery guy arrived with three pies. All the while the armchair analysis continued apace.\u201cDo they literally bring winter with them?\u201d Mr. Molina asked about the White Walkers, referring to the zombielike army of the dead descending on a mostly oblivious human population in the south.His longtime friend Erik Voss nodded as he finished a mouthful of pizza. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about this idea that winter doesn\u2019t bring White Walkers \u2014 that White Walkers bring winter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may be that winter didn\u2019t exist in this world until the White Walkers were created.\u201dThis is how America watches live TV in 2017 \u2014 starting late, pausing to grab food, debating the finer points of a show\u2019s mythology. But for Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss, this is more than an enjoyable pastime; it\u2019s a living.They are superfans \u2014 sophisticated ones \u2014 using visual aids to break down shows and movies for superfans. And their handiwork makes the audience for these pop-culture spectacles even bigger and more engaged.\u201cWe are in a world where the cacophony of coverage, whether it\u2019s Vanity Fair or New Rockstars, drives the cultural zeitgeist around the show,\u201d said Sabrina Caluori, HBO\u2019s senior vice president for digital media and marketing. \u201cThat breeds the FOMO \u2014 the Fear of Missing Out \u2014 that\u2019s driving continued growth of the show this season.\u201dThe morning after the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere, Mr. Molina, 32, and Mr. Voss, 29, started work early at their one-room studio, which is across the street from Universal Studios. Mr. Molina had watched the episode twice, made extensive notes and built the motion graphics for \u201cWesteros Weekly,\u201d a new show that New Rockstars is producing during this season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Mr. Voss was in another corner rewatching clips from the premiere and writing a script for an hourlong episode breakdown that he and Mr. Molina would begin taping the next day.The two men both have comedy backgrounds, and both are working on their own film and TV scripts even as they\u2019re becoming known online as film and TV personalities. New Rockstars, though, will be their full-time gig for the foreseeable future.\u201cThe moment we saw the response to that \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 video, we decided to reduce all the coverage on all the YouTubers,\u201d said Jeben Berg, a former Google executive and a partner in Zealot Networks, which owns New Rockstars. \u201cPeople wanted to see heightened, sensible, intelligent speculation on what was happening on big Hollywood film properties.\u201d(Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss have focused nearly all of their attention on the YouTube channel, which has about a million subscribers and is supported by advertising and sponsors, though this fall New Rockstars will begin making content for Facebook. So far the company has not delved into podcasts, Instagram or Snapchat as some other sites do.)There\u2019s a D.I.Y. spirit and modest scale to the New Rockstars operation. When Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss taped their breakdown video on Monday night, they were the only two people in the studio. They watched themselves on a monitor and advanced their teleprompter with an iPhone. No one yelled \u201ccut\u201d; they just kept recording.The next morning, as Mr. Molina and Mr. Voss were preparing to finish the video, an editor discovered that Mr. Voss\u2019s microphone had failed during the taping the night before. They didn\u2019t have time to rerecord, so they trudged ahead. That afternoon, Mr. Molina used an audio app to isolate and tweak Mr. Voss\u2019s vocal track from what his own microphone had captured.\u201cYou could replace everything in that studio with $5,000 and an Amazon Prime account,\u201d Mr. Molina said, \u201cand it would all be here in two days.\u201dNew Rockstars has only been in a studio since May; before that, Mr. Molina\u2019s apartment or whatever space they could find sufficed. But the smarts of their analysis, and the engaging presence the two men have on camera, more than make up for the bare-bones production.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charlottesville Beating Suspect Is Arrested in Georgia", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the suspects in the beating of a young African-American man during the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va., was arrested in Georgia on Monday.Alex Michael Ramos, 33, was charged with malicious wounding in the Aug. 12 attack on DeAndre Harris, 20, a teacher\u2019s aide and aspiring rapper, who was beaten by a group of people with wooden boards and pipes.Mr. Ramos was being held Tuesday in Forsyth, Ga., about an hour south of Atlanta.The case has become a focal point of debate on social media. Right-wing activists blame Mr. Harris for his injuries and have posted his home address and telephone number online. Mr. Harris, who sustained a broken wrist and a head wound that required 10 staples, cannot return to work because seeing large groups of people make him anxious, his lawyer, S. Lee Merritt, said.\u201cFor someone who is a schoolteacher and performer, all he does is stand around people,\u201d Mr. Merritt said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of a big deal.\u201dMr. Harris worked full time as an instructional aide for children enrolled in special education classes. He declined to be interviewed on Tuesday.\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get away,\u201d Mr. Merritt said. \u201cThey are surrounding him and beating him over the head with blunt objects. Their only defense is going to be self-defense, but under no one\u2019s legal standard is it self-defense to chase after someone wielding a flashlight when one of his friends is being speared with a pole, and then beating him maliciously.\u201dMr. Merritt said he was disappointed that Mr. Ramos and Mr. Borden had each been charged with only a single count of malicious wounding.Typically in criminal cases, prosecutors seek a stronger plea-bargaining position by lodging more severe charges than they expect to actually try. The single charge in this case \u2014 a felony punishable by one to five years in prison \u2014 will make it easier for Mr. Ramos to obtain release on bail, Mr. Merritt said.\u201cThis indicates that law enforcement is not taking this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cConspicuously missing are any hate-crime charges. Participating in a hate group\u2019s hate rally using racial slurs, where people in uniform with white-group insignia target one of the few black male protesters and bludgeon him, have all the elements of hate crimes.\u201dThe Charlottesville city prosecutor\u2019s office did not return a call seeking comment about the charges, and the police declined to comment further on the case Tuesday.The Unite the Right Rally ended even before it was scheduled to begin, when city officials who were alarmed by repeated violent incidents declared the rally an unlawful assembly. About two hours later, one white supremacist rammed his Dodge into cars and anti-racism demonstrators, killing a 32-year-old woman, Heather D. Heyer.\u201cI don\u2019t care who they were pushing out of the park, white supremacists or any one of us or Black Lives Matter or Antifa,\u201d Mr. Ramos said. \u201cThey were pushing them into opposition protesters, so they can be harmed. That\u2019s what happened. They were supposed to be there to protect and prevent any bad things.\u201dIn the video, Mr. Ramos said he was born and raised in the Bronx. He was known in South Florida as a member of the Occupy movement who participated in the 100-day encampment at a government plaza in Miami in 2011.But Mr. Ramos was also a member of Anonymous, the hacking collective, and a few fringe right-wing nationalist groups, such as Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters, according to Kevin K. Young, who said he and Mr. Ramos were friends during the Occupy movement.\u201cHe just wanted to be part of it,\u201d Mr. Young said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t somebody who presented ideas or planned actions, but he wanted to be there when the action happened.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a statement about the investigation into the assault. It was DeAndre Harris\u2019s lawyer, S. Lee Merritt, not Mr. Harris himself, who expressed disappointment that the authorities had not identified or arrested more suspects in the case.Advertisement"}

Seth Wispelwey of the local United Church of Christ. \u201cWhite supremacists rallying in our town is an act of violence.\u201dLate Friday night, several hundred torch-bearing men and women marched on the main quadrangle of the University of Virginia\u2019s grounds, shouting, \u201cYou will not replace us,\u201d and \u201cJew will not replace us.\u201d They walked around the Rotunda, the university\u2019s signature building, and to a statue of Thomas Jefferson, where a group of counterprotesters were gathered, and a brawl ensued. At least one person was led away in handcuffs by the police.\u201cI am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus,\u201d he added.City officials and the police said they were prepared for possible unrest; the Virginia National Guard put out a statement saying it would \u201cclosely monitor the situation.\u201d Mayor Mike Signer said in an interview on Friday that he had been consulting with fellow mayors, seeking advice on how to \u201cbe prepared to make sure people can assemble and express themselves freely.\u201dReligious leaders who are planning counterdemonstrations \u2014 including a sunrise prayer service featuring Cornel West, the Harvard professor and political activist \u2014 have been training in nonviolent protest.The University of Virginia Medical Center has canceled all elective surgery \u2014 standard procedure in preparation for events that could lead to mass casualties. Around town, some businesses plan to close.\u201cThis whole thing feels like the prep to a Wild West shootout where the businesses shutter and the women shoo their children upstairs,\u201d said Phillip Fassieux, 36, as he munched on an egg bagel at Bodo\u2019s, a few blocks from the Lee statue. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the wild, wild West. This is modern-day Charlottesville, where we\u2019re supposed to be better suited to engage with each other.\u201dWith the university, founded by Jefferson in 1819, as its centerpiece, Charlottesville is a politically progressive city; nearly 80 percent of voters here cast their ballots for Hillary Clinton in last year\u2019s presidential race.But it is also a city steeped in Southern history, one that still wrestles with the legacy of slavery. According to Jalane Schmidt, a professor of religious studies at the university, 52 percent of the residents of Charlottesville and surrounding Albemarle County \u2014 14,000 people in all \u2014 were enslaved during the Civil War. Jefferson, still revered here, was himself a slave owner.Today, African-Americans make up 19 percent of the city\u2019s population, and gentrification is pushing many of them out, Ms. Schmidt said. The fight over the Lee statue \u2014 in a downtown park that was called Lee Park until it was recently renamed Emancipation Park \u2014 has opened up old wounds and brought simmering tensions over race to the fore.Eugene Williams, 89, a former head of the local N.A.A.C.P., served sweet tea on the front porch of his house on Ridge Street one day this week and recalled the days when he was not allowed to dine at local restaurants. He favors keeping the Lee statue because he wants people to remember the Jim Crow era.\u201cThis statue has a lesson to teach us,\u201d he said.The debate over the statue began about a year and a half ago, when an African-American high school student here started a petition to have it removed. Wes Bellamy, the city\u2019s vice mayor and the only black member of the City Council, took up the cause, and the Council set up a commission. After public hearings, it recommended either that the statue be relocated to another park or that the city add historical context so that the monument could \u201ctransform in place.\u201dInstead, City Council members voted 3 to 2 in April to sell the statue. The next month, a judge issued an injunction, keeping the statue in place for six months.\u201cCharlottesville kind of made itself a target by deciding they wanted to remove this statue, and by stringing the whole thing out,\u201d said Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia law professor who is planning to give a talk on free speech Saturday as part of a \u201cday of reflective conversation\u201d organized by the university.Mr. Bellamy, 30, has himself become a target; he said in an interview that he has been receiving death threats. \u201cWhen you have a black, young African-American vice mayor, in their eyes, who was getting too big for his breeches, they want to send a message,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call me every kind of N-word you can think of.\u201dMr. Kessler, who organized the event on Saturday and calls himself a \u201cwhite advocate,\u201d said in an interview that his goal was to \u201cde-stigmatize white advocacy so that white people can stand up for their interests just like any other identity group.\u201dIn the run-up to Saturday, there has been confusion over where, precisely, the Unite the Right rally will take place. City officials denied Mr. Kessler\u2019s request to hold it in Emancipation Park, and instead granted a permit for a bigger park. On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Mr. Kessler, seeking to keep the demonstration at Emancipation Park.On Friday, a judge ruled in Mr. Kessler\u2019s favor.But if the city seems seized with anxiety, there is also a sense of determination.\u201cCharlottesville is mobilizing,\u201d said Mimi Arbeit, a community activist who is helping to organize counterdemonstrations. \u201cWe cannot allow the rise of white supremacy. Ignoring the Klan in the 1920s is precisely what allowed them to terrorize and murder black people in Charlottesville. We cannot allow that history to be repeated.\u201dHawes Spencer reported from Charlottesville, and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.Advertisement"}

In the Facebook post last month, he said that some foreign news outlets engaged in self-censorship when covering the prime minister because of the threat of legal action in Singapore.The dispute is the latest in a bitter family drama that has riveted the city-state and raised questions about the legacy of Mr. Lee, Singapore\u2019s first prime minister, and how the nation should be governed after 58 years of one-party rule.The government continues to monitor criticism, including comments from the prime minister\u2019s nephew at Harvard.Singapore\u2019s leaders have long turned to the courts to limit free speech by filing costly defamation lawsuits against citizens and international news outlets.A week later, the attorney general\u2019s office sent Mr. Li a strongly worded letter, signed by Francis Ng, a senior state counsel, saying the post was \u201can egregious and baseless attack on the Singapore judiciary and constitutes an offense of contempt of court.\u201dThe attorney general\u2019s office asked that Mr. Li \u201cpurge the contempt\u201d by deleting the post, sign the letter of apology and post it on his Facebook page.

Some of these treats are delicious, some are perfectly pleasant and many are achingly, inedibly sweet. Yet in a social-media-dominated world, the picture can be more satisfying than the dessert.\u201cA lot of the new little shops selling buns, fried chicken, bubble tea and shaved ice are in college towns,\u201d she said, beyond Asian-American enclaves where the shops are also thriving, like the San Gabriel Valley in Southern California, the Bay Area and New York City\u2019s three Chinatowns. Some are franchisees of Asian chains, but many belong to young entrepreneurs who smell opportunity in sugar and sprinkles.Mr. Lee said that in Seoul, where he lived until 2009, competition to come up with the next big treat is fierce: \u201cEvery summer, people are looking for something cold that\u2019s new.\u201dAsian diets were never completely dairy-free. In ancient times, the Korean royal household kept cows to supply milk for the court. Both meat and milk were scarce in Japan and China (and sometimes banned by Buddhist edict) but available to the wealthy for special dishes and medicinal purposes.Milk for mass consumption arrived with British colonizers, who took their addiction to milky tea and creamy custards to Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. In 1885, a determined doctor imported cattle to Hong Kong from his native Scotland and established a dairy farm to supply the island with fresh milk. (It\u2019s still standing.)But elaborate frozen desserts are nothing new in Asia: Fluffy shaved ice was first mentioned in Japanese literature about a thousand years ago. Even then, it was a summer treat flavored with different saps and syrups; later, it was scattered with toppings like red azuki beans, ripe fruit and sweet jellies made with agar, the natural gel harvested from algae. These originals are still popular, like the cendol served from roadside stands in Indonesia, fragrant with pandan and palm sugar.According to Daniel Gray, a Korean-American food-marketing consultant who lives in Seoul, these complex desserts match up with Asian culinary traditions, where texture can be as or more important than taste. (Bubble tea, with its pleasingly chewy balls of tapioca, is an excellent example.) Toppings like starchy mochi, slippery lychees and gummy bears are not only tasty and eye-catching, but they also provide the necessary riot of special effects.\u201cYou would never be served plain ice cream in a cup here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be too boring.\u201dThere is nothing especially Thai about ice cream rolls: The base is the same as countless other formulas, and a similar process is deployed at hundreds of Cold Stone Creameries.

{"Headline": "4,000 Kilometers, 10 Months: One Australian\u2019s March for Indigenous Rights", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPRINCES HIGHWAY, Australia \u2014 Clinton Pryor had already walked 4,780 kilometers, or nearly 3,000 miles, by the time I met up with him Thursday morning on a country road between Sydney and Melbourne.Mr. Pryor, an Aboriginal activist from Australia\u2019s west coast, was starting his 310th day on foot to protest the treatment of Indigenous Australians, and he seemed anxious to get going.He took a final drag off a cigarette.\u201cReady, guys?\u201d he said, looking toward his support crew \u2014 grandpas with long white beards, one driving a white station wagon barefoot, the other astride a bike.His girlfriend, Kerry-Lee Coulthard, who met Mr. Pryor when he passed through her hometown in central Australia, eyed the road ahead.\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for the grass-roots people,\u201d he said, about two kilometers into the walk. \u201cA lot of people are not being heard.\u201dMr. Pryor, 27, with a knee brace on one leg, said he started out his trek from Perth to Canberra to raise awareness about two specific issues: homelessness among Indigenous Australians, an issue he has experienced firsthand, and the forced closing of remote Aboriginal communities by the government, which he has been protesting since at least 2014.Over time, though, he said his mission has evolved to reflect what First Peoples have told him they were struggling with. Suicide. Poverty. Racist policing. Corruption. Lack of rights to land, lack of work, and perhaps most of all, Mr. Pryor says, lack of inclusion in decisions made by the government.\u201cThis is a civil rights movement,\u201d he says. \u201cThe power should be shared.\u201dHe talked about the importance of a treaty, which he says should have been signed 229 years ago when the first European settlers landed in Australia. He emphasized that services for Aboriginal communities, including access to water and education, needed to be expanded. And at times, he seemed frustrated with the whole idea of politics, declaring, \u201cWe just want things done right.\u201d\u201cAn all-or-nothing approach often results in nothing,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking that in 2017 you still have to be arguing that point \u2014 that we should actually be at the table when you\u2019re discussing our issues.\u201dMr. Pryor relies on other forms of encouragement.Just after noon, a man parked his truck across the road, ran to Mr. Pryor and handed him a few 20-dollar bills. \u201cDoing good, brother. You\u2019re making us all proud,\u201d he said before dashing away.When it started to rain a few minutes later, Noonie Raymond, a member of Mr. Pryor\u2019s support team, delivered large umbrellas, one for him, one for Ms. Coulthard.Mr. Raymond was on a mountain bike. Brett Burnell drove the station wagon, a 1999 Ford Falcon packed with supplies and signed by dozens of well-wishers during the journey.With their matching shirts and long, gray beards, Mr. Raymond and Mr. Burnell looked like brothers; they were hard to tell apart.Both men, longtime activists without Aboriginal roots said they joined Mr. Pryor to help right the wrongs of their country\u2019s past.\u201cWe\u2019re learning our history, which we weren\u2019t taught growing up,\u201d Mr. Raymond said.The challenges have varied. The Ford Falcon, bought for 1,300 Australian dollars ($1,030), was a replacement for a Mercedes van that Mr. Burnell started out with, but crashed after drifting asleep at the wheel. In the desert, Mr. Pryor said, they went two days without water, and at one point, Mr. Pryor\u2019s left leg swelled with fluid, forcing him to walk 50 kilometers in excruciating pain.One especially fortunate gift of lodging led to Mr. Pryor meeting Ms. Coulthard.Six months ago, he was staying in Port Augusta, a small city north of Adelaide, when he noticed a woman hanging laundry next door. It was Ms. Coulthard.\u201cHe must have been stalking me for 10 minutes,\u201d she said, her usual shyness giving way to humor. \u201cHe came up to me. Then we spent three hours talking.\u201dAsked what they talked about, she chuckled. \u201cHe asked about my dreams,\u201d she said.She told him how she\u2019d always hoped to help the homeless. She told him she\u2019d always hoped to visit Hawaii.Before long, Ms. Coulthard, 30, was traveling to see Mr. Pryor between long stretches of walking. She overcame her fear of flying. And he changed, too.\u201cI stopped drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cAll because of her.\u201dMr. Pryor\u2019s feet sometimes fall behind schedule.Admitting he was a bit slowed down by Ms. Coulthard, who doesn\u2019t usually join him, he jumped in a car just before 2 p.m. to drive to a march in Nowra. (His team marked where he\u2019d stopped so he could return and start again later.)At a riverside park, dozens of people gathered. Sausages cooked on a grill. A police officer with white face paint on his cheeks waved cars in as Paul Mcleod, 60, an elder whose mother was part of the Yuin nation, lit a ceremonial fire and performed a traditional dance.\u201cAll of our people walk with him, in the spirit, if not in the flesh,\u201d Mr. Mcleod told the crowd in English and in local languages. \u201cIt means a lot. To all of us.\u201dMr. Pryor, his face also painted, also spoke. He identified himself as a Wajuk, Balardung, Kija and a Yulparitja man from the West, and most of what he argued for sounded similar to what he\u2019d told me on the walk.But he also seemed to struggle with how to explain his purpose. At one point, he apologized for losing his train of thought. He said he was tired from walking.\u201cI\u2019ve been walking for 10 months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about telling everyone to get back up and keep fighting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Back-to-School Clothes, Back in the U.S.S.R.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesWhen summer winds down and my teenage daughter gets ready to start the new school year, she and I go through a ritual. I open her closet and take things out. She wrinkles her nose, rolls her eyes and ignores me, her eyes firmly glued to a screen. I pile clothes on her bed, taking them off hangers or rescuing them from drawers filled to such capacity that opening them is a challenge. She takes her eyes off Instagram for a moment, and says:\u201cMother, I don\u2019t want to go through this now. Can\u2019t we do it another day?\u201dI keep going.Eventually she sighs a great, big sigh, puts away her phone and joins me. The process of separating clothes into three piles begins. One for charity, another one for the local second-hand-sale Facebook group, and yet another for out-of-season storage (we live in Europe, where our closets are too small to hold several seasons worth of clothes). It\u2019ll take us a couple of hours to go through all of her stuff, but for me, it\u2019s not work. It\u2019s a welcome bonding experience that pulls my daughter away from her usual pursuits: maintaining her Snapchat streaks, talking with friends on WhatsApp and bingeing on recent Netflix releases.When I was a teenager, my mother and I also often bonded over clothes \u2014 but in a very different way.I grew up in Moscow in the Soviet era, and my peers and I despised the apparel churned out at the time by the planned Soviet economy. Constantly on the hunt for foreign-made clothes, we spared no time, effort or ingenuity to find a pair of pants, a dress or a blouse that didn\u2019t look as if it came off the conveyor belt in the textile center Ivanovo. We saved money to purchase them on the black market, begged to borrow them from classmates fortunate enough to have parents who traveled to Warsaw Pact countries, or \u2014 in my case \u2014 made them ourselves.In 1980s Moscow, the fashion magazine BurdaModen \u2014 a German monthly \u2014 was second only in popularity to bootlegged tapes of Vladimir Vysotsky, Russia\u2019s outspoken bard. Smuggled in by those lucky enough to travel abroad, each issue that made it behind the Iron Curtain created a fury of organizing activity in the Soviet workplace. At the Economic Institute where my mother worked on generating five-year plans and at the state gas company, Gazprom, where my father designed pipelines, a sheet of paper made the rounds as soon as the new issue of Burda came into someone\u2019s possession. By the end of the day that paper was full of names of co-workers desperate to borrow the magazine. With access to its pages limited to just a couple of days for each person on the list, we quickly replicated patterns that caught our eye and then passed it to the next fortunate soul.My mother and I pored over the magazine the very night she brought it home. We discussed silhouette lines, we considered the potential ease or difficulty of the job, and we estimated the availability of compatible cloth in the empty Soviet stores. In the end, with the decision made on what was to be my next skirt or my next pair of pants, I copied the patterns from Burda onto the old front pages of Moskovsky Komsomolets, the daily newspaper of Moscow\u2019s Komsomol chapter.My mother, meanwhile, scouted the city for fabric on her lunch breaks. If the magazine model wore plaid, she had to find plaid. If it was stripes, she looked for stripes. If polka-dot seemed in style, she crisscrossed the city searching for polka-dot. Occasionally someone would buy the same fabric for the same Burda pattern and later we\u2019d run into each other on the metro, dressed as if we had stood in the same queue at GUM, Moscow\u2019s central department store, to partake in a rare apparel shipment from one of our Eastern Bloc allies.Once my mother and I started each new sewing project, we worked on it for days, stealing an hour or two during the week from homework and housework and teaming up with my grandmother on the weekends. To the hum of the sewing machine and the squeak of our old scissors, I learned to spread the fabric flat on the kitchen table, pin the pattern to it and trace it with chalk. I practiced eyeballing a one-centimeter margin when cutting it out and I mastered threading and rethreading our clunky Tula, the Soviet-made sewing machine. Each fitting brought me closer to finishing a blouse meant for the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, to putting final touches on the sarafan destined for the spring dance, and to owning the pants I wore on my first date with a boy I liked.While we worked, we talked: about fashion, about school, about the demise of the latest Politburo leader, and about which banned samizdat book we were reading. We drank tea: sometimes with jam, conserved the summer before by my grandmother, and sometimes with my mother\u2019s famous sharlotka, or apple cake. When we finished a garment \u2014 several fittings and often weeks later \u2014 I ironed it and hung it in my closet along with our previous creations. Then I wore it day in and day out. There was no rule that stipulated a daily change of clothes in the Soviet Union. We didn\u2019t own enough garments to warrant that.It\u2019s now been over 30 years since I last traced a pattern or basted a seam. I no longer own a sewing machine and most of my clothes come off sale racks at the local Zara. When I want a skirt hemmed or a pair of pants taken in I go to a tailor. My only connection with needle and thread is an occasional sock that needs mending or a button that has to be reattached. Unfortunately my daughter doesn\u2019t even know how to do that. With cheap clothes readily available in our neighborhood, teaching her to make her own didn\u2019t seem essential. I never showed her how to sew.She knows how to shop, though. Every year she declares that she needs to overhaul her closet and disappears into Pull&Bear, her favorite store. There she assembles the styles she\u2019s seen and liked either on the streets of Madrid, on television or among her friends. Rather than planning each outfit, buying the fabric and stitching the garments, her new wardrobe quickly materializes in shopping bags. But the concept is the same: She cares about controlling the image she presents to the world just as I did at that age.She\u2019s excited about each new item, but clothes don\u2019t mean nearly as much to her as they did to me as a teenager.Yet they do their job: My daughter and I talk while we sort, and once every season I can count on her closet to guarantee some together time.Margarita Gokun Silver is a writer and an artist living in Madrid.Advertisement"}

Standing in line with her father, she was one of the few teenage girls at a Palace drop. Her tomboy style reminded me of 2000-era hip-hop, but with a subtle skater influence. Christoph was one of the elder statesmen of our shoot. I noticed him because he moved so fluidly through the Mercer Street crowd. A big fan of Raf Simons, he represented the ultimate evolution of the new geek style. His look was more sophisticated than most of the kids who stood on line, but it was still influenced by skateboard, sport and sneaker culture. The collective confidence and curation skills of these two boys showed in every piece of clothing: the brands they chose, the way their sneakers were tied, how their socks were worn. Ari Zamler, a self-described \u201chypebeast,\u201d was visiting from Detroit and celebrated his 12th birthday by standing in line for a Supreme drop. Kenyon Rezendes is a skater and BMX biker from New Bedford, Mass. What drew me to Nakassee was his \u201990s hip-hop-style fade. Jack, who was visiting from the Chicago area, was in SoHo at a Supreme release. The first things we noticed were his Air Jordan sneakers and Nike socks. I liked the contrast of his T-shirt logo and innocent face. There is a hint of a young Jay-Z in DaeSean. His look is a current take on \u201990s hip-hop fashion, but with the more fitted silhouette that has been adopted by African-American teenage boys. I really liked Sam\u2019s attitude. He put on retro Nirvana Kurt Cobain sunglasses that he had brought, but was mashed-up modern in his 2016 Kanye West Pablo hoodie.Mariachie was the leader of a group of teenagers from the High School of Sports Management in Brooklyn. Her ambiguous tomboy style was characteristic of the young women we saw in SoHo that day. Tylan, from Chicago, is a self-proclaimed fashion geek. His personal style was defined by his hoodie. Anthony was with friends who were visiting from Chicago. His sports jersey and Timberlands were emblematic of 2000-era hip-hop style. Anthony\u2019s ownership of the space he occupied drew us to him. Joshua, from Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., wore a Supreme Obama anorak while waiting in line outside the Palace store.We liked the subtleties of Gustavo\u2019s style: the rose detailing on his jeans and his choice of classic Old Skool Vans. The style of this group, also visiting from the High School of Sports Management, represents the confluence of 1990s- and 2000-era hip-hop. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Teaching Kids Coding, by the Book", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsOne sunny summer morning this month, a group of 20 teenage girls gathered in a conference room in the sleek offices of a tech company in Manhattan. It was their fifth week of coding camp, and they were huddled around laptops, brainstorming designs for their final projects. One group was building a computer game that simulates the experience of going through life with depression and anxiety, while others were drafting plans for websites that track diversity at companies and help connect newly arrived immigrants with local community groups.They were working intently when Reshma Saujani, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit organization Girls Who Code, dropped in to offer some encouragement.\u201cHow many of you take computer science class at your schools?\u201d she asked. Hands shot up. \u201cAre you the only girls in your class?\u201d she asked. Most of the girls nodded.Over the past five years, some 40,000 girls have learned to code through the organization\u2019s summer camps and afterschool programs. But Ms. Saujani wanted to expand the group\u2019s reach, and was looking for new ways to recruit girls into the tech industry.For a tech evangelist, her solution was surprisingly retro and analog: books. Girls Who Code is creating a publishing franchise, and plans to release 13 books over the next two years through a multibook deal with Penguin. The titles range from board books and picture books for babies and elementary school children, to nonfiction coding manuals, activity books and journals, and a series of novels featuring girl coders.This week, the organization is releasing its first two books \u2014 an illustrated nonfiction coding manual by Ms. Saujani, and a novel, \u201cThe Friendship Code,\u201d which features a group of girls who become friends in an after-school coding club.\u201cI wanted to create a series of books that girls could see themselves in, where you could sneak in the algorithms and you sneak in the coding,\u201d Ms. Saujani said.Lately, the niche has gotten considerably more crowded. A growing number of children\u2019s books authors are using fiction to teach the fundamentals of coding, a trend that has coincided with a push by Silicon Valley to fund and expand technology training in schools. The organization Code.org provides free online coding lessons, and has crafted coding curriculums for elementary, middle and high school students. Last year, Apple released a free app to teach the programming language Swift. Scratch Jr, a coding program designed for 4- to 7-year-olds, now has some five million users.Ms. Saujani\u2019s effort to counter the industry\u2019s gender imbalance, with coding clubs and now books, seems to have won over some major tech industry figures. Her new coding book features glowing endorsements from the philanthropist Melinda Gates; Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter; and Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg.The daughter of two engineers who came to the United States as political refugees from Uganda, Ms. Saujani is in some ways an unlikely advocate for computer literacy. Her academic and professional background is in law, history and politics, not technology. Before founding her coding organization, she worked as a lawyer for a hedge fund and ran for Congress in 2010. She lost, spectacularly, and decided to start a nonprofit to teach computer literacy to girls.Since its founding in 2012, the organization\u2019s coding clubs have rapidly spread across the country and now meet in 50 states. But demand has outstripped growth: 7,000 girls applied for 1,600 seats at the group\u2019s 80 summer camps.So in early 2015, to extend the group\u2019s reach, Ms. Saujani, who published a book for adults about women and leadership in 2013, went to her literary agent and proposed a series of children\u2019s books about coding. At the time, it seemed like an untapped market. Ms. Saujani met with several publishers, and was excited by Penguin\u2019s strategy of flooding every corner of the children\u2019s market, with board books like \u201cBaby Code!\u201d for 3- to 7-year-olds and novels for preteenage girls.Some tech experts say books could prove an effective way to recruit future coders, particularly girls, if the stories make programming seem creative and appealing. But others caution that books aren\u2019t a substitute for hand-on instruction. Josh Funk, a software engineer and the author of the picture book \u201cHow to Code a Sandcastle,\u201d which will be published next year as part of the Girls Who Code line, sees books as a way to get kids interested in the subject, not as a stand-in for coding classes. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn how to code by reading a picture book,\u201d he concedes.Some of the coding books for kids probably work better as gag gifts than as a training manual for mini Mark Zuckerbergs. John Vanden-Heuvel has created a lucrative subgenre in picture books with his series of coding books for babies, with titles like \u201cHTML for Babies,\u201d \u201cJavaScript for Babies,\u201d and \u201cCSS for Babies.\u201d Mr. Vanden-Heuvel, who created and self-published the books after his son was born sold some 100,000 copies on his own, then got a publishing deal with Sterling Children\u2019s. He later moved on to writing coding books for older kids, like \u201cC++ for Kids,\u201d which is aimed at 3- to 5-year-olds.Other authors are weaving coding concepts into the narratives of novels. In September, Disney Hyperion will publish Tamara Ireland Stone\u2019s middle grade novel, \u201cClick\u2019d,\u201d about a girl named Allie who builds an app that goes viral at her CodeGirls summer camp, then realizes a glitch could expose users\u2019 private data. (At the end of the book, Ms. Ireland includes exercises that explain how binary code and algorithms work.)\u201cI wanted to play with the similarities between magic and coding,\u201d said Mr. Yang, who taught computer programming at a high school in Oakland, Calif., for 17 years.Stacia Deutsch, who wrote \u201cThe Friendship Code\u201d series, had no background in coding when Penguin hired her to co-write the books in consultation with Ms. Saujani. So she went to afterschool coding workshops at schools around Orange County, Calif., where she lives, and studied the organization\u2019s teaching manual. Using their curriculum, she focused on a handful of programming concepts and integrated them into the plot.The novel centers on Lucy, who joins an after-school coding club and starts getting mysterious notes on her locker. To understand the messages, she has to master coding concepts like input/output, loops and variables.Ms. Deutsch struggled at times to get those ideas across. In moments of panic, she called a friend who is a coder for guidance. But in other ways, her status as a novice was an asset. Her characters didn\u2019t know much about coding at the beginning of the novel, and neither, she presumes, will many of her readers.\u201cI wanted someone who didn\u2019t know anything about coding to get excited about the possibilities,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a character in Tamara Ireland Stone\u2019s novel, \u201cClick\u2019d.\u201d She is Allie, not Alice.Advertisement"}

Their words were aimed at Jews as well as blacks.Neo-Nazis carried torches and chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d as they marched through the University of Virginia campus on Friday. And on Tuesday, Chris Cantwell, a white supremacist leader, told Vice News that he wanted a president who \u201cdoes not give his daughter to a Jew.\u201dIn his comments on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called the neo-Nazis at the protests \u201cbad people\u201d but defended many of those who came to the rally.\u201cIt looked like they had some rough, bad people, neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest and very legally protest.\u201dJewish supporters of Mr. Trump outside the administration also were largely quiet on Wednesday. Sheldon Adelson, the Jewish megadonor from Las Vegas, who was an avid supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, did not issue a statement.Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, who is Jewish, defended Mr. Trump in response to a reporter\u2019s question on Wednesday.\u201cI know President Trump and his heart,\u201d Mr. Cohen wrote. \u201cHe is a good man and doesn\u2019t have a racist bone in his body. All morning I am receiving horrific comments about being anti-black, racist, etc. for supporting Trump. It\u2019s just wrong!\u201dMr. Cohen emphatically denounced \u201cwhite supremacy, white nationalism, Nazi beliefs and hatred of anyone based on race, religion, creed, color or sexual orientation.\u201d But he added: \u201cTrump is not a racist and neither am I. The attacks against him and all of us who support him are disgusting, disgraceful and hurtful.\u201dSam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser who was fired after publishing racially charged Facebook posts, also came to the president\u2019s defense.\u201cI have spent thousands of hours with this man. He does not have one anti-Semitic bone in his body,\u201d Mr. Nunberg, who is Jewish, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Nunberg condemned the neo-Nazi protesters as \u201ca bunch of disgusting people. A bunch of people saying anti-Semitic stuff.\u201dHe added that he was disappointed with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Tuesday because they were open to interpretation and misunderstanding. He said Mr. Trump should have simply said that he stood by his previous comments about the protests.Mr. Nunberg said he did not believe Mr. Mnuchin or Mr. Cohn should make their views publicly known.\u201cIt\u2019s a no-win situation for them,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said. \u201cIf Mr. Mnuchin or Mr. Cohn issues a statement, then what? They are supposed to resign? They have a responsibility to carry out their jobs.\u201dRepresentative Lee Zeldin, a Jewish Republican from New York, came to the president\u2019s defense for noting that there was violence on both sides, though he added that \u201cthese two sides are not equal.

So is attempting to place it in a taxonomy, or to identify a precedent for what it does \u2014 in this case, conservative talk radio, whose power has been perilously underestimated for three decades. I received messages objecting to the article\u2019s political descriptions, which wasn\u2019t a surprise: Many such YouTubers self-identify with more granularity, as classical liberals or libertarians, as \u201cidentitarians,\u201d or as mere contrarians. There were people urging me not to give extreme politics a platform as others claimed these ideas were anything but.But reactions to the piece crystallized something else about the state of the media \u2014 all media \u2014 today. The most useful way to understand the disparity in responses inspired by the piece isn\u2019t to understand audiences as living on different parts of an ideological spectrum, or on a continuum of tech-savviness. Rather, I learned to understand where they were coming from in a much more literal sense. Media consumers\u2019 internet of 2017 is divided up among enormous, distinct and powerful platforms \u2014 Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc. And their experience of the broader media universe is informed by the contexts in which they spend the most time, or to which they feel allegiance.Those immersed in this subculture were, of course, skeptical and defensive, critical of what felt to them like a glancing take on their hometown, dismissing it as condescending or antagonistic. Other active YouTube users begged me to understand that the YouTube Right is not representative of their platform, and reasonably suggested that I had overstated their importance. A few more responded: \u201cWho?\u201dReaders from Twitter, where the YouTube Right maintains a visible secondary presence, were more receptive to the story\u2019s premises. To politically engaged Twitter users, the YouTube Right represents a powerful but remote, somewhat mysterious force. The story\u2019s subjects were more familiar to a typical Reddit user than to, for example, the average Facebook user. They\u2019re well-known objects of mockery on Tumblr, and something like mainstream figures on a site like 4chan.One user\u2019s home platform is another\u2019s foreign land. A point made by a subculture at home on Facebook might look funny to another on Twitter, which can read as evidence of a conspiracy to yet another on YouTube, which might be seen as offensive on Tumblr, which could be a joke on Reddit. One\u2019s sense of these things \u2014 whether a meme is funny, whether an argument is persuasive, whether a statement amounts to a threat \u2014 is informed not just by what the subculture stands for, but by which platform you use to make sense of the vast internet around you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heather Heyer, Charlottesville Victim, Cannot Be Silenced, Mother Says", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. \u2014 Heather D. Heyer, the woman run down during violent clashes here, was remembered on Wednesday for a quality that friends and relatives described as her most frustrating, and most admired \u2014 a passion for fighting injustice that was so relentless, it often spilled into her work and personal life.Hundreds of mourners packed a theater in downtown Charlottesville for her memorial service, wearing a sea of purple, her favorite color.Ms. Heyer, 32, had been among a crowd of counterprotesters who gathered on Saturday in opposition to a rally against the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee. That rally drew white supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members.They described her convictions as so intense that they prompted tearful outbursts at work, collapsed relationships and argumentative dinners at home, from which her father would occasionally escape to his car to play video games and avoid being lectured.But Ms. Heyer\u2019s convictions had penetrated the psyches of her occasionally ambivalent audience, and were celebrated on Wednesday by speaker after speaker.The message of the day was to stand up for what you believe in. And the most powerful moment came after Ms. Heyer\u2019s mother, Susan Bro, walked up a short staircase to the stage, pausing to brace herself on a railing and telling the audience that her fibromyalgia had worsened since her daughter\u2019s death. Any weakness seemed to leave her as she delivered her speech with an almost jarring degree of composure.Ms. Bro had decided, she said, to hold a public service to amplify her daughter\u2019s message of anti-discrimination. \u201cIf you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention,\u201d she said, quoting from a Facebook post by Ms. Heyer that has been shared more than 26,000 times.Ms. Bro called on the mourners, many of whom, she said, were probably caring and compassionate people, to take action on behalf of their values, as had her daughter, who worked as a waitress and a paralegal at a law firm, and had a high school education. She rallied the crowd and drew a standing ovation.\u201cThey tried to kill my child to shut her up,\u201d Ms. Bro called out. \u201cWell, guess what \u2014 you just magnified her.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not all about forgiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth is, we are going to have our differences, we are going to be angry with each other. But let\u2019s channel that anger not into hate.\u201dCo-workers told of occasionally finding Ms. Heyer in tears at her desk over injustice. Alfred A. Wilson, a manager at the law firm where she worked, said she had broken up with a boyfriend who questioned her for working for a black man. Mr. Wilson read letters from clients who said Ms. Heyer had helped them navigate financial strife without judgment.After the ceremony, Gov. Terry McAuliffe told reporters that Ms. Heyer should be \u201can inspiration to all of us \u2014 to do good, to put a hand out, to help one another.\u201dThe message seemed to take hold quickly among those in attendance. \u201cIt was really touching,\u201d said Theresa Buggs, 32, of Charlottesville. \u201cI just hope as I get older I\u2019ll be more like Heather.\u201dFlowers and sympathetic messages continued to accumulate at the corner of Fourth and Water Streets, where Ms. Heyer was struck. Paul Hurdle, 40, a marcher who witnessed what happened on Saturday, returned for the first time Wednesday morning.\u201cIt was an act of terrorism,\u201d Mr. Hurdle said. They say that terrorism is \u201cmeant to strike fear in the populace, and I understand that now.\u201d\u201cPart of me is afraid,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to let that govern me.\u201dAs for Ms. Heyer, \u201cshe stood up for what she knew was right,\u201d Mr. Hurdle said.Hawes Spencer reported from Charlottesville, and Caitlin Dickerson from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

The focus is on her eyes, specifically her eyelashes, which at first appear ordinary and untouched \u2014 a stark contrast from a picture taken weeks later, when they look long and thick. Mascara magnifies the effect in another snapshot.Reach out, the captions enthuse, if you want in!Such pictures have increasingly populated social media this year from women selling an eyelash enhancing serum from Rodan & Fields, a skin care company that distributes most of its products through independent \u201cconsultants.\u201d One might expect the average woman to be skeptical about the idea of applying a little-known liquid to her eyelids every night in hopes of longer lashes a month later, especially without a prescription. It is the kind of thing that, if seen on a television infomercial, might be skipped without a second thought.But fueled by social media testimonials and a robust direct selling force, the serum, Lash Boost, briefly sold out this summer and the company said that sales of the product \u2014 which costs up to $150 \u2014 should top $175 million in its first year.\u201cOur business is really based on the visible results of the products that we sell,\u201d said Lynn Emmolo, chief brand officer of Rodan & Fields. \u201cThe consultant connection to their friends and the visible results \u2014 that\u2019s where the magic happens.\u201dDr. Amy Newburger, a dermatologist who advised the Food and Drug Administration on a variety of products for more than a decade, said Lash Boost was similar to a slate of other enhancers that emerged after Latisse was introduced, which contain cosmetic, over-the-counter versions of the drug\u2019s active ingredient.Based on its chemical makeup, it\u2019s \u201cnot unique by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is very effective is they have excellent marketing.\u201d Dr. Newburger added that such products can have a visible effect on lashes and eyebrows, but that she considers them \u201cuncharted territory\u201d because of the proprietary formulations each brand creates to achieve the results and the limited testing performed on cosmetics more generally.Because Lash Boost is a cosmetic and not a drug, the company is careful to avoid saying that it causes lashes to grow. Instead, it uses language centered around appearance, promising \u201cfuller-looking\u201d and \u201clonger-looking\u201d lashes. Consultants for Rodan & Fields are given dos and don\u2019ts for their social media posts that advise them on lighting, as well as examples of compliant language (\u201cI have noticed longer-looking lashes\u201d) and noncompliant phrasing (\u201cMy lashes are longer\u201d).Lesley Russo, of Raleigh, N.C., who started selling the company\u2019s products about two years ago, said she had seen an especially enthusiastic response with the lashes on Facebook.\u201cIt grabs people\u2019s attention more because the eyes are front and center,\u201d she said. Ms. Russo said that she liked working with Rodan & Fields partly because it was not a party-based business and she can sell the product using social media and email outreach conducted from her couch. (Some people involved in direct selling still go the tried-and-true route and set up parties where they demonstrate their products.)Ms. Russo said many women use Facebook to hold \u201conline parties,\u201d where they will invite people to a page at a specific day and time, and then post about the products. Sometimes, they will also incorporate live video, she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s great because you can reach people all over the country.\u201d\u201cHonestly, the two of us are sick of getting all this information from friends we haven\u2019t heard from in years, where all they\u2019re interested in is making money off of us,\u201d said Michelle Fortin, one half of the duo. Still, she said, \u201cthe before and after pictures are definitely eye-catching.\u201dIn fact, Fortin said, her comedy partner had just bought Lash Boost and believed it was working.Advertisement"}

The role of fathers, father figures, and other adult male role models \u2014 including coaches, teachers and school administrators \u2014 can be crucially important in counteracting media and other cultural messages, said Kevin Kruger, president of NASPA, the national association for student affairs administrators at colleges and universities.Social media is part of both the problem and the solution.Photos, messages and videos sent via Snapchat, Facebook messenger and other popular apps now regularly expose incriminating behavior and help put bro culture on notice. But social media can also feed the growth of bro culture, because communicating through a screen can make interactions \u2014 such as adolescents and teenagers pressuring one another to send nudes, sharing private photos and messages \u2014 seem more transactional than real-life relationships and thwart social and emotional growth.Programs that work to promote healthy sexuality, communication, consent and responsibility are crucial because even students who want to talk about relationships and sex might not know how.The program works with students to shift responsibility from victims to bystanders. Teaching young people that members of a community look out for one another may help reduce the spread of bro culture.Years of working with teenagers and young adults has taught me that bro culture develops out of a social and emotional insecurity that uses a group dynamic as a safety blanket and excessive drinking and partying as a shield.\u201cWhen you have young athletes who at very young ages are identified as special, as unique, as having a particular kind of talent that very few people have access to,\u201d said Mark Anthony Neal, professor and founding director of the Center for Arts, Digital Culture and Entrepreneurship at Duke University. \u201cThey are granted a certain level of entitlement because of that \u2014 what kinds of classes they get to miss, what kind of opportunities to travel they get \u2014 all of this gets embodied into this notion of bro culture.\u201dEducators trying to counteract it can start by giving all students more opportunities to openly discuss and reflect on cultural norms. For high school and college students, that might also mean finding subtle ways to encourage students \u2014 young men and women \u2014 to improve empathetic communication through face-to-face conversations free from technological distractions.Kerry Cronin, a philosophy and theology professor at Boston College, said: \u201cParents and educators have no clue what\u2019s going on,\u201d as far as \u201cthe extent of bro culture and the coarseness of it.\u201dIn follow-up class discussions and reflection papers, Dr. Cronin\u2019s students often reveal how much they genuinely enjoyed the experience, despite any initial awkwardness or hesitation, and also admit they likely would have never gone on such a date otherwise.Dr. Cronin says students are often searching for permission and guidance on how to interrupt \u201cthe social script they take as given.\u201d Understanding that, she said, is the key to disrupting bro culture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Snap Stumbles Through Another Disappointing Quarter", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe technology world is scrutinizing Snap as an indicator of whether smaller social media companies can compete with behemoths like Facebook. And Wall Street is using Snap to gauge whether investors will embrace other unprofitable tech companies if they go public.Snap will soon face a make-or-break year, said Norm Johnston, the chief strategy officer at Mindshare, a global media agency. \u201cEither it will realize its full potential by delivering growth in daily users, or it will end up as the next Twitter,\u201d the social media service that has been grappling with stalled growth, he said.On Thursday, Snap did little to change its trajectory when it reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street projections. The company reported a loss of 36 cents a share, versus estimates of a 33-cent loss. Revenue rose to $181.7 million, versus expectations for $185.8 million. The company recorded a wider quarterly loss than a year ago of $443.1 million, up from $115.9 million.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working closely with our advertisers to improve our offerings and become a more integral part of their strategy,\u201d said Imran Khan, the chief strategy officer at Snap. He said that existing customers were also spending more money with the company.For Snap, there have long been signs that it would face bumps as a public company. Before its I.P.O., the company said it was losing money and made no guarantee that those losses would subside. Snap also said that its user growth rate was slowing and that it did not have a firm international expansion plan.\u201cSnap was massively overvalued because, as a private company, it could set a valuation based on the opportunity for growth,\u201d said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group.Mr. Spiegel said during a call with analysts that neither he nor Mr. Murphy would sell their stock this year. \u201cWe believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said.For a few months, Snap\u2019s stock stayed above its I.P.O. price. But investor doubts began to set in as Snap\u2019s user growth continued to slow, especially as rivals like Instagram began copying innovative features that once set Snapchat apart, including augmented reality images and disappearing content.More alarmingly, concern over Snap\u2019s advertising business started to rise. Some brands are beginning to question whether Snapchat is a niche product, like Twitter, or an essential piece of their digital marketing strategy, like Facebook or Google, said several advertising buyers.Last month, Morgan Stanley, which helped underwrite Snap\u2019s I.P.O., issued a report on the company that questioned the measurement tools that Snap makes for advertisers. These tools are regarded as subpar compared with the ones offered by Facebook, which is important because the tools help brands determine whether an ad was effective.Snap has introduced new tools for advertisers this year to make it easier to buy and manage ads on Snapchat. It also teamed with companies that can help measure and predict the effectiveness of specific marketing tactics on Snapchat. Snap now measures whether customers shop in stores after they see ads and in June, it confirmed it acquired a start-up called Placed that tracks retail foot traffic.\u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by the early performance of our self-service platform, which makes it easy for advertisers of all sizes to reach our unique audience,\u201d said Mr. Khan. On a call with analysts, he said that 60 percent of all Snap ad impressions were now delivered through those tools.Mr. Spiegel has long maintained that the amount of time that users spend in Snapchat makes it unique. The average user spends more than 30 minutes a day in the app. And in the most recent quarter, users under the age of 25, a demographic that advertisers covet, are spending more than 40 minutes a day in the app.He told analysts that it could become less costly to advertise on Snapchat, a platform that has been notoriously expensive. \u201cLower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said, and the change could get more advertisers to learn how to use Snap.Price has been one of several barriers that have made it hard for marketers to make a significant investment in Snapchat, said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of the ad agency 360i. \u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re dropping prices,\u201d she said. \u201cNow marketers will need Snap to help them measure the performance of their ads.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Wall Street estimate for Snap\u2019s earnings. The estimate was 33 cents a share, not 15 cents a share.Advertisement"}

Last semester was a stormy one for the Claremont Colleges, a consortium of seven elite institutions in suburban Los Angeles.By then, students were already well practiced in making their demands known.The previous month, a call-out painted in looping yellow letters on a Pitzer College \u201cfree speech wall\u201d against cultural appropriation \u2014 \u201cWhite Girl, Take OFF your hoops!!!\u201d \u2014 had escalated into widespread criticism of the wall painters.Campuses that have prided themselves on increased diversity in admissions are now wrestling with students who want more control over the institutions they attend, including a say in hiring (even of visiting professors), housing (a theme house at the University of California, Santa Cruz, must be painted in Pan-African colors) and curriculum (among nearly 50 demands presented to the University of Chicago: the creation of courses on the Islamic golden age, sequences on Caribbean and Southeast Asian civilizations, and a required diversity/inclusion course).All this might remind old-timers of calls in the late 1960s and \u201970s to institutionalize a more diverse viewpoint, leading to the establishment of black studies departments. Ralph F. Young, a historian who runs weekly \u201cDissent in America Teach-ins\u201d at Temple University, predicts that \u201cwe will have the 1960s all over again.\u201d But where that era\u2019s activists focused on a few issues, he said, \u201cnow it is about everything \u2014 everything is under attack.\u201dStudents are demanding official recognition of their identities, whether racial, ethnic, sexual, religious, first-generation, low-income or immigrant. When freshmen step onto campus, they aren\u2019t necessarily assuming the mascot and identity of their future alma mater, said Dwaine Plaza, a sociology professor at Oregon State University. \u201cO.S.U. is not what students are now embracing\u201d; instead they are \u201cseeing themselves as important being Jamaican-American, as being Indian-American.\u201dDr. Plaza, who taught a course last winter called \u201cAfrican-American Resistance in the Era of Donald Trump,\u201d sees that embrace as recognition that \u201cno matter how hard they try \u2014 yes, they can go to Costco and buy a house in your neighborhood \u2014 they still feel like a perennial outsider even if they wear a baseball cap and eat a hot dog.\u201d The new tone, he said, reflects \u201cthe consciousness raising that has taken place on campuses \u2014 it is O.K. to be different.\u201d And the Trump modus operandi of singling out particular identity groups has fed a sense of vulnerability and urgency.Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Vides, president of the Associated Students of Pomona College, does not appreciate the way institutions treat diversity. \u201cWe sprinkle a little bit of color on the top of an institution like icing but we don\u2019t look underneath where there is not enough faculty that understands the experiences the students are bringing in \u2014 that is a problem.\u201d Nationally, blacks and Hispanics made up just under 10 percent of full-time college faculty in fall 2015, according to federal data that also show nearly 30 percent of students from those backgrounds.\u201cIt is not just about admitting students, but supporting them,\u201d Ms. Vides said. Students want to \u201cmake sure that academic departments, academic and health resources, career resources reflect our needs and our histories.\u201dDr. Oxtoby sees a generation of socially connected students for whom the personal becomes political: \u201cIf something happens to someone I know, I want to show my solidarity.\u201d On campus, he said, students demand that leaders \u201cappreciate me for all the dimensions of my identity.\u201dLast academic year he met with 10 student groups. \u201cEach wanted a center, a room, staff.\u201d One student came twice. \u201cIn one meeting they wanted to talk about their identity as a queer student and in another their identity as a Latino student.\u201dMany professors are spending the summer trying to figure out how to discuss the campus climate in class without raising the ire of this audience. In the last few months, at least a half-dozen professors have been threatened or fired for airing controversial positions on issues of color or, in the case of Dr. Goffman at Pomona, researching the subject.That can play out in every aspect of student life, as William Gu, an Asian-American who writes for The Claremont Independent, found out after some of his articles showed up on conservative news sites. He received Facebook messages accusing him of \u201cthreatening marginalized communities\u201d and was told at a party that \u201cpeople are uncomfortable with you being here, please leave.\u201dMr. Gu, a sophomore, said each incoming class \u201cis getting progressively more radical.\u201d He recalled a panel discussion during orientation at which a student said, \u201cWe should burn down Pomona\u201d because \u201celite colleges represented white supremacist patriarchy.\u201d Mr. Gu found the idea absurd. \u201cYou are going to a $60,000-a-year school and you\u2019re either there because your parents are wealthy or the school has given you a full ride and you are saying it\u2019s a dangerous environment for you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a strange sense of entitlement.\u201dIt can be hard to separate intense advocacy from intolerance, particularly for students who, Dr. Plaza said, arrive \u201cempowered to feel they should have their say.\u201dHow equipped are colleges and faculty to address all these student demands?Some faculty members \u201cwant to hold onto curriculum and don\u2019t want to do the work.\u201d But, Dr. Plaza said, \u201cwe have to step up our game.

{"Headline": "The Alt-Right Finds a New Enemy in Silicon Valley", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftBut for the alt-right, the battle was just beginning.For alt-right activists, who occupy the rightmost flanks of a powerful conservative internet subculture, Google\u2019s response to Mr. Damore\u2019s memo was low-hanging fruit for mockery. But there is another reason that the alt-right\u2019s opposition campaign appeared so quickly, with such well-practiced maneuvers.For the last several months, far-right activists have mounted an aggressive political campaign against some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest players. Extending their attacks beyond social networks like Facebook and Twitter, tech\u2019s typical free-speech battlegrounds, they have accused a long list of companies, including Airbnb, PayPal and Patreon, of censoring right-wing views, and have pledged to expose Silicon Valley for what they say is a pervasive, industrywide liberal bias.Complaints like these might once have been easily dismissed. But in the Trump era, as the right wing\u2019s internet warriors have refined their tactics and gained legitimate political influence, they are putting Silicon Valley in an uncomfortable position.\u201cWe\u2019re just doing what the left has done for a while,\u201d Mr. Cernovich told me. \u201cYou use activist tactics to apply pressure to corporations, and the corporations respond.\u201dIt\u2019s a tech company\u2019s right, of course, to bar whomever it wishes. The First Amendment, often cited by right-wing activists as a bulwark against censorship, does not apply to the activities of companies, and tech companies almost always have terms in the fine print that give them the right to cut off access to users for any reason.But the latest wave of right-wing activism has still forced the hands of large Silicon Valley companies, many of which have tried to avoid the appearance of partisanship even as they promote progressive values.There is a certain poetic justice in the alt-right, largely an internet-based political movement, turning against the companies that enabled it in the first place. Like most modern political movements, the alt-right relies on tech platforms like YouTube and Twitter to rally supporters, collect donations and organize gatherings. In that sense, Silicon Valley progressivism isn\u2019t just an ideological offense to the alt-right \u2014 it\u2019s an operational threat.These companies are still tiny by Silicon Valley standards, but their supporters say that one day they could serve as the foundation for a kind of parallel right-wing internet where all speech is allowed, no matter how noxious or incendiary.It\u2019s unlikely that any alt-right protest will make a dent in the bottom lines of multibillion-dollar Silicon Valley behemoths. But by forcing these companies to take sides in an emerging culture war, these activists have already achieved a kind of perverse goal. They have found a new punching bag, and they have proved that in the hyper-polarized Trump era, there is no such thing as neutrality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Memewear", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationA few weeks ago, I took my sister and her friend to the Strand, Manhattan\u2019s mecca of used books and savvily branded accessories. Her friend Shar, staggered by her first trip to New York, was running her finger down a \u2018\u2018Nevertheless, She Persisted\u2019\u2019 pencil pouch, considering it as a souvenir. If she didn\u2019t want the sentiment on a pouch, she could have it as a tote or a T-shirt; she could even, as the Strand suggests, \u2018\u2018keep persisting from your head to your toes!\u2019\u2019 with a pair of blue knee-high socks.\u2018\u2018Eh, I wouldn\u2019t,\u2019\u2019 my sister said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s so new. We don\u2019t know if it has staying power.\u2019\u2019These objects are an example of \u2018\u2018memewear\u2019\u2019: the tangible detritus of a very popular, very temporary joke. Consider the face of the world-weary scholar whose BBC interview on South Korean politics was interrupted by his toddler lunging into the room. Now consider that face on a softball tee. A meme is intended to be seen only through glass: thumbed past on a Facebook feed, endlessly retooled in Reddit threads, batted across Twitter like a cat\u2019s feather toy, its own form of visual punctuation. When you first see it become physical, it feels like a hallucination, the stuff of your insomniac scrollings made manifest in the mundane world. Then comes a glorious shock of recognition, almost a thrill of the illicit: Should this be happening?You can break memewear down into categories. There\u2019s whimsically offensive: the Bed Intruder Halloween costume, which calls back to a man who found brief viral fame after his local news segment on a botched home invasion was set to music, consists of a wig and a do-rag in a box. There are animals on totes: lolcats requesting cheezburger or riding tacos through a cosmic backdrop, honey badgers refusing to tolerate your nonsense, the awed-looking shiba inu, known simply as the doge. (\u2018\u2018Wow,\u2019\u2019 one shirt reads, in the doge\u2019s distinctive Comic Sans patois. \u2018\u2018Very style. So shirt.\u2019\u2019) These are all classic memes, clever but innocent, like a smart-alecky fourth grader. Made by thousands of independent producers, distributed on Etsy and CafePress and Redbubble or mocked up by hand, memewear is for the Everyman.Memewear has its roots in fandom, though it\u2019s a limited precedent. In the 1960s, Andy Warhol played with the sheer ubiquity of pop-culture icons, retooling famous faces in lavender and yellow and silk-screening them on canvas. His waggish reconfigurations laid the groundwork for the self-diminishing T-shirts of the 1980s, with their stoned borrowings from television catchphrases and kitschy advertisements (\u2018\u2018Where\u2019s the beef?\u2019\u2019) that lost their tang by the early 1990s.At its most pure, fandom is an expression of mass enthusiasm. But memewear is about mass awareness, a completely democratic form of snobbery. Just as an NPR tote can occasionally be less about showing support for \u2018\u2018All Things Considered\u2019\u2019 than for the idea of news literacy, memewear establishes an in-group of the well-informed. It is a nod made flesh.Fashion\u2019s value is pinned to its materials. So what is memewear worth? If rare or labor-intensive materials like gold or silk are valuable and common ones like rayon and nylon are less so, what to make of a shirt spun of ubiquity? How do you appraise a dress made not of cotton but of pure recognition? You may as well try to market the air. A lolcat sweater is not meant for passing on, having none of the staying power my sister craved. Its magic lies in its complete disposability. It\u2019s a souvenir from time spent in an invisible world: I spent hours roaming the nether regions of Tumblr and all I got was this lousy hat.Unlike tchotchkes, collectibles and kitsch, memewear is not memorabilia: It accrues no value. Memewear, like a new car, starts leaking value as soon as it\u2019s off the lot. It is inherently ephemeral, but it is, crucially, less ephemeral than the images it pays tribute to. A \u2018\u2018Covfefe\u2019\u2019 tee (and inevitably, a \u2018\u2018Nevertheless, She Covfefed\u2019\u2019 tee) makes the internet real, gives it substance and shape. It lets our thoughts wear clothes. In blending the material world with the web, memewear proposes a compromise between what\u2019s stable and what\u2019s fluid. Fashion is written text, laid down in lace and aglets. The internet \u2014 your Twitter feed, your Amazon-recommended purchases, the Wikipedia page on Nicole Kidman\u2019s musical career \u2014 is a conversation, vanishing even as we have it. Memewear is an oral-history project, recording our community\u2019s customs before they can disappear.For me, memewear remains purely aspirational. I dress in neutral tones and generous plaids. I am afraid to wear colorful jeans. But I want to be bold enough to wear something that will be ridiculous in five months, if it isn\u2019t ridiculous already. Memewear may be more temporary than a tattoo, but it still functions as a statement of purpose, even if that statement is a rhinestone-studded \u2018\u2018meh.\u2019\u2019The \u2018\u2018Nevertheless, She Persisted\u2019\u2019 pencil pouch my sister rejected was the best possible option, a contradictory statement of purpose. It doesn\u2019t persist; that\u2019s the point. The \u2018\u2018Make America Read Again\u2019\u2019 hats in the gift section of the Strand now sit on the racks like deflated party balloons. In a bitter season in which we\u2019ve been forced to admit we don\u2019t share the same facts anymore, let alone the same cultural icons or values, memewear provides a modest acknowledgment of shared conditions, eliciting an all-too-rare murmur of recognition. It teaches us to accept that this moment, too, will pass.Jamie Fisher is a freelance writer and book reviewer. She is writing a novel set in postwar Italy.Advertisement"}

Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.With the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.That budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201dMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.It is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.But as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.And while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.It has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.Unlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.YouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.Although Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine. Originally, YouTube and its subscription YouTube Red channel were largely focused on creating bigger budget shows for YouTube stars.Data searches, Mr. Kyncl said, provided a \u201cwindow into the demand of Hollywood product on YouTube.\u201d\u201cWhy not fulfill this demand?\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes absolute sense.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Shifts From Paying Outside Lawyers by the Hour", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompanies have long chafed at law firms\u2019 practice of billing by the hour.Now, a huge corporation, Microsoft, is taking steps to move away from the traditional billing arrangement.David Howard, Microsoft\u2019s deputy general counsel, said that under a program begun last month, the software giant planned to rely much more heavily on alternative fee arrangements.Microsoft is aiming to move 90 percent of the company\u2019s legal work to such arrangements within two years, he said in a phone interview this week.The company\u2019s legal department has been examining its relationships with law firms over the past year, said Mr. Howard, who oversees litigation for Microsoft, an area in which expenditures are several hundred million dollars a year.The company\u2019s review, he said, found that it \u201cwould benefit from moving further away from a transactional model to one that encouraged deeper engagement between our lawyers and key trusted advisers.\u201dAs a result, \u201cwe\u2019ll do more work with firms on a retainer basis,\u201d he said, an approach that will \u201cembed our firms much more deeply in our work.\u201dHe emphasized that the move was less about saving money than it was about deepening relationships between Microsoft and the law firms that execute its legal strategy.\u201cWe want to create a situation that encourages our lawyers to be able to pick up the phone \u2014 without going through bureaucracy or worry about how to pay for it \u2014 and talk to the law firm about whatever is needed,\u201d he said. \u201cA firm usually handles a case, then you don\u2019t hear from them about legal developments in an area of concern, and we want to change that.\u201dThe change in Microsoft\u2019s relationship with its law firms could help spur more companies to abandon the billable hour method of charging for legal services.Corporations have been grumbling about billable hours for nearly a decade, with complaints rising after the 2008 financial crisis prompted cuts in legal budgets.Companies began hiring more in-house lawyers, reducing costs by handling more routine legal work themselves rather than assigning it to outside counsel.Most corporations have remained willing to pay for seasoned lawyers to resolve high-stakes legal matters, but they have been increasingly reluctant to subsidize additional costs like training entry-level lawyers. As demand for law firm services has decreased in recent years, firms have been more willing to agree to alternative arrangements like fixed fees to handle legal matters. Corporations have pushed this approach because it gives more certainty to their annual legal expenditures.The firms that will be part of Microsoft\u2019s revised program are Arent Fox; Covington & Burling; Davis Wright Tremaine; Fish & Richardson; Greenberg Traurig; K & L Gates; Latham & Watkins; Merchant & Gould; Orrick; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Perkins Coie; Sidley Austin; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Mr. Howard also said Microsoft planned to work more closely with law firms on diversity, which its legal department, along with those of companies like Facebook, has increasingly emphasized as a way to encourage firms to employ a broader variety of lawyers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Solution to Hackers? More Hackers", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf there\u2019s a single lesson Americans have learned from the events of the past year, it might be this: Hackers are dangerous people. They interfere in our elections, bring giant corporations to their knees, and steal passwords and credit card numbers by the truckload. They ignore boundaries. They delight in creating chaos.But what if that\u2019s the wrong narrative? What if we\u2019re ignoring a different group of hackers who aren\u2019t lawless renegades, who are in fact patriotic, public-spirited Americans who want to use their technical skills to protect our country from cyberattacks, but are being held back by outdated rules and overly protective institutions?In other words: What if the problem we face is not too many bad hackers, but too few good ones?The topic of ethical hacking was on everyone\u2019s mind at Def Con, the hacker convention last week in Las Vegas. It\u2019s the security community\u2019s annual gathering, where thousands of hackers gathered to show their latest exploits, discuss new security research and swap cyberwar stories. Many of the hackers I spoke to were gravely concerned about Russia\u2019s wide-ranging interference in last year\u2019s election. They wanted to know: How can we stop attacks like these in the future?Partly, that\u2019s because private sector jobs tend to pay more. But it\u2019s also because the government can be an inhospitable place for a hacker. Talented hackers can be disqualified for government jobs by strict background checks, and dissuaded by hiring processes that favor candidates with more formal credentials. At Def Con, I heard stories about hackers who had interviewed for government security jobs only to be turned away because they\u2019d smoked pot as a teenager, or violated copyright law by jail-breaking their video game console.These rules may keep a few bad apples away from critical government systems, but they also prevent many talented hackers from contributing. At Def Con, I spoke with Sean Kanuck, a former C.I.A. intelligence analyst who served as the federal government\u2019s national intelligence officer for cyberissues from 2011 to 2016. He said that hackers could be enormously valuable, if they were properly enlisted in the fight against attacks.\u201cThese people may be all hackers, and they may occasionally break the law, but they all still want the banking system to work,\u201d Mr. Kanuck said. \u201cAll of them, if they end up in a hospital room, they want the infusion pump working. There\u2019s common ground. And the knowledge here is incredible.\u201dThe private sector has already discovered the benefits of hackers. Most major tech companies \u2014 including Facebook, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 offer \u201cbug bounty\u201d programs, in which they offer financial rewards to hackers who find holes in their security measures. These companies know that paying hackers up front for their expertise is significantly cheaper than cleaning up after a breach, and they understand that the risk of a hacker going rogue inside their systems is outweighed by the benefits of having well-trained experts catch bugs and vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.The most talked-about session at this year\u2019s Def Con was when hackers were let loose on a series of computerized voting machines. These machines had been used in recent American elections, and most ran on comically outdated software. Hackers eventually broke into every machine and were able to manipulate the software to register fake ballots and change vote totals. (One enterprising hacker even rigged a voting machine to play the music video for Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d)There is, of course, the problem of outdated software. But some of the world\u2019s best security researchers have also been prohibited from poking and prodding at these machines by a thicket of copyright and anti-tampering laws. (The reason Def Con was able to test them at all is a 2015 exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that gave researchers a temporary pass to experiment on voting machines.) Now that white-hat hackers have found flaws in these machines, they can pass that knowledge on to the manufacturers and election officials, who can secure the machines ahead of the next election cycle.Hackers, it turns out, respond to incentives. But current laws don\u2019t allow hackers to test critical government systems outside of official agency-sponsored programs. As a result, we\u2019re missing out on important advice.Not all hackers are so helpful. But many are, and we should take advantage of their willingness to help secure our national infrastructure. Maybe federal workers should be subjected to a simulated hack before being allowed to access sensitive information. Or perhaps the government could create a white list of approved security researchers with a track record of ethical hacking, who would be given legal immunity for their work. Private sector companies have figured out how to bring in outside security expertise carefully, without creating a hacker free-for-all, and the government can, too.Spending a weekend at Def Con is a good way to learn how many dangers lurk in the digital world. (It wasn\u2019t just voting machines, hackers also demonstrated hacks on cars, kitchen appliances and all manner of other connected devices.) It\u2019s also a way to appreciate how necessary ethical hackers are to a modern democracy, especially one that is under siege from foreign online attackers.To paraphrase an organization with close ties to the government: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a hack is a good guy with a hack.Advertisement"}

The new money will go to redesigning the site and creating a better mobile version, in the mold of more modern services \u2014 it will look like Facebook or Twitter, per Recode, the technology site. This sounds smart, but entrenched communities tend to hate change, so we\u2019ll see what Reddit\u2019s hordes have to say about this.I can\u2019t imagine what I\u2019d do with a virtual assistant, though perhaps it would help me remember to pay rent on time, which I am constitutionally incapable of doing. In any case, I\u2019m curious to see how Facebook decides to use the tech. Perhaps they\u2019ll incorporate it into Messenger, the chat app that was playing around with its own virtual assistant ideas.I thought it was crazy and something I\u2019d never use, but a lot of folks on Twitter told me it\u2019s absolutely perfect for older people like their grandparents, who love to use video chat to keep in touch with family. Maybe I\u2019m wrong? Maybe I\u2019m just too young and cool to understand? Help me, Farhad.That\u2019s not good! But I can stomach it as long as they don\u2019t start leaking \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d spoilers all over the place.Do you have any Bitcoin, Farhad? Or perhaps now some Bitcoin Cash?The caveats: This all happened last year, and Snap said the rumors were false (though there may have been \u201cinformal\u201d talks, according to B.I.). It may not have been a real serious possibility, and often when rumors like these get floated, it stems from folks who have quite a vested interest in making an acquisition actually happen.Advertisers are noticing. I keep hearing chatter about ad budgets being moved from Snapchat over to Instagram, which offers a nearly identical product but with better advertising technology and a much larger base of users. If you\u2019re an ad exec looking to spend dollars on digital ads aimed at youngsters, it seems like kind of an easy choice.So perhaps a bailout acquisition by Google would actually make a modicum of sense. Think back to when Facebook bought Instagram. Mark Zuckerberg basically said, \u201ckeep doing what you\u2019re doing\u201d to Instagram, and acted to help supplement Instagram\u2019s growth only by providing some of Facebook\u2019s strongest assets. Facebook is sitting on a mountain of sophisticated ad technology, not to mention hundreds of thousands of eager advertisers looking for more space to buy ads.I could see Google and Snap in a similar situation, especially since Snap is actively in the market to improve its advertising technology through a potential acquisition or two, as we\u2019ve heard rumors of over the past few months. Selling out seems like a no-brainer to me, even if it\u2019s a tacit admission that the company couldn\u2019t make it alone on the public markets.Also, it\u2019s expensive. Even for Google, tens of billions of dollars on a second-place social networking company might be too much to swallow. Also, aren\u2019t we holding out for Google to buy Twitter? How many social networks can we expect Google to save?Anyway, I\u2019m going to Disneyland, Mike! See you in a couple of weeks.Advertisement"}

As a woman who has worked in IT for over 15 years, I have been sexually harassed, put up with denigrating comments from my male colleagues, been excluded from \u201cbonding\u201d and networking events where my female presence would have undermined their fun guys\u2019 night out on the company dime at cigar bars, strip clubs or pub crawls.As Americans, we\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve risen above the discriminatory attitudes of the past, but 40 years of women in the workplace isn\u2019t going to undo centuries of ingrained attitudes of subordination. Sexism is still as alive and well as it always has been. There are just new ways and old ways of rationalizing it.Not only am I good at math, I love it. I can\u2019t fully describe how math makes me feel. It makes me feel awesome and empowered. I looked for work for three and a half years in my field. Now I\u2019m a glorified secretary in a hospital. I don\u2019t get to do any math as part of my job. Tell me again how reinforcing ideas about women\u2019s inherent differences is a valid opinion that deserves my respect and time. Tell me again that my frustration is neuroses and probably PMS. Tell me again.Some female readers in the technology industry criticized Google for firing Mr. Damore; others supported his arguments. I am a female scientist. I know why women do not succeed at the same levels as men in science fields and it is not because we are neurotic. It\u2019s because we are the ones who bear and nurse children, and day care is expensive.Firing a man who expresses his opinion that there are so few women in tech is because they are inherently incapable of succeeding in tech only gives fodder to those who feel men are being pushed aside so women can succeed. With his firing, this opportunity to open his eyes is lost.As a female software developer, I also believe that Mr. Damore has a right to present his arguments. I will go so far as to say that some of them are correct and that I see those traits in myself. Maybe we don\u2019t need to go around pretending that every human is just the same, and maybe if we can accept the differences, we can move forward to finding a place for \u201cfeminine\u201d behavior within the IT community.Many readers suggested that Mr. Damore\u2019s error was writing his memo on a company computer on company time. Actually, he\u2019s not protected within the company as an employee using company time and computers. And Google was right to fire him for violating its policies.That employee exercised his free speech. The company exercised their right to fire an employee who contributed to a hostile workplace.Everyone has the right to their own backward, sexist, racist views, but when you utilize company property and resources to spread those views in violation of company policy you are likely to be disciplined and/or terminated.Some readers thought Google stymied Mr. Damore\u2019s attempt to openly discuss his viewpoints. Anyone who questions the politically correct orthodoxy, whether on race, sex, climate change, etc., is derided as a bigot, a boor or worse. It\u2019s true he had no First Amendment protection, but shame on Google. They\u2019re a bunch of thought bullies.So much for allowing employees to openly discuss their opinions. This is what true discrimination and intolerance looks like.Google missed an opportunity to engage this guy (who is the tip of an iceberg in Silicon Valley, which is just as libertarian as it is leftist) and discuss openly why his claims were simplistic.Other readers believed Mr. Damore was a victim of his own privilege. As an employee of privilege, he\u2019s probably unaccustomed to earning his way to a seat at the table. He\u2019s always had it. Fortunately, in a meritocracy, privilege is something you earn. And what better way to demonstrate it than by firing an utterly clueless person who doesn\u2019t demonstrate the skills required at Google.Mr. Damore is not a biologist yet felt privileged enough to speak like an expert on the subject.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Facebook Tests the Waters With a Stealth App", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow the social network is trying a different way into China: by authorizing the release of a new app there that does not carry the Facebook name.Facebook approved the May debut of a photo-sharing app, called Colorful Balloons, in China, according to a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s plans, who declined to be named because the information is politically sensitive. The app, which has not previously been reported, shares the look, function and feel of Facebook\u2019s Moments app. It was released through a separate local company and without any hint that the social network is affiliated with it.Now Colorful Balloons gives the Silicon Valley company a way to see how Chinese users digitally share information with their friends or interact with their favorite social media platforms.\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.It is unclear whether China\u2019s various internet regulators were aware of the app\u2019s existence. The under-the-table approach could cause Facebook new difficulties with a Chinese government that has maintained strict oversight and control over foreign tech companies.\u201cIt\u2019s not a mere business thing,\u201d said Teng Bingsheng, a professor of strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s politics.\u201dThe Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Before the release of Colorful Balloons, Facebook had taken an unusually high-profile approach to courting China.Colorful Balloons represents the opposite approach \u2014 one that is low profile.The app was released in China by a company called Youge Internet Technology, according to a post in Apple\u2019s app store. It is registered to an address in eastern Beijing, yet the room number listed in company registration documents could not be found amid a series of shabby, small offices on the building\u2019s fourth floor.Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Zhang\u2019s relationship to the company, and Ms. Zhang did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.If Facebook did little to promote Colorful Balloons in China, it did work to tailor the app to a local audience. In the rest of the world, the company\u2019s Moments app connects users through Facebook. Colorful Balloons instead links users through China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat.While photos can be shared, Facebook appears to have taken steps to ensure the app could not spread widely. For example, people who post photos from Colorful Balloons on WeChat will see a link that lets other users download Facebook\u2019s Chinese app. But the link does not work, meaning people have to seek out Colorful Balloons in an app store instead of grabbing it from their friends, which may limit its distribution.The risk Facebook is taking with the new app is high. The company appears to have handed over a fully functioning product to Youge for release, and has done so without indicating in any public way that it is connected to Facebook. Coming just ahead of a key meeting of the Chinese Communist Party this autumn, the secretive release of Colorful Balloons could also undermine trust between the company and the Chinese government.\u201cThe government\u2019s control and surveillance of media is strict, and it is almost impossible for them to open that door,\u201d said Mr. Teng, the Cheung Kong professor. \u201cAlthough Mark Zuckerberg has visited China many times and practiced his Chinese very hard, I don\u2019t foresee any major breakthroughs for Facebook.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.

{"Headline": "Thailand\u2019s Ex-Leader Leaves Supporters in Limbo After Disappearing During Trial", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 For two years, Yingluck Shinawatra, the former prime minister of Thailand, battled criminal charges of negligence and claims that she had cost the country billions of dollars. She appeared in court regularly and assured her supporters that she would fight until the end.Her whereabouts remained a mystery on Sunday. Officials of her party, Pheu Thai, said they had not heard from her and had no idea where she was.Ms. Yingluck\u2019s decision not to appear in court was costly. She forfeited $900,000 in bail and left her political movement in disarray, with no clear agenda or plan for moving forward.\u201cIt is now difficult for us to analyze what to do next,\u201d said Chaturon Chaisang, who served as education minister in her cabinet. \u201cWe want to hear from her and what her role will be now.\u201dA wealthy businessman who once owned the English soccer club Manchester City, Mr. Thaksin has a private jet and homes in several countries, including in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. Some speculate that Ms. Yingluck has joined him in the emirate.For Thailand, Ms. Yingluck\u2019s departure is the end of an era, when the populist siblings ran the country with the backing of the rural poor, who repeatedly voted them into office only to see the military take power twice.Since Mr. Thaksin\u2019s election in 2001, the country has been split between the rural poor and the urban elite. Under Ms. Yingluck, who was elected prime minister in 2011, street protests by both groups paralyzed Bangkok for months.\u201cThailand has been stuck for two decades now,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political-science professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. \u201cThe country remains divided and polarized.\u201dMr. Thitinan said that Ms. Yingluck\u2019s disappearance benefited the authorities by validating the charges against her and the takeover. He said he would not be surprised if some of the people in power had helped her leave the country.\u201cYingluck\u2019s flight was a victory of sorts for the generals,\u201d he said. \u201cHer running away reinforces their rationale for the coup that the rice-management scheme was corrupt and that she knew about it,\u201d he added, referring to a central issue in her trial.As prime minister, Ms. Yingluck lifted the minimum wage by up to 40 percent. She also adopted a rice-management plan, which was supposed to help poor farmers by paying them above market value for their rice.The government stockpiled the rice in the hope of making a profit, but world prices fell instead. Millions of tons ended up rotting in warehouses, and the government lost billions of dollars.Last year, a government committee ordered her to pay $1 billion in compensation. She protested last month that the country\u2019s leaders had seized money in her bank accounts before her trial had concluded.In the criminal case, she is charged with negligence, accused of allowing corrupt officials and businessmen to benefit from the rice subsidy.Mr. Thitinan, the political-science professor, said that Thailand\u2019s future would depend on whether the military reached out to her supporters and tried to boost their living standards. If not, the political stalemate is likely to continue, he said.\u201cThe key will be what the military regime takes away from all of this,\u201d he added.On the day she was scheduled to hear the verdict, the same court found 20 others guilty of illegally profiting from the rice deal. Five of them were officials in Ms. Yingluck\u2019s administration, and they received sentences of 24 to 42 years in prison.Ms. Yingluck notified the court that she was suffering from dizziness and headaches shortly before her hearing. But without a medical certificate, the court rejected that claim, issued a warrant for her arrest and ordered the forfeiture of her bail, 30 million Thai baht.Ms. Yingluck\u2019s niece and spokeswoman, Chayika Wongnapachant, said she knew nothing about her aunt\u2019s whereabouts. An assistant to Mr. Thaksin in Dubai said she, too, had no information. Party leaders in Thailand said they were not looking for Ms. Yingluck because they were afraid of putting her in jeopardy.\u201cWe believe she left on Wednesday, but we don\u2019t know how,\u201d said Mr. Chaturon, who also held top posts in Mr. Thaksin\u2019s government. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried to find out what happened. It is better to let her inform the public.\u201dA spokesman for the government, Weerachon Sukondhapatipak, said that the authorities were investigating Ms. Yingluck\u2019s disappearance but that they had not established whether she had left Thailand. Allegations that the government had helped her flee were only speculation, he said.\u201cWe haven\u2019t heard from a government official or from Khun Yingluck herself,\u201d he said, using a Thai honorific term. \u201cWe have to wait a little bit longer to be sure that she is actually leaving the country.\u201dGiven Ms. Yingluck\u2019s repeated promise to fight the criminal case to the end, many of her supporters said they had initially been shocked and dismayed when they learned that she had skipped the hearing.One supporter, Kamol Suksawat, expressed his disappointment on Ms. Yingluck\u2019s Facebook page an hour after she failed to appear in court.\u201cMadam, you should have fought to the end,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey issued an arrest warrant against you. They announced they took your bail money of 30 million Thai baht. This is like stepping on my heart.\u201dBut a day later, he had changed his mind.\u201cI am happy,\u201d he posted on her page Saturday. \u201cYou decided it right.\u201dRyn Jirenuwat contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Singapore, Chinese Dialects Revive After Decades of Restrictions", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 The Tok and Teo families are a model of traditional harmony, with three generations gathered under one roof, enjoying each other\u2019s company over slices of fruit and cups of tea on a Saturday afternoon in Singapore.There is only one problem: The youngest and oldest generations can barely communicate with each other.Lavell, 7, speaks fluent English and a smattering of Mandarin Chinese, while her grandmother, Law Ngoh Kiaw, prefers the Hokkien dialect of her ancestors\u2019 home in southeastern China. That leaves grandmother and granddaughter looking together at a doll house on the floor, unable to exchange more than a few words.\u201cShe can\u2019t speak our Hokkien,\u201d Mrs. Law said with a sigh, \u201cand doesn\u2019t really want to speak Mandarin, either.\u201dThis struggle to communicate within families is one of the painful effects of the Singapore government\u2019s large-scale, decades-long effort at linguistic engineering.Starting with a series of measures in the late 1970s, the leaders of this city-state effectively banned Chinese dialects, the mother tongues of about three-quarters of its citizens, in favor of Mandarin, China\u2019s official language.A few years later, even Mandarin usage was cut back in favor of the global language of commerce, English.\u201cSingapore used to be like a linguistic tropical rain forest \u2014 overgrown, and a bit chaotic but very vibrant and thriving,\u201d said Tan Dan Feng, a language historian in Singapore. \u201cNow, after decades of pruning and cutting, it\u2019s a garden focused on cash crops: learn English or Mandarin to get ahead and the rest is useless, so we cut it down.\u201dThis linguistic repression, and the consequences for multigenerational families, has led to a widespread sense of resentment \u2014 and now a softening in the government\u2019s policy.The government\u2019s easing of restrictions amid public discontent makes Singapore something of case study for how people around the world are reacting against the rising cultural homogeneity that comes with globalization.For Singapore\u2019s first generation of leaders, those sorts of ideas sounded like sentimentalism.At the time of the founding of the Republic of Singapore in 1965, it was led by a charismatic and authoritarian prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, who was a self-taught linguist. A product of the English-speaking elite who rarely spoke Chinese dialects, including Mandarin, Mr. Lee held the popular idea, discredited by linguists, that language was a zero-sum game: speaking more of one meant less mastery of another.In short, he considered dialects a waste of the brain\u2019s finite storage capacity when it should be filled with, above all else, English.\u201cHe felt that since he couldn\u2019t do it, the rest couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Prof. Lee Cher Leng, a language historian in the China studies department at the National University of Singapore, referring to Mr. Lee\u2019s inability to fluently speak multiple languages. \u201cHe felt it would be too confusing for kids to learn the dialects.\u201dAs the government considered which of Singapore\u2019s many languages to focus on, Mandarin Chinese and English were the logical choices. China, although more than a thousand miles away, was the ancestral homeland of most Singaporeans and was embarking on economic reforms that captivated Mr. Lee. English, the language of Singapore\u2019s elite since the British established a trading port here in 1819, was the dominant global language of culture and commerce.But neither language had much to do with the people who lived in Singapore when the government launched its policy in the 1970s.Then, as now, roughly 7 percent of Singaporeans came from southern India and most spoke Tamil. Another 15 percent spoke Malay. The ethnic Chinese, who then as now make up 75 percent of the population, had immigrated over the centuries from several mostly southern Chinese provinces, especially Fujian (where Hokkien is spoken) and Guangdong (home to Cantonese, Teochew, and Hakka). Only 2 percent spoke Mandarin.Although called \u201cdialects\u201d by the government, some of these Chinese tongues are at least as different as the various Romance languages. The government\u2019s policy was something like ordering Spaniards, French and Italians to abandon the languages they grew up with in favor of Portuguese.The policy was rolled out in waves. In 1979, the government launched a \u201cSpeak Mandarin\u201d campaign. In some schools, pupils who spoke dialects were fined and made to write out hundreds of times, \u201cI will not speak dialects.\u201d The population was bombarded with messages that dialect speakers had no future.By 1981, television and radio were banned from broadcasting almost all dialect shows, including popular music. That left many people cut off from society.Then, in 1987, to foster unity across Singapore\u2019s three major ethnic groups, Chinese, Indian and Malay, English became the main method of instruction in all schools. Today, almost all instruction is in English except for a class in the student\u2019s native tongue: Tamil and Malay for ethnic Indians and Malays, and Mandarin for ethnic Chinese.For some, it means committing to learn their ancestral language.One recent Friday evening, about 20 people sat in a small classroom learning phrases like \u201creunion meal,\u201d \u201cpraying for blessings\u201d and \u201cdragon dance.\u201d Three students were doctors specializing in geriatric care who wanted to understand older patients. Others were simply curious.\u201cI think it\u2019s to understand our roots,\u201d said Ivan Cheung, 34, who works in Singapore\u2019s oil refining industry. \u201cTo know our roots you have to know dialect.\u201dThe head of the community center, Perng Peck Seng, said that it, too, had seen the effects of the government policy. When he joined in the 1980s, all meetings were held in Hokkien and Mandarin. Now they are held in English and Mandarin because too few people, even in his organization, speak Hokkien fluently enough to conduct meetings.But Mr. Perng stopped short of criticizing the government. Instead, he said Singaporeans themselves had to take responsibility for the loss of their language diversity.\u201cSometimes I think we are too docile,\u201d Mr. Perng said. \u201cLeaders said if you speak too much dialect it\u2019ll affect your success in life, so many people dropped it on their own accord. The biggest problem is our own consciousness.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are You There, Dad? It\u2019s Me, Alice", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveIn December I moved the contents of my 10-year-old niece\u2019s bedroom from my brother\u2019s house in Portland, Ore., to mine a half-mile away, where I tried to create an exact replica: same color walls, pictures hung in the same spots and stuffed animals laid out exactly as they had been.Alice was going to be staying with us part-time because her father \u2014 my brother, James \u2014 had, at 37, taken his own life. Although James had at times quietly suffered from depression, he had seemed fine last fall; none of us saw this coming.Ten months earlier, he and his wife, Trina, got divorced, and they had been sharing custody of Alice equally. But Trina worked full-time, with long nursing shifts, and after James died there were three days a week unaccounted for.I wanted Alice with me on those days. Desperately.In my grief, I took other parts of James\u2019s life into mine, too. His clothes, for example. Often I wore his socks, always his coat, most times his shirts and sometimes his jeans, which hung on me.And soon I began to inhabit his online life as well. Searching for answers, I hacked into his various accounts: his email, Facebook, Instagram, tropical fish forum, chat site for BMW technicians, Snapchat, bank accounts, garbage bills and mileage awards charts.What I most wanted to find was the search history on his phone, thinking it might provide a clue, but the phone locked me out after too many failed passcode attempts. I knew it had to be some combination of 4s and 0s, but I couldn\u2019t get them in the right order. Or maybe, in my emotional fog, I just kept entering the same combination over and over: 4-0-0-0, 4-0-0-0, 4-0-0-0. (I did, eventually, through a series of complicated steps, gain access to some of the phone\u2019s features \u2014 but never the browser history.)The first call had come from my father on the morning of the winter solstice. Did I know where James was? That led to a series of calls and texts to relatives and friends that seemed to go on and on until he was discovered later that morning.After leaving my brother\u2019s house, my mother and I drove to Trina\u2019s, where my niece, Alice, sat crying on the couch, her face white, body shaking. If I could just be my brother, I thought, I could pick her up and say, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Blueberry. I\u2019m back. I\u2019m right here.\u201d And she would giggle and squirm into my lap, which is too small for a 10-year-old, but neither of us would care.That evening, I took the log from my phone and wrote down a minute-by-minute summary of when everything had happened, all of the calls and texts. If Alice were ever curious about the day, I would not leave anything out. The next days were a blur as relatives arrived and we tried to come to grips with what had happened, all with Christmas looming.On Christmas Eve, Alice texted me: \u201cDid dad get me Christmas presents?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d I replied. \u201cA big pile!\u201dI could almost see her brain working to compartmentalize this new reality, as if slamming a door on something she wasn\u2019t yet able to process.James\u2019s presents for Alice had been in his desk, unwrapped and without tags; I took them home with me. He and I have nearly identical (terrible) handwriting, so I could fill out the tags somewhat credibly on his behalf, being careful not to smear the labels with my tears.I wrote: \u201cTo: Alice\u201d \u201cLove: from Dad!\u201dAnd \u201cTo: Blueberry, I love you!! ~ Dad\u201dAnd on behalf of their puppy: \u201cKisses from Scout!!\u201dOn Christmas morning everyone came over to our house. For an hour and a half, I forced myself to hold it together and give Alice the Christmas morning she had been looking forward to. The next day, she left to spend the holiday week in Seattle with her grandparents, and that\u2019s when my husband and I moved her room, in its entirety, from James\u2019s house to ours.From Seattle, Alice texted: \u201cMy room is at your house?? dont send me pictures!!!! i want to be surprised!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll love it,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just the same.\u201dAfter New Year\u2019s it was a whole new life for us, with Alice staying at our house on the days she had stayed at her father\u2019s house. I would tuck her into the bed her dad got her, under fleece blankets instead of the sheets that still smelled like his house.In this way, months passed. Daffodil shoots started to peek through the mud. The shock began to wear off. And as it did, Alice started having trouble sleeping, despite her room being exactly the same and her schedule exactly the same.She began to approach me with complicated deals, like if she couldn\u2019t sleep in her bed, she would sleep on the couch. If she couldn\u2019t sleep on the couch, she would sleep in the babies\u2019 room. If she couldn\u2019t sleep in the babies\u2019 room, she would sleep with my husband and me. And then, if all that failed, she would call her mother to pick her up in the middle of the night.I wished, again, that I could be James for her. If only I could.Many nights, after my husband fell asleep, I would log in to James\u2019s Facebook account. Twice I forgot to log out and ended up posting as him in chat groups of his friends, which left them in stunned silence. Once, I mistakenly messaged back one of James\u2019s friends as him too. At least on social media it was as if time had stopped and he was still alive. Until somehow Facebook learned of his death and his page was converted to a memorial account, and this last vestige died too.But his email account lived on. I would leave it logged in and up on my computer on the tab to the left of my own email. (I still do.) He wasn\u2019t getting many emails, mostly junk or notices from various lists he had been on \u2014 notifications from Alice\u2019s school and alerts about lost neighborhood dogs.Then one day a new message popped up: \u201chi dad\u201dI stared for a while at Alice\u2019s message, so plaintive and weightless, without even the anchor of punctuation. I wondered if I should reply. I asked a therapist friend, who said: \u201cDon\u2019t answer as her father unless you ask Alice and she agrees to it.\u201dIt took me a few days to figure out how to ask Alice casually. During that time, I searched and read every email and text he had sent her. I studied his punctuation, his cadence, his vocabulary and his endearments. So many exclamation points.And then I texted her: \u201cI\u2019m on your dads email. can i write you from it?\u201dShe replied: \u201cwait what? oh ok\u201d\u201ci guess i want to pretend,\u201d I explained.\u201coh i get it ok that is fine\u201dThen I changed the subject and did not acknowledge after that moment that we had agreed on virtual resurrection.The next day, I pulled up the little message she had sent \u2014 \u201chi dad\u201d \u2014 and replied, \u201cHi Alice!!! Love you!!!!\u201dThe next day she wrote, \u201chi by the way you wrote that to me during school.\u201d\u201cOooooops! Did you open it at school? Miss you so much Blueberry!!\u201dShe wrote, \u201cI read it on my fit bit but it only reads half the message so I checked after school.\u201d\u201cThats my girl. I heard you have had trouble sleeping at aunt jessies? Hope it is better tonight!!!!\u201d\u201cYa,\u201d she replied.The next day she wrote: \u201chow was work dad\u201d\u201cvery busy!! I am on break!! Missing you!!! Love you Alice!!!\u201d\u201cI miss you dad I love you\u201dI don\u2019t know what Alice thinks of these exchanges, which continue to this day, though with less frequency. She knows we are pretending, of course, but who can say what goes on in her mind? She never says anything emotional. She just wants to chat with her father, to say she misses him and loves him. She wants to be able to ask questions and work through this in whatever way feels right. And I want the same things.I keep the tab to my brother\u2019s email open in my browser 24/7 and always try to respond within half an hour. Alice now sleeps well at my house, though she still sometimes ends up in bed with my husband and me. I text her most evenings and ask: \u201cHi, Mid, Lo?\u201d And she tells me the highlights, midlights and lowlights of each day.You can\u2019t put things back to the way they were, but you can try to make the best of the way things are.

Toastier temperatures promote tropical activity, and the ocean waters are far warmer in those areas than in the Northeast.Will we feel the effects of Harvey in New York?Yes.\u201cTropical systems impact the flow of the whole atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Homenuk said, because even when they make landfall somewhere else, they\u2019re often pulled up into our area.\u201cMoisture from the storm is going to eventually make its way up through the Mississippi Valley and then up through the Northeast.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Next week, classes start for more than a million public school students in the city.And with it, a new batch of freshmen will begin high school.

That account toggles between passenger needs and promotion of airport services. Over Memorial Day weekend, it mollified one passenger who complained about rudeness, and that was followed by another who wanted to know if PlayStation 4s are allowed in airplane cabins. (They are.)\u201cThe goal is to communicate with customers with timely relevant information and promote services,\u201d said Heather Lissner, an airport spokeswoman.With airplanes often filled almost to the brim and air travel increasingly unpredictable, airports have begun using social media to communicate with passengers.The hope is to turn what the industry calls dwell time, the two to three hours that passengers spend between curbside check-in and boarding, into a positive experience \u2014 one that can be lucrative for the airport.\u201cThey want to make sure the passenger feels his or her time and money is well spent,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Travel Group.Travel experts said they see social media as replacing antiquated passenger communications. \u201cInstead of giant screens and inaudible public address systems, the airports are presenting information in a much friendlier way,\u201d said Paul Tumpowsky, chief executive of Skylark, a travel agency in New York.Passenger experiences with social media, however, run the gamut from positive to largely nonexistent.Samantha Aguilar, a corporate travel manager in Phoenix, said social media makes her job easier by enabling her to anticipate problems for employees flying into Phoenix Sky Harbor.Last November, gates in Terminal 4 were closed for several hours after an unattended bag was discovered and required further inspection. The information was first reported on social media. \u201cI don\u2019t have to wait for official notification,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s real-time information.\u201dOthers said social media helped avoid delays. Bob Swindell, president and chief executive of the economic development organization Greater Fort Lauderdale Alliance, flies from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and relies on that airport\u2019s Twitter account (@FLLflyer) for emergency weather updates. Before he gets a notice from Delta Air Lines, \u201cI have notice from the airport,\u201d he said.Still, the social media efforts of the airports are dwarfed by those of the airlines, which count likes and followers in the millions. On Facebook, Delta has a total of nearly four million likes and people who follow it. And it has 1.9 million followers on Twitter. American Airlines (@AmericanAir) regularly tweets to its 1.47 million Twitter followers.At least one expert sees these efforts as an antidote to the stress of traveling. \u201cAirports can\u2019t control the check-in standards for the airline and can\u2019t control security for luggage,\u201d said Steven Carvell, a professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration.The Transportation Security Administration also has a social media presence. The agency has maintained a Twitter feed (@AskTSA) since September 2015 and an account on Facebook Messenger (AskTSA) since July 2016. It has fielded 305,000 questions, largely about permitted and prohibited items and its PreCheck expedited security program.Using either site, a registered PreCheck user can contact T.S.A. for assistance if the number does not appear on a boarding pass. With details provided by the passenger (full name, known traveler number and airline confirmation number), \u201cwe\u2019re able to work with our Secure Flight team to identify the issue and then contact their airline to update their information,\u201d Jennifer Plozai, a T.S.A. spokeswoman, wrote in an email.The agency also maintains an Instagram account, @tsa, that has grown to more than 780,000 followers from about 400,000 a year ago. It posts photos of confiscated contraband (agents confiscate about 70 firearms in carry-on bags each week) interspersed with images of dogs that detect explosives. Bob Burns, public affairs specialist for the T.S.A., who runs the site, invites passenger comments. \u201cIt\u2019s humanizing the bureaucracy,\u201d he said.Some passengers prefer to rely on their own knowledge and experience.Jay Acunzo, the creator and host of the Unthinkable podcast \u2014 about how to use intuition at work \u2014 has flown from Boston Logan International Airport three to four times a month. Although Logan has more than 136,000 likes on its Facebook and more than 6,400 reviews monitored during business hours, and 44,600 followers on Twitter (@BostonLogan), Mr. Acunzo was not among them.Several years ago he budgeted about five minutes to stand in a security line, but the clearance required a half-hour. (Mr. Acunzo said he now has Global Entry.). He barely made a flight, which was not equipped with Wi-Fi, so he was unable to send a promised project to a client by deadline, requiring an apology.Now, he said he leaves sufficient time, but still not the full two hours for domestic flights, and relies primarily on two apps \u2014 TripIt, to aggregate his trip data, and Evernote, to log articles he is writing so he does not have to worry about disrupting his work flow if there is no internet connection.\u201cI prepare for things not to run smoothly,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Regulators Investigating Ford Police Vehicles for Possible Exhaust Hazard", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn February, police officers in Austin, Tex., began complaining of dizziness and headaches while driving Ford sport utility vehicles that are specially made for law enforcement use. City officials suspected the cause was carbon monoxide leaking from the exhaust system.A month later, as Austin officials were meeting with Ford and federal safety regulators to investigate the problem, an officer blacked out briefly at the wheel of one of the vehicles, said David Green, a spokesman for the city.Ford and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are now scrambling to determine if the Ford police vehicles are safe. Police departments in Auburn, Mass.; Modesto, Calif.; Houston; and Galveston, Tex., and dozens of other cities around the country have found carbon monoxide is accumulating in the cabins of their Ford Police Interceptors, brawny versions of the Ford Explorer. Some police agencies said they are also having problems with regular Explorers.The federal safety agency is investigating Explorers and Police Interceptors made from 2011 to 2017, and Police Interceptors from 2016 and 2017 to see if exhaust fumes can make their way to drivers and other occupants. The agency said it has received 2,700 complaints from people who contend they have been exposed to exhaust fumes or carbon monoxide while in the vehicles.The agency first opened an investigation into odors and exhaust issues in Ford Explorers in July 2016.Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas produced by combustion in engines and furnaces. It can cause headaches, dizziness, weakness, upset stomach and confusion. Prolonged exposure can result in death.Ford acknowledged that leaks of carbon monoxide have been a problem in Police Interceptors that it said have been modified after leaving the factory by outfitters who add police lights and other special equipment. These modifications typically require that holes be drilled in parts of a vehicle\u2019s underbody to accommodate wiring.Ford does not believe there is a carbon monoxide problem with the regular Explorer, said Elizabeth Weigandt, a spokeswoman for Ford.Companies that install the extra equipment \u201cdon\u2019t always properly seal the holes they drill,\u201d Ms. Weigandt said. \u201cThey don\u2019t always put foam around the wiring and cover it with sealant. A lot of this is due to upfitters,\u201d an auto industry term for outfitters.She said that police departments can bring their Police Interceptors to dealers to have them examined for exhaust leaks, and have any seals reinforced to prevent carbon monoxide from entering the passenger cabin. Ford will cover the costs even if the vehicles are out of warranty, she added.\u201cWe have a group of people working with police departments to get to the bottom of this,\u201d she said.Austin is not taking any chances. It recently pulled from service all 446 of the Ford S.U.V.s in its fleet, Explorers and Interceptors, until the problem is solved, Mr. Green said. \u201cIt just got to the point where we had to pull them off the road.\u201dAfter the episode in March in which the police officer in Austin blacked out, the city equipped all of its Explorers and Police Interceptors with carbon monoxide detectors, Mr. Green said. The city recorded 73 cases in which the detectors found elevated levels of carbon monoxide in the vehicles. Three officers missed work because of exposure to carbon monoxide; two of them remain unable to work.This week, the police department in Auburn, Mass., reported that one of its 2017 Police Interceptors had been involved in a minor crash and said the officer at the wheel had been affected by exposure to carbon monoxide. It has pulled all 10 of its Ford S.U.V.s out of service.\u201cWe would urge other departments to have their cruisers tested and/or purchase detectors to ensure everyone\u2019s safety,\u201d Andrew Sluckis Jr., the Auburn police chief, said in a post on the department\u2019s Facebook page.The federal safety agency is examining vehicles from Austin and Auburn as part of its investigation.Advertisement"}

These little endorsements can reach a much larger audience than an interview with the author on a popular television show or a rave review in a major newspaper. \u201cIn previous times, you would have the Oprah or Daily Show bump,\u201d says Todd Doughty, the director of publicity at Doubleday. \u201cNow you have the Reese Witherspoon bump from Instagram.\u201dWitherspoon and Ritter are two of several actresses, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Emma Watson, Lena Dunham and Emma Roberts, who share photos of their favorite books with millions of followers on Instagram. While it is difficult to isolate the impact of a social-media post from the other facets of a promotional campaign, nearly all the major publishing houses see these accounts as a way to connect with audiences that would be difficult to reach through the traditional organs of book publicity. Watson\u2019s pictures, for example, go out to 38 million Instagram followers, while an interview on NPR\u2019s popular \u201cFresh Air\u201d radio program reaches about a million listeners. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely something we think about,\u201d says Miriam Parker, an associate publisher at Ecco Books. \u201cWe try to get books to people with big social-media followings and are strategic about it.\u201dA person need not necessarily be a celebrity to attract a publishing house\u2019s attention. \u201cWhat we really look for is people who are a little more niche, who do make sense for a particular title,\u201d says Lydia Hirt, the marketing director at Riverhead Books and Viking Books. Instagram\u2019s director of fashion partnerships, Eva Chen, for example, is not a household name, but she regularly recommends books to her 850,000 followers. \u201cShe\u2019s somebody who absolutely puts books in front of a group of people who may not have normally come across them,\u201d says Cristina Gilbert, the vice president of sales and marketing at Bloomsbury. Chen\u2019s endorsements of young-adult fiction are an unlikely pairing with her carefully composed photographs of beauty products, handbags and designer shoes \u2014 which is exactly what makes them so valuable to book publicists, who might struggle to reach her audience through more traditional outreach.

{"Headline": "Commander of Naval Fleet Relieved of Duty After Collisions", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the head of the Seventh Fleet, the Navy\u2019s largest overseas, was removed Wednesday in connection with the four accidents since January, including two fatal collisions in the past two months, according to a statement by the Navy.Adm. Scott H. Swift, the commander of the United States Pacific Fleet, was flying from Singapore to the Seventh Fleet headquarters in Yokosuka, Japan, to carry out the change in command. Admiral Aucoin is being replaced by Rear Adm. Phil Sawyer, \u201cwho has already been nominated and confirmed for the position and promotion to vice admiral,\u201d the Navy statement said.Admiral Aucoin, a highly decorated naval aviator, had commanded the fleet since September 2015.\u201cI support Admiral Swift\u2019s decision to bring in new leadership to Seventh Fleet,\u201d Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, said in a comment on his Facebook page. \u201cThe new Seventh Fleet commander must help move his team forward, focusing efforts on safe and effective operations.\u201dThe admiral\u2019s removal comes as the Navy is preparing to conduct an extremely rare suspension of ship operations worldwide for a day or two in the next week to review safety and operational procedures. More broadly, Navy officials are also investigating the role that training, manning and crew communications may have played in the accidents.On Wednesday, the search for the missing sailors continued aboard the ship and at sea. The Navy said it was widening the sea search area with the passage of time.He declined to say how many bodies had been located in the ship, which is docked at Changi Naval Base in Singapore. He also said that the Malaysian Navy, which is part of the search effort, had reported recovering a body at sea that might be one of the 10 missing sailors.\u201cWe have discovered other bodies during the diving on the McCain today,\u201d Admiral Swift said at a news conference, held within sight of the damaged ship. \u201cBut it is premature to say how many or what the status of the recovery of those bodies is.\u201dThe body found by the Malaysian Navy is being handed over to the Americans for identification.Ships and aircraft from five nations have been searching for the sailors near the site of the collision, in waters claimed by both Malaysia and Singapore. Each of those two countries claimed to be leading the search effort at sea, which includes ships and planes from the United States, Indonesia and Australia.Admiral Swift said the search at sea would continue despite the discovery of remains in the ship. \u201cThe focus of the United States Pacific Fleet is our 10 missing sailors and their families,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are always hopeful there are survivors.\u201dOn Tuesday afternoon, the White House issued a statement expressing \u201cgreat sadness\u201d over the deaths of the sailors aboard the McCain. \u201cAs the Navy begins the process of recovering our fallen sailors, our thoughts and prayers go out to their families and friends,\u201d the statement said.The collision was the second in two months involving a destroyer from the Seventh Fleet, which is based in Yokosuka, Japan.In June, the destroyer Fitzgerald collided with a cargo ship off Japan. Soon afterward, searchers found the bodies of seven missing sailors in its flooded berthing compartments.At his news conference Tuesday, Admiral Swift discounted suggestions that the crew of the McCain had been overworked or underprepared. He said the crew responded quickly after the collision, righted the ship and prevented an even bigger disaster.\u201cI was on the McCain this morning and looking at the eyes of those sailors, and even after their heroic efforts yesterday I didn\u2019t see exhaustion,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a crew that was taking a knee, so to speak. They are on their game.\u201dThe admiral said there were no signs of failure in the ship\u2019s steering system or of a cyberattack, two possibilities that have been mentioned in news reports. But he noted that the investigation was in its earliest stages and said, \u201cWe are not taking any consideration off the table.\u201dThe destroyer is named after John S. McCain Sr. and John S. McCain Jr., Navy admirals who were the grandfather and father of Senator John McCain of Arizona.\u201cI agree with Admiral Richardson that more forceful action is urgently needed to identify and correct the causes of the recent ship collisions,\u201d he said. \u201cOur sailors who risk their lives every day, in combat and in training, deserve no less.\u201dJames G. Stavridis, a retired four-star admiral who commanded American forces in Europe and Latin America, said the pause \u201cmakes sense, but it comes at a challenging time operationally.\u201d\u201cThe pause gives everyone a chance to stop the day-to-day operations, review training manuals, run drills to respond to crisis, study the specifics of previous collisions, rest and recuperate from the tempo of operations,\u201d he said.The Navy declined to confirm the names of the missing sailors, but by Tuesday some of their relatives began to identify them.Jacob Drake, 21, of North Lewisburg, Ohio, was among the missing, according to a cousin, Brandie Roberts. \u201cWe are all having a very difficult time not knowing where he is or what has happened,\u201d Ms. Roberts said in a Facebook message, adding that her family was \u201crefusing\u201d to lose hope. Ms. Roberts said she had last spoken with Mr. Drake just over a week ago.The family of Logan Palmer, an interior communications electrician petty officer third class who was from Illinois, said in a statement released by the Navy that they, too, were awaiting \u201cword from the Navy on our son Logan.\u201dRepresentative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, said he had spoken with the Palmer family and would monitor the Navy\u2019s investigation into the crash.And Darryl Smith, the father of Kenneth Smith, an electronics technician petty officer third class, said in a separate statement provided by the Navy that he was waiting for news about his son. \u201cI appreciate the courageous work of the crew in the aftermath of the collision and the ongoing rescue efforts,\u201d Mr. Smith said.The collision between the McCain and the Alnic MC, a Liberian-registered tanker about three times its size, occurred east of Singapore.Andrew Tan, the chief executive of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, said that about 250 people from various Singapore agencies were involved in the search.But in Malaysia, Zulkifli Abu Bakar, the director general of the Maritime Enforcement Agency, said the collision had occurred in his country\u2019s waters, at the highly congested entrance to the Singapore and Malacca Straits. He said 80,000 ships a year pass through the area.He said any territorial dispute was secondary to the search effort. \u201cWe do not want to have another collision,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the time being, I don\u2019t think we should argue about whose waters, because I think the most important thing is to focus on the search and rescue effort.\u201dEric Schmitt reported from Washington, and Richard C. Paddock from Singapore. Jess Bidgood contributed reporting from Boston.Advertisement"}

As part of their \u201cwell laid out\u201d plan, the sheriff said, the inmates threw their blankets over the wire so they could get over it. Two escapees were cut by razor-wire as they fled; one of those inmates was hospitalized so that he could \u201chave his thumb sewn back on,\u201d the sheriff said.The inmates, who discarded their orange jumpsuits, had taken advantage of a \u201cyoung fellow who hasn\u2019t been here very long,\u201d the sheriff added. The guard had been monitoring about 140 inmates in the jail\u2019s \u201ccontrol area\u201d and had \u201cviolated policy,\u201d Sheriff Underwood said. He would not specify how the guard would be disciplined, but he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of that matter.\u201dSheriff Underwood also said civilians outside the jail could be charged with crimes for assisting the escape.On Monday, the search for the last missing inmate \u2014 Brady Andrew Kilpatrick, 24 \u2014 expanded to Shelby County, about 70 miles southeast of Walker County. Deputies were pursuing a woman they had understood to be the escapee\u2019s girlfriend when a fatal crash occurred, the Shelby County coroner, Lina Evans, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday night.The woman had a male passenger in her vehicle, Ms. Evans said, but he did not turn out to be Mr. Kilpatrick.When deputies tried to stop the vehicle, the woman began driving \u201cerratically\u201d and fast in an effort to get away, Ms. Evans said. A four-vehicle crash ensued, killing the male passenger, Michael Francis Xavier Lee, a 34-year-old county resident, Ms. Evans said.The authorities later searched the woman\u2019s home and did not find the inmate, Ms. Evans added.The Shelby County sheriff\u2019s office did not respond to a phone message seeking comment Tuesday night.The female driver, whom Ms. Evans did not identify, was injured and was in \u201cvery serious condition\u201d at a hospital, she said, adding that she did not know whether the woman had been taken into custody.An article on Wednesday about the capture of escaped prisoners in Alabama misstated the time that one of them, Brady Andrew Kilpatrick, was caught. It was 6:30 p.m. Central time on Tuesday, not Eastern time.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At an Arkansas Mosque, a Vandal Spreads Hate and Finds Mercy", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "The first person he wrote to was his mother. Abraham, just shy of 21, had barely spoken to her since his arrest a few days before, and he had a lot to explain.It all began on a night last October when he borrowed her white minivan and drove to the home of a friend. They\u2019d gotten drunk on cheap whiskey. Kentucky Deluxe. Abraham agreed to drive his friend to a mosque in town. His friend drew swastikas and curses on the mosque\u2019s windows and doors while Abraham stood watch in the driveway.The next day, the vandalism was all over the news. Abraham watched the reports over and over on his phone, his stomach curdling with regret.Even now, as he was facing up to six years in prison for the act, Abraham could not explain why he had done it.He had grown up in Fort Smith, a city of tall oak trees and brick churches that has the look of a faded Polaroid. His father, charismatic but violent, died when Abraham was 5, leaving him with a feeling of powerlessness so intense that he has been trying to conquer it ever since. \u201cMost of my life I\u2019ve spent trying to train myself to become something that\u2019s too strong to be broken through,\u201d he said. Life has teed him up for a fight, and he walks tilted slightly forward, as if someone is pulling him with an invisible wire.As a poor student in the high school on the wealthier side of town, Abraham often felt like an outsider. He walked, not drove, hung out on playgrounds, not in restaurants. He got into a lot of fights. He did poorly in school, but he doesn\u2019t remember his teachers seeming surprised. Expectations were low, and he bent to fit them. He slept a lot in class. At 18, he dropped out.Fort Smith has two country clubs, several golf courses, a Talbots and a symphony orchestra. But a proliferation of pawnshops and a circuit court crowded with indigent defendants are reminders of the grinding poverty all around, in the rural areas of western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma.For years, those divisions had been etched into the city\u2019s geography. Poorer families lived on the north side of town and wealthier families on the south. Race followed the same pattern, with the south predominantly white and much of the city\u2019s black population in the north.But time has scrambled those old lines. Latinos came here to work in the poultry industry. Pho shops dot the city\u2019s main drag, property of Vietnamese who began arriving as refugees after the fall of Saigon. R & R\u2019s Curry Express serves deliciously spicy North Indian food at a Finish Line gas station.Muslims from different countries came, too \u2014 some to study, some to work in the city\u2019s growing medical industry. Many had money. Hisham Yasin did not.A Palestinian who grew up just outside Damascus in Syria, Hisham sold fruits and vegetables in an outdoor market. He came to the United States in 1996, joining his parents and an older brother. Hisham imagined Beverly Hills, but found himself in western Arkansas in a rotting house with rats and cockroaches. He washed dishes at the Golden Corral. His father collected cans. He and a brother, Abdul Rahman, opened a used-car business. They called it A & H Auto Sales.Today, Hisham lives in a grand house in Fort Smith with sparkling chandeliers on the edge of a thick green forest of oak and pine. He is 49 and has the look of an affable neighborhood baker, with a big belly and a broad smile. He is giving his three children what he calls a \u201cfive-star life\u201d compared with his own, which he says began at \u201cbelow zero.\u201d He follows the news about Syria daily. But Arkansas is his home. He considers the day he came to the United States \u2014 Feb. 11 \u2014 his birthday.Hisham was one of the founders of the mosque that Abraham helped vandalize. They called it Al Salam \u2014 meaning \u201cpeace\u201d in Arabic. Since 2009, it has been in a brick ranch formerly used as a law office. It is on a busy road, South 28th Street, between a library branch and a nursing home. The founders wanted it that way. They thought the Muslims of Fort Smith should be forthright and confident, not hiding somewhere off the beaten path. This, they believed, would gain the community\u2019s trust and respect, maybe even help guard against the noxious stream of negative news about Muslims.The truth was that until the vandalism, few people in Fort Smith knew that Muslims lived in their city.Abraham did. He had gone to high school with Hisham\u2019s older son, Wasim Yasin. They often ate lunch together in the cafeteria. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t easy being Muslim in high school, Wasim said. But around Abraham, it was.\u201cAbraham was a good guy, a \u2018whatever\u2019 kind of guy, he never had any problems with that,\u201d Wasim said. \u201cYou know how people can talk about Muslims. He came up to me and he said: \u2018I\u2019m with you, man. If anybody bothers you, just let me know. I\u2019m your friend.\u2019\u201dMonths passed after the vandalism without contact from the police, and Abraham began to feel relief. He had only helped a friend, he told himself. \u201cMy mind was trying to let me off the hook,\u201d he said.But his dreams were less forgiving. In one, he was walking through a crowd of parents and their children. The children were looking at some writing and crying. \u201cIt was like one of those Scrooge stories,\u201d he said. He could see the children, but they could not see him. He saw their frightened faces and woke up sweating.Now, sitting in the Sebastian County jail, Abraham was not entirely surprised he had ended up here. Expectations for him were so low \u2014 at his church, at school, even in his own mind \u2014 that he sometimes saw the line of his life pointing toward prison.But not like this. Not with swastikas. So Abraham decided to use another piece of paper the jail guard had given him to write to the mosque. He wanted to tell the people there how sorry he was for what he\u2019d done. What, after all, did he have to lose?He sat on the floor of the cell, and placed a yellow sheet of paper on one of the metal seats bolted to the wall. He did not know the mosque\u2019s name. So he copied it, a letter at a time, from his paperwork.\u201cDear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,\u201d he began.The sky was just brightening the morning of Oct. 20 when Hisham pulled into the mosque\u2019s driveway. He liked to do his morning prayers there when he could. The quiet of the early hour was soothing, and he\u2019d been told that praying at the mosque meant more rewards from God. But he had not come to pray this morning. He had sped there in his white Infiniti, carrying his gun, after receiving a distressed phone call from the imam.Al Salam\u2019s members had already been anxious. For months the year before, a man had sent the mosque disturbing emails. \u201cSharia is a cancer that must be eliminated,\u201d the man warned, until someone called the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump was calling for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d Few thought that was possible, but it seemed to loosen some dark impulse in the land.Rolling up to the mosque, Hisham saw the first swastika from the street, spray-painted in black on the bottom left corner of the small curbside sign. It was off-kilter, like a creeping spider.There was more on the building: \u201cGo Home\u201d on the wooden front door, just above a babysitter-wanted sign. On the garage: \u201cWe Don\u2019t Want You Here U.S.A.\u201d And on one of the front windows, among profanities about Islam and Allah, a phrase Hisham did not recognize: \u201cDeus Vult.\u201d It is Latin for \u201cIt is God\u2019s will\u201d \u2014 a medieval rallying cry for the Crusades.Hisham\u2019s heart hurt. He thought about how little the vandals understood. America was the only true home Hisham had ever known. As a Palestinian in Syria he had been stateless. America gave him a country. America gave him a kidney, through a transplant. It gave him the dignity of being able to travel in the world. He still cries when he explains this.\u201cThey never let me go to Dubai,\u201d Hisham said, blowing his nose and wiping his eyes. \u201cThen I went with my American passport, and they stand up straight \u2014 they say, \u2018You\u2019re welcome, Mr. Hisham!\u2019\u201dAt the mosque that morning, Hisham sprang into action like a rescue worker after an earthquake. He called the police. He called the mosque\u2019s board members. He called journalists.By early afternoon, the story was breaking.Then something wonderful happened. The mosque\u2019s phone started ringing, and didn\u2019t stop. Churches called. A synagogue called. Buddhists called. So did residents who had seen the news or simply driven by. One man called, crying. His daughter had seen the graffiti on her way to work and told him about it. He said the vandals could not have been Christians. No true Christian would have done it.Anas Bensalah, a mosque member who had taken the day off to help with the cleanup, told the man that he understood completely: That was exactly how he felt every time there was an attack by the Islamic State.Over the next week, the mosque was snowed under with cards and letters. Some people brought flowers. Most of the letters were from Fort Smith and the surrounding towns, but some were from as far as Reston, Va.Hisham was overjoyed. He kept them, as if they were jewels, in a drawer in his office.The night the mosque was vandalized, Kristin Collins, 45, had been worrying about her white minivan. There was a knocking sound under the hood, and it sometimes lurched unexpectedly. She was afraid the transmission was going, and she could not afford to fix it. Her last job was at a day care center in 2013. She quit after her husband, who had Parkinson\u2019s, began having trouble putting diapers on their 1-year-old. The next year, Kristin learned she had leukemia. She and her husband receive disability insurance \u2014 a total of about $1,700 a month to support them, Kristin\u2019s son Abraham and his younger brothers, Noah Davis and Gabriel Collins.Fixing the van was on a long list of things they couldn\u2019t afford: the $25 monster costume that Gabriel, 4, wanted for Halloween; the several thousand dollars in back rent on their small brick ranch house. Kristin sometimes had to go to church food banks at the end of the month. And she had the sinking feeling she would have to rely on charity for a turkey on Thanksgiving, only a month away.So when Abraham asked to borrow the van, she was reluctant. Kristin loved her son. At 20, he was still more a teenager than a man, with a sparse goatee and \u2014 at 5 feet 11 inches and 139 pounds \u2014 a boyish frame. He was outgoing, loved people and liked to show off his break dancing and singing. She remembers his sweet head, hair dyed green, asleep on her hospital couch during her cancer treatment. But he was also directionless and unemployed, and spent too much time drinking and smoking pot with his friends.Kristin\u2019s boys were so different. Her middle son, Noah, was shy and sensitive but also a striver. He rose many days at 6 a.m. to work at a sandwich shop downtown. He had a girlfriend and a car. Where Noah was determined, Abraham just floated through, escaping into comic books and cartoons.Yet the brothers, only 15 months apart, were extremely close. As kids they played pirates, drinking sweet tea as whiskey on bunk bed boats. Abraham was protective of Noah, a frequent target for bullies with his surgically repaired cleft palate. Abraham was also quick to fight. At 9, he pummeled a boy who had made fun of Noah.Something was lodged in Abraham from the beginning, like a shard of glass in his heel. Kristin says it came from his father, Hud Davis, who grew up in a violent home. He had one real leg and cartoon flames painted on his fake one, the result of stepping on a downed power line. To his friends, he was full of life. At home, he was cruel. Kristin remembers him grabbing her by the neck and slamming her into the laundry-room door.Noah would sit on his toy dump truck and wheel himself backward into the closet to hide during the eruptions. Abraham remembers his father screaming that he would not have had to marry \u201cyour whore mother\u201d if Abraham had not come along.At 5, Abraham said, he got down on his knees in his bedroom and asked God \u201cto take him and save my mom.\u201d When his 33-year-old father died a month later, after a seizure, Abraham believed he was responsible.As he grew older, Abraham had trouble controlling his anger. Hank Needham, the principal of Cavanaugh Elementary in Fort Smith, remembers him as a polite little boy \u2014 but one with an angry streak. He once threw a fit when the school took away his screwdriver, which had belonged to his father.\u201cHe had a big heart and a short fuse, and he\u2019d just start cussing,\u201d Mr. Needham said. \u201cHe had an adult mouth in the second grade.\u201dMr. Needham gained Abraham\u2019s trust, and medication for hyperactivity helped smooth his moods. By the sixth grade, he was an all-star student. His picture still hangs in a hallway promoting good attendance: Abraham, in a yellow sweatshirt, grinning.It didn\u2019t last. By the time he got to Southside High, Abraham had made peace with his place in the social hierarchy. He was, as he put it, \u201cone of the outcasts.\u201d But he was O.K. with that. He did not crave being in the popular crowd, which would have been impossible anyway.He didn\u2019t have money for meals at the mall or the latest phone. He couldn\u2019t afford fashionable sneakers or jeans; Kristin shopped at Goodwill. When Mr. Needham bought sneakers for Abraham one year, he expected the teenager to pick out the most expensive style. He chose a modest pair.\u201cHe said, \u2018Mr. Needham, that is not me,\u2019\u201d the principal remembered. \u201c\u2018That is not who I am.\u2019\u201dAbraham was himself with a small, tight group of friends, which included Craig Wigginton, a tall, intense teenager who lived in a small apartment across town. They bonded over their backgrounds. Craig had spent his early childhood on the carnival circuit with his parents, his father, Rick Wigginton, said. His mother eventually left the family. Last year, when his father was sent to prison for a while, Craig was left alone to care for his younger brother. Abraham helped babysit.Abraham believed Craig was \u201ccollege professor brilliant.\u201d He sometimes walked eight miles across town to see him. But Craig made Kristin nervous. She was driving him and Abraham somewhere once and a woman in a hijab drove by. She remembers Craig pointing out the \u201csand monkey in a Cadillac.\u201d He seemed jealous.Mr. Wigginton said his son never used words like that around him. Craig did not respond to requests for comment for this piece.Craig was the friend Abraham wanted to meet up with the night he asked his mother for the van. Kristin let him take it. It would be four months before she learned what he\u2019d done with it.Fort Smith was on the edge of the United States when it appeared in 1817 as a military outpost in Indian Territory, along what is now the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. A federal judge, Isaac Parker, made the place famous in the 1870s by presiding over one of the most prolific courts in the country. Known as the \u201cHanging Judge,\u201d he sentenced 160 people to death; 79 were executed.Today, Fort Smith is a mix of the South and the West, a peanut butter cup of libertarian and Southern Baptist sensibilities. The Old South still haunts the place: A monument to the first white child born in Fort Smith, erected in 1936, still stands, barely noticed, in a small park behind a beverage distributorship. Southside High\u2019s Dixie fight song was not retired until 2015, and its Johnny Rebel mascot a year later \u2014 and not without a fight.But the New South is here, too. Vibrant murals adorn downtown buildings, including a 100-foot-tall painting of an African-American woman and an Apache man on a grain tower. And while the city had a precipitous decline in manufacturing jobs, its economy is now doing other things.In February, a Milwaukee-based real estate company bought the old Whirlpool building, where thousands of workers made refrigerators. A large \u201cAvailable\u201d sign is now stuck to its facade. Health care and transportation companies have been hiring, particularly people with an education. The city\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than the national average, and its population \u2014 88,000 \u2014 is up since the last census.Fort Smith may have its country clubs, but the city\u2019s residents are largely middle and lower-middle class. Some homes cost more than $1 million, but a typical home is around $113,000.No one knows exactly when the first Muslims immigrated to Fort Smith. Dr. Louay Nassri, a pediatric pulmonologist who is the president of Al Salam Mosque and who came to Fort Smith in 1980, said there was at least one Muslim living here in the early 1970s.Nearly 450 people attended the main Ramadan celebration in June, the closest thing the community has to a census. They are for the most part educated, affluent, integrated. Many are doctors. Others are accountants, business owners, professors and teachers.Hisham remembers when they were just a curiosity.\u201cBefore 9/11, people thought we were Mexican,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d go to Walmart and they\u2019d say, \u2018Como est\u00e1, amigo?\u2019 We were laughing. I said, \u2018Excuse me, I don\u2019t speak Spanish.\u2019 They say, \u2018Where you from?\u2019 I say Palestine. They say, \u2018I never heard about it.\u2019 I say, \u2018I think you hear about Israel, right?\u2019 They say yes. I say, \u2018That\u2019s my homeland.\u2019\u201dEach family adapted in its own way.Dr. Hania Al-Shahrouri, a kidney specialist from Jordan, got used to people staring at her head covering. Wearing a hijab in the United States is as much an act of bravery as it is an act of faith, she said. When she first moved to Fort Smith, a man walked up to her in the grocery store.\u201cIn our religion, we don\u2019t hit our women,\u201d he said. \u201cWe let them wear whatever they want.\u201dTall and confident, with the poise of a ballet dancer, Dr. Al-Shahrouri tells herself that people stare because she is pretty, or because they like the color of her hijab. But she worries that her children, including her 13-year-old daughter, may not be able to summon the same self-confidence. So she wields what weapons she has to protect them: her status as a doctor and her wealth. She drives a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle. She carries an expensive hand bag.She doesn\u2019t like herself for it, but she knows that money commands respect, and in some ways, the Muslims who have it are often spared the bigotry that can bedevil those who do not.Mr. Bensalah understands, too. He came to Fort Smith from Morocco in 2000 to attend college. His first job was as a dishwasher. He fell in love with and married a local woman whose family refused to accept him \u2014 more because of his skin color, he said, though looking back it was also probably his religion.\u201cThey kept telling her, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you marrying your own kind?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhite women were supposed to marry white men.\u201dOn Sept. 25, 2001, his wife was in the hospital for the birth of their first child, and several of her relatives stopped him from entering the building. Standing outside, pleading with them to no avail, was one of the worst experiences of his life, he said. He did not witness the birth of his son. Nor did he tell his mother that he had become a father, fearing she would try to visit.\u201cI saw the power of anger and ignorance,\u201d he said.Determined, Mr. Bensalah wore down his in-laws with wit and generosity. He started with the smokers, standing around and cracking jokes. He bought beer. He went hunting. One day he came home from his job as an accountant to find his wife\u2019s cousin on his couch, and they talked for hours. The man became addicted to drugs, and Mr. Bensalah visited him in the hospital after he overdosed. He brought a Bible. As the man recovered, Mr. Bensalah taught him how to budget. He told him that he was worth something. Now the man lives in Colorado with three kids, a wife, and a good job at a mining company.Out of the worst of America could come the best of America.This is what makes Dr. Al-Shahrouri love the United States fiercely: There may be bigotry, but the system is fair, she said. She remembers entering a kidney transplant ward in 2004 with her medical team in San Antonio and being told to leave by the patient\u2019s wife, who raved that Dr. Al-Shahrouri would kill her husband \u201clike they killed us on 9/11.\u201d The doctor in charge warned the woman that if Dr. Al-Shahrouri wasn\u2019t allowed to treat her husband, no one would. Then the entire medical team walked out.On the night of Feb. 17, nearly four months after the mosque was vandalized, the police came to Abraham\u2019s house with a warrant for his arrest. Noah thought it was a case of mistaken identity. His brother had been in trouble twice before \u2014 once for having pot paraphernalia in his backpack, once for hanging around too late on a playground \u2014 but nothing that had required a $15,000 bond.Abraham wasn\u2019t home, but Noah knew where he was. \u201cDude, the cops came to arrest you,\u201d he said, driving to pick Abraham up in the minivan so that he could turn himself in. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201dLater, when Abraham really thought about it, he saw so many things that had brought him to this point. Too much Kentucky Deluxe. An inescapable feeling of worthlessness. Unquestioning loyalty to his friends.Craig lifted Abraham up. He made him feel good about himself. A history buff, Craig liked to use Hitler as an example, Abraham said.\u201cHe said, \u2018I understand Hitler did bad things, but on the other side of the coin he is the shining example of why no one can ever say that one man can\u2019t change the world,\u2019\u201d Abraham recounted. \u201c\u2018He was just one man from a broken country that was being destroyed by its debts, and he turned it into the most formidable fighting force and almost took over the world.\u2019\u201dAbraham, Craig and another friend, Ezra Pedraza, would sit around in Kristin\u2019s garage, amusing themselves with conspiracy theories and talking about their lives. Ezra went with them on the night of the vandalism.\u201cHe used to tell me and Ezra that we have the power to change the environment around us, too, to do great things and to shape this world,\u201d Abraham said.Abraham understands how the attack on the mosque looks. The swastikas. The reference to the Crusades. Craig\u2019s father said he was horrified at his son\u2019s use of swastikas. Abraham argued that these were intended not as expressions of racism or white power, but merely as the most offensive images they could conjure \u2014 a kind of measure of their manly capacity to shock.Mr. Bensalah said the symbols had their desired effect precisely because they were racist and threatening. Simple insults would not have gotten people\u2019s attention. But swastikas did.\u201cA swastika is a small act of terrorism if you think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, yes, it\u2019s scary.\u201dFor all the regret and penance that the act of vandalism caused Abraham, the decision to commit it took no time at all. The three friends had been drinking and talking about ISIS, he said. Craig was angry about American soldiers being killed, about children dying.And then an impulse: \u201cLet\u2019s retaliate.\u201dThey got into the white van, and Abraham drove to the mosque on South 28th Street. They went to the other mosque in town that night, too, and drew on it as well.Abraham burns with regret now. At their ignorance, for lumping all Muslims together. \u201cThat\u2019s like meeting one racist, and you say all white guys are like him,\u201d he said.At his weakness, for not stopping it: \u201cI wish I could go back in time and say, \u2018Hey, dumbass, I\u2019m the future you, and I\u2019m telling you, don\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201dBut he\u2019d done it. And now he was on his way to jail in the passenger seat of his mom\u2019s white van. Noah drove by the house so Abraham could say goodbye. His mother was sobbing in big, deep gulps. He had felt it before, the dead weight of her disappointment. It made him feel disgusting.\u201cShe cried like a woman who had just got broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about that a lot. It\u2019s stuff like that that hurts you while you are in jail. You replay and replay. It\u2019s torture on your mind. Worse than any knife.\u201dIf Abraham had $1,580 for a bail bond, he could have waited for his court date at home. But his family couldn\u2019t get the money together. So he waited in jail.At the Sebastian County Adult Detention Center, a hulking building with window slits like mail slots, he became the third person in a two-man cell with drafty concrete floors and two metal beds sticking out of the wall.Abraham was given a sheet and a thin blue sleeping pad, with a pillow area sewn into one end where the stuffing had been torn out. His skinny body was on high alert. He felt cold a lot. He barely slept the first week.Jail reminded him of high school. The prison guards were like the popular kids, lording their power over everybody else. The days were long and boring. People were constantly sizing each other up. New inmates quickly adapted to a rigid social hierarchy.Pretty much every group was represented. He made friends with a black man who was into Japanese cartoons and a Muslim who showed him the Quran. He had never seen one. The man told Abraham not to bother to look for the part where martyrdom brings 72 virgins. \u201cHe said it wasn\u2019t there and he knew because he had looked for it himself,\u201d Abraham said, laughing.There were white supremacists of several varieties. One took an interest in Abraham after learning that he had vandalized the mosque, even offered him a tattoo. Abraham told Noah later that he had said no.It took a month and several upsetting tangles with a confusing appointment system for Kristin to arrange her first visit with Abraham in jail. When she finally saw his face behind the glass, she started to cry. He did, too. Recounting this scene later, he raised his two hands to his cheeks and said, \u201cTwo rivers.\u201dThe telephone for talking through the glass barely worked. They laughed about it. Abraham\u2019s mouth moved, but the sound came out delayed, or not at all, like an old kung fu movie. Kristin and Noah visited every Saturday after that.Abraham had spent his entire life trying to become strong enough to protect his family, but it was not until jail, he said, that he realized that he was the one who had inflicted the most hurt. He felt a powerful urge to set things right.The letter to the mosque, he said, was a first step.\u201cI was just so tired of doing the wrong thing,\u201d he said.He was terrified of going to prison. But his fate was out of his hands. And, anyway, the truth was out: The mosque\u2019s security camera had captured the act.Abraham did not know the mosque\u2019s address, so he mailed it to his mother, with a small note asking her to deliver it. The postmark was Feb. 22.\u201cDear Masjid Al Salam Mosque,\u201d Abraham wrote. \u201cI know you guys probably don\u2019t want to hear from me at all but I really want to get this to y\u2019all. I\u2019m so sorry about having a hand in vandalising your mosque. It was wrong and y\u2019all did not deserve to have that done to you. I hurt y\u2019all and I am haunted by it. And even after all this you still forgave me. You are much better people than I.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me, and that is honestly really scary. But I just wouldn\u2019t want to keep going on without trying to make amends. I wish I could undo the pain I helped to cause. I used to walk by your mosque a lot and ask myself why I would do that. I don\u2019t even hate Muslims. Or anyone for that matter.\u201cAll in all,\u201d he concluded, \u201cI just want to say I\u2019m sorry.\u201dNoah drove the letter to the mosque on a Friday. He took off his shoes as a sign of respect and introduced himself. Dr. Nassri was moved. No one had expected to hear from the vandals. Certainly not like this.Dr. Nassri called a meeting of senior members of the mosque. Hisham was there. So was Mr. Bensalah, the accountant from Morocco.The sermon had just reminded them of their duty as Muslims to forgive. It didn\u2019t take them long to do it.\u201cIf one of my kids did something stupid like that I would want them to be forgiven,\u201d Mr. Bensalah said.Later, when Dr. Nassri met with a man from the prosecutor\u2019s office, he made clear that the mosque did not want to press charges and strongly opposed a felony charge for Abraham.\u201cWe did not want this to destroy his life,\u201d Dr. Nassri said.The long wooden benches in the gallery of Courtroom 201 were already packed on May 24, the day of Abraham\u2019s hearing. Nearly everyone was white. Most of the defendants were poor.The morning unfolded in a relentless stream of misery over crimes like drug possession and writing bad checks.Kristin and Noah walked in at 9 a.m. sharp. Noah, in his best jeans and plaid shirt, sat with his chin in his hands. Kristin kept nervously shifting in her seat. Hisham walked in, wearing jeans and an electric-lime shirt. He wedged himself in next to Kristin, but had no idea who she was.Abraham\u2019s case had taken an unexpected turn.Dr. Nassri had gone to meet the prosecutors again. They had bad news: Abraham would have to plead guilty to a felony, not a mere misdemeanor, or face a trial. He would avoid prison, but only if he remained on good behavior for three years. Any minor violation could land him behind bars for six years. The best outcome he could hope for would be to get a judge to seal his record \u2014 in eight years.Dr. Nassri was taken aback. \u201cI said, \u2018You guys are asking for more than we want,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey call us the victims, and the victims say, \u2018Hey, guys, loosen up!\u2019\u201dBut the prosecutors were unmoved. Daniel Shue, the head prosecuting attorney, said that actions had consequences and that all three men had participated. And this was not just a run-of-the-mill vandalism, it was an act of bigotry.The mosque\u2019s camera had captured Craig in the act of writing, and his punishment was steepest. The prosecutor said that there was no clear proof that either of the other two had done any writing but that no one could know without a trial.The law was straightforward: If the spray painting and other vandalism cost the mosque more than $1,000 to repair, the case was a felony. Anything equal or less than that was a misdemeanor. Dr. Nassri submitted paperwork showing the mosque had spent only $500 on cleanup. But the prosecutor\u2019s office sought its own estimate from a local restoration company, which claimed the damage would cost about $1,800 to clean up.Abraham\u2019s public defender told him that they could attack that evidence at trial. But Abraham wanted to get out of jail.Around 11:15 a.m., he shuffled into the courtroom through a side door in an orange jump suit and leg irons. Craig was with him. Ezra Pedraza, who had been out on bail, wore a plaid shirt and jeans.The prosecutor noted that the victims \u201casked for mercy and leniency.\u201dThe judge looked out at the defendants. \u201cMercy. Hmmm.\u201dHe accepted their pleas. Then he lectured them.\u201cIf the victims in this case had not approved of this, I would not have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou would have gone to trial, and there is a good chance all three of you would have gone to prison. So you need to think twice before you do something, which is just stupid. What you did was just stupid.\u201dKristin, losing patience, said under her breath: \u201cThank you. Point taken.\u201dIt is summer in Fort Smith. The sun is searing. On Hisham\u2019s car lot, small fruit trees and vegetables grow in dirt-filled kiddie swimming pools. He is already harvesting figs and hot peppers, as well as Syrian thyme and mint that he uses to flavor his visitors\u2019 tea.Hisham believes the vandalism of his mosque was one of the best things to happen to the Muslims of Fort Smith. The crime allowed them to reveal themselves \u2014 to say, \u201cWe are your doctors, your accountants and your used-car salesmen.\u201d They now have a relationship with the synagogue in town. Several members, including Dr. Al-Shahrouri, the kidney specialist, have begun speaking to local audiences about Islam.Hisham was reminded of a saying from the Quran.\u201cYou might hate something that happens to you, but actually it\u2019s excellent for you,\u201d he said, sitting in his small, cluttered shop, surrounded by artifacts of his life: a revolving display of birthday key chains, a giant dried bean pod the size of an arm, an Elvis belt buckle and two plaques he got in the mail after he donated to a Sept. 11 fund. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to us: Something very bad. But very good result.\u201dBut Hisham also doesn\u2019t like how hard it is to get a second chance in America. You can do a stupid thing and pay for it, but afterward no one will hire you. Hisham has helped two men in this situation. They do odd jobs at his car lot. He went to court with them when no one else would. He helped one buy a washing machine, and paid for the other to bury a relative.\u201cSomeone messes up and it sticks with him all his life,\u201d Hisham said. \u201cEven if he tries to become a good man, the community say to him, \u2018You are a bad man!\u2019 They encourage him to be a bad man.\u201dFor Abraham, jail became a dividing line between the mistakes of his past and some unknown future.When Noah first saw his brother after he was released, Abraham was standing alone outside the jail, holding an envelope and a Bible. Noah parked the car and jumped out without shutting his door, sprinting across the street to embrace him.Back at home, Abraham\u2019s family gathered around him in the driveway, laughing and talking. The night was warm, and the stars were out. Gabriel was ecstatic, hopping up and down.\u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed,\u201d Abraham said, looking at the sky.Kristin wanted to sing a song with her son: \u201cFind Your Wings,\u201d by the Christian singer Mark Harris. They sang, haltingly and softly, in harmony:\u201cThat\u2019s my boy,\u201d Kristin said, beaming at Abraham. \u201cThat\u2019s my baby boy.\u201dBut he was now a felon, and there were daily reminders of that. A police car regularly circled their block. He had community service to perform, and within a few days he was sorting donations at a Goodwill store.He owed about $3,200 in fines and restitution, but landing a job would be harder now. Kristin found about 20 employers in Fort Smith that hired felons. Abraham wanted to fill out paper applications but was told to apply online. He did not have a computer, which meant he had to go to the library whenever he needed one.His family\u2019s finances had not improved while he was away. The day he started at Goodwill, the water was cut off at the house and the phone was about to be disconnected.He felt embarrassed to tell people what he had done, like the manager at Goodwill, who recognized Abraham from when he used to come in as a boy. But he would feel better afterward, as if confessing was helping him grow some stub of a new self.It was a daily struggle. \u201cI wake up and look in the mirror and I just think, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u201d Abraham said.He wanted badly to visit the mosque, to say hello and thank the people there. Dr. Nassri had asked the prosecutor to allow Abraham to come, but was told no. Mr. Bensalah suggested meeting Abraham in a cafe, but the public defender advised against it.After he got out of jail, Abraham posted a note on Facebook.\u201cWell, I\u2019m home now,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI just want to say thank you to all those who have been supporting me and a big thanks to the guys at the mosque who have been supportive and helpful and I pray blessings over them.\u201dThe next day, he saw a response from Wasim, Hisham\u2019s son.\u201cBro move on with life we forgave you from the first time you apologized don\u2019t let that mistake bring you down,\u201d he had written. And then, Abraham\u2019s favorite line: \u201cI speak for the whole Muslim community of fort smith we love you and want you to be the best example in life we don\u2019t hold grudges against anybody!\u201dIt was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "American Exasperation and Australian Humor", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 22_____In my case, I often feel as though I never see the United States quite so clearly as I do when I\u2019ve just returned after a long time away, which was the case last week. I was home for a wedding, a bit of work and a little vacation, and at every stop, I found myself marveling at the sheer American-ness of conversations and experiences.Americans Are ExhaustedLove him or hate him, Donald Trump seems to be wearing people out.Many of the journalists I talked to seemed spent, tired from covering a country that seems to convulse again and again, with each passing week. And among voters on opposite sides of the Trump divide, I heard a lot of exasperation and not a whole lot of understanding.A few Trump critics I saw at my friend\u2019s wedding chewed over every speech and every new development after the Charlottesville protests; others seemed to have less capacity for continuous outrage, offering little more than an \u201cI know\u201d and a shake of the head, asking how anyone could see any Trump as a positive force.Meanwhile, Trump supporters I know chose not to engage. One of my brothers, a Trump voter, said he\u2019d expected chaos given that Trump is taking on a broken system. During a long car ride, he told me he figured the news coverage of Charlottesville would just be more of the same, from more of the people who want Trump gone. He never even watched Trump\u2019s controversial speeches (though he may have now after I insisted he watch the raw clips).What I sensed in that conversation and many others was less a desire to find middle ground than a craving for calm, in a country drowning in political adrenaline.Empowered, for Good and IllOn a subway train in Manhattan last week, a petite Asian woman with a thick accent scolded me for not noticing that there was a pregnant woman near the doors who needed a seat.I quickly got up, effusive with apology. Then I thought: Would that exchange have happened in Sydney?There was no denying that the woman felt empowered. Once I stood, she started talking to me \u2014 loudly \u2014 about all the other men in the subway car who had been there longer and seen the mother-to-be and stayed seated. And what could be more American than that?Australians often remark on the American love affair with individual rights over the collective (it\u2019s what explains American gun laws, they correctly note), and on my trip home, I again saw how much of American life continues to be shaped by that individualist ethos.Yes, it drives politics. The American propensity for self-empowerment fuels both the white nationalist and anti-racist counter-protester.But what I found equally striking during this last trip was the degree to which it governs smaller, more intimate interactions. Americans call each other out, often. There\u2019s a comfort with inquiry and confrontation that, coming from another country, seems peculiar \u2014 or so it did to me.Efficiency or BustThis is a more minor point, but wow, the United States \u2014 or rather New York \u2014 sure does strive for maximum efficiency.I almost forgot what it was like to get dirty looks for walking too slowly on Manhattan sidewalks. I found it odd that at wine stores, restaurants and cafes the staff eagerly attended to my every need, delivering quick, friendly service, consistently.I won\u2019t delve into the possible reasons (yes, there are many, and I\u2019m not concluding which country\u2019s service economy is better or worse overall) but here\u2019s what hit me at one point: Sydneysiders are competitive about anything having to do with sports. New Yorkers are competitive with customer care.In the meantime, check out another batch of New York Times stories you might have otherwise missed below, plus a roundup of your responses to my last newsletter (especially on the question of whether Australians are quicker to joke than self-reflect).______________________________Here\u2019s a sampling, lightly edited for space and clarity. Thanks to all who contributed.It\u2019s been a revelation to me elsewhere to see women accused of being highly emotional or crying at work, because Australian girls learn very early on not to cry. The penalty for crying at school or being over emotional is quite severe.That friendly attitude can become a coded form of attack with which to shut out people, or shut down difficult conversations (particularly those that are critical of the dominant culture). The compulsion to be blokey and tough, to let everything slide off your back for better or worse, dismisses an individual\u2019s experience and opinion. It also allows people to brush off horrible behaviour with the excuse of \u201cjust having a laugh,\u201d expecting others to buck up and move on.Watching from a distance, these lesser aspects of Aussie nature seem to be playing out horrifically in our current politics.\u2014 Tenille BonoguoreIn my experience, this just doesn\u2019t happen with Australians. If the topic strays into serious territory, everyone needs to be smiling and joking. As soon as the smiles disappear, someone will crack a joke and change the topic.I think Damien\u2019s observations are spot on \u2014 we are a friendly people (we prioritize fun and laughter) but that\u2019s mixed in with a touch of anti-intellectualism (because we don\u2019t like tall poppies). Personally, I find this both an endearing and incredibly frustrating aspect of our culture.\u2014 Marleena ForwardIt often surprised my companions when I explained that I found no humour in the statements. I was obliged with, \u201cYou Americans are so politically correct.\u201d I think some of us are somewhat more socially aware and slightly more socially responsible.\u2014 Sydnye AllenMany people protest all of these aspects of modern Australia in different ways, through art, plays, novels, movies, petitions, protests.\u2014 Gabrielle Herderschee-Hunter\u2014 Tim ElliottAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alice Waters on Sex, Drugs and Sustainable Agriculture", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERKELEY, Calif. \u2014 Alice Waters took LSD only once. She spent most of the night floating near the ceiling, ignoring the molecules moving in the wood grain of the floorboards.Of course it was the best. This is Alice Waters, for whom the provenance of everything she puts in her mouth is paramount.Ms. Waters wrote the book, which Clarkson Potter will publish on Sept. 5, reluctantly. It is the last in a three-book deal she signed more than a decade ago, and the least collaborative of the dozen books that bear her name. To produce it, she spent a year telling stories to Bob Carrau, a writer and longtime family friend. Cristina Mueller, a writer who once worked as her assistant, took dictation.Sprinkled with photographs, the book traces Ms. Waters\u2019s years as a European backpacker smitten with France and as a young radical cooking for the Bay Area\u2019s antiwar intelligentsia. It ends the night the enthusiastic but very green cook opened her tiny, fixed-price French restaurant.But for Ms. Waters, now 73 and still flitting through the kitchen at Chez Panisse to snag bites of prosciutto and ordering that the dining room shades be lifted to better capture the late afternoon California light, the book is something of a mike drop.Although she has never been afraid of ridicule, Ms. Waters says she has entered a phase in which neither praise nor criticism mean all that much to her.\u201cI feel reassured about the content because it is what I experienced,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t not be honest.\u201dShe drives an Audi (the cover to the center console is missing), often calling her assistant to determine the best route through the Bay Area\u2019s brutal traffic. Her few concessions to fame include a prime parking spot on Saturdays at the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market in San Francisco.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about making money,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was never the goal.\u201dStill, Ms. Waters has not set foot in a conventional grocery store for 25 years. She remains devoted to the idea that all food should be organic, beautiful and eaten communally.That approach, which once seemed strident and economically tone deaf, has seeped into everyday food culture. Ms. Waters\u2019s image has softened into that of a grandmotherly sage whose wisdom young people especially seem eager to hear.Ms. Waters is the reason restaurants started naming farms on menus and serving mesclun salads and American-made goat cheese.Yet she continues to play a kind of small ball that, over the years, has proved powerful. She has never expanded Chez Panisse to other cities, or jumped fully into celebrity in ways that could have promoted her agenda. Rather, she prefers to personally cajole every politician, journalist and philanthropist she meets.But even in Berkeley, Ms. Waters\u2019s ideas haven\u2019t been realized. Although her foundation paid for a chef to engineer a radical change in the district\u2019s food program, Berkeley schools still don\u2019t serve food that meets her standards.Ms. Waters hates the word \u201cscaling,\u201d calling it a fast-food-culture term.\u201cI leveraged myself in the best of all possible ways,\u201d she said. \u201cI have given a philosophy of food which I learned from the French to everybody who works at the restaurant, and they take those values and make them their own.\u201dShe remains singularly focused on what seems impossible in the current political climate: giving all American children free organic food at school and tying it into the curriculum. \u201cFeeding children is a moral issue,\u201d she said.To that end, she is pondering new ways to raise money through taxes, or from investors like Jeff Bezos. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a letter to him,\u201d she said.She sees parallels between the state of politics today and the battles of 50 years ago, but her strategy is not to fight directly.\u201cNow is not the time,\u201d she said over dinner in the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse. \u201cWe\u2019re like the French underground. We are passing notes to each other. But soon there will be something, an event, and we will come forward together. No one knows how powerful we are. We are vigilantes.\u201dMs. Waters ordered a couple of salads, one built with arugula and prosciutto and another of purslane, cucumbers and Charentais melon. A dish of roasted Monterey Bay squid came to the table, along with a tangle of hand-cut, herbed noodles with chanterelles and thyme.She asked a waiter to fill her glass with ros\u00e9 and then not bring any more. More than a glass or two makes her too sleepy, she said. Not as in the old days, which she writes about in the book with lighthearted relish.Ms. Waters describes drunken high school romps in the back seats of cars and subsequent pregnancy scares, a love of men and drink so powerful it got her kicked out of a college sorority on morals charges, and trips across Europe that did as much to provoke her culinary awakening as her sexual one.She approaches other revelations with more sobriety. There was an attempted rape by a man who sneaked into her bedroom with a knife in the mid-1970s. She survived by jumping out a second-floor window, an incident that helped build a kind of steely resolve and confidence.Ms. Waters writes with great affection about the men who were her big loves and shaped her views on film, music and politics, as well as the look and feel of the restaurant.These days, Ms. Waters is more of an executive editor than a chef at Chez Panisse. She eats there every day when she is town, offering many, many suggestions.\u201cI hope everybody can see that I have a valuable role as a critic, because I\u2019ve been there since the beginning and I\u2019ve seen the restaurant go through lots of changes,\u201d she writes.Still, she knows people sometimes don\u2019t ask for her opinion because she can be what might charitably be called insistent. To that end, Ms. Waters has worked on becoming more polite, saying please and thank you to the people under her umbrella.Ms. Waters lives alone now. She has never liked being alone, even as a child. Her last romantic relationship ended a couple of years ago. She is always looking for a new one because she is, above all else, a romantic. But she has some specific ideas about it.\u201cYounger men are my Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d she said.Her friends, like the former restaurant critic and Gourmet editor Ruth Reichl, worry that she won\u2019t find someone who can go the distance with her.\u201cWith Alice, you have to march to her tune,\u201d Ms. Reichl said. \u201cAnybody who is strong enough to take her on isn\u2019t going to do what she wants to do.\u201d\u201cMy mom is a hummingbird burrowing into flowers,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s so captivating you can\u2019t help but be rapt.\u201dMs. Waters\u2019s plan has always been to spend her later years in a multigenerational commune of her own design. \u201cI\u2019d better get busy on that,\u201d she said.And then?There will be no afterlife, she said. \u201cI\u2019m an ashes-to-ashes kind of person.\u201dcookingslide showAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Introduces a Dedicated Home for Videos", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook is coming for broadcast television. And YouTube. And Netflix. And every other place for video.On Wednesday, Facebook introduced Watch, a dedicated home for videos in the social network.Watch is a redesign of the site\u2019s current video tab, altered in a way intended to entice people to watch for longer stretches and return regularly to view shows, including the first programs funded by the company. The idea is that when users open Watch, the latest episodes of their favorite shows will be there waiting for them.Facebook is betting that adding a social component to online video consumption \u2014 the ability to chat with people in your network during a show or knowing what\u2019s popular among your friends \u2014 will make the experience notably different from YouTube and Netflix.For example, Watch will highlight different shows under categories such as \u201cMost Talked About\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s Making People Laugh.\u201d Facebook said the videos that will appear in Watch will be pulled from creators and publishers who have created \u201cShow\u201d pages on Facebook \u2014 akin to how some small businesses create a dedicated page.Facebook said the show pages would also provide a way for dedicated fans to interact with the shows\u2019 creators beyond merely watching the episodes.\u201cMore and more people are coming to Facebook with the intention of watching videos,\u201d said Fidji Simo, who leads Facebook\u2019s video efforts. \u201cThis is the next step.\u201dTo encourage more people to create shows for Watch, Facebook said it would expand its video advertisement monetization program, which shares revenue from commercials that appear during videos. Facebook has limited the number of content creators who can take advantage of the program during a testing phase.Many Facebook users see videos only as they scroll past a friend\u2019s wedding photos or a cousin\u2019s political rant, unlike YouTube users who visit that site for the purpose of watching videos. As advertising dollars earmarked for television move online, Facebook is seeking a way to coax its huge audience \u2014 two billion users monthly \u2014 to see it as a destination for video.YouTube has said its mobile viewers watch videos for more than an hour a day on average. Facebook has not disclosed the time its users spend viewing, but it is expected to be much less. The Watch initiative could change that; Facebook said it expects the videos within Watch to be longer than the videos users find in their Newsfeeds.The shows that will appear in Watch are a mix of videos that are already popular on Facebook \u2014 like \u201cNas Daily,\u201d a series that chronicles the travels of a social media star around the world \u2014 and original programs funded by Facebook.Among the shows Facebook is paying for are \u201cReturning the Favor,\u201d a show about inspiring people starring Mike Rowe, who was the host of \u201cDirty Jobs.\u201dWatch will also feature live programming, including one Major League Baseball game a week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defendants Kept in the Dark About Evidence, Until It\u2019s Too Late", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "New York is one of 10 states where prosecutors can wait until just before trial to share evidence, which critics say is unfair. But a new bill could change the rules.Supported byIn September 2013, a fight broke out on the sidewalk outside the Bronx nightclub where Aaron Cedres worked as a bouncer. It was a confusing scrum of about a dozen people, and one man suffered a broken jaw and deep slashes to his head and back.A month later, Mr. Cedres \u2014 then a 25-year-old father with no criminal record \u2014 was charged with gang assault, which carried the prospect of 25 years in prison. Cameras had been posted outside the club, and the prosecutor said the tapes looked bad for Mr. Cedres, his lawyer recalled.Mr. Cedres was offered a plea deal: five years behind bars. He insisted that he had thrown one punch to help break up two men, and he urged his lawyer to get the footage.But Mr. Cedres was up against entrenched legal practices. New York is one of 10 states where prosecutors can wait until just before trial to turn over witness names and statements and other key evidence known as discovery, which backs up criminal charges. It is a strategic advantage that critics call unfair and unnecessary.Some discovery \u2014 such as video footage \u2014 is supposed to be turned over on request, but defense attorneys complain that the requests are often countered, delayed or ignored. They say the restrictive discovery rules put people like Mr. Cedres into a high-stakes dilemma: Plead guilty without seeing all the evidence, or risk a trial that could end in a prison sentence much longer than what they might get under a plea.Most take the deal. According to the State Division of Criminal Justice Services, more than 98 percent of felony arrests that end in convictions occur through a guilty plea, not a trial, a slightly higher number than national figures.For decades, legislation to require prosecutors to turn over evidence earlier has run into stiff opposition from New York\u2019s district attorneys, who present a powerful counterargument: the safety of witnesses. More than a dozen such bills have failed in the past quarter-century.Now, the politics show signs of shifting, and a renewed effort is underway to push the Legislature to overhaul state discovery rules, following the example of traditionally more conservative states such as North Carolina and Texas.This year, the New York State Bar Association for the first time is throwing its weight behind a new Assembly bill requiring prosecutors to automatically turn over police reports, witness names and statements, and grand jury testimony early in a case. Their endeavor is backed by the Legal Aid Society and the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that helps exonerate people who have been wrongly convicted, although it faces a difficult road. There is no companion bill in the Senate, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has not embraced the idea.At the same time, the state court system is considering providing judges with a new tool to ensure that prosecutors turn over potentially exculpatory information.\u201cWhen I was a cop, I always believed the criminal justice system was on the level,\u201d said Mr. Berkley, who was a critic of some departmental practices and who has four brothers who have served time in prison. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed now to say that.\u201dThe efforts in New York reflect a national trend toward more open discovery laws. Ohio broadened its laws in 2010. New Jersey and Utah now require that discovery be provided before a guilty plea. The American Bar Association, whose standards often serve as models for state laws, has convened a task force to update its criminal discovery standards for the first time in more than 20 years.Even in New York, some prosecutors already go beyond what the law requires. The Brooklyn district attorney\u2019s office has long provided open and early discovery in most cases. The acting district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said his office sometimes sought protective orders to shield vulnerable witnesses or, more rarely, to relocate them.\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to find the right balance in how to keep our witnesses safe and also make sure the process is as transparent and open as possible,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said.State lawmakers, facing resistance from prosecutors, have been reluctant to follow that tide.Prosecutors describe frightening encounters between the accused and witnesses and warn of violence in a \u201cno snitching\u201d culture intensified by social media. Prosecutors say the current law helps protect witnesses by allowing them to withhold witness information indefinitely, since so few cases go to trial.Jack Ryan, the chief assistant district attorney in the Queens district attorney\u2019s office, recalled a recent case in which a witness was photographed on his way into the courthouse.\u201cBefore the witness even testified, that video was uploaded on Facebook identifying the guy as a snitch,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a legitimate fear.\u201dMr. Cedres and his lawyer, Kristin Bruan, said that at first he had refused the plea deal, but that as the months had worn on, he had begun to consider it. Pending felony charges meant that he lost his job, then his apartment and car. His girlfriend moved into her mother\u2019s house with the couple\u2019s infant daughter, and Mr. Cedres was homeless.Ms. Bruan wondered if Mr. Cedres accurately remembered the chaotic event, or if his single punch was enough to make him guilty under the law. Prosecutors in this case turned over police reports indicating that the victim and his girlfriend had found Mr. Cedres on Facebook, identified him as a leader of the assault and were willing to testify. But they still had not turned over the surveillance video.\u201cWithout that video, our guy was going to prison,\u201d said Ms. Bruan, a staff attorney with the Legal Aid Society.Ms. Bruan filed a motion for discovery shortly after Mr. Cedres was arrested. Under the law, the prosecution had 15 days to hand over the material or explain why it would not. Fifteen days passed with no reply, then 30, Ms. Bruan said.Judges have few available sanctions for prosecutors who do not comply with discovery requests.The judge who presided over a later stage of Mr. Cedres\u2019s case, Troy K. Webber, said a judge could have ordered the video tossed out of the case. But that would have wrongly punished the defense, she said in an interview.\u201cYou have to hope the people will turn over the video,\u201d said Justice Webber, who now sits on a state appellate court.More than two months after Ms. Bruan\u2019s initial request, the prosecutor wrote that the video \u201cdoes not show anything/is corrupted,\u201d an email shows. Ms. Bruan pushed back, and after five more months of wrangling, the videos appeared in her inbox.They showed almost exactly what Mr. Cedres had said they would: In the mayhem, he threw two punches to free the club owner\u2019s son from a bear hug. A separate fight spilled down the street, where a crowd of people beat the man who was ultimately seriously injured. After a year and a half and 22 court appearances, the charges were dismissed.Patrice O\u2019Shaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx district attorney\u2019s office, declined to comment on the case.After Mr. Cedres lost his job, he was arrested a number of times for petty offenses such as jumping subway turnstiles. He now lives with his mother and earns money as a driver, but he said his stability felt fragile.\u201cI\u2019m getting little things back, but I shouldn\u2019t have lost it to begin with,\u201d Mr. Cedres said.Prosecutors are supposed to turn over evidence that is favorable to the accused \u2014 called Brady material after a landmark 1963 Supreme Court decision \u2014 regardless of other discovery rules. But the Supreme Court never set deadlines, and lower courts have split over whether Brady material must be turned over before a plea.What constitutes such evidence is left to prosecutors to determine, and the line is not always clear.But the deadline in the order would be 30 days before trial \u2014 well after most plea negotiations have taken place.Kimberly Overton, a prosecutor who runs training programs for the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys, said a 2004 state law requiring prosecutors there to turn over most of their files automatically very early in a case helped to clear up any potential ambiguity over Brady material. \u201cThere is no decision for a prosecutor to make now,\u201d she said.Adding to the ambiguity is that discovery policies vary not only by state but also by prosecutor.While Brooklyn has a more open policy, the Queens district attorney\u2019s office will negotiate pleas only before a grand jury indictment, a point when the law requires no discovery at all \u2014 and sometimes before there is time to thoroughly examine the evidence it has.\u201cWe disclose what we need to disclose,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.More than a dozen defense lawyers and judges who practice in Manhattan said the district\u2019s attorney\u2019s office there hewed closely to the restrictive state law. Even the name of the accuser is routinely withheld until the eve of trial, they said.The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., disputed the characterization. \u201cWe do provide more than the law allows already,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the file, we tell our assistants to turn it over, except in situations that involve witness safety.\u201dIn late May, Mr. Vance\u2019s office announced a new policy to provide discovery at arraignment in some felony cases when the main witness is a police officer.Mr. Ryan and Mr. Vance acknowledged that defense lawyers who had good relationships with prosecutors were apt to get an earlier crack at discovery than others.\u201cWhen serious lawyers understand they\u2019re dealing with serious lawyers on the other side, that usually leads to a level of trust that accelerates discovery,\u201d Mr. Vance said.Faster discovery, advocates of the change argue, can lead to fairer outcomes. This happened in the case of Winston Jones.In November, Mr. Jones was arrested and charged with breaking into a Brooklyn bodega and stealing Red Bulls, cigarettes and cash. At 35, Mr. Jones had been arrested in connection with dozens of petty crimes, but this time he was charged with burglary, a felony.Prosecutors offered him a plea: one and a half to three years in prison if he took the offer on the spot, said his attorney, Scott Hechinger of Brooklyn Defender Services.Mr. Jones\u2019s memory of the night was blurred by alcohol, but he did not view the crime as serious. He refused, and was sent to Rikers Island.Because of Brooklyn\u2019s discovery policy, three months after his arrest Mr. Jones was able to read the grand jury testimony of an employee who recognized him from surveillance videos. He saw himself on tape, rummaging through coolers and slurring his words.After insisting that he had done nothing, Mr. Jones began to talk about a lifetime of alcohol abuse. Mr. Hechinger took this back to the negotiating table, and in June, Mr. Jones pleaded guilty to attempted burglary in exchange for inpatient drug and alcohol treatment. If he does well, he will avoid prison, and the case will be dismissed and sealed.James Yates, who in 1979 helped draft New York\u2019s current discovery law as a young Assembly staff member and who went on to serve more than 18 years as a state judge, said he believed the law had been \u201cabused, twisted and turned\u201d to withhold information.But he said he was skeptical that the new bill pending in the Legislature would overcome opposition by prosecutors.If the law changes, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see a huge increase in crime because no one\u2019s going to cooperate,\u201d said Scott McNamara, the district attorney of Oneida County and the president-elect of the state district attorneys association, which has opposed changes to New York\u2019s discovery rules.As one of many examples, Mr. McNamara cited the 2013 case of David McKithen, who was facing drug possession charges in Buffalo when he obtained grand jury testimony of witnesses through discovery. Soon after, witnesses said, they and their families began receiving threats. One refused to answer questions on the stand. Mr. McKithen was found guilty of witness tampering and intimidation.A New York State Bar Association report concluded that states with more open systems did not have worse problems with witness intimidation than New York. In Brooklyn, Mr. Gonzalez said, threats to witnesses occur because the defendants already know who they are.Aside from safety concerns, some prosecutors scoff at the notion that defendants need an earlier peek at evidence to know if they are guilty.\u201cWhat the defendant may not know is the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, and therefore how likely it is that he can \u2018beat\u2019 the charges despite his guilt,\u201d wrote three prosecutors who dissented from the state bar association report.Defense lawyers respond that they need discovery to know whether the facts of the case warrant the charges or whether there are witnesses who might provide an alternative view. In New York, prosecutors do not have to provide witness names at all if the witnesses are not expected to testify.Isaiah Spry learned this lesson in December 2012, when he was bewildered to discover that he had been charged with attempted possession of a loaded firearm, a violent felony that carried up to seven years in prison. He was celebrating his 27th birthday with his girlfriend, he said, when the couple began fighting in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building.When the police arrived, he kicked and flailed, according to court documents. A police captain later said Mr. Spry had tried to wrest an officer\u2019s gun from his holster.Prosecutors offered him a plea deal of two years in prison, said his attorney, Robert Bickel of the Legal Aid Society. Mr. Spry refused. He spent five months in jail before finally agreeing to plead guilty to the felony in exchange for probation.\u201cI knew I was innocent, but I didn\u2019t know what they had against me,\u201d he said.Just as Mr. Spry was entering his plea, the judge called the lawyers up to the bench and advised the defense to go to trial, Mr. Bickel recalled. The judge had seen something the defense had not: the grand jury testimony.When prosecutors eventually turned over the testimony, Mr. Spry learned that the officer did not recall his grabbing for the gun.The judge, Justice Gregory Carro of the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, confirmed Mr. Bickel\u2019s account but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on the case.At trial, Mr. Spry was convicted of two misdemeanor counts but acquitted of the weapons charge.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Rebecca Solnit Became the Voice of the Resistance", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySubjects that the author and essayist Rebecca Solnit has written about, some at considerable length, include Irish history, atlases, Alzheimer\u2019s, a traveling medical clinic, natural disasters, urban planning, tortoises, walking, gentrification, Yosemite National Park and Apple Inc.\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something interdisciplinary at best and wildly wandering at worst about how I think,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently over the phone from San Francisco, where she lives and works. \u2018\u2018I am interested in almost everything, and it can sometimes seem like a burden.\u2019\u2019 She cited Virginia Woolf and Henry David Thoreau as the writers most important to her: \u2018\u2018Each of them wrote exquisitely about experiential, immediate encounters with the tangible world but could also be very powerful political polemicists. And the arc of their work describes a space in which you can be both.\u2019\u2019In other words, Solnit is a certain kind of celebrity, if a reluctant one. \u2018\u2018I feel that it\u2019s really important to not depend on all this in any sense and not let this define my worth or work,\u2019\u2019 she said on the phone. \u2018\u2018I wrote \u2018Hope in the Dark\u2019 14 years ago. Am I somehow better or smarter now than I was then?\u2019\u2019 The answer, of course, is no. Strange as it is to say, Solnit\u2019s newfound popularity reveals more about her readers than it does her. That the book, and her other suddenly timely work, was not written in the last several months, but rather years prior, makes its ideas seem even truer, giving it the veneer of sacred text. She has become a Cassandra figure of the left, her writing, which seems magically to have long ago said the things that many Americans now most want to hear, consumed as both balm and rallying cry.Paul Yamazaki, the head book buyer at City Lights bookstore in San Francisco, which published Solnit\u2019s first book in 1991, adds the frank, genre-defying works of Kathy Acker and Jane Bowles to the list, but can\u2019t quite conjure a unifying theory of what all of these authors share. \u2018\u2018I wish I had one!\u2019\u2019 he laughed over the phone. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d be a much better bookseller if I did.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s worth noting, however, that these belatedly embraced writers seem to be mostly female. Perhaps it\u2019s because no one listens to them the first time they speak.There\u2019s another reason, too, that we look to the past for our current intellectual decipherers and idols. In the Trump era, Solnit, who writes against corruption of all kinds \u2014 environmental, political, social \u2014 seems herself wholly uncorrupted: by these sorts of discussions of commercial popularity; by the harried activity of online life; by the social spheres of Washington, D.C., and New York City; by the aesthetic fetishization that so many women writers are subject to. \u2018\u2018If you think of a kind of ecology of ideas, there are more than enough people telling us how horrific and terrible and bad everything is, and I don\u2019t really need to join that project,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a whole other project of trying to counterbalance that \u2014 sometimes we do win and this is how it worked in the past.\u2019\u2019 She continued, \u2018\u2018Change is often unpredictable and indirect. We don\u2019t know the future. We\u2019ve changed the world many times, and remembering that, that history, is really a source of power to continue and it doesn\u2019t get talked about nearly enough.\u2019\u2019For years, Solnit has been traveling with photographer friends to Lake Powell, a massive reservoir on the central border of Utah and Arizona that was formerly a series of magnificent sandstone gorges known as Glen Canyon. She has written about the awe-inspiring industriousness that is responsible for the lake \u2014 its creation, by damming the Colorado River, began in the late 1950s, and it took 17 years to fill to capacity \u2014 but also about the hubris that imbues it; it is, she says, \u2018\u2018failing quite spectacularly,\u2019\u2019 with water levels dropping significantly over the last two decades.The excursions come as a relief. \u2018\u2018Writing about the politics of this moment sort of feels like being stranded in the shallows, and means not writing about deeper cultural forces and longer timeframes in history,\u2019\u2019 she said. As the water levels of Lake Powell have dropped, the Colorado River has begun to re-emerge in some places. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not exactly hopeful,\u2019\u2019 Solnit said. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s something that\u2019s neither victory nor defeat. That\u2019s really interesting to me.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "From Kaiseki to Ramen, a Fresh Shipment of Asian Imports", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of New York\u2019s most intriguing new Asian restaurants in recent years have been imports \u2014 spinoffs of established places in Japan and China, often with a distinct innovation or specialty. This season\u2019s newcomers follow suit.At Wokuni, the first American outpost for Tokyo Ichiban Foods, which runs 50 restaurants in Japan, bluefin tuna and king yellowtail will arrive by air from the company\u2019s own aquaculture farm in Japan. Those fish and others will be prepared in traditional fashion \u2014 sushi, sashimi, tempura or grilled \u2014 and sold at a retail counter.Ramen has become commonplace in New York, but, at Tonchin New York in Midtown Manhattan, a Tokyo-based restaurant group will shine the spotlight on Tokyo-style ramen: broth seasoned with soy sauce. The curly noodles are made in-house. Tonchin will also serve teppanyaki dishes, seared on vintage-style iron griddles, and fried chicken.Toru Okuda, who earned many Michelin stars in Tokyo and runs a restaurant in Paris, has secured a tiny niche in New York, where he will join the recent parade of chefs serving finely wrought kaiseki dinners. His Chelsea restaurant, Okuda, will offer two seatings each night at a counter with just seven seats. A private room holds another six.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.But there will be no shortage of tables at DaDong New York, a vast addition to Midtown by way of Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, China, with about 300 seats inside and nearly 200 on outdoor terraces on two floors. Here the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is Peking duck, cooked in special ovens to produce skin with a glassy crispness and sheen. The menu promises to deliver \u201cthe artistic conception of Chinese cuisine,\u201d in beautifully rendered preparations by the chef, Dong Zhenxiang, better known as DaDong, and his executive chef, Andy Xu.Other distinctive imports are on the horizon. Zauo, a multistory restaurant from Tokyo where customers can reel in their own fish from pools in the dining room, is set to open early next year at 152 West 24th Street. Marugame Udon, which features noodles that are kneaded, cut and cooked to order and has nearly 1,000 locations in Japan and elsewhere, is about to open in Los Angeles and has plans to expand, with New York in its sights.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What U.Va. Students Saw in Charlottesville", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Campus In recent years, college towns and campuses have attracted divisive figures like Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader who organized the rally, as youthful activism in the community all but guarantees protest and media coverage.The New York Times reached out to University of Virginia students to reflect on the event.History and Government, \u201918After this weekend, there should be no excuse for anyone to not take white supremacy seriously. Certainly the neo-Nazis who came to Charlottesville to intimidate minority communities take themselves seriously: They showed up with assault rifles and guns, wearing camouflage. They marched through a college campus with lit torches, yelling Nazi-era slogans and phrases like, \u201cYou will not replace us.\u201dOn Saturday, as counterprotesters rallied near Emancipation Park, we were pelted with water bottles, chemicals, tear gas, rocks \u2014 really, anything the white supremacists could get their hands on.Even after the crowds were dispersed and the governor declared a state of emergency, there were reports that neo-Nazis were headed to black, low-income neighborhoods around Charlottesville.The intention of this \u201calt-right\u201d rally was clear, and it had nothing to do with a statue. It was about intimidation. We need to call this violence \u2014 which culminated with the death of a 32-year-old woman \u2014 by its name: domestic terrorism.Politics and African-American and African Studies, \u201917On Friday night, I was locked in a church full of people, who were singing loudly to overpower the hate-filled chants of alt-right protesters carrying torches right outside the chapel doors.Still, I got up early on Saturday morning. Some friends and I had promised to be in downtown Charlottesville by 7 a.m. to help set up the counterprotest camp. We ate some fast food, moved tables, wrote the phone numbers of legal aid agencies on our arms in surgical marker in case we were arrested, and hung up \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs. There were helicopters hovering overhead.We left the park to go meet other student protesters, and walked by several alt-right groups, but we exchanged no words.However, once we got to Emancipation Park, I found myself being talked at by a man wearing a red shirt. Red Shirt told me that Africa was for the black man, and America was for the white man. He seemed to have forgotten the brown men who were here long before either of our ancestors. He told a white woman, who was holding a sign promoting peace, that she was a race traitor, and despite her wide hips, he\u2019d be willing to show her what a real man was all about. He spouted racist theories about the testosterone levels of black women and the difference in brain sizes between the races. I was unnerved; he truly believed what he was saying.As more and more Confederate flag-waving men and women \u2014 but mostly, overwhelmingly, men \u2014 filed into the park with shields and guns, people who were not with the alt-right moved further into the streets. I stood on the pavement looking up at the white supremacists as they crowded together on a small slope, and I could see their world getting crowded, more claustrophobic. It\u2019s their hatred, their refusal to leave their bubbles, that was really taking up space.Each time one of the white supremacists threw a water bottle filled with a purplish chemical I couldn\u2019t identify, or released pepper spray or smoke into the crowd, the counterprotesters retreated. We coughed into surgical masks or scarves and clutched at our throats, but then turned back for more.I quickly learned to raise my poster board over my head as a cover, and I breathed in through my nose to protect my throat.It was obviously a very dangerous situation. The news said it. The governor said it when he declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard. The worried text messages of family and friends said it. And a woman murdered in the street said it.But for all the vitriol and hatred, there was also something deeply human happening in downtown Charlottesville. People were offering each other water, masks, earplugs and gloves. One kind woman came around to offer us locally grown cherry tomatoes. I, for my own peace of mind, have to believe that humanity\u2019s good will eventually outweigh its bad. It won\u2019t happen on its own, but with the help of people like those who were helping, or perhaps, watching from their homes in horror, thinking about the role they might play to stop something like this from happening again.Creative Writing, \u201919Violence and hate and blood, that\u2019s what I saw. What happened in Charlottesville this past weekend wasn\u2019t a rally. It was a riot.I was on Market Street around 11:30 a.m. when a counterprotester ripped a newspaper stand off the sidewalk and threw it at alt-right protesters. I saw another man from the white supremacist crowd being chased and beaten. People were hitting him with their signs. A much older man, also with the alt-right group, got pushed to the ground in the commotion. Someone raised a stick over his head and beat the man with it, and that\u2019s when I screamed and ran over with several other strangers to help him to his feet.There was alt-right propaganda playing on speakers somewhere, and a woman was trying to sermonize into a microphone, but all of it was drowned out. Everyone was screaming obscenities. And everyone had cameras and iPhones out to record it all.I know the cameras let people capture their individual perspectives, and some might not otherwise be seen. I filmed the protest for 15 minutes straight until my phone died. It was my shield, and my weapon of proof. But the filming en masse was a strange sort of horror. It seemed to precipitate a certain outcome \u2014 the kind that might be sensational enough to spread online. It was like fights in high school, where everyone gathered around holding their cameras, and there was an unconscious intensification of the violence.There were absolutely groups of peaceful protesters in Charlottesville this past weekend, many making a mature show of resistance. But what I saw on Market Street didn\u2019t feel like resistance. It felt like every single person letting out his or her own well of fear and frustration on the crowd.As the alt-right crowd started to disperse, I followed them further down Market Street and saw the most significant organized group of counterprotestors I had seen all day. They were locked arm in arm, chanting, waving flags and signs. Some were shouting \u201cGet out of our town!\u201d at the alt-right as they marched. I joined in. We were only a few feet away from them, yelling, when a woman from their line turned to me, looked me dead in the eye and said, \u201cI hope you get raped by a nigger.\u201dI would hear that line several more times before the end of the day.University of Virginia School of Law, \u201919By the time we got to Emancipation Park, the police were dispersing the crowds. We walked to nearby McGuffey Park, which felt like a resistance camp at the end of the world.No neo-Nazis were there: It was only counterprotesters, clergy and volunteers. People were passing out food and water, a D.J. was playing reggae music, and there were huge papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 statues, giant paper cranes and protest signs hung up everywhere.Leaders of the counterprotests asked us to mobilize: There were reports of people of color being attacked downtown. We began marching down the street, chanting, \u201cWhen black lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!\u201d and, \u201cNo racists, no KKK, no fascist USA!\u201dWe seemed to be hundreds of people deep, but when we turned a street corner, there was another huge group of protesters walking to meet us. This incredibly inspiring moment brought tears to both of our eyes. We had walked about halfway up Water Street when we heard the screams. There was chaos as the crowd parted \u2014 people were darting off the road \u2014 and we both leapt to the side of the street just as a Dodge Challenger came barreling through.The scene was horrific. People were having panic attacks, sobbing, bleeding and hugging. Those with huge banners shielded the injured as they received medical treatment. It was unclear whether the crowd was still in danger, but the alleyways were crowding up. We called a friend who lives close by and he took us in and gave us some water and food. We called our parents, we called our friends and then we sat in silence.We witnessed domestic terrorism in our home. Neither of us regrets attending the rally, and we will keep showing up, every single time it\u2019s necessary.Political and Social Thought, \u201918This weekend I sat at home in Northern Virginia, paralyzed, watching on television as white supremacists marched with torches outside the room I will be living in this year.I\u2019m one of 54 students who have the honor to live on University of Virginia\u2019s Lawn \u2014 Thomas Jefferson\u2019s original \u201cacademical village\u201d \u2014 for our fourth year of college. This has always been a big deal for me; it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked for since my first year. Students are chosen to live on the Lawn based on academic excellence, leadership and service.The Lawn is the central nervous system of the university. It is also a space that was traditionally occupied by scions of slaveholding families. It used to be a place where people like me, a brown kid attending school on a financial aid scholarship, did not belong. Somehow I made it.That small victory feels like a sick joke now.I know the university needs to put out a measured response. I\u2019m trying to be sympathetic to what is certainly a delicate situation for the administration.Major undeclared, \u201920I\u2019m the opinion editor of The Cavalier Daily, the student newspaper. Several weeks I ago I wrote a column arguing that the alt-right rally that took place over the weekend should be allowed to go on.The way I see it, white supremacists \u2014 despite their irrefutably toxic ideology \u2014 are entitled to the same constitutional liberties as anyone else. I figured, maybe na\u00efvely, that allowing the alt-right to assemble in public, under the scrutiny of daylight, would galvanize public opinion against their hateful beliefs. It would reveal the rotting foundation on which their ideology rests.I feel foolish about that.The alt-right has shown itself to be a domestic terrorist organization. Their use of intimidation, terror and violence in the pursuit of their goals more than justify this categorization.On Friday night, we witnessed armed white supremacists march through university grounds with lit torches, threatening, harassing and physically assaulting students who were organizing peacefully \u2014 or who were just trying to go about their business despite the shocking events unfolding in their backyard.I still believe in the sanctity of the First Amendment. True progress and healing can be achieved only through open, honest dialogue. But what happened in Charlottesville doesn\u2019t, and perhaps never did, qualify as protected speech.I was wrong about the nature of the alt-right, but I am encouraged by the widespread backlash and denunciation of their ideology. Despite the shocking, gut wrenching images coming out of my town, the solidarity on display gives me hope that we can work toward a more open and inclusive society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reading, Writing and Refugees", "Date": "2017-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere is a guide to some of the new and forthcoming children\u2019s books about Muslim refugees, ranging from picture books for toddlers and early readers to young adult novels.In the fall of 2015, Amy Shrodes was volunteering at a seaside kitchen on the Greek island of Lesbos, serving tea to refugees arriving from Syria and Iraq, when she found a bedraggled white cat. The creature was clearly not one of the island strays. Ms. Shrodes asked around and learned that the cat had come in one of the boats from Turkey, but in the chaos, had become separated from his owners. Ms. Shrodes took the cat in, and made a Facebook page in hopes of finding his family through social media. It turned out, the cat\u2019s name was Kunkush, and the family he belonged to \u2014 a woman named Sura and her five children \u2014 had fled from Mosul, Iraq, to escape the violence. They had settled in Oslo, and eventually saw a news report about Kunkush and the efforts to find his owners. The family was reunited with Kunkush in February 2016.Kunkush\u2019s tale \u2014 a rare war story with a happy ending \u2014 has been adapted into two picture books. \u201cLost and Found Cat,\u201d by Ms. Shrodes and Mr. Kuntz, was published by Crown Books for Young Readers in January and is aimed at 4- to 8-year-olds; \u201cKunkush: The True Story of a Refugee Cat,\u201d by Marne Ventura, with illustrations by Beidi Guo, comes out this month from Raintree.Ms. Shrodes said that by centering the story on a missing cat, they approached the difficult subject of the refugee crisis in a way that wasn\u2019t too frightening for young readers.\u201cWith a cat as the protagonist, the story can be softened a little bit,\u201d Ms. Shrodes said. \u201cIt\u2019s an easier way for people to open their minds.\u201dMost of Suzanne Del Rizzo\u2019s illustrations tell cheerful, whimsical stories. Her artwork has appeared in a book about a pig that desperately wants to fly, and one about a gerbil.But in \u201cMy Beautiful Birds,\u201d published in March by Pajama Press, Ms. Del Rizzo ventured into darker territory, as she told the story of Sami, a Syrian boy who evacuates his home when the fighting becomes too dangerous and has to leave behind his pet pigeons.The author, who lives in Oakville, Ontario, said that she wrote the book because her own children had been asking about the conflict in Syria and she struggled to explain it to them. Then she saw an article about a boy in the Zaatari camp who had tamed some wild birds, and thought his story could be the basis for a picture book. The boy\u2019s story is accompanied by colorful, mixed-media images, made of clay. \u201cI wanted to find more kid-friendly resources to approach the topic, because it\u2019s pretty scary stuff,\u201d she said.Nizar Ali Badr makes art from stones that he gathers and arranges into shapes that tell a story. When the Canadian children\u2019s author Margriet Ruurs came across photographs of his work on Facebook \u2014 images of desperate families walking with all their belongings on their backs \u2014 she immediately wanted to use his artwork as a foundation for a picture book about refugees. It took her months to finally reach Mr. Badr, who lives in Latakia, Syria, and doesn\u2019t speak English. But eventually she asked if he would team up with her on a children\u2019s book that told the story of families leaving their homes to escape the war.Their book, \u201cStepping Stones,\u201d a dual-language picture book from Orca Book Publishers, in English and Arabic, has been a best seller in Canada. The book has been used in classrooms and for fund-raisers to support Syrian families that resettled in Canada. Ms. Ruurs said that she had received calls from teachers who told her the book resonated with students from refugee families. \u201cI\u2019ve had librarians and teachers phone me and say, \u2018The children in my class said, \u201cThis is me, it\u2019s about me, it\u2019s my story.\u201d\u2019\u201dThis forthcoming coming-of-age novel follows Nadia, a Syrian girl who turns 12 as the Arab Spring begins in 2010. After a failed democratic uprising in Syria, civil war breaks out and Aleppo is bombed, forcing Nadia\u2019s family to evacuate. The novel will be released in January by Simon & Schuster/Paula Wiseman Books.Mr. Gratz\u2019s middle-grade novel, which Scholastic published in July, alternates among three narratives that explore the lives of child refugees in different decades and parts of the world. The stories, which are interconnected in surprising ways that are revealed at the end, feature a Jewish boy whose family flees Nazi Germany on the St. Louis ocean liner; a Cuban girl who leaves Havana in 1994; and a Syrian boy from Aleppo, whose family survives a bombing and struggles to make it to Germany, where they will seek asylum. By weaving the stories together, Mr. Gratz draws parallels between the plights of refugees decades ago with those seeking asylum today.\u2018The Boy in the Wine Cellar,\u2019 by Katherine MarshMs. Marsh, a former managing editor for The New Republic, explores the plight of refugees in Europe in this novel, which will be published by Putnam children\u2019s division. The story features an American boy living in Brussels who helps a 14-year-old Syrian refugee who has lost his family and is hiding from the authorities.Ms. Abawi, whose parents left Afghanistan as refugees, visited a refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece, when she was researching the novel, and saw connections between her own family\u2019s flight to safety and the risks that desperate Syrians were making to escape an entrenched civil war. \u201cAs a former refugee I saw a familiarity that I couldn\u2019t shake,\u201d Ms. Abawi wrote in an author\u2019s note. Philomel Books is to release the novel in January.Ms. Abdel-Fattah said that she wrote the novel in hopes that Mina might make young readers empathize with refugees. \u201cSome readers have written to me and said it had changed their whole perspective on the refugee debate,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Demolition Is Halted on a Queens Building Filled With Cats", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemolition of the vacant apartment building at 778 Onderdonk Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens, began last month \u2014 only the building was not vacant. Living in its crawl spaces and crannies were more than 40 cats, apparently left by a former tenant who neighbors said had hoarded them in her apartment.The demolition was halted after a group of women from the neighborhood and animal rescue organizations intervened with the owners, they said. A rescue effort has been underway to lure the remaining cats out of the building. About 20 have been trapped and taken to shelters, and about the same number are believed to remain in the building. They peer out, just beyond reach, reflector eyes gleaming out from the dark.Isaac Silberstein, who owns the eight-unit building, said he was not aware of the animals at first, but had noticed that the building smelled bad. It was only when workers gutting the building began to break down a third-floor apartment last month that they discovered it was filled with cats.\u201cWhen they opened the walls, they jumped out \u2014 cats, baby cats, big ones, you can\u2019t imagine,\u201d Mr. Silberstein said. He ordered most demolition work to stop, he said, except for a few walls in case cats had crept inside them. \u201cWhat if there were dead cats in there?\u201d he said. \u201cThen it would be my problem.\u201dMr. Silberstein hired a private company to remove the cats, but its methods, which he said included spraying bleach to drive out the cats with the smell, upset the neighbors so much that he permitted them to rescue the cats themselves instead.But the neighbors-turned-cat-rescuers provided a different account of events. Dolores Benefatti, who lives around the corner, said she and other neighbors saw a few cats leaving the building in mid-July.Concerned, Ms. Benefatti and others sneaked in to investigate.\u201cWe scouted around through piles and piles of debris,\u201d she said. \u201cWe heard \u2018swoosh, swoosh.\u2019 Cats were rushing all around us.\u201dA piece of a cat tail was found on a staircase, she said. They spotted what looked like a cat\u2019s jaw bone. Cats ran through cracks in the walls and floors, while pairs of eyes stared at them, glowing against the flashlights on their cellphones.\u201cA lot of these cats had injuries, gashes in their faces,\u201d Ms. Benefatti said. \u201cOne had to be put down eventually because of a respiratory infection.\u201d\u201cOnce we went in and saw what was going on, we were devastated,\u201d she said.The women gave the cats food and water, she said. \u201cBones! They were skins and bones. They needed to be fattened up.\u201dEventually, they began to rescue the cats themselves, she said, chasing the animals and suffering scratches. The group rescued 10 on July 26, placing them with several rescue organizations and keeping some themselves. When one member of the group posted about the conditions on Facebook on July 29, it drew the attention of a host of rescue groups. Ms. Benefatti said she obtained permission from the landlord on Sunday to enter the building and capture the rest of the animals.\u201cWe were deeply disturbed by reports that construction work was taking place with abandoned cats in the building,\u201d Joseph Soldevere, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, said by email. The department sent inspectors to the building to make sure it was safe. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon all of us to do what we can to protect vulnerable animals, and we will continue to monitor this site closely,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, some cats were still in the building, days after Animal Care Centers of NYC, the city\u2019s animal control agency, stepped in on Sunday.\u201cWe are working with the manager of the property, who has promised us that no more work will be done until all the cats are out,\u201d Katy Hansen, a spokeswoman for the centers, said.How many more cats are in the building is unclear. \u201cThere are so many crawl spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many places they can hide.\u201dSince the city became involved, the building has been closed to the original rescuers. On Wednesday afternoon, tensions rose when Michael O\u2019Neil, an animal welfare activist from Tail of Two Kitties, climbed through a window to check on a cat that was motionless in a trap, a cage put out by the city officers baited with food.As Mr. O\u2019Neil climbed back out the window, a half-dozen police officers who had been called to the scene surrounded him. After he explained his mission \u2014 and the officers peered in and saw the caged cat \u2014 he was released.Standing on the sidewalk, Mr. O\u2019Neil said, \u201cAs much as we\u2019re trying to help cats, I\u2019m also trying to expose what\u2019s been done here.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled in one instance the surname of an animal welfare activist. He is Michael O\u2019Neil, not O\u2019Neill.Susan A. Beachy contributed researchAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Today: A Dial-a-Rep Phone Booth", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this cheery Thursday.But last Thursday, our city got a new one, with a catch.When you enter the bright red phone booth on West 13th Street in the Meatpacking District and pick up the receiver, you are connected to the switchboard of the Capitol in Washington. You are then asked to enter your ZIP code and choose the Senate or House of Representatives member you wish to speak to. Then you are connected to his or her office.Want to talk about health care? Go ahead. Have ideas to improve education? Share them.The idea for the phone booth sprang from a group of employees \u2014 from marketing, public relations and corporate culture \u2014 at the Standard Hotel. It was designed as a tool for staff members and customers who were searching for ways to be more politically engaged after last year\u2019s election.The employees found a 1970s Sprint booth available from an auction house on eBay for less than $300, picked it up in Port Royal, Pa., and had it refurbished. Then, they placed it on the sidewalk, watched and waited.We waited, too, on Wednesday afternoon for about three hours. We mostly saw curious passers-by who squinted to read a sign at the top, or fixed their hair using the booth\u2019s reflective doors. No one made a call.So we did.We connected with the office of Representative Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat, who represents New York\u2019s 13th Congressional District, but we couldn\u2019t hear the person who answered the phone. (A representative at the Standard Hotel said it planned to replace the phone part that is causing the bad reception.)So we tried again, this time from our cellphone.We spoke to David Kimelman, a staff assistant and legislative correspondent who fields calls for Mr. Espaillat\u2019s office.The staff there answers from 50 to a few hundred calls from constituents on any given day, Mr. Kimelman said.When citizens call their representative, Mr. Kimelman said, a staff member will usually tally complaints and listen for patterns for or against pieces of legislation. Those concerns are then shared with the representative.His tips for getting your voice heard? It\u2019s fine to be brief if you just want your opinion counted as a \u201cyea\u201d or \u201cnay\u201d on a specific bill. But you can also discuss how an issue personally affects you, your family or community.And be nice, Mr. Kimelman said.\u201cA lot of people who answer phones are interns,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know why you\u2019re yelling a them.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Eighty-something degrees for most of the day and 60-something degrees by night, with clear skies throughout.The weekend is looking iffy, though, so use this beautiful morning commute as an opportunity to do a no-rain dance.The arrest ended a monthslong search for the man who killed six people and wounded seven others. New Yorkers across the city breathed a sigh of relief.We recently asked readers who were residents then what the city was like during the summer of 1977.Here\u2019s what a few remembered:\u201cI cut my hair in April that year, because it appeared that Son of Sam targeted women with long hair. It was a long, hot summer.\u201d\u2014 Casey Quinlan, 65, Richmond, Va.\u201cMy husband and I lived near Parkchester in the Bronx, and late every Saturday night we walked to get the Sunday papers. One night was really beautiful, and we were surprised at how few people were out. Normally the streets would be filled with people. Then we remembered: Son of Sam. A car pulled up nearby, and we were terrified and almost ran home. The whole area was on edge until he was caught.\u201d\u2014 Sandy Dubinsky, 68, Westchester\u201cIn general the city was more dangerous, and the Son of Sam was the icing on the cake. Both petty and violent crime was numerous. Residents on Fifth Avenue parked their cars on the east side in view of the doorman, as on the park side guaranteed that it would be broken into. Being mugged was not an anomaly.\u201d\u2014 Joseph Sobin, 51, Denver\u201cI was an occupational therapy student at N.Y.U. and participating in a fieldwork internship in the summer of 1977. My position was in the psychiatric unit of what was then Cabrini Hospital. There was a young man who was admitted to this psychiatric ward who claimed to be the Son of Sam. It was very scary as no one could be sure if it was true. It was a dark summer in N.Y.C. Finally the news came that he was arrested.\u201d\u2014 Sandra Waife Rothenberg, 60, Weston, Conn.Advertisement"}

Pausing there to observe the place and its people, \u201cyou really get an idea of the diversity of cultures in Panama,\u201d said Ms. Cromwell, who lived in Panama City for a few years beginning in 2006 and returns regularly. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d see it in most guidebooks.\u201dMs. Cromwell did her own shopping there. It is, she said, a place to find everything you need \u2014 even a haircut on the side of the road \u2014 for a good price. Yet in the years since she has lived full-time in Panama, the street \u201chas gentrified in the most extreme way,\u201d she said. Today a wandering visitor will find upscale hotels, nightclubs and coffee shops a short walk away.On her visit in June, Avenida Central was beginning to feel endangered. Flocks of pigeons had colonized the area. Ms. Cromwell noticed pumpkins growing right in the middle of the street. \u201cIt just seemed a little bit more chaotic,\u201d she said.Ms. Cromwell shot these photographs with change in mind: \u201cI kind of saw it as this last look at this street that may not be the same as it\u2019s been for a while.\u201dThis man was selling CDs or T-shirts at a stand on Avenida Central. \u201cI thought the tonality in his hair was just so beautiful,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. \u201cFor being a mullet, it was an attractive look.\u201dGuna Indians, one of Panama\u2019s indigenous groups, come to Avenida Central to do their shopping. Most of them live on the Guna Yala islands, where there are not many stores. \u201cThe plastic bag that the man on the right is carrying on his shoulder, it\u2019s ubiquitous,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. \u201cYou can buy these cheap bags, and they\u2019re pretty sturdy \u2014 you can stuff all your goods in them.\u201dEugenio Chergio Mendoza was socializing with a lottery vendor when Ms. Cromwell met him. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a guayabera,\u201d she said, \u201cand then he\u2019s also wearing a Panamanian hat.\u201d A number of the older men who spend time on Avenida Central dress in this dapper style, she said. And like Mr. Mendoza, many spend time with the lottery vendors. \u201cThat week, 99 was a really popular number because Ricardo Martinelli, the ex-president of Panama, had been arrested in Miami,\u201d said Ms. Cromwell, noting that the number 99 signifies president.Members of some indigenous groups in Panama wear fabric wrapped around their waists. \u201cThis is where a lot of the indigenous groups come to buy their fabric,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing fabric. I bought some and I\u2019m going to make curtains.\u201d Some of the shops sell fabric meant for one group; others are all-purpose stores.\u201cI thought he had striking facial features,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said of the man in blue, who was selling items that she said were likely counterfeit. \u201cHis jeans are very in right now in Panama, especially on the street. It\u2019s not hard to find ripped jeans.\u201d Ms. Cromwell was struck by the \u201coverload of color\u201d this Guna woman was wearing. Her handkerchief is \u201ckind of like a modesty handkerchief,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen wear that as a sign of respect when they leave the house.\u201d The mola \u2014 the embroidered squares around her waist \u2014 are popular among tourists. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge export for them,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. And the bracelets, which are worn on the legs as well as the wrists, are given to a woman at her coming-of-age ceremony.\u201cThe older generation on the street takes a lot of pride in how they dress,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said. She photographed this man not far from a street where older people go to spend time together during the day. \u201cAll of them are dressed in more formal ways,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can see kind of the Caribbean influence.\u201dShe was drawn to yellow once again when she photographed this vendor pushing a shaved ice cart. \u201cThey put sugary flavoring and condensed milk on top,\u201d Ms. Cromwell said, \u201cand it\u2019s just a very typical Panamanian street snack.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Ajjuma, Sunny Lee Plans to Put Korean Sides Front and Center", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the chef Sunny Lee was growing up in Andover, Mass., if her family wanted to eat Korean food, they had to make it at home. \u201cI was always in the kitchen,\u201d she said of her childhood, learning the tastes and textures of traditional dishes from the Korean side of her family: her father, grandmother, and aunts.Upon arriving at the Culinary Institute of America, Ms. Lee, now 30, pushed Korean food to the back of her mind and mastered the school\u2019s European curriculum, later shooting to the highest realms of fine dining. But after cooking at Blue Hill and Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan, Dover in Brooklyn, and the kitchen of the avant-garde Paris chef David Toutain, she realized (at age 27) that she was already burned out on that style.Highly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.\u201cThere\u2019s a disconnect between people and food once you enter fine dining,\u201d she said. The kitchen becomes so focused on preparing the dish, she said, that \u201cit\u2019s easy to forget that you are actually doing this in order to feed the people in the dining room.\u201dLiving in New York, she said, got her hooked on Korean restaurants and the home-style food they served. \u201cI noticed that the people I was eating with, whether they knew Korean food or not, would always light up when the banchan came,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like Christmas.\u201dWhen Ms. Lee\u2019s restaurant, Ajjuma, opens this fall in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, she will put banchan at the center of the menu. Ms. Lee has worked at the Good Fork and Insa in Brooklyn, where the chef Sohui Kim put her in charge of banchan and let her stretch her wings, using nontraditional ingredients and holding pop-up all-banchan dinners.Some of her creations draw on American tradition, like her version of Ants on a Log: salted celery stuffed with a sesame-, soy- and caramel-inflected peanut butter. There will be an ever-changing banchan list, like the oyster cart at a raw bar, and a few big, sometimes shareable dishes that set off the small ones, instead of the other way around.To prepare for Ajjuma\u2019s opening, Ms. Lee dove deep into the study of traditional banchan, which have been part of Korean daily life for centuries, from every farmhouse to the royal court. Now, she will take that knowledge and expand it to include all her food influences, with American ingredients like corn, tomatoes and kale; French techniques and aesthetics: and New York adventurousness and creativity.\u201cThe question is, how nontraditional can you make banchan without losing its Korean essence?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll be trying to find out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This week it took down a truly vile video it produced in January celebrating motorists who had plowed into \u201cliberal protesters,\u201d advising its readers to \u201cstudy the technique.\u201d (The Daily Caller said on Thursday that the video was a young videographer\u2019s \u201cclumsy attempt at creating some levity\u201d at a tense time, but added that any suggestion that the video had a role in causing \u201cNazis to be stupid, violent maniacs is patently absurd.\u201d)It may come as a relief that people in high places in the media and technology world decided it was no longer tenable to give extra oxygen \u2014 digital and financial \u2014 to those who worship the champions of slavery or march under the Nazi flag, glorifying one of the most morally reprehensible regimes in history.But it is truly remarkable that it only happened now, after the nation had to witness a white supremacist rally gone wrong, a latter-day Munich Beer Hall Putsch in miniature.Then again, that list had been out for three years.As we\u2019ve seen time and time again in recent months, it often takes an extreme moment to push the platforms to address extreme content.Part of the problem is logistical: There is so much material flooding the platforms that the most dangerous items can slip through.But moves to stanch certain kinds of content also clash with the spirit of the First Amendment and, more to the point, the free-speech ethos that is so ingrained in the web.That ethos has been the game-changer, and often for the good.Unlike the last big communications revolutions \u2014 brought about with radio and then television \u2014 this one came with no barrier to entry in terms of expensive equipment like towers and studios. There have been no governmental limits like broadcasting standards and licensing requirements.That has democratized information, giving rise to new political and social movements as well as to a phalanx of innovative media ventures that have diminished the traditional gatekeeper role of the mainstream media. It gave anyone with an internet connection an opportunity to have his or her voice heard widely via Facebook or Twitter, Reddit or Medium.But as the downsides of informational democratization become more evident \u2014 the opening it has provided for nefarious state actors, terrorists and hate mongers \u2014 those who have some control over the web\u2019s content stream have had a hard time figuring out where to build some much-needed dams.Google, in keeping with Silicon Valley\u2019s aversion to the news media, would not provide anyone to speak on the record about its policies but pointed to new moves aimed at starving hateful or violent sites of advertising revenue and to detect and remove terrorist videos.The trouble has come in finding the line between what some may find offensive and what is objectively dangerous speech.YouTube shut down The Daily Stormer. But I had no trouble finding a recording of Thursday\u2019s edition of \u201cDavid Duke Radio\u201d on YouTube, or, for that matter, the latest audio from \u201cStormfront Radio,\u201d which is connected to an older supremacist site.Then again, the efforts to police content can go too far. Mixed in with complaints from right-wing provocateurs who have already been shut down are serious conservative fears that the moves will result in censorship for right-leaning political thought.The conversation needs to continue. It can\u2019t only be had at the height of a crisis, and it can\u2019t only be relegated to social media.But at this point, if we can\u2019t set a line at neo-Nazis and white nationalists inciting hatred and violence, can we set any line at all?Jaclyn Peiser contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Egg Is More Than Just an Egg at While in Kathmandu", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHungry City9 PhotosHere is the soul of New York, manifested as breakfast: an egg, over easy, the white cratered with a copper frill and the yolk a veiled pulse at the center, flopped over bacon and oozing cheese.Tradition demands that this be served in the jaws of a kaiser roll. But at While in Kathmandu, a Nepali restaurant in Ridgewood, Queens, it\u2019s presented on a pancake \u2014 your choice of buckwheat, spongy and porous; millet, dark as chocolate and seamed with sugar; or mung bean, dense, with a faint ginger heat.Don\u2019t call it fusion, even though the menu does. It\u2019s just the American larder, getting wider.Here, the definition of breakfast is more expansive, with each pancake accompanied by a gentle curry, tomato chutney and cumin-strafed potatoes like mouthfuls of musk. The pancakes can come plain or topped with a single, wrinkly egg, pocked with oil. But the marriage with bacon and cheese is best of all, earthiness enveloping pangs of salt.In the kitchen, he enlisted Shanti Maskey, a former cook at Nepalese Indian and Tawa Food Corp. in Jackson Heights, Queens. She traces her roots to the Newars, who settled Kathmandu Valley centuries ago. Occasionally, her recipes diverge from the Kharels\u2019. They prefer their buckwheat pancakes sweet and the millet ones salty, but \u201cChef likes it the other way, so we let her,\u201d Mr. Kharel said.Sel roti is sweet, too, a great craggy loop of rice soaked overnight, ground into dough and fried. It\u2019s grander in circumference than a doughnut but skinnier, and ambushes you with sugar. Curry is banished from the plate; instead, there is aachar, cool and refreshing, with cucumber, green peas and half-mashed potatoes, and house-made masala for a low-level kindling.Momos, the monumental dumplings found across the Himalayas, rise like islands from a sauce of tomatoes and earthy spices that Mr. Kharel would not name: \u201cThere are too many competitors,\u201d he said. Beef momos are the standard elsewhere in town, but his family is Hindu and doesn\u2019t eat beef; the finest dumplings here are sealed around liquefying knots of pork.For choila, a plain-spoken Newari snack, chicken thigh is rubbed with ginger, garlic and chiles and brought close to burning over open flame, then left to rest until smoke has sought out every pore. It may arrive cold alongside aachar and chiura, rice grains pounded flat and then fried into gossamer flakes that suggest fossilized tears. Or it may be charred twice, pulled apart and tucked, still warm, into a whole-wheat roti made to order, with a final sluice of tomato and mint chutneys and a scattering of onions and cilantro.Mr. Kharel calls this \u201cnot a taco\u201d and files it alongside fries tossed with green chile, cloves, cumin and coriander, and red-gold chicken wings slapped with masala and chile paste to keep the juices in. There is no border here between New York and Kathmandu, illustrated at the top of the menu with a silhouette of the cities\u2019 skylines yoked into one, high-rises shoulder to shoulder with tiered pagodas.In Nepal, Mr. Kharel\u2019s father was a journalist who ran a pro-democracy newspaper. He passed on to his son a belief in the power of the collective. A few years ago, Mr. Kharel helped found the Nepalese American Youth Association, which raised funds for relief after the 2015 earthquake in Nepal.More recently, he turned the restaurant\u2019s backyard, a pretty arrangement of gravel, picnic tables and paper lanterns on strings of twinkle lights, into a pop-up market featuring Nepali-American designers.\u201cI know we failed Nepali food back in 2012,\u201d he said of his family. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of explaining to do.\u201dPete Wells\u2019s restaurant reviews will return next Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump Offers Neo-Nazis Muted Criticism, Netanyahu Is Largely Silent", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s defiant attempts this week to apportion equal blame to the \u201calt-left\u201d for the violence in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend and the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests.It also contrasted with the unusual reticence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, a powerful orator who often communicates directly through video clips, scathing Facebook posts and statements from his office, but who has remained uncharacteristically tongue-tied about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.The piercing images of the torchlight march at the University of Virginia, with its Nazi symbols and chants of \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d reverberated across Israel, the homeland of, and a refuge for, Jews that was established in the wake of the Holocaust.In a message of solidarity with the American Jewish community, President Reuven Rivlin of Israel wrote, \u201cThe very idea that in our time we would see a Nazi flag \u2014 perhaps the most vicious symbol of anti-Semitism \u2014 paraded in the streets of the world\u2019s greatest democracy, and Israel\u2019s most cherished and greatest ally, is almost beyond belief.\u201dThe manifestations of hatred prompted condemnations from across Israel\u2019s political spectrum, but only a minimalist response from Mr. Netanyahu, who finds himself caught between his vow to represent all the Jews of the world and his friendship with the testy president of the United States.And he has remained silent about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, which American Jewish organizations have described as deeply troubling.Yair Lapid, of the centrist Yesh Atid party, said in a statement, \u201cThere aren\u2019t two sides. When neo-Nazis march in Charlottesville and scream slogans against Jews and in support of white supremacy, the condemnation has to be unambiguous.\u201dAfter eight years of tensions with the Obama administration over policy issues including the nuclear accord with Iran and Israel\u2019s settlement activity, Mr. Netanyahu celebrated the election of Mr. Trump and embraced him as the greatest friend of Israel and the Jewish people. Some of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Israeli allies have defended his reserved response as in keeping with diplomatic norms.\u201cIt is an established custom in Israel that Israeli prime ministers will not be overtly critical of the president of the United States,\u201d said Zalman Shoval, a former ambassador to the United States from Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative Likud Party.In a telephone interview, Mr. Shoval denounced all expressions of neo-Nazism as abhorrent and said nothing could be equated with it. But, he added, Mr. Netanyahu, \u201cas prime minister, has to take all factors into consideration,\u201d and \u201cdoes not have to come out with public statements.\u201d\u201cThe neo nazis scums in Virginia hate me and my country,\u201d he wrote in English. \u201cBut they belong to the past. Their breed is dying out. However the thugs of Antifa and BLM who hate my country (and America too in my view) just as much are getting stronger and stronger and becoming super dominant in American universities and public life.\u201dThe Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a clarification deploring expressions of anti-Semitism in general, but legitimizing and supporting the campaign against Mr. Soros, who has financed left-wing causes critical of the Israeli government.Other prominent Israeli politicians and bodies preceded Mr. Netanyahu in condemning the violence in Charlottesville and the response of Mr. Trump, if not by name.Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident who is chairman of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, said he was \u201cdeeply concerned by the expressions of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism and hatred exhibited at the neo-Nazi rally,\u201d adding in a statement, \u201cI am horrified by the death of a protester at the hands of one of the marchers. These is no place for such hate speech or violence in any democratic society.\u201dNaftali Bennett, the leader of the far-right party The Jewish Home and minister of education and diaspora affairs, said the \u201cunhindered waving of Nazi flags and symbols\u201d also disrespected the millions of American soldiers who fought to protect the world from the Nazis. \u201cThe leaders of the U.S. must condemn and denounce the displays of anti-Semitism,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Comment on Race Reopens New York Democrats\u2019 Split Over Schools", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe 55-word Facebook post had a remarkably short life span, especially for one from Daniel S. Loeb, a charter school proponent and activist investor known for his acid-penned missives.Politicians who have long benefited from Mr. Loeb\u2019s generosity scurried for cover and distance. And his enemies pounced.Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, called on Friday for Mr. Loeb to step down from his post as chairman of Success Academy, a major charter schools network. Democratic groups in New York and beyond pushed Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to return the $170,000 he had raised from Mr. Loeb and his wife over the years, including at a fund-raiser two years ago at Mr. Loeb\u2019s Hamptons home.The day\u2019s events captured years of interwoven and lingering grievances that have defined Democratic politics in New York. On one side are left-leaning Democrats like Mr. de Blasio and the Assembly speaker, Carl M. Heastie, who have traditional ties to the powerful teachers union. On the other are those backed by donors who support charter schools, politicians like Mr. Cuomo and Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the renegade Independent Democratic Conference.Mr. Loeb\u2019s comment also directly hit on the long-simmering racial tensions in Albany, where Mr. Klein\u2019s group has helped block Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the black lawmaker whom Mr. Loeb attacked in his Facebook post, from ascending to the post of majority leader.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who has sparred with Mr. Loeb in the past, said that Mr. Loeb, who is Jewish, \u201cshould understand the history of the K.K.K. and the history of what he said.\u201dShe added, \u201cOne wonders what has happened with the elite in this country that they feel no consequences of using words of persecution and hate.\u201dSince then, one of the governor\u2019s more generous supporters has been Mr. Loeb, who, as the founder of Third Point L.L.C., has a reputation for sending incendiary activist letters to companies that his fund has gone after, seeking either management or structural changes.Mr. Cuomo has often backed the charter schools\u2019 agenda, including appearing at a 2014 rally on the Capitol steps \u2014 at the same time that Mr. de Blasio was holding his own rally in Albany, in support of his efforts to expand prekindergarten.And charter-school supporters, led by Mr. Loeb, have poured millions of dollars into ensuring that the State Senate remains in Republican hands \u2014 even as Democrats have won a majority of seats \u2014 backing Mr. Klein\u2019s renegade group, which first broke away from the party in 2011 and eventually formed a coalition with the Republicans.Mr. Loeb himself made a $50,000 donation to Mr. Klein\u2019s group last year, and has also donated to Mr. Klein. And in the since-retracted Facebook post, Mr. Loeb prefaced his criticism of Ms. Stewart-Cousins with a compliment for him.\u201cThank God for Jeff Klein and those who stand for education choice and support charter funding,\u201d Mr. Loeb wrote.Now Mr. Loeb\u2019s comments have created another problem for the governor, as those who have long agitated against Mr. Klein and Mr. Cuomo called for them to return Mr. Loeb\u2019s largess.\u201cDemocrats need to show there are some differences with the Republican Party,\u201d said Bill Lipton of the independent Working Families Party, which tries to pull the Democrats to the political left. \u201cCuomo and Klein returning the money of oligarchs who compare respected African-American leaders to the K.K.K. would be a start.\u201dThe Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which seeks to elect Democrats to statehouses nationwide, also called for Mr. Cuomo to give back the cash. He has so far declined to comment on that possibility, but said in a statement that Mr. Loeb\u2019s comments were \u201cdeeply hurtful and offensive and there is no place for this type of rhetoric in any discourse \u2014 political or otherwise.\u201dMr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray were equally blunt in criticizing Mr. Loeb\u2019s Facebook post. Both used Twitter to call on Mr. Loeb to step down.\u201cThanks for the apology. Now resign,\u201d Ms. McCray wrote. \u201cImmediately.\u201dMr. de Blasio chimed in: \u201cCharter schools are in fact public schools. No public school leader would get to keep their job after a comment like Loeb\u2019s. Time to go, Dan.\u201dEva Moskowitz, the Success Academy chief executive and a frequent foil of the mayor\u2019s, accepted Mr. Loeb\u2019s apology as \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d in a statement, and said \u201cthere are electeds who in good faith hold differing positions on schooling.\u201dRace never lurks too far below the surface in the charter school debate. Success Academy boasts that 93 percent of its students are \u201cchildren of color.\u201d Its schools regularly outperform schools in even wealthy suburbs, let alone their urban counterparts.It was an exchange over race that spurred Mr. Loeb\u2019s Facebook comment. Ms. Stewart-Cousins, the Senate minority leader, told Mr. Cuomo in a private meeting last month that, \u201cYou look at me, Mr. Governor, but you don\u2019t see me. You see my black skin and a woman,\u201d amid a conversation about understanding suburban voters.Ms. Stewart-Cousins represents Westchester County and Mr. Cuomo had suggested that Mr. Klein, who lives in and mostly represents the Bronx, understood such voters better.On Monday, Democrats are scheduled to rally in Harlem in support of Democratic unity behind Ms. Stewart-Cousins as their leader, an event that is expected to draw more interest after Mr. Loeb\u2019s comments.While social media responses largely condemned Mr. Loeb\u2019s statement, his wife, Margaret Munzer Loeb, praised Mr. Cuomo on Facebook, calling him the \u201cbest governor.\u201d\u201cOnly democrat not taking tons of money from the teachers union which is the largest single lobby to the democrats ... if not for Cuomo, thousands of children of color and white middle class kids would have been forced out of the charter schools their parents fought hard to get their kids into,\u201d she wrote. \u201cGo Cuomo!\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s the phone no one in the room wants to hear ringing: It alerts Guam to an incoming ballistic missile.A call on this phone would only come from the United States Pacific Command in Hawaii to inform Guam of the impending strike.If it were to ring, a blue light would flash and immediately set into motion a chain of emergency response procedures to alert all of Guam\u2019s roughly 162,000 civilians of the threat within two minutes. The system includes mass notification sirens that are positioned around the island, radio and television emergency broadcasts, and emergency medical workers and mayors equipped with mobile public address systems.Workers at the Homeland Security office have been on 24-hour duty fielding questions from residents and the news media since North Korea warned last week it was preparing a missile test that would create an \u201cenveloping fire\u201d in the waters off Guam.\u201cGuam has been through supertyphoons, an 8.2 earthquake, tsunami warnings \u2014 just about anything and everything that can threaten this tiny little island \u2014 so we\u2019ve been conditioned to stay calm in a situation like this,\u201d said Dee Cruz, the office\u2019s grants manager and senior desk watch officer. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we look danger in the face and dare it to do its worst,\u201d she added, \u201cwe just know what to do to prepare.\u201dBut being ready for a ballistic missile strike is not like preparing for a typhoon. For one thing, tropical storms move at an average speed of about 12 miles per hour, giving people in Guam several days to prepare. A ballistic missile launched from North Korea, however, would take just 17 minutes to hit the waters off the island.\u201cFrom the moment the sirens sound off, everyone should be ready to shelter in place,\u201d Ms. Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to make a plan now so that when it\u2019s time for an emergency you\u2019ll know what to do.\u201dMs. Cruz detailed the preparations people needed to take.\u201cCreate a family group chat so you can quickly communicate with each other instead of making individual calls,\u201d Ms. Cruz suggested. \u201cMake sure you have an emergency kit with basic supplies \u2014 small items like water and a first aid kit can save a life in an emergency situation.\u201dFor many on the island, which is home to Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam, being prepared for an emergency is second nature, said Andrew Lee, a local firefighter and former Marine.\u201cThe nature of my job is to be ready to respond in the capacity that we are able \u2014 that\u2019s the way it is in any fire department, not just the Guam Fire Department,\u201d he said. \u201cAt home, we have a bugout bag prepared for an emergency, but we\u2019re always hoping for the best,\u201d he said, referring to the portable survival kits many families here have.Despite North Korea\u2019s threat to lob a missile toward Guam, many residents seem to be taking things in stride. Guam\u2019s largest supermarket chain, Pay-Less Supermarkets, has not seen any unusual shopping activity in its eight stores, said Kathy Sgro, the company\u2019s executive vice president.\u201cWhile we haven\u2019t noticed an increase in sales of canned goods, bottled water, or emergency items such as candles and batteries, we have seen a small spike in sales of antacids and milk of magnesia, which makes me wonder if people are experiencing higher levels of anxiety than usual,\u201d Ms. Sgro said.Regine Biscoe Lee, a senator in Guam\u2019s Legislature, thinks there is a heightened sense of anxiety among the people of Guam but said that her office had not received any calls regarding the North Korean threat.\u201cHere on Guam it\u2019s business as usual, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re turning a blind eye to the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cFaith and family \u2014 that\u2019s what people cling to here on Guam.

A postmortem examination began that night.Mr. Madsen initially told investigators that he and Ms. Wall had gone out on the submarine, which he had designed, on the evening of Aug. 10 for an article Ms. Wall was working on, and that he had dropped her off later that night in a remote section of the port of Copenhagen.But he later changed his story, telling investigators that Ms. Wall died accidentally on the submarine, which sank, and that he had buried her at sea.Jens Moller, chief homicide investigator for the Copenhagen police, said at a news conference that metal had been attached to the torso to weigh it down. \u201cWe consider this a breakthrough in the investigation,\u201d Mr. Moller said, \u201cbut we continue to search for the missing body parts.\u201dHe also said that \u201ccoagulated blood\u201d had been found inside Mr. Madsen\u2019s submarine, which was recovered from a depth of about 22 feet. The police have said that they believe the submarine was deliberately sunk.Mr. Madsen\u2019s lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, said after the announcement that her client \u201cfinds it positive that there is a final clarification\u201d about the discovery of Ms. Wall\u2019s body.Ms. Engmark said she could not comment on the condition of Ms. Wall\u2019s body beyond her client\u2019s statement that he buried her at sea. \u201cDue to the court\u2019s closed doors, I\u2019m not permitted to either confirm or deny reports on what happened to the body,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.The police said they are still looking for other parts of Ms. Wall\u2019s body, but criminal law experts said that the evidence \u2014 which appeared damning \u2014 could already be enough to secure a conviction.Sentences for murder in Denmark rarely go beyond 16 years, as Scandinavian countries place a heavy emphasis on the prospects of rehabilitation.\u201cKim joined the club having recently returned to Beijing full of passion for the stories she planned to cover here,\u201d the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China said in a statement. \u201cShe was a talented freelance journalist, brimming with integrity, humanity and a deep interest in China and the wider region.\u201d\u201cWhat hurts me the most is that she would have portrayed him in a really fair, honest and compassionate way, trying to find common ground with this guy because that\u2019s what she was about,\u201d Ms. Clerici said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to cope with the idea that something this horrible could happen to her next door to her home.\u201dMr. Jensen, the newspaper editor, said the case had transfixed Denmark.\u201cIt began with a crazy scientist who we thought was a victim, as his submarine disappeared accidentally with a Swedish journalist onboard,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cOur emotions were completely turned around as he went from victim to possible perpetrator.\u201dMr. Madsen had been well known in Denmark as a quirky if temperamental innovator who had worked on developing rockets and submarines. He did not have a criminal record.Mr. Jensen, the editor, said the similarities were troubling and hard to ignore. \u201cThis is a story about the bright Nordic region where dark forces lurk underneath the surface of our well-kept welfare states,\u201d he said.But others found the comparison unseemly. The scriptwriter for \u201cThe Bridge,\u201d Hans Rosenfeldt, wrote in an email: \u201cI\u2019m not at all comfortable with commenting or reflecting over real crimes in this way.\u201dChristina Anderson contributed reporting from Stockholm.Advertisement"}

But I was never nervous \u2014 so today I just sat back, ate some popcorn and cashed in my profits.\u201dOn Monday, the index ticked up, after falling 8 percent on Friday, as investors took the view that the Fed would not be raising interest rates soon after a speech by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.Now, a new generation of day traders, deploying an expanding array of opaque, high-risk, high-return trading vehicles concocted by Wall Street, are pouring into one of the market\u2019s most arcane corners, making bets on whether the VIX \u2014 otherwise known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 will rise or fall.Wagering on the fear gauge, a measure of how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead, has traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors with the cash and financial relationships to purchase the derivatives that facilitate these trades.In the years after the financial crisis, however, investment banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse came out with VIX-linked investments that investors could purchase on the stock exchange, just as if they were buying shares of IBM or Microsoft.Called exchange traded notes, they were a racier version of the exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that track every variety of index and investment strategy and now have more than $4 trillion in investor assets.Led by Barclays iPath S&P 500 Short Term Futures ETN (VXX), these investments have attracted over $14 billion in investor flows since 2012, according to FactSet, a data-gathering firm.There are now more than 30 different VIX-themed investment choices (including some that use leverage, amplifying gains and losses) that investors can snap up on a public exchange.Because they are so easy to trade and because the question driving the trade \u2014 Will the markets succumb to fear or won\u2019t they? \u2014 borders on the existential, a new wave of millennial day traders has been at the forefront of this trade.And many are using Stock Twits, the social media investing website embraced by stay-at-home investors, as well as Twitter and Facebook to passionately promote their strategies.But this explosion in interest is prompting concerns that investors may not be truly aware of what they are getting into.In theory, the murky nomenclature of these investments ought to be warning enough for amateur investors to tread with caution. And it is also true that the fund prospectuses warn bluntly that investors can lose large sums of money if they buy and hold these investments.\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d Mr. Whaley said. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201dIndeed, the most popular of the funds, the Barclays iPath fund, known broadly by its ticker symbol VXX, has since its inception averaged a yearly return of negative 58 percent, according to FactSet.While many professionals will purchase these securities to hedge their exposure to the stock market, analysts say that day traders are now using them to gamble on a sharp spike in the VIX.\u201cYou have seen this infusion of millennials coming in and buying VXX and UVXY,\u201d Mr. Moadel said, referring to the main VIX product and its leveraged cousin. \u201cBut most of the time they just get killed.\u201dDoing the killing, so to speak, have been investors like Mr. Golden, who consistently shorts VXX and UVXY whenever they spike upward.His bet is founded on two principles: one being that VXX and UVXY, because they track a basket of VIX futures, not the index itself, will decline in value over time as the contracts expire.He describes it as a heavy anvil weighing down on the value of each security.Mr. Golden also believes that in the decades since the VIX was introduced in 1993, its long-term trend has been to push consistently downward. Yes, there will be spikes as during major cataclysms (9/11, the 2008 financial crisis) and other less tumultuous events (a devaluation in China, a North Korea crisis or even a presidential tweet).But after every spike of fear must follow a longer period of calm, Mr. Golden contends, which, he argues, is a perfect scenario if your bias is to always bet against fear.\u201cThe nature of volatility is that it desensitizes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why the index has been tracking down for so long.\u201dJust as the frenetic buying of tech stocks by day traders in 1999 and 2000 came to be seen as a major factor behind the boom and bust, market experts say that traders like Mr. Golden who persistently short the VIX have distorted the market.\u201cThe VIX spikes have become more extreme \u2014 on the upside and the downside,\u201d said Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist at Deutsche Bank.Mr. Golden, who is 40, lives in a suburb of Ocala, Fla. Since he has been shorting VIX, he says his net worth has gone to $12 million from $500,000 in about five years.But, as with any trader on a roll, he likes to keep score, and he is quick to spar on Twitter with the traders who appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d program.Now, he is starting a hedge fund dedicated to wagering against the VIX. Investors, he says, have been pounding on his door to get in early, offering him $100 million for starters.That is a lot of money for a onetime Target manager.\u201cYes, it is a crowded trade,\u201d Mr. Golden acknowledged. \u201cBut I don\u2019t worry about crowds \u2014 I just worry what the next existential shock might be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated where Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist, works. It is Deutsche Bank, not Barclays. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Kind of Sichuan Restaurant for New York", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosBefore I\u2019d seen my first chile pepper at Guan Fu, it was already clear that it is a new kind of Sichuan restaurant for New York.To get there, you head to downtown Flushing, Queens, cross a courtyard off Prince Street and pass between the two stone lions under a small Chinese gabled roof, guarding the front door. Inside is a dignified dining room where polished wood panels stand next to weathered wooden screens under gilded, illuminated ceiling recesses.In the private rooms visible behind sliding doors, a few of the chairs look like small thrones. The ones in the main dining room are elaborate, cushioned and wide enough for two. The tables are set with dark wooden chopstick handles, wrapped in metal filigree at one end, with brushed steel tips at the other. To use them, you twist disposable bamboo tips into the steel ends. While you\u2019re doing this, a server brings a party-size segmented wooden bowl holding sunflower seeds and roasted watermelon seeds for you to crack open while you page through the menu.Guan Fu Sichuan\u2019s formality and rich interior detail are rare among this city\u2019s Sichuan restaurants. Atmosphere doesn\u2019t fill your stomach, of course, but when it\u2019s done right, it can slow you down and wake your senses to the smells and tastes on the way.That is the case at Guan Fu, where the kitchen doesn\u2019t always try to strafe your palate into submission with a hail of chiles. The flavors are potent, but they don\u2019t get all of their force from their heat.I didn\u2019t think I could love Sichuan boiled fish with pickled vegetables more than I already do until I tasted Guan Fu\u2019s version. Here the body and flavor of what is typically a rather thin sauce is broadened with a stock made from fish bones. Fresh green chiles provide a heat held in thrilling check by the sourness. The broth is too intensely salty to qualify as soup, the server explained, but I still drank as much of it as I could handle.The kitchen gives mapo tofu, that old war horse, a new lease on life. While the chile heat is not full-bore, the fermented beans and other components are. Shimmering over jiggly mounds of white tofu is a mapo sauce as deeply flavored as any I\u2019ve tasted.Cabbage is fried with pork and fresh chiles, but the appeal of the dish is the way the invisible presence of Sichuan peppercorns sets your mouth and lips tingling.And there is hardly any heat at all in the \u201ceggplant with iron plate.\u201d Traditionally made at home for Sichuan spring festivals, the dish was new to me, and I was very glad to make its acquaintance. Slices of eggplant are slit open, stuffed like dumplings with a pork-eggplant filling, then closed up, battered and fried. They are served in a pan kept over a small flame. The sauce that coated them was swimming with scallions and a few lengths of dried chile, but it drew its energy from the tension between sweet and sour.Not that the kitchen avoids spices. One reason to keep your wits about you while eating at Guan Fu is that you can\u2019t always tell when extreme heat is about to rain down like Judgment Day.One of the hottest things on the menu, the Guan Fu-style cuttlefish salad, contains almost no red chiles. Its ability to shock and amaze comes from fresh green chiles that are roasted until black, skinned and made into a sauce that tastes almost Mexican. Barely cooked cuttlefish are scored with a knife so they twist up and look like little pine cones. That potent green sauce insinuates itself into every one of their crevices.This is one of many Guan Fu dishes that are rarely seen in New York, if ever. The menu is about 40 glossy pages long and full of color photographs of coral groupers, crystal crabs and other sea animals. In some parts it looks like a children\u2019s book, although the kids won\u2019t like the way the story ends for the soft-shell turtle.If you order one, a live specimen is brought out for inspection and reappears a short time later in pieces, mingled with potatoes, green beans and pickled cherry peppers. Its shell lies over the dish like a green cloche. Tradition dictates that the oldest person at the table has first crack at the chewy rim of fat around the edge. (At my table, that honor went to me. It and the soft cartilage were the most interesting parts of the animal; the meat was like fish-flavored chicken.)Not all the exotic imported species were available when I went, and others were offered at prices that scared me off. They are, presumably, meant for other customers who can afford to pay for a taste of home. Guan Fu, which joins a cluster of restaurants under the Hyatt Place hotel in the One Fulton Square real estate venture, is a reflection of the new money that is starting to transform this end of Flushing. The owners, Li Boru and Xue Wei, moved from China to New York to go to graduate school and wanted to open a restaurant that would evoke the aristocratic cooking of China\u2019s dynastic era.For ordinary budgets, the kitchen will make most fish dishes with either tilapia or sea bass. The bass, clean and fresh tasting, is what I ordered with the pickled vegetables and in an equally heroic dish called \u201chomemade roasted fish.\u201d The bass was cooked whole and served with crunchy lotus root in a dark, fiery, wonderful stew seasoned with cilantro, Sichuan peppercorns and a 32-ingredient chile oil.Among the menu\u2019s soft spots were two dishes any Sichuan restaurant should nail. Both dan dan noodles and kung pao chicken were unaccountably sleepy. Still, the noodles themselves, made on site, were very good, and the chicken had real flavor, which isn\u2019t always the case. This wasn\u2019t enough to make either dish interesting, but it does show the care Guan Fu takes with its ingredients.The day-to-day cooking is in the hands of one chef and the recipes are the domain of another, who works in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan Province. Mr. Li and Mr. Xue declined to name either man, citing personal reasons and a fear of chef poachers.According to one server, the chef in Chengdu was meant to join the one in Flushing but has been prevented from leaving China. This may explain some minor kitchen inconsistencies, like knife work that can be painstaking on some nights but haphazard on others.The dining room staff is variable, too. Multiple cues were missed at one dinner, when plates weren\u2019t changed and cups of very good jasmine tea weren\u2019t refilled as often as we would have liked. During other meals, the servers were extraordinarily eager to help.Guan Fu is a restaurant with room to grow. But it is an exceptional one already, throwing open a window on Sichuan cuisine to show New Yorkers the nuance and rich variety that lie beyond the old blast of chiles.Advertisement"}

Ron Lieber, The Times\u2019s Your Money columnist, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Personal finance is indeed deeply personal, and I\u2019ve found over the years that I learn as much from the people who read my work as I do from sources. To tap into that wisdom, I often open up comments on my column and moderate them myself, replying along the way to questions or particularly provocative statements.But because mine is a weekend column and there are sometimes hundreds of comments to approve by hand, I need to have a laptop with me wherever I go in order to keep up, and the lighter the better. So I lean hard on my MacBook Air (and really abuse the Samsonite Xenon backpack I use to lug it around).What do you like about it, and what could be better?A while back, I heard the author Gretchen Rubin say something enlightening about how much happier she was when she realized she could have multiple phone chargers and laptop cords instead of just one. I bought myself a Chromebook to use for office meetings (to go with my desktop machine at work and the Mac at home) so I wasn\u2019t lugging the Mac around on the subway even more than I already do.What\u2019s your favorite fintech app, and why?I love being able to scan checks and deposit them without doing the whole envelope, stamp, mailbox routine. I haven\u2019t maintained checking accounts at banks with branches in over 15 years, and this helps me keep the streak going. I do find it rather curious, however, that Charles Schwab can suck that paper through the air and into my checking account without much delay but still helps itself to a four-day hold on transfers from my external savings account.I have a saying \u2014 more like a lament \u2014 that I repeat so often that I\u2019ve turned it into a hashtag: Nothing is simple or easy. (Nothing!) #Nisoe. Technology has come a long way, but it is almost never as simple as its marketers suggest. My wife and I have rarely managed to touch any aspect of our audiovisual setup in our apartment without needing to pay someone to actually make it work. Now, hiring tech support in this way is reflexive \u2014 a pre-emptive way to buy back time that would surely be lost in figuring the whole thing out and probably failing. So I encourage people to budget for that, whether in hours or dollars.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life, and what do you and your family do with it?Why is Spotify better than alternatives like Apple Music?I haven\u2019t tried Apple Music, so I\u2019m not sure if it would be any better at this, but it would be neat to be able to post these spontaneous playlists to Facebook with some kind of natural language command so that people could play them with just one click. Why can\u2019t I type (or speak) something obviously recognizable, like \u201ctake the last six songs I played and post them to my Facebook account\u201d and have it just happen?If you could dream up a gadget or app that has yet to exist, what would it be and how much would you be willing to pay for it?I don\u2019t even know where to start here. Let\u2019s go from cheap to expensive.A voice (or foot!) operated screen door for when your hands are filled with grilled food or dirty dishes: $10.An app for all kids\u2019 first phones that allows them to help when they see someone on the street in need of help. Hit one button, and $1 moves from their allowance app to the nearest homeless shelter or food bank. I\u2019d pay $20 for this, but maybe Apple or Google will figure this out themselves and give it away in their app stores.And how about an app that finally lets me store all of the restaurants I want to try, so I can pull it up whenever I get hungry to remind myself of what is nearby or at the location that I\u2019m heading to? Maybe $25 for this one.Advertisement"}

What are the police doing, Mommy?\u201dThe authorities and the people of Euclid have been asking the same questions since the police pulled over Richard Hubbard III shortly before 10:30 Saturday morning, after they said he rolled through an intersection.Dash cam footage of the encounter released Monday by the Euclid police is no less violent.The footage shows Mr. Hubbard emerging from the silver Hyundai. After a brief, blurry exchange, the police officer on the driver\u2019s side, Michael Amiott, shoves Mr. Hubbard forcefully against the vehicle. The two men begin to struggle as Officer Amiott kicks at Mr. Hubbard and his partner rushes around to assist.Both videos then show Officer Amiott crouched over Mr. Hubbard, who is lying on the street. He punches Mr. Hubbard in the head and face more than a dozen times over the course of several minutes.The blows do not stop coming, even when Mr. Hubbard is completely prone on the ground.

{"Headline": "The Loyal Engineers Steering NASA\u2019s Voyager Probes Across the Universe", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "FeatureAs the Voyager mission is winding down, so, too, are the careers of the aging explorers who expanded our sense of home in the galaxy.Supported byA fleet of JPL trucks made the trip under armored guard to the same destination. Their cargo was unwrapped inside the hangar high bay, a gleaming silo stocked with tool racks and ladder trucks. Engineers began to assemble the various pieces. Gradually, two identical spacecraft took shape. They were dubbed Voyager I and II, and their mission was to make the first color photographs and close-up measurements of Jupiter, Saturn and their moons. Then, if all went well, they might press onward \u2014 into uncharted territory.It took six months, working in shifts around the clock, for the NASA crew to reassemble and test the spacecraft. As the first launch date, Aug. 20, drew near, they folded the camera and instrument boom down against the spacecraft\u2019s spindly body like a bird\u2019s wing; gingerly they pushed it, satellite dish first, up inside a metal capsule hanging from the high bay ceiling. Once \u2018\u2018mated,\u2019\u2019 the capsule and its cargo \u2014 a probe no bigger than a Volkswagen Beetle that, along with its twin, had nevertheless taken 1,500 engineers five years and more than $200 million to build \u2014 were towed to the launchpad.By T-minus two hours, a select few engineers, too nervous to sit down, stood at computers outside the high bay, overseeing the spacecraft telemetry. Elsewhere in the hangar, scientists, NASA brass from Washington and several dozen \u2018\u2018nonessential\u2019\u2019 engineers \u2014 Zottarelli among them \u2014 huddled around TV monitors. At T-minus 30 seconds, the spacecraft\u2019s engines roared to life, and many of the nonessentials took off running out of the room and toward the exit \u2014 \u2018\u2018seven, six, five.\u2019\u2019 They burst out into the morning. Shielding their eyes, they peered across a flat expanse at smoke billowing on the horizon. Slowly and silently, the capsule rose out of the cloud, its rockets trailing flames. In an instant, there came a terrific boom as the sound waves from blastoff hit the hangar like a gong, ringing it as the spacecraft disappeared.Two weeks later, after the second launch, everyone headed home. The show was over \u2014 both spacecraft were performing flawlessly \u2014 but behind the scenes, the mission, on a tight budget, lagged in hiring the more than 200 computer engineers needed to shepherd the spacecraft through a planetary encounter. Many of those on the flight team were fresh out of college, running the most sophisticated electronics systems in the world. They had barely had a chance to jell, when, in April 1978, not yet halfway to Jupiter, Voyager 1 experienced a problem. Its scan platform, where the cameras and instruments are mounted, got stuck.As the engineers scrambled to figure out what they could do from more than 100 million miles away, someone forgot to send a weekly command to reset a timer on the other spacecraft. When it ran down without hearing from Earth, it triggered so-called fault-protection software, 600 lines of code that respond to malfunctions automatically. In this instance, fault protection assumed the radio receiver was broken and switched to the backup. On the mission-control monitors in a situation like this, the crawl of numbers reporting the status of the receivers would have turned crimson: a \u2018\u2018red alarm.\u2019\u2019Realizing their mistake, the engineers tried to stop the fault-protection routine, but the newly awakened backup receiver would not register their command. Helpless, they waited for the spacecraft to reason its way back to the original receiver; when it did, and the command went through normally, they were giddy with relief. They were still high-fiving when the working receiver shorted out like a blown fuse. Now it really was dead.Today the Voyagers are 10 billion and 13 billion miles away, the farthest man-made objects from Earth. The 40th anniversary of their launch will be celebrated next month. We tend to think of space as vacant, but it is actually matter, created, as everything in the universe is, by the explosions of ancient stars. Within our planetary neighborhood, this \u2018\u2018space\u2019\u2019 is made up of different particles than the space outside is, because of supersonic wind that blows out from the surface of our sun at a million miles per hour. The wind generates a bubble around our solar system called the heliosphere. Five years ago, Voyager 1 reached the boundary where the heliosphere gives way to interstellar space, a region as novel to us \u2014 and potentially relevant \u2014 as the Pacific was to Europeans 500 years ago. The data the probes are collecting are challenging fundamental physics and will provide clues to the biggest of questions: Why did our sun give birth to life only here? Where else, within our solar system or others, are we most likely to find evidence that we are not alone?The mission quite possibly represents the end of an era of space exploration in which the main goal is observation rather than commercialization. In internal memos, Trump-administration advisers have referred to NASA\u2019s traditional contractors as \u2018\u2018Old Space\u2019\u2019 and proposed refocusing its budget on supporting the growth of the private \u2018\u2018New Space\u2019\u2019 industry, Politico reported in February. \u2018\u2018Economic development of space\u2019\u2019 will begin in near-Earth orbit and on the moon, according to the president\u2019s transition team, with \u2018\u2018private lunar landers staking out de facto \u2018property rights\u2019 for Americans on the moon, by 2020.\u2019\u2019All explorations demand sacrifices in exchange for uncertain outcomes. Some of those sacrifices are social: how many resources we collectively devote to a given pursuit of knowledge. But another portion is borne by the explorer alone, who used to be rewarded with adventure and fame if not fortune. For the foreseeable future, Voyager seems destined to remain in the running for the title of Mankind\u2019s Greatest Journey, which might just make its nine flight-team engineers \u2014 most of whom have been with the mission since the Reagan administration \u2014 our greatest living explorers. They also may be the last people left on the planet who can operate the spacecraft\u2019s onboard computers, which have 235,000 times less memory and 175,000 times less speed than a 16-gigabyte smartphone. And while it\u2019s true that these pioneers haven\u2019t gone anywhere themselves, they are arguably every bit as dauntless as more celebrated predecessors. Magellan never had to steer a vessel from the confines of a dun-colored rental office, let alone stay at the helm long enough to qualify for a senior discount at the McDonald\u2019s next door.Their fluency in archaic programming languages will become only more crucial as the years go on, because even as the probes harvest priceless information from the cosmos, they are running out of fuel. (Decaying plutonium supplies their power.) By 2030 at the latest, they will not have enough juice left to run a single experiment. And even that best case comes with a major caveat: that the flight-team members forgo retirement to squeeze the most out of every last watt.The Voyagers carried cameras and instruments for analyzing atmospheric temperatures, moon masses, gravitational and magnetic fields and radiation levels. Reaching Jupiter in 1979, they captured images of lightning in its cloud tops and astounded scientists \u2014 who had assumed all moons were as barren as our own \u2014 with pictures of eight active volcanoes on its satellite Io; Europa, another Jovian moon, was encased in a shell of water ice, cracked in places by what appeared to be the tides of an ocean below. The photographs revealed themselves on control-room monitors pixel by pixel, row by row. \u2018\u2018I would be sitting in here at night sometimes when the Voyager mission was flying,\u2019\u2019 Esker Davis, project manager for the Saturn encounter, told David W. Swift, who published an oral history of the mission in 1997, after Davis\u2019s death. \u2018\u2018And my wife would call up and ask what I was doing. I said, \u2018Just watching pictures come in, being the first person to see this picture.\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019The mission would have ended there, but President Ronald Reagan bestowed an extension, possibly swayed by the real-time briefings hosted by Ed Stone, the project\u2019s lead scientist, on the occasion of every planetary encounter. Hundreds of reporters, as well as politicians and celebrities, attended, packing into a cramped JPL auditorium for the debuts of Uranus in 1986 and Neptune in 1989.The final flyby, of Neptune\u2019s moon Triton, took place on a hot August night. Afterward, everyone celebrated with Champagne, cold cuts and drunken singing; on the JPL lawn, Chuck Berry performed \u2018\u2018Johnny B. Goode,\u2019\u2019 one of the tracks included on gold-plated records of human sights and sounds attached to the spacecraft for any intelligent life that might find them. Then, gradually, the hallways grew quiet. Stone and his colleagues moved on to new projects while analyzing Voyager data part time; the flight team laid off 150 engineers (many of whom went on to staff subsequent missions). The probes\u2019 new goal was to reach interstellar space. But though scientists had measured the speed of the solar wind that forms the heliosphere, the properties of the matter beyond it had never been analyzed. How much pressure it exerted on the bubble, and thus the size of the bubble, were a mystery. So, too, was how long \u2014 years? decades? \u2014 it might take a craft to escape it.At the mission\u2019s outset, the flight-team members were mischievous kids. They relieved stress with games and pranks: bowling in the hallway, using soda cans as pins; filling desk drawers with plastic bags of live goldfish; making scientists compete in disco-pose contests. Now, by 1990, they were older, with kids of their own. They had experienced the deaths of colleagues and watched others\u2019 marriages falter as a result of long hours at the lab. With no planets to explore, they spent the decade doing routine spacecraft maintenance with a fraction of their bygone manpower. Six of the current nine engineers were on the team then. Sun Kang Matsumoto, who joined the mission in \u201985, studied so diligently to master the new roles pressed upon her that her sons learned the spacecraft contours by osmosis. When her eldest was 8, he surprised her with a perfect Lego model; now in college, \u2018\u2018he calls and asks, \u2018How is Voyager?\u2019 Like, \u2018How is Grandma?\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto says.The mission originally occupied three floors of Building 264 on the JPL campus, home to many of the lab\u2019s highest-profile projects. But soon after Neptune, says Jefferson Hall, who joined the project in 1978, \u2018\u2018we were booted out.\u2019\u2019 Their first move was into the former offices of a mainframe-computer company in Sierra Madre. In 2002, after more staff cuts, they moved to a rental suite in Altadena. NASA reviewed the mission to determine if it should be canceled altogether.The scientists\u2019 models, meanwhile, began to reveal subtle changes in the raw data. By late 2004, it was clear that Voyager 1\u2019s magnetometer had detected an abrupt increase in the strength of the surrounding magnetic field, suggesting the probe had entered the outermost layer of the heliospheric bubble, the \u2018\u2018heliosheath.\u2019\u2019 This is where the solar wind ions abruptly slow as they press outward against the surrounding interstellar matter and swerve to create a cometlike tail. A wind of interstellar ions flows around the outside of the bubble like water around the bow of a ship. Finally, on Aug. 25, 2012, the density of particles around the spacecraft precipitously increased, as though it had plunged from sky to sea. It had crossed the threshold of interstellar space.Last autumn, I drove through the San Gabriel Valley to a squat concrete building beside Scott-Fox Puppy Preschool. Suzanne Dodd, 56, the mission\u2019s project manager, answered the door. She wore red-framed glasses over sharp blue eyes, and her fair hair was cut short. She escorted me past the vestibule to a common room ringed by office doors. Hanging over the cubicle partitions in the center was a shingle that read \u2018\u2018Mission Control.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018You can see where we are in the culture,\u2019\u2019 she said, with a mild sweep of her palm. Voyager was her first job. She pointed out a used microfiche reader that Tom Weeks, a hardware engineer and the self-described mission librarian, purchased on eBay to read old diagnostics reports. To conserve power on the spacecraft, the engineers must decide what to turn off when, and for how long \u2014 which means estimating how cold they can let each component get. (On Voyager 2, because of the broken oscillator, any change in temperature also tweaks the receiver frequency.) Turning the heaters off for a while is the safest way to get enough power to run the instruments, but the lower the overall wattage drops, the faster parts will freeze. One of the team\u2019s most valuable insights so far: Spinning the wheels of an eight-track tape recorder \u2014 the spacecrafts\u2019 only data-storage option \u2014 generates a bit of additional heat.Enrique Medina, the power subsystem expert, was preparing to implement a \u2018\u2018patch,\u2019\u2019 an update that would turn off a heater on Voyager 2 in order to run the gyroscope, roll the spacecraft and calibrate the magnetometer. Even though they simulate every patch with software, there is plenty of room for human error. Far more often, hardware fails for no evident reason. In 1998, Voyager 2 reacted to a command by going silent. For 64 hours straight, the flight team studied the specific instruction \u2014 consisting of 18 bits, or 1s and 0s \u2014 that preceded the blackout. Bits have been known to \u2018\u2018flip\u2019\u2019 to the opposite value, changing the instruction the same way that swapping a single letter turns \u2018\u2018cat\u2019\u2019 into \u2018\u2018cut.\u2019\u2019 The question was: What instruction had they accidentally given and how could they undo it? At last, modeling the outcome of each possible bit, they discovered one that turned off the exciter, which generates the spacecraft\u2019s radio signal; when they turned it back on, the transmissions resumed. A similar scare took place in 2010, when a bit involved in formatting telemetry flipped, turning the transmissions to gibberish. \u2018\u2018A lot of our anomalies we\u2019ve come up with workarounds for, and at the time we didn\u2019t know why it happened,\u2019\u2019 Weeks explained. Dodd added, \u2018\u2018The No. 1 rule with spacecraft is: Don\u2019t change it if you don\u2019t have to.\u2019\u2019In the mission-control cubby, Medina, who is 68 and a grandfather of four, with a husky voice and a Tom Selleck mustache, rolled a chair over to two pairs of monitors labeled with construction-paper signs that read: \u2018\u2018Voyager Mission Control Hardware, PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH.\u2019\u2019 He jiggled a mouse, and one of the screens woke to a stream of numbers and letters describing the health of Voyager 1.Because they have only four kilobytes of computer storage, the spacecraft transmit data 24/7, but the radio signals take 19 hours and 12 hours to reach Earth. The three antenna dishes big enough to register them are shared, so Voyager gets only four to six hours of reception time per spacecraft per day; outside these often odd windows, their data dissipate into the ether. Medina gestured to another computer in the corner that monitors the telemetry that comes in when the office is empty and, if it detects an anomaly, phones an on-call engineer: the Voyager Alarm Monitor Processor Including Remote Examination tool. \u2018\u2018We call it Vampire,\u2019\u2019 Medina said, \u2018\u2018because it works in the middle of the night.\u2019\u2019In March 2014, after news broke that Voyager 1 had crossed into interstellar space, I spoke with Medina over the phone. \u2018\u2018I would not leave my wife to go with Angelina Jolie, as exciting as that sounds,\u2019\u2019 he told me. \u2018\u2018And I would not leave Voyager to go to the new Mars missions. I will not leave Voyager until it ceases to exist. Or until I cease to exist.\u2019\u2019\u2018\u2018If the pressure outside got high enough, and there are some areas in the Milky Way galaxy where it would be high enough, it could compress the heliosphere down to where in fact the boundary is almost to where we are. And that would change the radiation environment of the planets, which is important when you want to try to understand anything about the origin of life,\u2019\u2019 Ed Stone, the science-team leader, told me when I visited him at Caltech last fall. \u2018\u2018Here on Earth, wherever there\u2019s liquid water, whether it\u2019s boiling water coming out of the vents or frozen water, there are microbes there. So life is remarkably robust where there\u2019s water.\u2019\u2019He went on: \u2018\u2018I think that one of the biggest questions is, Can we find a spot here in the solar system where there\u2019s microbial life? If there\u2019s no microbial life anywhere else, that would be surprising, given here on Earth it appeared fairly quickly after the end of the bombardment,\u2019\u2019 an epic rain of asteroids some four billion years ago. \u2018\u2018If one could ever find some evidence of it here in the solar system where we could get a sample, then one could look at the DNA. All life on Earth has a related DNA. Is that true for everywhere? Either answer would be amazing. Either there\u2019s only one way that life evolves, or no, there\u2019s more than one way.\u2019\u2019In his office, Stone stood on tiptoe to lift an intricate model of Voyager from the top of a bookcase. At 81, he moves more stiffly than the Stone of NASA archival footage. Otherwise, he is remarkably unchanged. On a bulletin board behind his computer, he pins the latest graphs of the rate of charged particles that each spacecraft has detected. A drastic dip in low-energy ones is what convinced him that Voyager 1 had exited the heliosphere, and he is eager for Voyager 2, which entered the heliosheath from a different angle in 2007, to see a comparable drop before it goes quiet.\u2018\u2018When we started this, I realized we were on a mission of discovery,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I just had no idea how much discovery there was going to be. And I certainly had no idea that it would last as long as it has.\u2019\u2019 After we lose contact with them, the spacecraft will continue to orbit the galaxy for billions of years, never striking another star. \u2018\u2018Space,\u2019\u2019 Stone said, \u2018\u2018is really empty.\u2019\u2019Astrophysicists who study the heliosphere wage a constant battle against apathy when it comes to invisible substances nearly 100 times farther away from us than the sun is. \u2018\u2018I hear a lot of people saying, \u2018So what?\u2019 I try to explain: \u2018It\u2019s like your home,\u2019\u2009\u2019\u2019 Merav Opher, a professor of astrophysics at Boston University and a member of the Voyager science team, told me. \u2018\u2018You just found out the walls aren\u2019t walls. They\u2019re porous. I think it\u2019s existential.\u2019\u2019 In 2006, Opher and Stone published a landmark paper in The Astrophysical Journal predicting that Voyager 2 would encounter the heliosphere boundary closer to the sun than its twin had, pointing to a startling contradiction: The heliosphere must be asymmetrical; it is not a \u2018\u2018sphere\u2019\u2019 after all.There is passionate disagreement about what its exact shape is. (The Voyager scientists argue over practically every scrap of data; a few holdouts insist that Voyager 1 has yet to reach interstellar space.) In 1961, Eugene Parker, the renowned astrophysicist who first predicted the existence of a heliosphere, hypothesized that it might look like a comet \u2014 compressed in front with a tail in back. Earlier this year, Tom Krimigis, the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and the principal investigator for Voyager\u2019s Low-Energy Charged Particle Experiment, published a paper in Nature Astronomy showing that the heliosphere has a very short tail and \u2018\u2018kind of moves through space like a clenched fist.\u2019\u2019 His instrument has also shown that cosmic rays \u2014 expected to flow toward the heliosphere uniformly from across interstellar space \u2014 actually move quite differently depending on their orientation to the interstellar magnetic field. \u2018\u2018Every once in a while, a tsunami passes Voyager,\u2019\u2019 Krimigis told me, referring to these waves. \u2018\u2018The galaxy was supposed to be a calm sea, and that\u2019s not what we find.\u2019\u2019Opher believes that the influence of the sun\u2019s magnetic field may warp the heliosphere into the shape of a \u2018\u2018croissant.\u2019\u2019 At its plump center, interstellar matter presses in closer than previously thought \u2014 which would mean we are less isolated from the rest of the galaxy than we believe.Later that morning, when Zottarelli entered the conference room to attend his last daily flight-team briefing, his colleague Adans Ko, 58, was arranging takeout containers of dim sum on the table for a celebration. He threw an arm around his shoulders and said, \u2018\u2018Larry is going to give me a kiss today!\u2019\u2019 Matsumoto, who was holding a camera, said, \u2018\u2018O.K., look at me.\u2019\u2019 She was making a photo album for him. When the party broke up, I found Zottarelli\u2019s replacement, Lu Yang, at her desk. I asked her if he had given her any specific advice. \u2018\u2018Whatever the problem, you go there and solve it,\u2019\u2019 she said, and laughed.In retirement, Zottarelli told me, he would like to see Florida again. He wonders how it has changed. In his garage is a 1954 Swallow Doretti, a fixer-upper. \u2018\u2018It probably needs new brakes,\u2019\u2019 he said. I asked him if there was anywhere he liked to drive for fun. \u2018\u2018No,\u2019\u2019 he replied. \u2018\u2018Not anymore.\u2019\u2019I had stopped by his office to say goodbye and ask him what he planned to do with his newfound freedom. I pictured him in the Doretti, flying down the Pacific Coast Highway, wind in his hair. But he seemed to be in no mood for talking. I wished him well and turned to go. Then he spoke. \u2018\u2018I expect my second stroke will be on the 17th of November,\u2019\u2019 he said ruefully, gesturing toward his empty wall calendar. \u2018\u2018Life expectancy is five to seven years at my age on retiring, so \u2014\u2019\u2019 He paused. \u2018\u2018That was humor, I guess. I\u2019m not looking forward to being even older. Got no choice in the matter.\u2019\u2019I asked if he ever found himself thinking about the billions of years that the Voyagers will circle the center of the galaxy, long after our sun has exploded, scattering more stardust throughout the universe. \u2018\u2018Of course,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I was raised in the Roman Rite. I\u2019m pretty much an atheist. But what is the meaning of life? It\u2019s not Monty Python, O.K.?\u2019\u2019Had he reached any conclusions about what it is? \u2018\u2018Well, on Earth, yeah,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018One species always prepares the way for the next generation \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u2019\u2019An article on Aug. 6 about the Voyager space probes misstated the title of Tom Krimigis. He is the emeritus head of the Space Department at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, not the emeritus head of the entire laboratory.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sorrow and Scrutiny After a Teenager\u2019s Death at Football Practice", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFARMINGVILLE, N.Y. \u2014 It was the first official day of football season at Sachem High School East here, but the field remained empty and silent. The overcast sky bore down on the green grounds; dreary weather on a dreadful day. If not for the accident, Joshua Mileto\u2019s team would have been holding tryouts for the new season.Instead, hundreds of Sachem East teenagers gathered at the McManus-Lorey Funeral Home, two miles away, to pay final respects to Mr. Mileto, 16. Last week, several football players watched in horror as a 400-pound log struck him on the head during a preseason conditioning practice on the field. On Monday, dressed in black clothes, they hugged one another as they waited in line outside his wake. Some of the players, who wore their team jerseys, held back tears. Others could not.For many in this tight-knit Long Island community, Mr. Mileto\u2019s death was a tragic accident with no sensible explanation.Dr. Douglas Casa, a national expert on sports conditioning, said he had never heard of the log drill being used in football practice at the high school level. He said that in 20 years in the field, the only time he encountered the drill was as an expert witness in a court case after a high school wrestler died from heat stroke following the exercise. (Dr. Casa estimated that he had been an expert witness in over 40 cases in which athletes have died.)\u201cMy immediate thought is that Navy SEAL training is brutally hard, generally, for men in the mid-20s who are some of the best athletes in the whole world. And most of them don\u2019t make it through the training,\u201d said Dr. Casa, the chief executive of the Korey Stringer Institute, an organization based in Connecticut focused on preventing athletes\u2019 deaths. \u201cMost of the best athletes in the world can\u2019t make it through. This is not a good idea for kids to be doing.\u201dThe attention has provoked a sense of defensiveness in the Sachem East community, which includes several mostly white, middle-class towns on Long Island. (Sachem East is one of two high schools in the district; Farmingville is part of the larger town of Brookhaven.) As they grieved, Sachem parents and students remained careful not to point fingers and were protective of the coaches overseeing the training camp where Mr. Mileto died. Many insisted the community needed to grieve before turning to the cause of the fatal accident.\u201cAfter he passed, people started gravitating to asking, \u2018What if we had done this? What if we had done that? What if we didn\u2019t do that drill?\u2019 But that\u2019s the same thing that happens in any tragedy,\u201d said Ryan Leone, 20, a recent Sachem East graduate who was on the field visiting when Mr. Mileto was fatally injured. He helped the coaches, whom he knew, provide emergency aid to Mr. Mileto.\u201cThese coaches would not have done something that they didn\u2019t feel comfortable supervising or that would hurt the kids,\u201d Mr. Leone said. \u201cI think it\u2019s just wrong to look at it from that perspective.\u201d\u201cThe biggest concern was someone stubbing their toe,\u201d he added. \u201cThis just wasn\u2019t being done in an unsafe way.\u201dThe accident happened just after 8:30 a.m. on Aug. 10. Mr. Leone said he was startled when someone shouted repeatedly, \u201cCoach, call 9-1-1!\u201d Mr. Leone sprinted toward the commotion and joined several adults and coaches attempting to treat Mr. Mileto, whose face was covered in blood.One coach, Chris Di\u2019Iorio, performed CPR as Mariano Gonzalez, the team\u2019s trainer, applied pressure to the wound. Mr. Leone and another coach tried to keep Mr. Mileto breathing. but according to Mr. Leone, they could not find a pulse.Mr. Mileto\u2019s mother arrived on the scene soon after he was placed in an ambulance. They drove to Stony Brook University Hospital \u2014 she rode in the front seat \u2014 where Mr. Mileto was pronounced dead.The use of the log drill has come under scrutiny particularly because deaths during practice are so rare. Several of the coaches declined to comment for this article \u2014 including the head coach, Mark Wojciechowski \u2014 and it was not clear if the team had performed the log drill before. After initial inquiries by The New York Times about safety protocols to Dr. Ken Graham, the superintendent of the Sachem Central School District, a communications consultant said in an email that the district was not involved in the training camp. Though the practice took place on the school\u2019s field and included the school\u2019s coaches, it was overseen by the Sachem East Touchdown Club, which raises money for the football club. The president and vice president for the club did not return calls requesting comment.The Associated Press reported on Friday that Mr. Wojciechowski and another member of the coaching staff were being reassigned pending an investigation into the death.Mr. Mileto\u2019s death does not neatly fit into the existing national conversation about the safety of contact football, which centers primarily on preventing and treating concussions. But it does raise some of the same concerns those involved in youth sports often cite, including how hard coaches push youngsters during training or whether they take unnecessary risks for the sake of gaining an edge.More than a million high school athletes play tackle football each year across the country. While injuries are common, deaths are rare, and traumatic-injury deaths typically happen during games rather than training sessions, said Dr. Kristen Kucera, a sports science expert and the director of the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Dr. Kucera said she had not previously heard of high school students using a log to train.Dr. Casa said it was unfortunate that there was no national governing body for high school sports, as there is for college sports, that can regulate safety standards for practices. Instead, the process is handled by state associations with varying degrees of efficacy. He also worried that medical experts are not always consulted when local administrators are setting safety standards.\u201cMedical people don\u2019t set medical policies,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are athletic administrators that set policies. That shocks any parent that I tell that.\u201dAnd identifying who should have the final say in conversations about safety regulations can also be contentious.Chris Boone, a spokesman for the National Federation of State High School Associations, said that individual schools, school districts and state associations determine practice regulations through agreements that differ from state to state. Robert Zayas, the executive director of the New York State Public High School Athletic Association, said that the organization does not have any specific rules or regulations that dictate what is permitted in training. He said the association does, however, have standards related to concussion management. \u201cWe have a lot of safety measures in place, but no rules and regulations,\u201d he added.\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on the conditioning drill that a coach was conducting,\u201d Mr. Zayas said. \u201cThe number of drills and conditioning practices that we see throughout New York and throughout the country vary greatly. As teams are conditioning in the off-season, it\u2019s left up to the discretion of the coaches.\u201dThe Sachem Central School District said in a statement on Wednesday that it \u201cwill assess the status of the team\u2019s activities over the course of the next several days.\u201d The district said that in addition to a police investigation, an internal district investigation had been opened.Mr. Leone, who is a junior at the University of Pennsylvania and was visiting home before the new school year, had worked as a coach with middle school students as part of the Sachem East Touchdown Club and knew the coaches on the team. He said he was not sure if the log drill had been used in previous training sessions.\u201cI think that image deeply affected the coaches that were there,\u201d Mr. Leone said, referring to Mr. Mileto\u2019s injuries. \u201cI just hope they never have to see anything like this again. I keep seeing his face pop into my head.\u201dStephanie Caleb, a senior at Sachem East, said that everyone at the school was devastated by the loss. Her boyfriend, who is on the football team, was close with Mr. Mileto. She said that the intense media attention to his death made it difficult to grieve in peace.There was deep anger at the news media, Ms. Caleb said, \u201cand the news reporters invading everybody\u2019s privacy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not completely wrong to ask for information,\u201d she said, \u201cbut showing up and filming everybody outside the funeral, that\u2019s not right.\u201dMr. Mileto\u2019s official obituary pulls at the heartstrings. \u201cTo Josh his community was a part of his family and the feeling was mutual,\u201d it read. He loved his friends, sports, music and \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\u201d He kissed his mother daily, the obituary noted.\u201cWe are absolutely beyond devastated,\u201d wrote his mother, Sayyida Mileto, in a Facebook post. \u201cWe are in no way able to respond or speak to anyone at this point.\u201dMany of his classmates, as teenagers do, expressed their grief on Facebook and Instagram. They posted photo montages with long tributes; they changed their user profiles to include crying emojis and praying hands; they shared photos of him in his football jersey, No. 5, ready to play.Because of an editing error an earlier version of this article provided the incorrect day for Joshua Mileto\u2019s wake. His wake was Monday, not Tuesday. The error was repeated in a caption in one of the photographs.Advertisement"}

And then, in the hours and days after a participant drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring at least 19 others, internet companies undertook a collective purge.Facebook banned a range of pages with names like \u2018\u2018Right Wing Death Squad\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018White Nationalists United.\u2019\u2019 Reddit banned, among others, a hard-right community called \u2018\u2018Physical Removal,\u2019\u2019 an organizer of which had called the weekend\u2019s killing \u2018\u2018a morally justified action.\u2019\u2019 Twitter suspended an unknown number of users, including popular accounts associated with 4chan\u2019s openly fascistic Politically Incorrect message board, or /pol/. Discord, a chat app for gamers that doubled as an organizing tool for the event, and where a prominent white supremacist had called for disrupting Heyer\u2019s funeral, rushed to do cleanup.The clampdown extended beyond the walled gardens of social platforms to a wide array of online services. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi site that promoted the march and celebrated its fatal outcome, was banned by the domain registrar and hosting service GoDaddy, then hours later by Google\u2019s hosting service, then lost access to SendGrid, which it had used to deliver its newsletter; PayPal cut off the white nationalist Richard Spencer\u2019s organization, which later lost access to its web host, Squarespace; Airbnb removed the accounts of a number of Charlottesville attendees before the event, and released a statement saying that \u2018\u2018violence, racism and hatred demonstrated by neo-\u00adNazis, the alt-right and white supremacists should have no place in this world\u2019\u2019; by Wednesday, Spotify was even expunging \u2018\u2018white supremacist\u2019\u2019 music from its library.The platforms\u2019 sudden action in response to an outpouring of public grief and rage resembles, at first glance, a moral awakening and suggests a mounting sense of responsibility to the body politic. You could be forgiven for seeing this as a turning point for these sites, away from a hands-off approach to the communities they host and toward something with more oversight and regulation. An inside-out version of this analysis has been embraced by right-wing users, who have wasted no time declaring these bans a violation of their free speech. But this is an incomplete accounting of what happened and one that serves two parties and two parties alone: the companies themselves and the people they\u2019ve just banned.It is worth noting that the platforms most flamboyantly dedicated to a borrowed idea of free speech and assembly are the same ones that have struggled most intensely with groups of users who seek to organize and disrupt their platforms. A community of trolls on an internet platform is, in political terms, not totally unlike a fascist movement in a weak liberal democracy: It engages with and uses the rules and protections of the system it inhabits with the intent of subverting it and eventually remaking it in their image or, if that fails, merely destroying it.But what gave these trolls power on platforms wasn\u2019t just their willingness to act in bad faith and to break the rules and norms of their environment. It was their understanding that the rules and norms of platforms were self-serving and cynical in the first place. After all, these platforms draw arbitrary boundaries constantly and with much less controversy \u2014 against spammers, concerning profanity or in response to government demands. These fringe groups saw an opportunity in the gap between the platforms\u2019 strained public dedication to discourse stewardship and their actual existence as profit-driven entities, free to do as they please. Despite their participatory rhetoric, social platforms are closer to authoritarian spaces than democratic ones. It makes some sense that people with authoritarian tendencies would have an intuitive understanding of how they work and how to take advantage of them.This was also a moment these hate groups were anticipating; getting banned in an opaque, unilateral fashion was always the way out and, to some degree, it suits them. In the last year, hard-right communities on social platforms have cultivated a pre-emptive identity as platform refugees and victims of censorship. They\u2019ve also been preparing for this moment or one like it: There are hard-right alternatives to Twitter, to Reddit and even to the still-mostly-lawless 4chan. There are alternative fund-raising sites in the mold of GoFundMe or Kickstarter; there\u2019s an alternative to Patreon called Hatreon. Like most of these new alternatives, it has cynically borrowed a cause \u2014 it calls itself a site that \u2018\u2018stands for free speech absolutism\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that the more mainstream platforms borrowed first. Their persecution narrative, which is the most useful narrative they have, and one that will help spread their cause beyond the fringes, was written for them years ago by the same companies that helped give them a voice.John Herrman is a David Carr Fellow at The New York Times.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justin Gatlin Is an Athlete of His Time, Not a Villain", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySports of The TimesFans showered Gatlin with boos; British sportswriters waxed righteous about their pantomime villain (\u201cGatlin is a shameless fraud\u201d was one of the milder takes); and Sebastian Coe, president of track and field\u2019s international governing body, was beside himself for having to award a medal to Gatlin.\u201cI\u2019m not eulogistic at the thought of somebody who has served two bans in our sport walking off with one of the biggest prizes,\u201d Coe said.This narrative is fractured and self-righteous. Gatlin has sinned, but the outrage, particularly from those who know better, edges toward the absurd.This is inaccurate. His first offense was no offense at all.In the summer of 2001, after his freshman year at the University of Tennessee, Gatlin tested positive for a very small trace of amphetamine after running as an amateur in an event sponsored by USA Track & Field. Amphetamines are ingredients in Adderall, for which Gatlin has carried a prescription since he was 7 years old and learned he had an attention deficit disorder. He took Adderall while preparing for summer midterms three days before the race.His decision was consistent with N.C.A.A. rules and guidance given to professional athletes. Nonetheless, Coe\u2019s organization, the International Association of Athletics Federations, handed down a two-year ban. Gatlin appealed and got the suspension cut to a year. The grand executioners in the press corps might want to page to the decision\u2019s conclusion:\u201cMr. Gatlin neither cheated nor intended to cheat,\u201d the appeals panel wrote. \u201cHe is certainly not a doper.\u201dThat seems a suitably stiff sentence for a first offense.Let me now back off a step or three and interrogate my own righteousness.A month ago, I talked with the American high jumper Chaunt\u00e9 Lowe about the moment last November when she learned she had won a bronze medal in the 2008 Olympics. The international antidoping agency, taking advantage of technological advances, retested the blood of three jumpers (two Russians and a Ukrainian) who finished ahead of her at those Games. It disqualified all three. Lowe learned of this by Facebook and felt caught between elation and sorrow, aware of opportunities lost, not least that joyous moment atop a podium.A year ago, I sat atop a mountain outside Oslo and heard two top American biathletes, Susan Dunklee and Lowell Bailey, talk about the frustration of competing to their lung-straining best and suspecting that some of the athletes a few paces ahead of them might have a chemical advantage.These athletes work too hard to think we can just slap them on the back and murmur que ser\u00e1, ser\u00e1. They enjoy precious few years at their peak. Several of them told me they would like to see career suspensions for first doping offenses.The United States has cracked down hard. But Russia has taken on the mantle and gone far beyond, running a state-sponsored doping program with a thuggish insistence that gives its athletes and coaches little choice. This represents an existential threat to clean sport.I called Max Cobb, the president of U.S. Biathlon and an insistent reformer, and asked about the question of appropriate penalties for athletes like Gatlin. He is not by temperament the sort who favors blanket lifetime suspensions, and he sees considerable mitigating factors in Gatlin\u2019s case. He also sees a place for lifetime bans as a threat.\u201cIf you are engaged in systematic blood manipulation, you are deliberately trying to cheat the system,\u201d Cobb noted. \u201cIt cannot be an accident, and that\u2019s where the option of a lifetime ban would really help.\u201dTrack and field\u2019s reputation as irreparably tarnished by doping may be unfair and owe paradoxically to its growing ability to ferret out offenders. The doping era may have reached its body-distorting peak before the turn of this century, when athletes from many nations imbibed all sorts of steroids. Olympians break records with less regularity now; some women\u2019s records set in that period have stood for decades. Scientists speculate that cheating athletes now take smaller doses to avoid detection.As for Bolt and Gatlin, too many reporters and fans remain invested in fairy-tale dichotomies. Bolt is a glorious runner and a joyous showman for the ages, and he has passed every drug test without a glitch. So writers fit him for a crown as the king of clean sport.What, however, explains the urgency in fitting Gatlin for the crown of thorns? Gatlin is an athlete of his time and place. He finished third in the 100 meters at the 2012 London Olympics. Five of the eight men who ran that day have served doping bans. There were runners in London last weekend who had served doping suspensions and returned to competition.Track and field offers a complicated world.Coe\u2019s rhetoric is steely, and he has accomplished some good since becoming chief of the international federation. He was also forced to acknowledge in 2015 that Nike had paid him $150,000 annually to serve as a company \u201cambassador.\u201d French prosecutors are examining whether anyone bribed top international track officials to steer the 2021 world championships to Eugene, Ore.My intention here is not to throw up a cloud and allow Gatlin to slip untouched off the stage. His athletic history is a cross of his making. After a four-year absence, he returned overweight and slow, turning in embarrassing times in places like Finland.That moment likely has passed.The championship race in London was an old man\u2019s affair. Gatlin won with a 9.92. Had he run that time at the world championships in Beijing in 2015, he would have finished far behind Bolt. He is tested randomly by the United States Anti-Doping Agency; screeners checked his blood four times and his urine 10 times last year before the Olympics.He passed all of those.Age is the runner that will track Gatlin to earth. When I saw him in Oregon in May, he acknowledged mental fatigue and hamstrings and thighs that growl like old hounds.He is a personable man; he is flawed. There\u2019s no need to turn him into a hero. But the villain stuff plays like the cheap tricks adults use to distract from bigger problems.Email: powellm@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stranded on Norwegian Island, Rowers End Their Arctic Mission", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn international team of rowers ended a record-breaking expedition through the Arctic Ocean on Monday after becoming stranded on a remote Norwegian island partway through their month-and-a-half-long journey.They had set out to break several world records while using the mission to raise money for a school in the Himalayas. They achieved 11 of 12 expected world records, related to distance traveled and location in the Arctic, before having to call off their mission.Now, it could be at least another week before the crew of six adventurers, whose expedition was called the Polar Row, is evacuated from the island where they sought refuge on Aug. 19, according to social media posts from its members.The rowers \u2014 from Britain, Iceland, India, Norway and the United States \u2014 took to sea from the northern coast of Norway on July 20 and headed north to an island on the Svalbard archipelago. They then continued to the Arctic ice shelf \u2014 the first rowing crew recorded as making it that far north \u2014 before turning south toward Iceland.As conditions aboard the 30-foot boat deteriorated, the rowers abandoned their intended course and headed for Jan Mayen island instead. That small volcanic island is about halfway between Norway and Greenland.On Monday, nine days after reaching Jan Mayen, the crew officially ended its journey.Jan Mayen is not permanently inhabited, but is staffed by around 18 members of the Norwegian Armed Forces and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute who have a base there and welcomed the crew into their facilities.As crew members wait to be evacuated, they have been detailing their journey in social media posts.\u201cThe hospitality has been unbelievable \u2014 they\u2019ve saved our lives,\u201d Mr. Gregory said in a video posted to his Twitter account.The clip shows a desolate beach strewn with driftwood and whale bones.Private airplanes are not permitted to land on the island, so the rowers are waiting to see when they might be able to return home.The expedition\u2019s captain, Fiann Paul, initially tried to have a fresh crew brought to the island to continue the journey, he said in an email. Flight restrictions on Jan Mayen made that impossible, but Mr. Paul vowed to attempt the Arctic journey again.\u201cWe will row again,\u201d he said, \u201cmaybe an even bigger route than this one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Doubles Down on Threats Against North Korea as Nuclear Tensions Escalate", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 President Trump escalated his war of words with North Korea on Thursday by declaring that his provocative threat to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d might not have been harsh enough, as nuclear tensions between the two nations continued to crackle.Rejecting critics at home and abroad who condemned his earlier warning as reckless saber-rattling, Mr. Trump said North Korea and its volatile leader, Kim Jong-un, have pushed the United States and the rest of the world for too long.\u201cFrankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d he told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201dAsked if that was a dare, Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a dare. It\u2019s a statement. Has nothing to do with dare. That\u2019s a statement. He\u2019s not going to go around threatening Guam and he\u2019s not going to threaten the United States and he\u2019s not going to threaten Japan, and he\u2019s not going to threaten South Korea. No, that\u2019s not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program has recently accelerated faster than expected.Mr. Trump made his latest comments on North Korea during a pair of televised media events that covered a dizzying array of topics. He assailed Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, for not passing his legislative priorities, calling it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the party\u2019s health care plan failed by one vote and hinting that the leader should step down if he cannot do better. Mr. Trump also said he would declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency and defended his decision to bar transgender people from the armed forces, saying he was \u201cdoing the military a great favor.\u201dIn his first response to Russia\u2019s decision to force the United States to slash its diplomatic staff in half, the president said he would thank President Vladimir V. Putin for helping him trim payroll costs. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, whose house was raided last month by law enforcement agents as part of an investigation into Russia ties, calling him \u201ca very decent man.\u201d He said he was not considering firing Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.After nearly a week of his working vacation here, the president was in an expansive mood and seemingly eager to talk and take on all issues. While his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, held a sign in the back of the room saying \u201cone more question,\u201d Mr. Trump kept plowing ahead, taking one after another until he was satisfied.Joining him at the club were Vice President Mike Pence and several aides, including Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, who has been under fire from the alt-right media after purging his staff of several hard-liners thought to be close to Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist. Mr. Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had confidence in General McMaster.Democrats complained that the president was inflaming the confrontation and called for diplomacy instead. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s escalatory rhetoric is exactly the wrong response to dealing with North Korea\u2019s provocative behavior,\u201d said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s East Asia Subcommittee. \u201cIt unnecessarily heightens the risk of miscalculation and creates the very fog that can lead to war.\u201dMore than 60 House Democrats sent a letter on Thursday to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson asking him to restrain the president. \u201cThese statements are irresponsible and dangerous, and also senselessly provide a boon to domestic North Korean propaganda, which has long sought to portray the United States as a threat to their people,\u201d the letter said.Former President Jimmy Carter, who has visited North Korea three times as a private citizen, added his voice to the criticism. \u201cIn addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries, especially China and Russia,\u201d he said in a statement. He added that all parties must assure the North Koreans that they would forgo \u201cany military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.\u201dFor all the bellicose words, Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he was open to negotiations, as Mr. Tillerson has urged. But the president expressed skepticism that talks would lead to a reasonable outcome, given the experiences of his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, none of whom was able to resolve the issue through negotiations.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll always consider negotiations,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been negotiating now for 25 years. Look at Clinton. He folded on the negotiations. He was weak and ineffective. You look what happened with Bush, you look what happened with Obama. Obama, he didn\u2019t even want to talk about it. But I talk. It\u2019s about time. Somebody has to do it.\u201dMr. Trump likewise said he doubted that sanctions passed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council last weekend would ultimately succeed. But he again suggested that he would bargain with China by backing down from a planned trade war if Beijing did more to resolve the North Korea impasse.\u201cWe lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know how I feel. It\u2019s not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade.\u201dHe was vague about exactly where the line would be if North Korea did not back down, and refused to say whether he would consider a pre-emptive military strike without an attack by Pyongyang.Asked what would be \u201ctougher\u201d than \u201cfire and fury,\u201d he demurred. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see.\u201dStress within the administration over North Korea again spilled over and into public view on Thursday. Speaking with reporters en route to Seattle, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the president was entitled to use whatever language he thought appropriate. \u201cI was not elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people elected the president.\u201dBut asked about his own equally tough but less colorful statement about North Korea, issued on Wednesday, Mr. Mattis said, \u201cThe rhetoric is up to the president. This is my rhetoric.\u201dA White House aide, meanwhile, said no one should listen to Mr. Tillerson on military matters related to North Korea after the secretary of state said he saw no imminent likelihood of war and urged Americans to sleep soundly.That drew a sharp retort from Mr. Tillerson\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cHe\u2019s a cabinet secretary,\u201d Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s fourth in line to the presidency.

Any food trend that smelled like a fad was dismissed out of hand. Stern, serious and often unmovable, Ms. Jones approached cookbooks like works of literature that happened to contain recipes. Still, the books had to be practical.\u201cShe did not have that sort of abstract, fake literary-tone-poems-about-food thing. She was interested in a real sense of a real cook in the kitchen,\u201d said Rux Martin, the cookbook editor who once edited the master when they reworked the children\u2019s baking book \u201cKnead It, Punch It, Bake It!,\u201d which Ms. Jones wrote with her husband, Evan.\u201cI was terrified,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be?\u201dIt was a sentiment shared by many in her stable at Alfred A.

Needless to say, she took communion.\u201dMs. Jones discovered Ms. Cunningham when she was seeking someone to rework nearly 2,000 recipes from Fannie Merritt Farmer\u2019s 1890 cookbook, and turned to James Beard for advice. He sent Ms. Jones a stack of letters about food from Ms. Cunningham, a California homemaker who was working as his assistant. It started her career.Ms. Jones sent Ms. Reichl a note saying that she loved the book because she saw it as a bookend to the works of M.F.K. Fisher.

Ms. Reichl took her advice and went to another publisher. The book became a best-seller and ushered in the era of the modern food memoir.\u201cIt was just incredibly kind, because she knew what would be best for the book and she was realistic about it,\u201d said Ms. Reichl, who called Ms. Jones \u201cwonderfully indignant\u201d on matters of food.Advertisement"}

Friends inside the apartment then poured cold water on the scalded girl to try to alleviate the pain, according to the police.Police officers responding to a 911 call at 4:40 a.m. on Monday arrived at the apartment at 1064 Findlay Avenue to find Jamoneisha, who lives in a neighboring building, conscious, with burns on her face, neck, chest and back.She was taken to Harlem Hospital, where she remained in serious but stable condition, her mother, Ebony Merritt, said.Standing outside of the hospital after visiting her daughter on Thursday, Ms. Merritt was shaken by what had happened, and deeply angry.\u201cI just want justice for my daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cI want all that was involved to be brought to justice.\u201dIn postings online, Ms. Merritt said she thought her daughter was a victim of a social media stunt called the Hot Water Challenge. It is an apparent knockoff of the Ice Bucket Challenge, a viral video phenomenon that led thousands of people, including many celebrities, to record themselves having ice water dumped on their heads as part of an effort to raise money for research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.Ms. Merritt said her daughter and the other girl were friends who lived across the street from each other the past six years.

Officials at Bronx-Lebanon confirmed that the child had not been released.\u201cWhat she did was really wrong, but it\u2019s too much right now,\u201d Ms. Panton told The Daily News. \u201cMy daughter is 12.
