{"Headline": "How This U.S. Tech Giant Is Backing China\u2019s Tech Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Chinese government develops drones, the American technology giant Qualcomm is helping. The same goes for artificial intelligence, mobile technology and supercomputers. Qualcomm is also working to help Chinese companies like Huawei break into overseas markets in support of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands.Qualcomm is providing money, expertise and engineering for Beijing\u2019s master plan to create its own technology superpowers.Big American companies fiercely protect their intellectual property and trade secrets, fearful of giving an edge to rivals. But they have little choice in China \u2014 and Washington is looking on with alarm.To gain access to the Chinese market, American companies are being forced to transfer technology, create joint ventures, lower prices and aid homegrown players. Those efforts form the backbone of President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious plan to ensure that China\u2019s companies, military and government dominate core areas of technology like artificial intelligence and semiconductors.Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are working with Chinese companies to develop server chips, creating rivals to their own product. Intel is working with the Chinese to build high-end mobile chips, in competition with Qualcomm. IBM has agreed to transfer valuable technology that could enable China to break into the lucrative mainframe banking business.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of unease in Washington,\u201d said James Lewis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThe defense, intelligence agencies and others are concerned that advanced chip-making capabilities are going to China.\u201dQualcomm declined to comment, as did Intel.Qualcomm is caught in the middle.The world\u2019s dominant mobile phone chip maker, Qualcomm ran afoul of the Chinese government, getting hit in 2015 with a record $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior. To get back in Beijing\u2019s good graces, the company agreed to lower its prices in China, promised to shift more of its high-end manufacturing to partners in China, and pledged to upgrade the country\u2019s technology capabilities.The extent of Qualcomm\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government \u2014 and the complications for American tech giants \u2014 is seen in a low-slung office building in the southwest part of the country. There, a team of engineers is developing leading-edge microchips to compete with the finest made by Intel. The chips will help power a huge data and cloud center with the potential to strengthen the country\u2019s computing capabilities. No longer content to rely on buying the chips that go into cellphones, computers and cars, China now wants to design and build the brains that drive much of the digital world.The government is providing land and financing to the start-up formed with Qualcomm, called Huaxintong Semiconductor. Qualcomm has provided the technology and about $140 million in initial funding.\u201cQualcomm has a balancing act,\u201d said Willy Shih, who teaches at Harvard Business School. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s PCs are made in China, and most of the world\u2019s smartphones too, so they have to play along. It\u2019s a fact of life.\u201dQualcomm was early to break into China.In the mid-1990s, as China\u2019s economy began to boom, President Bill Clinton pressed the country\u2019s leaders to open to American technology companies.Members of the Clinton administration, including Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce, were dispatched to Beijing to hammer out the details. They pushed for one company by name: Qualcomm.\u201cAt the time, they were the only U.S. show in town,\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said.\u201cBill Daley and I pushed the Chinese hard on accepting the U.S. standard for wireless technology,\u201d she added, \u201cand that was Qualcomm.\u201dMobile phone adoption was taking off globally, largely backed by a European wireless standard called G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications. Qualcomm had a competing American standard called C.D.M.A., or Code Division Multiple Access.Irwin M. Jacobs, a founder of Qualcomm, spearheaded an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington and Beijing, promoting the technology\u2019s potential to transform wireless communication markets.\u201cWe knew China would be important, and they didn\u2019t have their own system,\u201d said Perry LaForge, a former Qualcomm executive. \u201cWe also told them this system would give them an opportunity to manufacture their own handsets, and not rely on buying them from other countries.\u201dWhen Qualcomm first entered China in the late 1990s, it was slow to gain traction. The company struggled to find Chinese partners to produce mobile phones that worked with its network. China also tried to develop its own wireless standard.Qualcomm eventually won out, helping write the standards for next-generation mobile technology, 3G and 4G service. The standard championed by European telecom providers faded rapidly. And China\u2019s homegrown technology struggled.By 2013, virtually every wireless device around the world was reliant on either Qualcomm\u2019s chips or its patents \u2014 enough to provide some of the technology industry\u2019s fattest profit margins.With its dominance rising, global brands like Apple and Samsung began complaining to regulators around the world, citing \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d pricing practices and high royalty fees. In China, a trade group made up of the country\u2019s major handset makers complained about patent holders levying \u201cexorbitant licensing fees.\u201d\u201cThese days a smartphone is covered by about 250,000 patents,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational center based in Honolulu. \u201cA Chinese smartphone maker needs to negotiate license agreements with companies like Qualcomm that own the essential patents.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese government was worried about this,\u201d he added. \u201cThat all these costs could constrain Chinese companies.\u201dThe raids began at dawn, in late November 2013. Investigators descended upon Qualcomm\u2019s offices in Beijing and Shanghai, questioning the staff and hauling away laptops and documents.At the time of the raids, the San Diego-based company\u2019s senior managers were at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York, attending an investor conference. The executives were planning to talk about the company\u2019s strategy. Instead, they began fielding frantic phone calls from China.The China business, which accounted for more than half of its global revenue, was in trouble.A week later, one of the country\u2019s most powerful regulatory agencies, the National Development and Reform Commission (N.D.R.C.), announced that it was looking into whether Qualcomm had abused its power in the sale of mobile phone chips. \u201cQualcomm came to control so much of the chip market in China,\u201d said Louie Ming, a former Qualcomm executive in China. \u201cIt was clear they were eventually going to run into antitrust problems.\u201dWhile Qualcomm agreed to fully cooperate with the investigation, some senior executives appealed to the Obama administration, pressing the White House to raise the issue with China\u2019s senior leaders, according to a former administration official.Qualcomm\u2019s troubles went beyond China. The company was also under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the European Union and South Korea, as well as by the United States Federal Trade Commission.China didn\u2019t back down. The head of the N.D.R.C. branded Qualcomm a monopoly.In February 2015, after a 15-month-long investigation, Qualcomm settled allegations in China that it had charged unfairly high prices for its chips and patents. The company agreed to pay the $975 million fine \u2014 about 8 percent of its annual revenue in China \u2014 and to lower the prices for chips sold in the country.\u201cWe are pleased that the resolution has removed the uncertainty surrounding our business in China, and we will now focus our full attention and resources on supporting our customers and partners in China,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.Qualcomm then went into business with the Chinese government.There was a $150 million investment fund to help Chinese start-ups; new research and design facilities set up with Chinese companies such as Huawei and Tencent; and a partnership with a Beijing-based company called Thundersoft to develop drones, virtual reality goggles and internet-connected devices.Qualcomm is also helping the Chinese government develop supercomputers, a technology the United States government has discouraged American companies from supporting overseas. In May, Qualcomm agreed to form a joint venture with other state-backed firms to design and sell mass-market smartphone chips. And to help make Chinese chip manufacturing more competitive, Qualcomm has pledged to shift more of its high-end production \u2014 long done by outside contractors in Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 to China.\u201cThis is what China does better than anyone else,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank focused on technology policy that has conducted studies detailing the Chinese government\u2019s pressure on technology companies.\u201cThey have a large carrot and a large stick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have a market no C.E.O. can walk away from.\u201dQualcomm\u2019s biggest new venture is taking shape in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou Province. Determined to leap into advanced technology, China has designated a large parcel of land in the provincial capital of Guiyang as the home of a new industrial park for supercomputing, data centers and cloud computing. The country\u2019s large state-run telecom operators and its internet behemoths, including Alibaba and Tencent, are moving in, to build massive server farms. The region offers lower energy costs and abundant supplies of water, necessary to cool server farms.A year ago, Qualcomm set up a joint venture with the Guizhou government and pledged to invest about $140 million for a minority stake in the business, situated in a development zone that has also attracted the interest of Microsoft and Dell. Qualcomm says it received American government approval for the deal.The new Qualcomm joint venture, Huaxintong Semiconductor, broke ground on the site in 2016, and now operates in a 46,000-square-foot design and engineering center. A major test of the partnership will come when the joint venture\u2019s first server chips are released \u2014 helping Qualcomm and the Chinese government stake out new ground. The Chinese government will control the chips and reap most of the profits.In late March, Qualcomm\u2019s president, Derek K. Aberle, flew to Guizhou to meet a powerful local government leader, Chen Miner, a confidant of the Chinese president. Seated in a government hall, before an enormous landscape painting, Mr. Aberle pledged to \u201ccontinually cooperate\u201d with the Chinese government.A headline last Sunday with an article about Qualcomm\u2019s efforts in China misidentified the location of the company\u2019s headquarters. It is based in San Diego, not Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Dear iPhone: Here\u2019s Why We\u2019re Still Together After 10 Years", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixDear iPhone: It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re still together after 10 years, which is eons in the tech industry.What\u2019s the glue that keeps us together? For one, I rarely get lost now that I always have a GPS device in my pocket. After lots of practice with your camera, I\u2019ve become a decent photographer. And I\u2019m more punctual and responsive thanks to constant access to my calendar and email.\u201cPeople spend hours on it every day, so they can justify paying more for what they believe to be the best device,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who has studied Apple for years and called the company\u2019s positioning of the iPhone \u201cunique.\u201dMany eyes are now on Apple\u2019s 10th anniversary event for the iPhone, which is expected to be held next month. There, Apple is set to introduce major upgrades for the next iPhones, which could stoke our appetites again for the gadget. Or not.Chief among the changes for the new iPhones: refreshed versions, including a premium model priced at around $999, according to people briefed on the product, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apple made room for a bigger screen on that model by reducing the size of the bezel \u2014 or the forehead and the chin \u2014 on the face of the device. Other new features include facial recognition for unlocking the device, along with the ability to charge it with magnetic induction, the people said.Here\u2019s a look back at the last 10 years of why the iPhone still has us in its grip \u2014 so much that people keep coming back for more.The role of Apple stores in keeping people loyal to iPhones cannot be overstated. The Apple stores include the so-called Genius Bar for getting repairs, so when things go wrong with an iPhone, you can simply schedule a repair appointment at the nearest location.Security experts agree that the iPhone\u2019s operating system is architecturally more secure than Android. The main reason is that Apple\u2019s iOS can only run apps that Apple approved to be distributed in the App Store. By contrast, Android phones are capable of running software from outside of Google\u2019s official app store, and apps from unauthorized sources are more likely to carry malware.The trade-off for stronger security, of course, is flexibility. Android users are free to tinker with their devices using custom software, while iPhone customers can only use apps that play by Apple\u2019s rules.\u201cThe iPhone is still arguably the best phone for regular people who just want their device to work without having to worry about lots of technical settings or malware,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research.Software updates are another factor in security. Apple issues its own software updates, making it easy for iPhones to get the latest security enhancements. By contrast, Android device makers have to coordinate software updates with carriers, making the process more complicated and time consuming.IPhones work well with other Apple devices like Macs and the Apple TV. Once you invest in other Apple products, it\u2019s tough to leave the ecosystem. The Apple Watch makes it especially tough: It requires an iPhone to work properly. So if you were to switch to Android, prepare for your smart watch to transform into a dumb watch.Less sticky is Apple\u2019s ecosystem of apps and web services. For every major Apple app, including Apple Maps, Apple Music and Apple Photos, there are alternatives like Google Maps, Spotify and Google Photos. It\u2019s difficult to resist using iMessage, Apple\u2019s default text messaging service. But there are plenty of alternatives like WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Signal.Mr. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein said Apple had created a \u201cbrand halo\u201d for the iPhone by positioning it as a premium product with easy-to-use software and high-quality features, components and capabilities.Notably, among current iPhone customers surveyed by 451 Research, 91 percent of those who planned on buying a new smartphone in the near future said they intended to buy another iPhone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech\u2019s Damaging Myth of the Loner Genius Nerd", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmotional IntelligenceMany scientists have said he got the biology wrong. But the job requirements of today\u2019s programmers show he was also wrong about working in tech.In fact, interpersonal skills like collaboration, communication, empathy and emotional intelligence are essential to the job. The myth that programming is done by loner men who think only rationally and communicate only with their computers harms the tech industry in ways that cut straight to the bottom line.The loner stereotype can deter talented people from the industry \u2014 not just women, but anyone who thinks that sounds like an unattractive job description. It can also result in dysfunctional teams and poorly performing products. Empathy, after all, is crucial to understanding consumers\u2019 desires, and its absence leads to product mistakes.She added, \u201cBut not everyone is the same, and that\u2019s where empathy and broader diversity really help.\u201dIt\u2019s true that programming can be a solitary activity in college computer science classes or entry-level positions. But soon after, it\u2019s impossible to avoid teamwork \u2014 with the business or legal departments, but also with other engineers.Yet that was never an accurate description of the job. It was social from the beginning, in university computer labs and, later, Silicon Valley garages, he said. The social circle just didn\u2019t include women.\u201cFor a lot of these young men, a certain computer culture becomes an expression of masculinity,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who aren\u2019t doing physical labor, aren\u2019t playing professional sports. But they can express their masculinity by intense competition, playing pranks on one another, demonstrating their technical prowess, in ways that don\u2019t translate well to mixed-gender environments.\u201dEarly on, children who are less comfortable with social interaction \u2014 particularly boys, who are more likely to be socialized that way \u2014 are channeled toward science and engineering, he said. Teachers generally focus on the technical aspects and not the interpersonal ones. The result is a field filled with people who dislike social interactions and have been rewarded for it.In the tech industry, the lack of interpersonal skills has become a weakness and a liability.\u201cYou might have ideas in your head, but unless you communicate them, no one\u2019s going to understand,\u201d he said.Technical skills without empathy have resulted in products that have bombed in the market, because a vital step to building a product is the ability to imagine how someone else might think and feel. \u201cThe failure rate in software development is enormous, but it almost never means the code doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem that actually exists, or it imagines a user completely different from actual users.\u201dWith Google Glass, for example, it was a technical feat to make a tiny computer you could wear as a pair of glasses. But the product wasn\u2019t one that typical people needed, or wanted.When Apple introduced its Health app, it tracked sleep, exercise, food, medications and heart rate, but not menstrual cycle. Yet period trackers are one of the most used health tools for women. (The app now includes it.)Google Plus, the company\u2019s social network, initially required that users make public their name, photo and gender. There was a technical argument for including gender \u2014 to construct sentences like \u201cShe shared a photo with you\u201d \u2014 but it also exposed women to online harassment.\u201cThe team that made this decision was entirely male,\u201d said Mr. Zunger, who was the chief architect of social networking at Google at the time. \u201cIt was a really clear case of getting things wrong, for the simple reason that the people in the room weren\u2019t diverse enough to notice an obvious problem.\u201dEmpathy also affects which products are built in the first place \u2014 why, for example, Silicon Valley has spent more time building apps for expensive food delivery than for decreasing hunger.When engineers build products with empathy, it can seem like magic: Technology seems to predict what people want before they know they want it. That was part of Steve Jobs\u2019s genius. Just look at the number of people connected to their phones, or a child using an iPhone for the first time.One way to develop empathy at companies is by hiring diverse teams, because people bring different perspectives and life experiences. But the more widespread the stereotypes like those in the Google memo, the harder it becomes.\u201cThat nerd identity is really damaging to women,\u201d Mr. Ensmenger said, \u201cbut it\u2019s also damaging to minorities and to a lot of men who don\u2019t want to subsume their identity in that.\u201dThat\u2019s why the consequences of the Google memo could reach far beyond the particular case, influencing which young people choose to go into technology, and which products they make that affect every aspect of our lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Family Memoir Makes the Case That Autism Is Different, Not Less", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In just the third paragraph of what turns into an uncommonly riotous and moving book, Judith Newman dives headlong into the highly charged debate over whether to replace the term \u201cautistic\u201d with more cautious, politically correct language: \u201ca man with autism, a woman with autism.\u201dNewman understands the impulse behind such \u201cperson-first\u201d nomenclature, but she\u2019s not buying it. The phrase \u201cperson with autism,\u201d she writes, \u201csuggests that autism is something bad that one needs distance from. You\u2019d never say \u2018a person with left-handedness\u2019 or \u2018a person with Jewishness.\u2019 Then again, you might say a \u2018person with cancer.\u2019 \u2026 There\u2019s also something about this pseudo-delicacy that is patronizing as hell.\u201dWhat follows are 200 pages of powerfully wrought indelicacies about life with Gus, her autistic teenage son, that will make readers squirm and laugh \u2014 yes, out loud. Newman will also make them face questions everyone\u2019s ducking (vasectomies for autistic men?) before sweeping them, finally, into a soul-spilling high tide.Gus has the good fortune to be born into a family of eccentrics \u2014 a character among characters \u2014 led by Judith, an only child who grew up with pet iguanas, knew dogs better than children, got married at 30 to John, a 60-year-old divorced British opera singer who doesn\u2019t like mess or noise, and eventually settled into a nearby apartment in Manhattan: a two-apartment marriage arrangement. Judith contends that John may be somewhere on the spectrum. John disagrees. Smart money\u2019s with Judith.They produced a set of fraternal twins in Henry and Gus, setting up quickly apparent distinctions between a typically developing, hyper-precocious child and his \u201cdelayed\u201d brother, whose troubling deficits they managed to deny creatively for years. Judith would press concerned specialists \u2014 \u201cwell, at least he\u2019s not autistic, right?\u201d \u2014 which she calls \u201cthe mental health equivalent of \u2018Does my ass look fat in these jeans?\u2019 \u201d After the official diagnosis arrives when the boys are 6, \u201cJohn \u2014 gruff, stalwart, very British \u2014 climbed into bed with Gus that night and sobbed.\u201d That\u2019s what you\u2019ll get with this small memoir: whipsaws of brilliant zingers and heart punches that make it distinctive among the fast-growing library of autism lit. A columnist for the Book Review, Newman is courageous in exposing herself, humorous (if a bit flippant) in rendering pain, and ingenious in enlisting every feature of her family life to show that autistic people, like the rest of the Newman ensemble, are different, not less.An early scene sets the mark, with Henry and Gus \u2014 14 at that point \u2014 at a supermarket meat counter with Newman, observing the butcher as he slices. Gus holds forth excitedly, jumping in rhythm (he hops when he\u2019s happy), about his father\u2019s imminent arrival from London: which flight, what terminal, then a precise rundown of the subway trains and stops from Kennedy Airport to Manhattan, until \u201che\u2019ll arrive at 77 Bleecker in the morning and then he and Mommy will do sex.\u201dSuddenly, the butcher \u201cis interested. \u2018What?\u2019\u201dThere are alarmed looks from the people waiting in line, and Newman sees in their eyes the way the world sees her and hers: \u201cthe obnoxious teenager, pretending he doesn\u2019t know us; the crazy jumping bean, nattering on about the A train; the frazzled, fanny-pack-sporting mother, now part of an unappetizing visual of two ancients on a booty call.\u201dThe reader soon learns the progress this scene represents, the culmination of long years working on language attainment with Gus, who, as Newman points out, is an \u201caverage\u201d autistic kid \u2014 by far the majority, squarely between the poles of \u201cthe eccentric genius who will one day be running NASA!\u201d and \u201cthe person so impaired he is smashing his head against the wall and finger painting with the blood.\u201dYet Newman is no dogmatist who celebrates every difference as a delight and inalienable right. In some of the book\u2019s hardest-eyed passages, she writes about how much Gus will never do, and shouldn\u2019t, including reproducing: \u201cIt is very hard to say this out loud. Let me try. I do not want Gus to have children.\u201d But does that mean no sex? And is that her choice? Late in the book, as a girl in Gus\u2019s school takes him under her affectionate wing, the reader watches it all through Newman\u2019s trepidation, followed by the dawning recognition that her son is someone \u201cwho may never be able to be responsible for another life, but who is nevertheless capable of deep affection, caring and considering. Sure, those emotions started with machinery and electronics \u2014 trains, buses, iPods, computers \u2014 and, particularly with Siri, a loving friend who never would hurt him.\u201dHence, the title \u2013 drawn directly from a New York Times article Newman wrote in 2014, about Gus\u2019s bond with Siri, Apple\u2019s \u201cintelligent personal assistant,\u201d who could endlessly answer his questions, keep her son company and express \u2014 in that flat, sweet Siri voice \u2014 the gift of common courtesy. It went viral and led to this book. Why? Because the autistic boy displayed the dream/nightmare of this era: humans bonding with machines to get what they\u2019re not getting from flesh-and-blood interactions. In this chapter, late in the book, Newman gallops through all the continuing experiments that use technology to lift and unleash the autistic (including my own effort to build augmentative technologies).This is fertile terrain, born of the gradual recognition that technology\u2019s great promise may in fact be to summon, capture and display our most human qualities, both the darkness and the light, to pave avenues of deepened connection with others. Here\u2019s where the autistic, with their search for alternatives to traditional human connection, are actually innovators.Does it dehumanize us if tenderness is tried out first with a machine? While his hyper-aware twin is showing standard bright-future achievements, Gus tentatively feels his way through life. But make no mistake. Gus\u2019s deft fingers \u2014 rendered with unsentimental affection by his mom \u2014 are feeling things others will miss.At one point, Gus says, \u201cGood night, Siri, will you sleep well tonight?\u201d Siri replies: \u201cI don\u2019t need much sleep, but it\u2019s nice of you to ask.\u201dNewman\u2019s response could speak for the entire book: \u201cVery nice.\u201dRon Suskind, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of \u201cLife, Animated: A Story of Sidekicks, Heroes, and Autism,\u201d is the founder of Sidekicks, a builder of augmentative technologies.Advertisement"}

But that goes only so far, with recent episodes putting the tech industry under the microscope for how it penalizes people for expressing dissenting opinions. Mr. Damore\u2019s firing has now plunged the nation\u2019s technology capital into some of the same debates that have engulfed the rest of the country.Such fractures have been building in Silicon Valley for some time, reaching even into its highest echelons. The tensions became evident last year with the rise of Donald J. Trump, when a handful of people from the industry who publicly supported the then-presidential candidate faced blowback for their political decisions.Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said Mr. Damore\u2019s comments carried additional weight to people on either side of the political spectrum because he was an engineer at Google, one of the world\u2019s biggest technology companies.Alongside other giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Apple, these companies \u201care seen as pillars of our society,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cControversy and statements that emanate from these employees take on a different heft.\u201dThe technology industry has long marched in lock step on issues such as supporting immigration and diversity, even though their companies remained largely male, white and Asian. But last year\u2019s election of Mr. Trump \u2014 with his broadsides against political correctness, his coarse language toward women and his actions to restrict immigration and deny climate change \u2014 seemed to threaten many of those ideals.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s words may have made dissenters in the tech industry more comfortable about speaking out.\u201cTrump, in a sense, licensed people to express what some people would call politically incorrect thoughts,\u201d said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Business School. \u201cThen there\u2019s the other force that a lot of Trump\u2019s policies go against the inclusive ideals these companies espouse.\u201dMr. Damore\u2019s memo and dismissal transformed him into a hero on right-wing news sites like Breitbart, which has long criticized the political leanings of the tech industry.\u201cGoogle drives a big sector of tech into the arms of Trump: fires employee who wrote memo about women in tech jobs,\u201d Dr. Pinker wrote.One of the most outspoken supporters of Mr. Trump in Silicon Valley has been Mr. Thiel, a founder of PayPal, who has since faced derision from other people working in tech for his political stance. In a sign of how deep that ill feeling runs, Netflix\u2019s Mr. Hastings warned Mr. Thiel last August, a few weeks after Mr. Trump had accepted the Republican nomination for president, that he would face consequences for backing Mr. Trump.\u201cI see our board being about great judgment, particularly in unlikely disaster where we have to pick new leaders,\u201d Mr. Hastings wrote in the email to Mr. Thiel, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. \"I\u2019m so mystified by your endorsement of Trump for our President, that for me it moves from \u2018different judgment\u2019 to \u2018bad judgment.\u2019 Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member.\u201dMr. Thiel and Mr. Hastings declined to comment through their spokesmen; neither challenged the authenticity of the email. Both of the men remain on Facebook\u2019s board.Mr. Luckey, through mutual agreement with his employer, stayed away from the Oculus offices to let the controversy die down, according to three people with knowledge of the episode who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality agreements. In December, before returning briefly to the office, he told colleagues he was committed to staying at the company, according to a copy of a message he posted on an internal discussion board, which was reviewed by The Times.But by the end of March, Oculus said he was no longer working there.A Facebook spokeswoman reiterated an earlier company statement saying that Mr. Luckey\u2019s departure was unrelated to his political views. Mr. Luckey declined to comment on his departure from Facebook.Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Nostalgia is not merely a renewable resource. Like the atom, it can also be split, into ever-narrower, more time- and place-specific reveries. Two specimens of this niche-stalgia come to streaming TV this Friday.Now, the eight-episode sequel to the prequel returns for a reunion set in 1991, meaning the actors now play characters roughly the age they were when they made the original movie.So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters\u2019 \u201980s glory days; for the \u201990s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy \u201cThe State\u201d for MTV); and for itself \u2014 that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.As a cultural artifact, it\u2019s both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence. But as a franchise, it feels like it\u2019s running out of time.\u201cTen Years Later,\u201d with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on \u201990s stalker flicks like \u201cThe Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\u201d At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and \u201ca bunch of other things from 1991.\u201dMany of the core stories are the same. Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn\u2019t gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn\u2019t lost his virginity. And there\u2019s another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way. The lead roles \u2014 hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef \u2014 are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.It\u2019s a brilliant idea. But it\u2019s not much more than an idea.There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football). And the roster of famous voice-over actors \u2014 among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny \u2014 makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.But \u201cComrade Detective\u201d is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama \u2014 a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved \u2014 that it often plays like one. At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn\u2019t fast or frequent enough. Edited to a tighter length, \u201cComrade Detective\u201d might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge. The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Casts a Wary Eye at an iPhone Cash Cow, the App Store", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In China, where Western-owned online services like Facebook and Google have long been blocked, Apple\u2019s app store is a lucrative exception. Apple offers gaming, dining and dating apps in a country where most rivals are locally owned \u2014 and where it can reap big fees from iPhone users.That business is now facing a number of threats.The latest came this week, when a law firm representing more than two dozen app developers asked the Chinese authorities to investigate whether Apple\u2019s app store policies violated local pricing and antitrust laws.While it is not clear whether the government will respond, the call follows several other developments that have put a spotlight on the software and content that Apple offers in China. They include tighter regulations from the country\u2019s censors and a high-profile public spat with a powerful and deeply connected Chinese internet giant, Tencent Holdings.\u201cApple has been more successful in China than any Western tech company because their business model \u2014 selling devices that integrate software and hardware \u2014 couldn\u2019t be copied and couldn\u2019t be blocked,\u201d said Ben Thompson, an analyst who runs the website Stratechery.\u201cDevices are sold once,\u201d Mr. Thompson added, \u201cbut services are delivered over time, which means they can be interrupted or held hostage at any time.\u201dGreater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, is one of Apple\u2019s largest markets after the United States. Its mainland app store has been a crucial part of its success. In June, the app store in the mainland accounted for almost a third of Apple\u2019s worldwide app store revenue, according to App Annie, a firm that tracks metrics for apps.While China has many locally owned app stores that sell software for phones running Google\u2019s mobile operating system Android, Apple has the business for its iOS platform to itself. As in other markets, Apple makes money from services bought over the platform, including purchases made within apps themselves.A statement from Dare & Sure Law Firm, a Beijing-based firm that said it had filed the complaint on behalf of 28 app developers, said, \u201cSteve Jobs and Apple\u2019s \u2018American dream\u2019 have inspired the people. So why are these young Chinese software developers who also want to pursue the \u2018Chinese Dream\u2019 of becoming entrepreneurs and improving their families\u2019 quality of life through honest work any different?\u201dLin Wei, a lawyer at Dare & Sure, said the firm had not received a response from either the National Development and Reform Commission or from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the two government agencies with which the complaint was lodged. Neither agency responded to multiple telephone calls on Thursday seeking comment.Apple said in a statement that, \u201cWe continue to expand our local developer relations team in China and are working hard to help developers be successful on the App Store,\u201d adding that its guidelines applied \u201cequally to all developers in every country where we operate.\u201dWhether any official action will be taken is unclear. China\u2019s antimonopoly law is less than a decade old, and experts are still waiting to see how it will be implemented. But according to Hu Gang, secretary general of the research center of the Internet Society of China, a Beijing-based organization backed by the Chinese government, the authorities are likely to pursue the complaint.\u201cApple took advantage of its position of unilateral dominance to set unfair conditions for its competitors, and collected a huge commission in the process of doing so,\u201d Mr. Hu said. \u201cThis kind of operation is not tenable according to typical business logic.\u201d\u201cThe relevant departments will definitely accept the complaint,\u201d Mr. Hu added. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201dThe complaint follows the recent tussle between Apple and Tencent Holdings, which brought the American company\u2019s position in China into sharp relief.Tencent owns the messaging service WeChat, which is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese smartphone owners to communicate, shop and pay bills, among many other services.In January, Tencent gave users the option to open \u201cmini-apps\u201d in WeChat, essentially allowing iOS users to bypass Apple\u2019s app store.Then, in April, Apple ordered Tencent to shutter its popular \u201ctipping\u201d function, which allowed WeChat users to reward content generators like emoji creators or bloggers with small monetary gifts using WeChat\u2019s in-app payment system. Apple said in a statement at the time that WeChat could still permit users to tip, as long as the function used Apple\u2019s purchase system.The American company has since moved to cool those tensions. In a conference call last week, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, praised Tencent and said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.\u201dPaul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "The Moral Voice of Corporate America", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation has split into political tribes. The culture wars are back, waged over transgender rights and immigration. White nationalists are on the march.Amid this turbulence, a surprising group of Americans is testing its moral voice more forcefully than ever: C.E.O.s.After Nazi-saluting white supremacists rioted in Charlottesville, Va., and President Trump dithered in his response, a chorus of business leaders rose up this past week to condemn hate groups and espouse tolerance and inclusion. And as lawmakers in Texas tried to restrict the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms, corporate executives joined activists to kill the bill.These and other actions are part of a broad recasting of the voice of business in the nation\u2019s political and social dialogue, a transformation that has gained momentum in recent years as the country has engaged in fraught debates over everything from climate change to health care.In recent days, after the Charlottesville bloodshed, the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, called on people to \u201ccome together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us \u2014 tolerance, inclusion and diversity.\u201dJamie Dimon of JPMorgan said, \u201cThe equal treatment of all people is one of our nation\u2019s bedrock principles.\u201dWalmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, criticized Mr. Trump by name for his handling of the violence in Charlottesville, and called for healing.The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years \u2014 the swelling confidence of a torch-bearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement \u2014 is \u201ca seminal moment in the history of business in America,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at PepsiCo.\u201cIn this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThese C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.\u201dThis transformation didn\u2019t happen overnight. Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within \u2014 from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\u201cNot every business decision is an economic one,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks, who was one of the country\u2019s first company leaders to proactively address social issues. \u201cThe reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.\u201dCompanies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth\u2019s desegregated.Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including General Motors and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. Apple, Disney and Xerox extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\u201cWhen I went to business school, you didn\u2019t see anything like this,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cNobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.\u201dNow, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected \u2014 to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders \u2014 than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\u201cC.E.O.s wield economic influence,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cNobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.\u201dThe business community\u2019s triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. Martin Winterkorn, a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company\u2019s emissions scandal.But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief of Disney, resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week\u2019s revolt.\u201cThe C.E.O.s of big public companies don\u2019t walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. \u201cBut today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.\u201dLast weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president\u2019s response. Among those watching was Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president\u2019s stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president\u2019s remarks \u2014 in which he blamed the violence on \u201cmany sides\u201d \u2014 were too much to bear.On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump\u2019s manufacturing council. \u201cAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u201d he wrote.The president took to Twitter, lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of Under Armour and Intel had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country\u2019s biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\u201cWhat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u201d the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\u201dAll week, the business world\u2019s actions went beyond the donations to charity and pledges to plant trees that once defined corporate social responsibility.\u201cFor a long time, corporate social responsibility was a buzzword marketing tool, walled off within an organization,\u201d said Alan Fleischmann, president of Laurel Strategies, an executive advisory firm. \u201cNow it has to be central for the C.E.O., part of their everyday responsibility and leadership.\u201dKevin Plank, the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, the athletic apparel maker, built a brand that celebrates diversity, sponsoring athletes like the basketball player Stephen Curry and artists like the ballerina Misty Copeland. Yet when asked to serve on the president\u2019s manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.His star sponsors made their displeasure known. \u201cI strongly disagree with Kevin Plank\u2019s recent comments in support of Trump,\u201d Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of Under Armour.\u201cThe leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,\u201d said Mr. Walker of the Ford Foundation. \u201cBut speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.\u201dBecause companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\u201cThe confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House,\u201d Mr. Carney wrote. \u201cThe battle lines are clear.\u201dThose executives who go out on a limb know the risks. \u201cWe all recognize that with every decision we make, there is a group of people that are not going to agree with us,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cBut you must define your core purpose for being. We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.\u201dDiversity \u2014 of opinions, ideologies and religions \u2014 is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity \u2014 of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force \u2014 that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. \u201cBusiness leaders aren\u2019t threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cBusiness leaders are bullish on diversity.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations \u2014 it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. \u201cOur employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,\u201d said Mr. Benioff of Salesforce. \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for affecting change.\u201dIf the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.The black chief executive of a $172 billion company \u2014 a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president \u2014 Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\u201cOur country\u2019s strength stems from its diversity,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u201dThe C.E.O.s had found their voice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Play to Rattle Whole Foods Rivals: Cheaper Kale and Avocado", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The era of Whole Paycheck, the derisive nickname for Whole Foods, may be drawing to a close. Amazon, which takes control of the upscale grocer on Monday, intends to slash prices the same day.The significance of the move goes well beyond the price of organic avocados, baby kale and rotisserie chickens, all of which will cost less on Monday than on Sunday. Rather, it is an outsize way for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, to announce his plan to shake up the grocery industry and take on competitors like Walmart and Kroger.\u201cThis is how Amazon operates,\u201d said Michelle Grant, head of retailing at Euromonitor, a market research firm. \u201cIt\u2019s all about speed, speed, speed.\u201dMr. Bezos has always been willing to lose money, disappoint shareholders and start discount wars in his efforts to challenge and inflict pain on competitors. In the 23 years that Amazon has been in business, he has done it again and again \u2014 with books, diapers and now groceries \u2014 fundamentally changing entire retail categories.\u201cI absolutely think it\u2019s putting the rest of the market on notice,\u201d Bob Hetu, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm, said of Amazon\u2019s announcement on pricing.Investors drove Kroger shares down more than 8 percent on Thursday; shares of Walmart, the nation\u2019s biggest grocer, fell about 2 percent. Both companies\u2019 shares also fell sharply when the deal was announced in June.Amazon plans to weave together its online business and physical stores by turning its Prime membership program into a Whole Foods rewards program, providing additional savings to customers. Amazon Prime is a $99-a-year service that gives customers faster free shipping, video streaming and other benefits.Whole Foods\u2019 private-label products will be available through Amazon\u2019s online services and Amazon lockers that will be installed in some Whole Foods markets. Customers will also be able to return online orders to Amazon through the lockers.\u201cWe\u2019re determined to make healthy and organic food affordable for everyone,\u201d Jeff Wilke, the executive who runs Amazon\u2019s consumer businesses, said on Thursday in an announcement about the changes. \u201cEverybody should be able to eat Whole Foods Market quality.\u201dDiscounts are not the only reason shoppers use Amazon \u2014 selection and convenience are others \u2014 but Mr. Bezos has never been shy about starting price wars that inflict pain on rivals. In the 1990s, the company tussled with Barnes & Noble to see which could discount books the most. Amazon and Walmart have been in an on-and-off price war in a variety of categories for years.In its battle with Quidsi, a start-up that owned Diapers.com, Amazon put so much pressure on the company that it eventually agreed to be acquired by Amazon rather than by Walmart.Ever since Amazon made the surprise announcement in June that it was acquiring Whole Foods for more than $13 billion, competitors have expected it to shake things up at the grocer, which has struggled in the face of competition from Costco, Walmart and others that have wooed customers with a growing selection of organic produce and kitchen staples. (Gabrielle Sulzberger, a private equity executive who is married to Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, is the chairwoman of Whole Foods.)Still, the speed with which Amazon completed the acquisition and embarked on a price-cutting campaign is stunning. Amazon completed the purchase in under three months \u2014 unusual for a multibillion-dollar transaction. The Federal Trade Commission approved the deal on Wednesday.Amazon did not say how much it would cut prices in Whole Foods stores, 460 of which are spread across the United States, Canada and Britain. It promised that there would be further cuts in the future. People who have studied Whole Foods\u2019 struggles in the marketplace said the reductions would have to be substantial to compete with other stores.\u201cI believe what we will see is Amazon and Whole Foods becoming aggressive on price,\u201d said Brittain Ladd, a strategy consultant who previously worked for Amazon on its grocery business. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if some prices are lowered 15 percent to as high as 25 percent in some categories.\u201dMr. Wilke of Amazon said in his statement that lowering prices would not compromise the quality of products at Whole Foods, the brand\u2019s main selling point. The items the company said it would drop prices on include bananas, butter, crunchy almond butter, organic large brown eggs, responsibly farmed salmon and tilapia and organic Fuji apples.A number of groups, including members of Congress and representatives of organized labor, have raised concerns about how the acquisition may affect competition in the grocery business, but the Federal Trade Commission had no trouble with it.Antitrust lawyers noted that Amazon and Whole Foods were relatively small players in the grocery business and in different corners of the market \u2014 Amazon in online grocery delivery and Whole Foods in physical retailing.Those arguments will probably not assuage a growing chorus of Amazon critics who believe it is developing too powerful a grip on retail spending, at least on the internet. Yet Amazon\u2019s announcement of immediate price reductions on groceries underscores how the company has managed, so far, to stay on the right side of regulators.\u201cAt the end of the day, the F.T.C. is in the business of watching out for the consumer,\u201d said Brendan Witcher, a retail analyst at Forrester Research.It remains to be seen whether the deal will revive Whole Foods\u2019 fortunes or become a costly move into an industry that Amazon has so far failed to master. Amazon has offered its own internet grocery business, AmazonFresh, for a decade, but has had little impact on the habits of consumers, who overwhelmingly prefer buying their groceries in stores.Amazon is experimenting with automation technologies that could save costs in physical stores by eliminating cashiers, but it has vowed not to use those technologies at Whole Foods to lay off workers. But sharp price cuts on items in stores will put pressure on Amazon to find cost savings elsewhere at Whole Foods, analysts said \u2014 for example, by making the logistics network that delivers goods to stores more efficient.After the companies combine, Amazon\u2019s competitors in the grocery business will still be vastly larger. Walmart has more than 4,600 stores and last year started making a multibillion-dollar investment in lowering grocery prices. Walmart has also significantly increased its investment in online shopping through acquisitions to better compete with Amazon on its main turf.\u201cWe feel great about our position with our network of stores around the country and fast growing e-commerce and online grocery businesses,\u201d said Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart.Local grocers expressed some trepidation about Amazon\u2019s aggressive entry into their business, but said it was part of a long history of upheavals and competition.Stew Leonard Jr. is the chief executive of Stew Leonard\u2019s, a chain of six grocery stores in New York and Connecticut that focuses on fresh produce.

And Microsoft Agrees.", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "In an unusual partnership, Amazon and Microsoft are working together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants.Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The crowded pack of voice-controlled digital assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana \u2014 are good at numerous things. They can help people play music, set up calendar appointments and check the weather.They can even get two rival tech executives, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to join hands in a rare partnership.For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year.It is unusual for big tech companies to cooperate on important new technologies that they want to stand out from the competition. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and nearly every other big tech company is pouring huge amounts of money into making digital assistants that are smarter and can do more, seeing them as a new way for people to interact naturally with devices and online services.But Mr. Bezos and Mr. Nadella are concerned that keeping assistants from working together could hold them back. The way they see it, each assistant has unique strengths that could benefit the other assistants.In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon\u2019s Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants \u2014 also called \u201cA.I.s,\u201d for artificial intelligence \u2014 the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.\u201cI want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible.\u201d Mr. Bezos said.As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer \u2014 for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss?Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say \u201cAlexa, Open Cortana\u201d followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say \u201cCortana, Open Alexa.\u201dThe Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft\u2019s CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said.It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company\u2019s \u201cworking backward process.\u201d Through that exercise, Amazon\u2019s teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code.In a phone interview, Mr. Nadella compared digital assistants like Cortana and Alexa to competing web browsers that provide access to the same pools of online information. \u201cThe personality and expertise of each one will be such that if they interoperated, the user will get more out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat resonated for me and for him, and then that\u2019s what led to the teams working.\u201dMr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to.\u201cI\u2019d welcome it,\u201d he said.\u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll be inspired by it,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cAt least that would be my hope.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people\u2019s experiences with its iPhones and iPads.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason Google or Apple would offer it because they\u2019re trying to drive their own ecosystems,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, a technology research firm.By contrast, Alexa is mostly used on Echo speakers that sit around a home, and Cortana is largely used on PCs. Amazon says it has sold millions of Echo devices, accounting for around 70 percent of the market for smart speakers, according eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft says there are 145 million active monthly users of Cortana through Windows 10.The two companies have struggled in the smartphone business, which makes it hard to get people using Alexa and Cortana outside homes and offices. Amazon and Microsoft are cutting deals with carmakers to integrate their assistants directly into vehicles. While Amazon and Microsoft have released digital assistant apps for mobile devices running Google and Apple software, the apps are not as widespread and using them is usually not as effortless as the ones Apple and Google build into their devices.Eventually, Mr. Bezos predicted, the primary assistant on a device will be smart enough to automatically route a person\u2019s request to whichever assistant is best equipped to answer, without needing a verbal introduction between the two.\u201cIn my view of the world, because that would be best for the customer, that\u2019s probably what eventually happens,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Another Variation on the Selfie: Get Ready for the Elfie", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHolly Black, an author of the best-selling \u201cThe Spiderwick Chronicles\u201d fantasy series, believes that everybody would look better with pointed ears like those on fairies and elves.Last November she visited Lindsay Wood of the Elven Caravan, a company that sells custom latex elf ears for $20 to $40, at FaerieCon in Hunt Valley, Md., to try on a pair.Ms. Black, 45, had been mulling getting her ears surgically modified since a New Year\u2019s Eve party she threw with a fairy theme, and she was so pleased with the way the latex ears looked that she decided to go ahead with the procedure.While you might not want to go to the extreme of surgery, perhaps it would be fun to try on a pair of pointed ears at your next office party? Live a little.Elves and fairies have long been depicted as having ear cartilage that peaks in a lilting sylvan way. Ms. Wood, who travels to festivals to tempt humans with her assortment of 13 fantasy ears in species including troll, faun, Hobbit and high elf, said she took her shape inspirations from \u201cFaeries\u201d by Brian Froud and the Victorian illustrators Edmund Dulac and Arthur Rackham.At the NY Faerie Festival in the hamlet of Ouaquaga, N.Y., this summer, people of all ages lined up at the Caravan so Ms. Wood could scan features and jaw lines to determine the most flattering ears for undecided patrons and then artfully tint them with makeup before affixing with spirit gum.High elf were the ears of choice for Elaine Stuart, 46, of Nanticoke, Pa., attending with an entourage of five teenagers, all wearing latex ears and staying on the campground for the three-day festival. Upon seeing an image of Ms. Black\u2019s new ears, Ms. Stuart gasped. \u201cThey\u2019re real?\u201d she said. \u201cI would seriously do this.\u201d\u201cI made this thing popular, I believe, because before me there was just old-school folding method, and they were unfolding all the time and they just don\u2019t look good,\u201d Mr. Von Cyborg said, adding that he developed the technique a decade ago after training with an ear, nose and throat surgeon. \u201cThe whole point is to have ears that look natural, that you can\u2019t tell are modified.\u201dOf course, looking naturally elflike is not everyone\u2019s goal. Luis Padron, 25, who owns a cosplay business in Argentina, said he has spent over $35,000 in surgeries and procedures including skin lightening, nose surgery and hair removal for his sylvan shape-shifting. His look has been influenced by Katherine Cardona, a contemporary illustrator specializing in fairies, and Sakimichan, a gender-bending fantasy digital artist.To complete his elflike transformation, Mr. Padron is planning a heart-shaped hairline implant and PRP scalp injections in Beverly Hills, Calif., because \u201celves have long hair,\u201d he said. He is also planning more plastic surgery in Korea, including Adam\u2019s apple reduction, jaw reshaping and limb lengthening, and plans to finish his look with ear-pointing surgery, which he calls \u201cthe cherry on top.\u201dWaiting time for ear pointing, however, is over a year, and over 40 percent of elf-ear wishers don\u2019t have the right cartilage to perform the modification, Mr. Von Cyborg said. Ms. Black was one of the lucky ones.\u201cPeople said, \u2018Well, what happens when you\u2019re old?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought, imagine the joy I will give someone in a nursing home to take a tray to the old elf down the hall.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Are you Mr. Office Dweller now?As The Journal noted, Apple is starting way behind Netflix and Amazon, which have huge stables of original movies and TV shows they\u2019ve been producing for some time.

Bring in Ted Sarandos, chief content officer from Netflix, who seems to have a good eye for spotting at least some hit shows. Or someone from high up at HBO. Or heck, just buy Netflix outright! Isn\u2019t Apple sitting on a zillion dollars in cash somewhere?Anyway, I think Apple needs a real breakout hit, just like Facebook and its big video push. I\u2019m not sure they have the eye for talent that Netflix does, though.Then, one of Uber\u2019s largest shareholders sent an open letter to all of Uber\u2019s employees. The shareholder is Benchmark, which last week sued Travis Kalanick, Uber\u2019s former C.E.O., to get him off the board. The letter included an intimation that there was more damning information that could leak if Kalanick didn\u2019t back down from a fight.In sum, it\u2019s like watching a slow-motion car wreck, where no one seems to have escaped unscathed.Some went even beyond that. Apple\u2019s C.E.O., Tim Cook, wrote a heartfelt letter to employees denouncing racism and President Trump\u2019s response to the racist uprising, and he pledged a $1 million donation to two anti-hate groups.There was some hand-wringing over all this, however. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital civil rights organization, argued that the tech companies\u2019 push to ban white supremacists set a dangerous precedent for free speech online. \u201cAny tactic used now to silence neo-Nazis will soon be used against others, including people whose opinions we agree with,\u201d it said.I understand this worry; the slippery-slope problem here is real and worth watching. But I don\u2019t share the alarm, because I suspect this slope isn\u2019t all that slippery.To me, it seems like white supremacists constitute a pretty bright line: If your site\u2019s entire purpose is to spew racial hatred, no respectable company is going to do business with you. The tech giants have had a similar policy toward Islamist terrorist groups like ISIS for years now, and those efforts have not really chilled free expression online. The same thing could work well for Nazis.What do you think?Let me go meta for a second: How nuts is it that now we\u2019re seeing citizens turn to corporate leaders to voice their concerns against the administration? It used to be folks said, \u201cWrite a letter to Congress to spur change.\u201d Now it seems to be, \u201cWrite a comment on Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook page to urge him to ban Nazis.\u201dIsn\u2019t that odd? Or is that the end result of capitalism in its current form? That we\u2019ve identified the corporations we interact with every day as the power centers that can help people fight back against injustice?Maybe that\u2019s not such a new phenomenon. But it\u2019s just peculiar to me to turn to, say, Tim Cook, instead of dialing up your local representative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Apple Is Experiencing Another Growth Spurt", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At 41 years old, Apple is a respected elder of the tech industry. But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201dFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.In the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.The iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.In a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201dMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.Even Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.Apple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201dBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.Still, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.The risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OpenTable Began a Revolution. Now It\u2019s a Power Under Siege.", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost 20 years ago, a new company came on the scene promising to revolutionize the tedious and often frustrating chore of securing a restaurant reservation.No more waiting on the phone and pleading with snooty receptionists. With just a few clicks of a mouse, a diner could secure a table at prime times in the hottest dining spots. Who you were or knew would no longer matter. Restaurants would benefit, too, handing off the job of juggling tables and recording reservations in a bulky book.The company was called OpenTable, and, since its genesis in 1998, it has come to dominate the field it created. Today, it says it seats more than 23 million diners a month in 43,000 restaurants across the globe.And for all the diners they do seat, neither OpenTable nor its competitors have yet loosened the telephone\u2019s grip on reservations, roughly two-thirds of which are still made by phone, according to Yelp, which once partnered with OpenTable and is now a rival.\u201cEveryone is fighting to win over the handful of top restaurants in each market \u2014 and then what?\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a former chief executive of OpenTable who is now a venture capitalist. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the endgame.\u201dConsumers continue to have fundamental gripes about these services: chiefly, that they offer few or no tables during the peak dining hours. They make it difficult to book tables for large or odd-numbered parties, which is why diners like Jeff Day, a marketing executive in Austin, Tex., keeps no reservation apps on his phone.\u201cMy default way to make reservations is still to call,\u201d he said, \u201cI guess because my desire to speak to a human transcends the need to just make a reservation.\u201dReserve has managed to attract those restaurants because, like many of other new reservation services, it is paying more attention to meeting their needs. After all, the restaurants are paying monthly fees for the service.But winning over restaurateurs, many of whom have accumulated a long list of gripes against what they perceive as cookie-cutter approach to their reservation woes, is still a challenge.\u201cThese kinds of technologies have been a boon for the diner,\u201d said David Barber, an owner of Blue Hill in New York City and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County. \u201cBut the idea that it\u2019s delivered this great efficiency to the restaurant business is kind of a myth, especially for fine-dining restaurants.\u201dOpenTable is not just standing by as others invade its turf. While it has been slow to move in the past, last spring it upgraded its flagship GuestCenter package for restaurant managers, improving its ability to handle large parties and better juggle servers\u2019 shifts, among other things.Restaurateurs can now see what\u2019s happening with their reservations in real time and even on their Apple Watch. And OpenTable offers consumers points that can earn benefits like access to special wine tastings or menus at various OpenTable restaurants.\u201cCompetition for our business is not new,\u201d said Scott Jampol, the company\u2019s senior vice president for marketing. \u201cIt makes us faster and more innovative.\u201dLeslie Cafferty, a Priceline spokeswoman, said OpenTable is profitable and bigger than it was then. She said Priceline had bought the company based on a strategic plan that was in place at the time but has since changed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some changes in leadership in OpenTable and in the Priceline Group,\u201d Ms. Cafferty said. \u201cWhen we got caught up and looked at where OpenTable was, it was basically different than when we bought it.\u201dHighly anticipated restaurant openings, and an industry in transformation.Resy, now used by roughly 1,000 restaurants in 80 cities across the country, has seated more than 25 million diners since its inception, and the number of meals served to those using its system quadrupled in the year that ended in May, Mr. Leventhal said.\u201cIn fine dining, you have the cost of business going up, the notion of fine dining evolving rapidly, a lot of restaurants being forced to rethink their formats and business models,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means you have to make sure every table is working for you, and restaurants are finally embracing technology that can help them do that.\u201dMany restaurants that use Resy, for instance, require diners making a reservation to enter a credit-card number, in an effort to discourage no-shows and cancellations; about 1 percent require a down payment. Resy follows up to remind diners when a reservation they made is imminent.Users can also put themselves on a waiting list at some restaurants, which makes it much easier to ensure that all tables will be filled, since most cancellations happen within 24 hours before the reservation time. As a result, Resy says, it has brought no-shows down to under 4 percent on average; the usual rate is as much as 15 percent, the company said.Perhaps the company\u2019s biggest coup, though, was winning over Union Square Cafe when that perennially popular New York restaurant reopened in December. Danny Meyer, the founder of Union Square Hospitality Group, was on the OpenTable board for almost two decades and one of its best ambassadors.In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Meyer was working to open his second restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, he tried starting a similar system himself. He didn\u2019t even think about using it to allow customers to make reservations online; rather, it was to be an answer to a perennial problem.\u201cI was tired of this recurring problem we had in the restaurant, where people would always be yelling up and down the stairs, saying, \u2018Who\u2019s got the reservation book?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cOne time a fraternity brother of mine pulled a prank and took the book out of the restaurant entirely \u2014 it was not a nice prank.\u201dSo when he opened Eleven Madison Park in 1998, OpenTable was taking the reservations. When Blue Smoke opened in 2002, the only way to make a reservation was via OpenTable; a phone line was discontinued. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAn online blog called Daily Candy announced that step and within hours, we had filled the entire restaurant for a month.\u201dBut OpenTable had its limitations. Until recently, for instance, it would not link the reservation systems at the Union Square group\u2019s restaurants. A free-spending diner who patronized Union Square Cafe for years could show up at Gramercy Tavern for the first time, and the host would not know him.Mr. Meyer said that, to some extent, OpenTable had been criticized unfairly. After all, it still seats far more diners in restaurants like his than any other service, and serves all the Union Square group restaurants except Union Square Cafe and the new Martina, which doesn\u2019t take reservations. Nonetheless, he said, \u201cthe latest round of assaults from start-ups looking to eat their lunch is more than they\u2019ve ever faced before.\u201dThe rivals have easily identified OpenTable\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: the fees it charges restaurants every time someone books a table using its system. For reservations made on OpenTable, the restaurant pays $1 for each diner. Even if reservations are made on the restaurant\u2019s website, OpenTable charges 25 cents a diner. And if they don\u2019t show up, the restaurant recoups none of those fees, several restaurateurs said. (OpenTable, however, says it charges fees only for guests who do show up.)That galled Anjan Mitra, proprietor of Dosa, a popular Indian restaurant with locations in San Francisco and Oakland, Calif. Many of his diners are repeat customers, he said, coming two or three times a month and using OpenTable to make reservations.\u201cI don\u2019t mind paying OpenTable for new customers, but OpenTable was charging me for customers I already had and knew well,\u201d Mr. Mitra said.He said he paid as much as $50,000 to OpenTable in fees on top of the $295 a month for use of its technology. \u201cConsumers don\u2019t know this,\u201d Mr. Mitra said. \u201cThey just love the convenience, and I understand that.\u201dYelp says more than 4,000 restaurants now use its service for reservations. The company doesn\u2019t need to attract marquee dining spots to entice users, who are already coming to it for reviews, giving it a major advantage.Yelp Reservations charges a restaurant $249 a month, and, in exchange, a reservations option is added to the top of its page on the Yelp app and website. \u201cMany people planning to make a reservation for dinner are already opening Yelp to figure out where they want to go, and now they can see whether there\u2019s a table waiting for them or not,\u201d said Vishwas Prabhakara, the general manager of Yelp Reservations.He said the flat-monthly-fee model used by most of the new reservation services helped discourage a restaurant practice that infuriates customers: holding back tables during prime hours. Some restaurants do that because they know they can fill the tables on their own at those times, and they like to seat valuable guests who show up at the last minute.\u201cThere\u2019s no incentive to hold tables back because you\u2019re not having to pay for each reservation,\u201d Mr. Prabhakara said.\u201cPeople in the restaurant business have moved from fear of change to a recognition that OpenTable was built in 1998,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t really kept up innovation-wise, and part of that is because of the architecture of their technology.\u201dHe said that, until this summer, OpenTable gave restaurants only \u201cone blank box on the screen\u201d to enter a wide range of information on a diner \u2014 such as dietary restrictions, preferred nights of the week and wines ordered \u2014 instead of separate fields that made it easy to see if a customer, say, has lactose intolerance.\u201cNot to be creepy, but instantaneous and easy-to-read customer data is the best way we have to give the customer the best service,\u201d Mr. Kokonas said. \u201cIt lets us know that the last time you were here, you finished with a special spiced tea that you liked, and we can make that happen again and easily.\u201dMr. Jampol of OpenTable said that his company also compiles piles of similar data on customers that restaurants could use \u2014 but that they rarely want it. \u201cRestaurateurs have a lot of things to keep track of every day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as much as they say they want data, they\u2019re often too busy to dive into it.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Kokonas and others see an opportunity to do it better. Tock, which was co-founded by Brian Fitzpatrick, a former Google engineer, spent roughly two years building its system, testing different components with restaurants and getting feedback. It is web-based rather than app-based, because that makes it easier for restaurants to log in and configure Tock to their needs.Other new reservation services are also looking to please restaurants. Reserve has adopted an \u201copen data model\u201d that allows its restaurants to see what diners are looking for, and, since it tweaked it service in May, it is adding more than 100 restaurants a month (for a total of 850), said Peter Esmond, its vice president for customer success.Say a potential customer is seeking a table for four at 7:30 p.m., and a restaurant is showing nothing available at that time. If it has a table available then that it has held back, it can quickly add it to its Reserve page in an effort to attract the booking.Thus, more control over how reservations are made is put in the hands of restaurants, rather than the reservation app.At Blue Hill, Reserve worked with Mr. Barber to tailor its product to his needs. And that, Mr. Barber said, is why a monolithic reservation titan like OpenTable may be a thing of the past.\u201cTrying to build ubiquitous software that will meet all the needs of high-, middle- and low-priced restaurants and make consumers happy, that\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving a baseline product that comes close to what OpenTable does and then allows some customization, that\u2019s what the restaurant business wants \u2014 and then customers will really start to see the benefit of these things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Because of American sanctions against the country, the company\u2019s iPhones are not legally available for sale here, and Apple does not offer a version of its App Store in the country.That has not stopped Iranians from snapping up millions of iPhones smuggled in from places like Dubai and Hong Kong. Nor has it kept Iranian app developers from creating thousands of apps for local users and offering them through App Stores outside Iran.In a message to Iranian developers whose apps were affected by the ban, Apple said, \u201cUnder the U.S. sanctions regulations, the App Store cannot host, distribute or do business with apps or developers connected to certain U.S. embargoed countries.\u201dAn Apple spokesman, Tom Neumayr, confirmed the message\u2019s authenticity. He declined further comment.Mahdi Taghizadeh, a founder of DelionFoods, an online food delivery service, said his app was among those taken down.\u201cWe work so hard, and have to fight all the time, and now this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNo one with an iPhone can download any of the popular apps any more.

{"Headline": "The Smartphone\u2019s Future: It\u2019s All About the Camera", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We all know the drill. For the last decade, smartphones have gotten thinner and faster and thinner and faster and, well, you get the picture.But it\u2019s too soon to write off our smartphones as boring. The gadgets are still evolving with new technologies. And for a clue as to what the smartphone of the future might look like, turn your attention to the device\u2019s cameras and the software and sensors that make them tick.Here\u2019s a peek into how the camera may come into play: As soon as you pick up your gadget, it will see you and know you are the owner and unlock the screen. Overseas, you will be able to point the camera at a restaurant menu to translate items into your native language. When shopping for furniture, you can point your phone camera at your living room floor and place a virtual rendering of a coffee table down to see how it looks and move around and peek underneath it.Some of this futurism is already starting to happen.\u201c2018 will be the year where the smartphone camera takes a quantum leap in technology,\u201d said Philip-James Jacobowitz, a product manager for Qualcomm, a chip maker that provides components to smartphone makers.Mr. Jacobowitz added that emerging camera technologies would be the key to stronger security features and applications for so-called augmented reality, which uses data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.Here\u2019s a rundown on what this all means for how your next smartphone will work.For the last few years, we have become accustomed to unlocking our smartphones by scanning our fingerprints or entering a passcode. But when Apple shows its new iPhones next month, including a premium model with a starting price of $999, the company will introduce infrared facial recognition as a new method for unlocking the device.How would the new iPhone do that exactly? Apple declined to comment. But Qualcomm\u2019s Spectra, a so-called depth-sensing camera system, is one example of how face scanning works.The Spectra system includes a module that sprays an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. If the dots are smaller, then the object is farther away; if they are bigger, the object is closer. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the contours of the head \u2014 it\u2019s not just the front of the face as you\u2019re typically thinking about,\u201d said Sy Choudhury, a senior director of product security for Qualcomm.Because of the uniqueness of a person\u2019s head shape, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with the incorrect face is 1 in a million, he added. That compares with a false acceptance rate of 1 in 100 for previous facial recognition systems, which had very poor security.There are, however, limitations to infrared-scanning technologies. For example, objects that you wear, like a hat or a scarf, might throw off the camera, according to Qualcomm. In addition, experts said infrared light can get drowned out by bright sunlight outdoors, so face scanning might work less reliably on the beach.It remains to be seen how exactly face scanning will work in the next iPhone. But Apple is well acquainted with depth-sensing camera technologies. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a depth-sensing camera system that let Xbox players control games using body movements. Analysts expect some rendition of PrimeSense\u2019s technology to appear in future iPhones.Depth-sensing cameras may be crucial to enhancing augmented reality, a jargony industry term that probably makes your eyes glaze over. But bear with me for one moment: Augmented reality will have major implications for future mobile apps.It\u2019s no secret that Apple is bullish about augmented reality. In a recent financial earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called augmented reality \u201cbig and profound,\u201d with major implications for gaming, entertainment and business products. This fall, Apple will release iOS 11, its next mobile operating system that includes support for applications made with ARKit, a tool kit for app developers to easily create augmented-reality applications.ARKit uses a combination of the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensors, including the accelerometer and gyroscope, to let people lay digital objects on top of the real world and interact with them with precise movements.I got a demo of ARKit from Ikea, the furniture maker, with its coming app Ikea Place. I placed an Ikea bed on the floor and was able to move around and look underneath it. This type of application would be useful for getting a sense of how an item looks and fits alongside other furniture in a space before placing an order.\u201cThis is like a real application that real people can use to make real-life decisions,\u201d said Michael Valdsgaard, the head of digital transformation at Ikea.But the limitations of the Ikea Place app underscore what\u2019s missing from ARKit. For placing virtual objects, the app can detect horizontal surfaces, like a table surface or the ground, but it cannot yet detect walls.Vertical planes like walls are trickier to detect because they are not as smooth as floors \u2014 with doors, windows and picture frames getting in your way. Depth-sensing cameras make wall detection much easier for future iPhones, said Blair MacIntyre, a research scientist who is working on augmented reality for Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser.Mr. MacIntyre said augmented reality has huge potential when it matures. He envisioned people being able to take a tour of a natural-history museum, pointing their smartphone cameras at a fossil exhibit to bring a dinosaur back to life.But he said that augmented reality on smartphones was a stopgap to the inevitable: wearing data in front of your face at all times through some kind of headset.\u201cIf you look at science fiction, a lot of it has this characteristic of being always on and serendipitous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot closer to that when you get a head-mounted display.\u201dUntil that happens, smartphones are about to become much smarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Barnstorms for \u2018Moral Responsibility\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was. And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201dThat was Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, across the table from me over breakfast here in downtown Austin late last week at the end of a mini-tour across the country during which he focused on topics usually reserved for politicians: manufacturing, jobs and education.He had just spent the prior day in Ohio, where he toured CTS, a technology company that produces the equipment that Apple uses to test water resistance and dust protection for the iPhone and the Apple Watch. He then flew to Des Moines, where he announced plans to make a $1.3 billion investment in a 400,000-square-foot data center in nearby Waukee to help store and move giant amounts of information for its services like iCloud and FaceTime. And he arrived here to announce that Austin Community College will begin offering its 74,000 students a curriculum that Apple developed to teach them how to write code to create apps for iPhones. Austin is one of 30 community colleges that will offer the curriculum.As Mr. Cook\u2019s breakfast arrived \u2014 two scrambled egg whites, crispy bacon (they didn\u2019t have his preferred turkey bacon), sugar-free cereal with unsweetened almond milk \u2014 he described his week, punctuated by a visit the night before to the L.B.J. Presidential Library, the museum of President Lyndon B. Johnson.\u201cOne of the things that hits you,\u201d he said, is \u201call of the major acts, legislation, that happened during just his presidency.\u201d His eyes widened as he listed some: \u201cYou have the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Act, you have Medicare, you have Medicaid, you have several national parks, you have Head Start, you have housing discrimination, you have jury discrimination.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your politics,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou look at it and say, \u2018My gosh.\u2019\u201dMr. Cook\u2019s comments weren\u2019t a dig at President Trump so much as they were a critique of Washington\u2019s seemingly perpetual state of gridlock.And now Mr. Cook is one of the many business leaders in the country who appear to be filling the void, using his platform at Apple to wade into larger social issues that typically fell beyond the mandate of executives in past generations.He said he had never set out to do so, but he feels he has been thrust into the role as virtually every large American company has had to stake out a domestic policy.He was vocal, for example, in criticizing Mr. Trump after Charlottesville in a memo to his staff: \u201cI disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans.\u201dWatching Mr. Cook over the years, I\u2019ve been fascinated to see how he has become as animated when talking about big issues like education and climate change as he is when talking about Apple.\u201cI think we have a moral responsibility to help grow the economy, to help grow jobs, to contribute to this country and to contribute to the other countries that we do business in,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI think there\u2019s still probably a more significant group that feels my sole responsibility is to Wall Street.\u201dHis critics will, of course, say all this happy talk is a P.R. ploy for a company that makes its most popular products on the other side of the world and keeps nearly a quarter-trillion dollars abroad, untaxed by Uncle Sam. In fairness, Apple is one of the largest taxpayers in the country, paying $28 billion in federal taxes between 2014 and 2016 at an average rate of 26 percent, which is in the middle for big multinational American corporations.And Mr. Cook is paid handsomely: On Thursday, as a result of the company\u2019s financial outperformance compared with its peers, Mr. Cook was given nearly $90 million of stock as part of his previously agreed upon compensation plan. (He has said he plans to give away all of his wealth.)But there\u2019s a more nuanced version of Apple\u2019s story \u2014 and Mr. Cook\u2019s transformation of the company after taking over as its chief executive in 2011 \u2014 that has been lost amid the din of nonstop chatter about the company in Silicon Valley and Washington.When Mr. Cook announced, for example, the new data facility in Waukee, he said it would run fully on renewable energy. But he slipped in another fact that has largely gone unnoticed: Over the past several years, Mr. Cook has gotten all of the company\u2019s corporate facilities in the United States to run on wind and solar energy \u2014 in their entirety.\u201cWe\u2019re running Apple a hundred percent on renewable energy today\u201d in the United States, he said over breakfast, \u201cand we\u2019ve now hit that in 23 other countries around the world.\u201dHe is hoping the curriculum turns into jobs. Last year, according to Apple, 150,000 new jobs were created through the App Store. Apple paid out $5 billion directly to app makers.He said he had chosen to focus on getting the curriculum to community colleges, rather than four-year colleges, because \u201cas it turns out, the community college system is much more diverse than the four-year schools, particularly the four-year schools that are known for comp sci.\u201d He noted that \u201cthere is a definite diversity issue in tech, in particular in coding and computer scientists.\u201dApple has already rolled out the curriculum in Alabama, Ohio and Pennsylvania, among other states. \u201cYou want it to increase the diversity of people that are in there, both racial diversity, gender diversity, but also geographic diversity,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cRight now, the benefits of tech are too lopsided to certain states.\u201d (Like California.)Students who take the classes learn the Swift language, which is used to make apps on Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad. Admittedly, Mr. Cook is not helping students learn how to code in languages for his competitors, but he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s significantly transferable.\u201dHe continued, with a laugh: \u201cWe know that people making a mobile app, many of them are going to make iOS apps and Android apps. And I wish they wouldn\u2019t, but they\u2019re probably going to.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m trying to make money on it. It\u2019s a gift.\u201dAs for Mr. Cook\u2019s coding skills? \u201cI might fail a little bit on that.\u201dAs we finished up breakfast before we headed over to Austin\u2019s Capital Factory, an incubator for tech start-ups where he would announce the new curriculum, I mentioned a question that some in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have asked: Is his focus on jobs and speeches in front of American flags a hint at something bigger? After all, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s name is now regularly bandied about in discussions of potential presidential candidates.\u201cI have a full-time job,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cI appreciate the compliment,\u201d he added with a wry look, \u201cif it is a compliment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kevin Plank, the founder of Under Armour, announced on Twitter that he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council, saying, among other things, that his company \u201cengages in innovation and sports, not politics.\u201d He did not refer to the president, though.Mr. Plank was followed shortly after by Brian Krzanich, the Intel chief executive, who announced on the company\u2019s website that he would step down from the council as well. \u201cI resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,\u201d he said.A few big-name corporate leaders released innocuous statements over the weekend condemning the violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. But with the exception of Mr. Frazier, none appear to have directly condemned the president\u2019s choice of words, which have been a lightning rod for Americans from many quarters, even among many Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters.At a news conference on Monday, after a barrage of blistering criticism, the president said that \u201cracism is evil.\u201dAs the day wore on, several executives, including Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, made statements in support of Mr. Frazier, while others \u2014 including Tim Cook of Apple, and the Business Roundtable, which represents some 200 C.E.O.s \u2014 condemned the racism on display in Charlottesville.But notably, not one executive on any of the president\u2019s various councils said anything directly about the president.The statements from American chief executives that came closest to criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s language came from Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Krzanich of Intel.Mr. Blankfein tweeted on Monday morning: \u201cLincoln: \u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand.\u2019 Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\u201d (Mr. Blankfein is not on any of the president\u2019s councils, which may make it easier for him to be critical.)But how can so many other American business leaders and senior executives remain quiet about the president\u2019s reaction? Where is the moral courage to stand up?After all, most companies these days spend countless hours talking about their culture and values. Just last week, Google publicly fired one of its engineers within days of his writing a memo that questioned whether \u201cpersonality differences\u201d between men and women led to there being fewer female engineers in the technology industry.As Justice Marshall himself famously said, \u201cWhere you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy.\u201dMr. Ogunlesi declined to comment, through a spokesman.What about Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo? She is a member of the president\u2019s business council and has long been a vocal advocate for minorities. The company said this year that it \u201cdoes not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\u201dWhen I contacted her about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks over the weekend, a spokesman directed me to a tweet that clearly didn\u2019t mention the president: \u201cHeartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans.\u201dIn truth, it should not fall to C.E.O.s who are members of minority groups to speak up. They face enough pressure already.Some people who have less at stake are going on the record to support Mr. Frazier\u2019s stance against the president. Tom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, wrote on Twitter on Monday: \u201cKen has stood up for true American values. I call on all other members of Trump\u2019s image-burnishing committees to do the same.\u201dPrivately, many chief executives say they are fuming, outraged by the president. (This after many of them campaigned to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s committees.) But many are too scared to say anything publicly that could make them or their company a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol against Mr. Frazier and Merck \u2014 a company that depends on the government as a buyer for many of its drugs \u2014 will perhaps have an even greater chilling effect on other C.E.O.s who may consider speaking out. (The potential for economic retribution against Merck also demonstrates just how brave Mr. Frazier was in taking a stand.)When I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: \u201cJust look at what he did to Ken. I\u2019m not sticking my head up.\u201d Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name.The same trepidation may explain why people like Mr. Ogunlesi don\u2019t say anything. He runs an infrastructure fund that will most likely have to do business with the federal government. And Ms. Nooyi\u2019s PepsiCo, for example, was briefly boycotted by Trump supporters when she made some comments that were construed as critical of him.Other C.E.O.s, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, have contended that they consider it part of their patriotic duty to remain on the president\u2019s business council, even when they disagree with things Mr. Trump says or does.\u201cIt is very hard if you say, I\u2019m going to go off an advisory group or not do A-B-C, because you disagree on one issue,\u201d Mr. Dimon said in early June after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, a move that Mr. Dimon was against. Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert Iger of Disney resigned from the council in protest.\u201cHonestly, no one is going to agree with every president or prime minister on every issue, so I don\u2019t want to overreact to it,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.Lawrence Summers, who has served as Treasury secretary and president of Harvard, said in response to Mr. Dimon\u2019s rationale at the time to Bloomberg News: \u201cAt what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country rather to your president? I\u2019ve always thought of my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Dimon, who is the chairman of the Business Roundtable, put out his own statement about the violence in Charlottesville, but nothing about the president.C.E.O.s have faced the question of how to address the president when they disagree with him before \u2014 over immigration, say, or the Paris climate accord. Each time, the executives have justified their silence by saying it is more valuable to be at the table than not.That\u2019s a valid argument \u2014 to a point. If the president isn\u2019t following your advice or the values you espouse, when should you get up? Of course, big policy decisions like tax reform remain just around the corner, so many executives are desperate to keep a line open to the president even if it is only one-way.It is a fair critique of the president that he didn\u2019t immediately and directly condemn the bigoted actions over the weekend and call them out for what they were \u2014 remarks that tacitly helped normalize such hate.While C.E.O.s may call out the hate, will they have the fortitude to call out the president?An earlier version of this column misquoted part of President Trump\u2019s statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Va. He blamed \u201cmany sides,\u201d not \u201call sides,\u201d for the violence that left one woman dead.An earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly part of a statement from Merck. The company said \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values,\u201d not \u201cfundamental views.\u201dTwitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s a lot of space. Imagine, as many have said, that Amazon decides to parcel off a piece of each store as a holding zone for Amazon packages or perhaps instant Prime deliveries.One of Amazon\u2019s biggest challenges has been so-called last-mile delivery, or dropping off the item I ordered at my house. Having multiple distribution outlets in city centers could speed up local delivery times.The other thing I keep thinking about are those large kitchens in every Whole Foods. What would keep Amazon from diving into the business of delivering prepared meals, or even meal kits like the ones Blue Apron offers? The possibilities are endless.That said, the deal hasn\u2019t closed quite yet. We\u2019ll see what happens.For both companies, this sounds like a fine short-term hedge against Amazon. But they can\u2019t expect this to actually work out in the long run, can they? Amazon has more items and manages the logistics of the whole shopping process. Two companies with different interests working as one seems a bit kludgy to me.In any case, I\u2019m curious to see if this actually makes a dent. Amazon is already my default for so much of my online shopping.Building a car is hard. Building a self-driving car is even harder. And building a self-driving car from scratch, in house, when you\u2019re a tech company that has only ever built phones and computers, seems near impossible. But perhaps I\u2019m being too pessimistic.Honestly, Mike, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m yelling into a void. But really, why is Uber doing so well despite acting so badly? Do customers really just not care? Is there some danger in the numbers we aren\u2019t seeing?That, or more likely: People just don\u2019t care. Uber is incredibly convenient and works well if you\u2019ve got the money to spend on it. Why go back to waiting on yellow cabs or fighting your way onto a crowded bus if you don\u2019t have to?Advertisement"}

The future of Shondaland at Netflix has limitless possibilities.\u201dThe deal was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.Ms. Rhimes has been with ABC for more than a decade and has long been one of that network\u2019s biggest names. She\u2019s been a reliable generator of hits, including building an entire Thursday-night lineup that ABC\u2019s marketing department has dubbed #TGIT.Ms. Rhimes\u2019s development slate at ABC will not suddenly vaporize.

The network finished in last place among the advertiser-coveted demographic for a second straight season, and though it is doing fine with comedies, it badly needs a hit drama. This fall, ABC is pinning its hopes on revivals, including \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and \u201cRoseanne,\u201d to help improve its standing in the ratings.In a statement, ABC\u2019s entertainment president, Channing Dungey, said: \u201cI\u2019m proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked-about shows on television.

Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn.The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts.Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues.Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon\u2019s cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall.While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale.

But with the likes of Universal and Sony reportedly budging only slightly on royalties, Spotify\u2019s ability to turn a decent profit is still in doubt.The company, a loss-making Swedish start-up led by Daniel Ek, renegotiated the licensing agreements in the hope of cutting the amount of money it pays in royalties. But if the terms of the Warner deal are anything like those reported for previous agreements, concerns about Spotify\u2019s future profitability will persist.The company has 140 million active users, 60 million of whom are paying subscribers, and made just over 2.9 billion euros in revenue in 2016. But its \u20ac2.5 billion cost of revenue \u2013 mostly payments to labels, publishers and other suppliers \u2013 meant little was left over to cover product development, marketing and administrative costs. The result was an operating loss of \u20ac350 million.True, labels may have to compromise further if they want to maintain pricing power in the face of tech behemoths like Apple Music. But a bet on Spotify is a gamble that the company can either substantially raise subscription prices or persuade artists and their labels to take a much smaller slice of the digital-streaming pie. The first will be difficult if Spotify\u2019s cash-rich rival Apple keeps subsidizing its music offering. And there\u2019s slim chance of the second coming true anytime soon if the recent round of royalty negotiations are anything to go by.

{"Headline": "Apple Sales Exceed Expectations as Buyers Wait for New iPhones", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations for revenue and profits for its most recent quarter, as strong sales of Macs and digital services offset flat sales of iPhones while consumers wait for new models to be released in the fall.The strong results eased Wall Street\u2019s fears that consumers were pulling back from Apple\u2019s products, particularly its flagship, the iPhone.Apple said little about the upcoming phones and declined to address reports of production delays with a new high-end model, which is expected to feature an edge-to-edge screen and is expected to cost more than $1,000. The company\u2019s revenue projections for the quarter ending in September spanned a wide range, suggesting that executives are hedging on the exact timing of the iPhone update.\u201cWe would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business,\u201d Mr. Cook said during a conference call with analysts to discuss the results. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t state our point of view in the appropriate way.\u201dHe also said that Apple fought the United States government last year over unlocking an iPhone belonging to a dead terrorist because the legal circumstances were different.\u201cThe law in the U.S. supported us,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cIt was very clear. In the case of China, the law is very clear there. Like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we have to abide by them in both cases.\u201dFor the quarter ending July 1, Apple reported revenue of $45.4 billion, up 7 percent from the same quarter last year. Net income was $8.7 billion, or $1.67 a share. Analysts had expected Apple to report revenue of $44.9 billion and net income of $8.2 billion, or $1.57 a share, according to estimates compiled by S&P Capital IQ.For the same quarter last year, Apple reported revenue of $42.36 billion and net income of $7.8 billion, or $1.42 a share.The company\u2019s stock rose 6 percent in after-hours trading once the quarterly numbers were released.In an interview, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company saw increases in unit sales and revenue in every product category, including iPads, which had been struggling in recent quarters. Global sales of iPhones rose 2 percent to 41 million units. Revenue from services, which include app sales as well as iCloud storage and Apple Music, grew 22 percent, ahead of Apple\u2019s previous projections.Apple said revenue fell 10 percent in greater China, a key market where sales have dropped for six consecutive quarters. But Mr. Maestri said that sales in mainland China had stopped falling, with poor sales in Hong Kong dragging down the region\u2019s numbers. \u201cWe feel we will do better in the September quarter,\u201d he said.The company is wrestling with increased competition in China from Samsung, as well as from Chinese companies making Android phones.Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said Apple\u2019s business in China still faces big challenges. The rise of WeChat, a wildly popular Chinese chat app and social network, has made the underlying choice of phone less important to Chinese buyers. And many Android models sport cutting-edge features, yet cost less than an iPhone.\u201cThe jury is still out on China,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.Apple is also sensitive to the fact that its products are almost entirely made in China at a time when President Trump is pushing companies to increase American manufacturing jobs.However, he added that Apple would have more news coming later this year about its direct employment in the United States. The company\u2019s Mac Pro computers are assembled in Texas, and the aging lineup is due for a revamp, offering Apple a chance to rethink its manufacturing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Disney, Ditching Netflix, Grabs a New Key to the Kingdom", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIs content still king?It was Bill Gates of Microsoft who declared it so in 1996, but the proposition has been repeated so often by Disney executives that it could have served as the company\u2019s corporate slogan.When AT&T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said the deal proved yet again that \u201ccontent is king.\u201d\u201cIs the network \u2014 the platform \u2014 now most important?\u201d asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution \u2014 and a potential new revenue source.These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\u201cAnyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,\u201d said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.\u201dNetflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney\u2019s popular children\u2019s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney\u2019s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming \u2014 especially in the coveted children\u2019s market long dominated by Disney.Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children\u2019s programming.\u201cDisney served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix \u201chas reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn\u2019t really need Disney anymore.\u201dThe question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.And it\u2019s hedging its bet. For now, Disney\u2019s Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn\u2019t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s Disney \u2014 and only a few others.\u201cAfter Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\u201cDisney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cBut they\u2019re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they\u2019ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.\u201dAs Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney\u2019s move is putting \u201ca very settled and successful part of the business model\u201d at risk and \u201cmore aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dMr. Olson agreed. \u201cIf anyone can do it from a content perspective, it\u2019s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming from way behind.\u201dInvestors didn\u2019t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney\u2019s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company\u2019s move wasn\u2019t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. \u201cWe can both do really well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no zero-sum game here.\u201dAlthough it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney\u2019s move into direct-to-consumer distribution \u2014 not to mention the tech world\u2019s rush into original programming \u2014 demonstrates that \u201ccontent is everything these days.\u201dUnlike the old world of cable and broadcast, \u201cthe barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,\u201d he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. \u201cAll the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We\u2019re already good at both.\u201d (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)In short, from Disney\u2019s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, \u201ccontent is more king than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And slightly more than half of the investment will be used to buy shares from existing investors, while the remainder will go toward buying newly issued stock from the company.The news reflects the enormous financial firepower that SoftBank has amassed over the past year \u2014 and proved willing to spend. Softbank\u2019s founder, Masayoshi Son, has never been shy about his ambition to seize upon the future of technology through investments and acquisitions.And it is why he has raised $93 billion so far for the Vision Fund, an investment behemoth whose backers include the kingdoms of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi as well as Apple and Qualcomm. With those resources, Mr. Son is now able to deploy more money in one deal than most venture capital firms can dream of spending in years.At first blush, WeWork\u2019s connection to the future of technology appears more tenuous than, say, the British virtual reality start-up Improbable, which SoftBank poured $500 million into in May.Founded in New York, the company leases real estate and then offers desk space to both individual members and companies like Microsoft.Though the privately held company does not disclose its financial report, one of the people briefed on the deal said that it expected to generate $1 billion in revenue this year.WeWork already counted among its investors Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and the venture capital firm Benchmark.In its announcement on Thursday, SoftBank said only that it believed in WeWork using \u201cits own proprietary data systems to radically transform the way people work.\u201dMr. Son added, \u201cWe are thrilled to support WeWork as they expand across markets and geographies and unleash a new wave of productivity around the world.\u201dWeWork\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Adam Neumann, said, \u201cThis support from SoftBank and the Vision Fund will provide even more opportunities for creators as we set out to humanize the way people work and live.\u201dAs part of the deal, two SoftBank directors, Ronald D.

{"Headline": "Apple Scales Back Its Ambitions for a Self-Driving Car", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 As new employees were brought into Apple\u2019s secret effort to create a self-driving car a few years ago, managers told them that they were working on the company\u2019s next big thing: A product that would take on Detroit and disrupt the automobile industry.A notable symbol of that retrenchment is a self-driving shuttle service that ferries employees from one Apple building to another. The shuttle, which has never been reported before, will likely be a commercial vehicle from an automaker and Apple will use it to test the autonomous driving technology that it develops.Five people familiar with Apple\u2019s car project, code-named \u201cTitan,\u201d discussed with The New York Times the missteps that led the tech giant to move \u2014 at least for now \u2014 from creating a self-driving Apple car to creating technology for a car that someone else builds. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly about Apple\u2019s plans.The project\u2019s reduced scale aligns Apple more closely with other tech companies that are working on autonomous driving technology but are steering clear of building cars. Even Waymo, the Google self-driving spinoff that is probably furthest along among Silicon Valley companies, has said repeatedly that it does not plan to produce its own vehicles.Apple\u2019s testing vehicles will carry employees between its various Silicon Valley offices. The new effort is called PAIL, short for Palo Alto to Infinite Loop, the address of the company\u2019s main office in Cupertino, Calif., and a few miles down the road from Palo Alto, Calif.Apple\u2019s in-house shuttle service, which isn\u2019t operational yet, follows Waymo, Uber and a number of car companies that have been testing driverless cars on city streets around the world.But the initial scale of Apple\u2019s driverless ambitions went beyond tinkering or building underlying technology. The Titan project started in 2014, and it was staffed by many Apple veterans. The company also hired engineers with expertise in building cars, and not just the software that would run an autonomous vehicle.It was a do-it-all approach typical of Apple, which prefers to control every aspect of a product, from the software that runs it to the look and feel of the hardware.From the beginning, the employees dedicated to Project Titan looked at a wide range of details. That included motorized doors that opened and closed silently. They also studied ways to redesign a car interior without a steering wheel or gas pedals, and they worked on adding virtual or augmented reality into interior displays.The team also worked on a new light and ranging detection sensor, also known as lidar. Lidar sensors normally protrude from the top of a car like a spinning cone and are essential in driverless cars. Apple, as always focused on clean designs, wanted to do away with the awkward cone.But the car project ran into trouble, said the five people familiar with it, dogged by its size and by the lack of a clearly defined vision of what Apple wanted in a vehicle. Team members complained of shifting priorities and arbitrary or unrealistic deadlines.There was disagreement about whether Apple should develop a fully autonomous vehicle or a semiautonomous car that could drive itself for stretches but allow the driver to retake control.Steve Zadesky, an Apple executive who was initially in charge of Titan, wanted to pursue the semiautonomous option. But people within the industrial design team including Jonathan Ive, Apple\u2019s chief designer, believed that a fully driverless car would allow the company to reimagine the automobile experience, according to the five people.A similar debate raged inside Google\u2019s self-driving car effort for years. There, the fully autonomous vehicle won out, mainly because researchers worried drivers couldn\u2019t be trusted to retake control in an emergency.Even though Apple had not ironed out many of the basics, like how the autonomous systems would work, a team had already started working on an operating system software called CarOS. There was fierce debate about whether it should be programmed using Swift, Apple\u2019s own programming language, or the industry standard, C++.Mr. Zadesky, who worked on the iPod and iPhone, eventually left Titan and took a leave of absence from the company for personal reasons in 2016. He is still at Apple, although he is no longer involved in the project. Mr. Zadesky could not be reached for comment.Mr. Mansfield shelved plans to build a car and focused the project on the underlying self-driving technology. He also laid off some hardware staff, though the exact number of employees dedicated to working on car technology was unclear.More recently, the team has grown again, adding personnel with expertise in autonomous systems, rather than car production.While many companies are pursuing driverless technology and see it as a game changer for car ownership and transportation, no one has figured out how to cash in yet.With expectations reset and the team more focused, people on the Titan project said morale has improved under Mr. Mansfield. Still, one of the biggest challenges is holding onto talented engineers because self-driving technology is one of the hottest things in Silicon Valley, and Apple is hardly the only company working on it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung Verdict Sends a Tough New Message to South Korea Inc.", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 More than two decades ago, South Korean prosecutors indicted the chairman of the powerful Samsung conglomerate on charges of bribing the president. He was let off with a suspended sentence and then a presidential pardon.About a decade later, he was indicted again, on tax evasion and embezzlement charges. And again he escaped prison time.The message was clear: Samsung was essentially untouchable, and the family that ran the company wielded the true power in South Korea.On Friday, the country\u2019s courts sent a different message.Lee Jae-yong, the third-generation heir to the Samsung empire, was sentenced to five years in prison over a bribery scandal that has already contributed to the downfall of the country\u2019s former president and shaken the country\u2019s political and economic foundations.It was the most remarkable sentence yet for a South Korean business titan, and a sign that the country is no longer willing to offer its business leaders political impunity in exchange for untrammeled economic growth.Now South Korea and Samsung \u2014 the country\u2019s biggest business empire and a global force in the technology industry \u2014 are at a turning point. Friday\u2019s verdict could embolden efforts to weaken the hold that major family-run business groups have maintained over one of the world\u2019s most dynamic economies.\u201cUntil now, Samsung had always been considered above the law in South Korea,\u201d said You Jong-il, an economist at the KDI School of Public Policy and Management. \u201cThis marks a big stride in establishing judicial justice in the country because it has kept failing before Samsung.\u201dFor Samsung, a vast conglomerate, the verdict offers a test of whether the company can wean itself from the family that founded it and has long used it to amass wealth and power. Mr. Lee and other family members could still wield power behind the scenes, say people who study South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, the way some of the country\u2019s other business empires have been run from jail cells.\u201cHe still has controlling power, even though he\u2019s in jail,\u201d said Chang Sea-jin, a professor at the National University of Singapore, speaking of Mr. Lee. \u201cHe can fire any chief executive, and the professional managers should have to keep reporting to him.\u201dMr. Lee and four other Samsung executives were convicted on Friday of paying $7.8 million in bribes and other inducements to ensure that the country\u2019s disgraced former president, Park Geun-hye, supported a complicated corporate deal. That deal strengthened Mr. Lee\u2019s grip on Samsung Electronics, the famous maker of smartphones and televisions and the conglomerate\u2019s crown jewel.The verdict could still be reversed on appeal, which Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers have said they will pursue. Their hope is not senseless: Mr. Lee\u2019s father, Lee Kun-hee, twice received presidential pardons for wrongdoing. But the current president, Moon Jae-in, and his political party have pledged to crack down on shady practices at South Korea\u2019s family-run business empires, which are known as chaebols.In 2005, conversations recorded between a senior Samsung executive and a newspaper magnate, both close to the Lee family, were leaked to local news media. In those conversations, which took place eight years earlier, they discussed bribes paid to top politicians and senior prosecutors. Samsung apologized, but the recordings were not used as evidence because they had been illegally recorded.Mr. Lee\u2019s father \u2014 Lee Kun-hee, the son of Samsung\u2019s founder \u2014 was twice pardoned by presidents after being convicted of bribery and other charges. But he won a measure of respect from South Koreans because he helped make Samsung Electronics into a high-quality brand.Being in prison does not necessarily mean that Mr. Lee will give up control, however. He has two sisters, but neither has been heavily involved in the electronics business and they generally have not been considered rivals to Mr. Lee.Perhaps the most daunting challenge to Samsung is one that the company has not been able to solve even with Mr. Lee free and in charge. While the company dominates hardware, from memory and chips to the finished smartphone and television, it has long struggled in the realm of software and services.Another challenge could arise with the death of the elder Mr. Lee, which could set off the type of infighting that split up other chaebol families and empires in recent years, said Park Sang-in, a professor of public administration at Seoul National University and a chaebol critic.\u201cCronies inside Samsung will start taking sides, and this is a risky situation you can\u2019t control from a jail cell,\u201d he said.For many in South Korea, the question is whether the authorities will keep up the pressure on the country\u2019s big business groups. Some groups critical of the chaebol say Friday\u2019s Samsung verdict was not as severe as it could have been, and that the five-year sentence was the weakest legal penalty allowed for the crimes Mr. Lee committed.\u201cThis is another court ruling proving that in South Korea, if you don\u2019t have money, you are guilty,\u201d said a statement from Spec Watch, a Seoul-based civic group that monitors corporate crimes, \u201cbut if you have money, you are innocent.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article, using information from Reuters, provided an incorrect photographer credit. The picture of Lee Jae-yong was a pool photo by Chung Sung-Jun; it was not taken by Lee Jae-yong.Choe Sang-Hun and Jeyup S. Kwaak reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Paul Mozur reported from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

What were your early years like?Tell me about your parents.Both my parents are entrepreneurs. My dad has done a million things over the years. He\u2019s been a journalist. He started his own stock brokerage firm. He owns more than 30 restaurants across three states now. I definitely saw the struggles of entrepreneurship. Restaurants are a really tough business.My mom owned a collection of gift stores, and I would work for her when I was in school. She has a really great eye for spotting the next trend.How have they influenced your leadership style?My dad was always good at what I would describe as panicking early, which I think of as looking way out over the horizon and thinking through a decision and the 50 steps down the road. That\u2019s served me really well.My mom would always say that it\u2019s better to have a couple of nice things than a lot of mediocre things. We\u2019ve applied that lesson at work, to do a few things really well.Did you have an idea what you wanted to do for a career when you went to college?When I was 7 years old, my grandmother gave me an Apple II Plus for Christmas, and I took to it like a duck to water. Computers made a lot of sense to me. My mom used to sneak me into computer science classes at the University of Utah, pretending that she was taking the continuing education classes, and I would basically do all the work.So I planned to study computer science. But I took a couple of courses and I was bored out of my mind. So I transferred my major to English literature, and kept computer science as a minor.When I graduated, I had job offers at a bunch of tech companies that I thought weren\u2019t going to go anywhere, like Netscape and Yahoo and Microsoft. And I remember thinking that I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life sitting in front of a computer writing code. So I decided to go to law school.I eventually found my way to the world of start-ups. I became pretty hooked on starting something from scratch. Working at a start-up is almost like a drug. There\u2019s something very powerful about going from an idea on a piece of paper to enough money in a bank account to fund it, to building a team.I started working on Cloudflare as a business-school project in 2009, and my co-founders and I opened an office in California in January 2010.What are some leadership lessons you\u2019ve learned?The three of us who started Cloudflare each have our strengths and weaknesses. But together we formed a really great foundation. The way my co-founder Michelle [Zatlyn] describes it is that when you\u2019re starting a business, you\u2019ve got a certain surface area that you\u2019ve got to cover.It\u2019s kind of like a Venn diagram. You want people who can cover as much of that surface area as possible. You don\u2019t want them so completely disparate that they can\u2019t even communicate, so you need a little bit of overlap. If you\u2019ve got too much overlap, then you end up fighting over whose job it is.What else?When the company was just eight of us, a younger engineer suggested a new tradition \u2014 every Friday after work, we go get drinks at a local pub, talk about the week and get to know each other outside of work.Michelle and I vetoed that idea, and people said, \u201cWhy? Are you the fun police?\u201d I explained that when you look at successful organizations, they\u2019re defined by their ability to pull from the broadest possible pool of people. At some point, we\u2019re going to want to hire a 50-year-old single mom or dad who has to pick up their daughter from soccer practice on Friday afternoons.If they can\u2019t feel like they\u2019re part of the team, then they\u2019re not going to come work for us. That\u2019s going to massively narrow the pool of people we can hire from. We wanted to make Cloudflare a place where, no matter who you were, you could come here and work, and you\u2019d be judged on that work. We weren\u2019t trying to recreate college.I also watched other companies stumble because they grow too fast. If you\u2019re growing faster than doubling the number of employees in any 12-month period, then inherently you\u2019re going to have more new people than old people. And in the short term, maybe that\u2019s fine. But the culture can start to suffer because there\u2019s nothing foundational to keep you stable.We have a rule across the organization, and on a team level, to never grow faster than doubling in any 12-month period. For start-ups like us, there\u2019s constant pressure to grow faster, but if you do that, then there are no culture-keepers of the organization.How do you hire?I look for an incredibly high degree of curiosity \u2014 people who just relentlessly want to learn new things and put themselves in new situations \u2014 and a high degree of empathy. If people are curious and empathetic, they can learn just about anything.One of the best ways to tell whether someone\u2019s curious and empathetic is to ask them for the questions they have. You can see how their mind works and how thoughtful they are.What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?Really understand your strengths and weaknesses, and surround yourself with people who complement you and challenge you. That will help you continue to grow.As I look back on my career, I\u2019ve always had partners in crime. Starting a company on your own can be horrifically lonely.Advertisement"}

Slightly fuzzy to the touch, Allbirds have minimal styling (tiny logos only) and come in two versions: a runner and a lounger. Both styles, for men and women, sell for $95. Next month, Allbirds is opening its first store in Manhattan.In true Silicon Valley fashion, Allbirds is a start-up. Is it venture funded? Of course it is. The company has raised $9.95 million over the last year to spread its vision. But this being start-up land, a shoe is never just a shoe.\u201cWe\u2019re about the distillation of solutions, the refinement and crafting of forms in a maniacal way,\u201d said Tim Brown, the Allbirds co-founder from New Zealand.And so, for now, this insular world has settled on Allbirds.At a gathering last month hosted by the venture capital firm August Capital on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., about 1,000 entrepreneurs and investors mingled on a concrete patio over margaritas and deviled eggs to celebrate summer. Guests wore other shoes \u2014 New Balance, Top-Siders, Tevas and a rare dress shoe were spotted \u2014 but the furry-looking Allbird was by far the most common.Serik Kaldykulov, the managing partner for Elefund, which finances early-stage start-ups, wore a pair as he waited to get into the party.\u201cEveryone\u2019s wearing them. Sometimes it is awkward, especially if we\u2019re wearing the same color \u2014 but then it\u2019s an icebreaker,\u201d said Mr. Kaldykulov, who owns four pairs in different colors.\u201cAnything with laces becomes less efficient,\u201d said John Kim, chief executive of SendBird, a start-up that helps software engineers build chat features within their apps. He sported a pair of light gray Allbirds.Mr. Kim said he wore Allbirds for \u201call reasons and purposes\u201d \u2014 except to a recent barbecue, for fear that sauce could seep in. Allbirds, which are machine washable, are meant to be worn without socks. (Some have complained about how quickly the shoes wear out, though Allbirds has said in a statement that the latest line is more durable than earlier iterations.)At Allbirds\u2019 office, in one of San Francisco\u2019s oldest buildings on a high-end shopping street downtown, he and Mr. Brown, both 36, told the story of how they became Silicon Valley\u2019s cobblers.In 2009, Mr. Brown, then vice captain of the New Zealand soccer team, was trying to figure out his next chapter. He liked design and, before attending business school, made simple leather shoes for his friends. But the shoes were uncomfortable.\u201cI didn\u2019t understand how it could be made,\u201d he said.Mr. Zwillinger, an engineer in biotechnology, was working in Silicon Valley and struggling to sell algae oil as a replacement for petroleum. (It was too expensive to catch on.) Their wives, who are best friends and former Dartmouth roommates, introduced the two men. Mr. Brown traveled to Northern California to meet Mr. Zwillinger and get advice on supply chains. Mr. Zwillinger cooked a lamb stew, and the two decided to form a business.\u201cOne of the worst offenders of the environment from a consumer product standpoint is shoes,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the making; it\u2019s the materials.\u201dAllbirds are made of a very fine merino wool, each strand 17.5 microns wide. \u201cWhich is 20 percent of the width of the average human hair,\u201d he said.The shoe\u2019s name comes from what explorers supposedly first said of New Zealand: \u201cIt\u2019s all birds.\u201d Also, Mr. Zwillinger is an avid birder.For a while, there was little tech interest. Then, in mid-2016, Mr. Zwillinger noticed tech leaders posting about the shoes on Snapchat and Twitter.\u201cAll of a sudden, men size 12 and 13 went out of stock,\u201d Mr. Zwillinger said. \u201cOur demo went from mostly female to way male. A run started happening.\u201dToday, the two men have 50 employees in their San Francisco headquarters, 350 contractors in a factory in South Korea and 40 at a warehouse in Nashville. The Brooklyn-based Red Antler consultant firm worked with them on branding and design.The office is packed. The meeting room is up a ladder; there\u2019s a fros\u00e9 machine for frozen ros\u00e9. At 4 p.m. every day, the founders host an all-office push-up session called \u201c40 at 4.\u201dDave Morin, an investor at Slow Ventures, which put money into Allbirds, said the start-up was a place to invest \u201cin the material science and the dream.\u201d\u201cNo. 1, breakthrough material; two, you didn\u2019t need socks, that changes the idea of shoes; and No. 3, it was a single shoe,\u201d Mr. Morin said. \u201cI think of it as classic Apple simplicity strategy.\u201dOthers were more hesitant.\u201cI don\u2019t think Silicon Valley has ever set, is currently setting, or ever will set any fashion trends,\u201d said Mr. Costolo, the former Twitter chief executive who wears Allbirds.Mr. Brown and Mr. Zwillinger said they planned to release new colors of shoes (currently six are available, including pine and moss) and, eventually, shoes for children.

{"Headline": "Crowded TV Marketplace Gets Ready for Three Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has more than $1 billion budgeted for original programming, Facebook wants its own version of \u201cScandal\u201d and Google is ready to spend up to $3 million per episode on a drama.The three digital giants have signaled to Hollywood that they are serious about entering a television landscape that Netflix and Amazon shook up just a few years ago. Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.With the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.That budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201dMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.It is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.But as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.And while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.It has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.Unlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.YouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.Although Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine. Originally, YouTube and its subscription YouTube Red channel were largely focused on creating bigger budget shows for YouTube stars.Data searches, Mr. Kyncl said, provided a \u201cwindow into the demand of Hollywood product on YouTube.\u201d\u201cWhy not fulfill this demand?\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes absolute sense.

The app, which has not previously been reported, shares the look, function and feel of Facebook\u2019s Moments app. It was released through a separate local company and without any hint that the social network is affiliated with it.Now Colorful Balloons gives the Silicon Valley company a way to see how Chinese users digitally share information with their friends or interact with their favorite social media platforms.\u201cWe have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,\u201d Facebook said in a statement.It is unclear whether China\u2019s various internet regulators were aware of the app\u2019s existence. The under-the-table approach could cause Facebook new difficulties with a Chinese government that has maintained strict oversight and control over foreign tech companies.\u201cIt\u2019s not a mere business thing,\u201d said Teng Bingsheng, a professor of strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. \u201cIt\u2019s politics.\u201dThe Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment.Before the release of Colorful Balloons, Facebook had taken an unusually high-profile approach to courting China.Colorful Balloons represents the opposite approach \u2014 one that is low profile.The app was released in China by a company called Youge Internet Technology, according to a post in Apple\u2019s app store. It is registered to an address in eastern Beijing, yet the room number listed in company registration documents could not be found amid a series of shabby, small offices on the building\u2019s fourth floor.Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Zhang\u2019s relationship to the company, and Ms. Zhang did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.If Facebook did little to promote Colorful Balloons in China, it did work to tailor the app to a local audience. In the rest of the world, the company\u2019s Moments app connects users through Facebook. Colorful Balloons instead links users through China\u2019s biggest social network, WeChat.While photos can be shared, Facebook appears to have taken steps to ensure the app could not spread widely. For example, people who post photos from Colorful Balloons on WeChat will see a link that lets other users download Facebook\u2019s Chinese app. But the link does not work, meaning people have to seek out Colorful Balloons in an app store instead of grabbing it from their friends, which may limit its distribution.The risk Facebook is taking with the new app is high. The company appears to have handed over a fully functioning product to Youge for release, and has done so without indicating in any public way that it is connected to Facebook. Coming just ahead of a key meeting of the Chinese Communist Party this autumn, the secretive release of Colorful Balloons could also undermine trust between the company and the Chinese government.\u201cThe government\u2019s control and surveillance of media is strict, and it is almost impossible for them to open that door,\u201d said Mr. Teng, the Cheung Kong professor. \u201cAlthough Mark Zuckerberg has visited China many times and practiced his Chinese very hard, I don\u2019t foresee any major breakthroughs for Facebook.\u201dCarolyn Zhang contributed research from Shanghai.

{"Headline": "How Disney Wants to Take On Netflix With Its Own Streaming Services", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Walt Disney Company, under pressure to address threats to its vast television business, unveiled its answer on Tuesday: two Netflix-style streaming services.\u201cI would characterize this as an extremely important, very, very significant strategic shift for us,\u201d Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings. Underscoring the need for Mr. Iger to reposition his company for growth, Disney reported a slight decline in revenue and a 9 percent drop in net income.Disney\u2019s move online could put the company in conflict with Netflix, which will lose access to new Disney and Pixar films, and with cable providers, which pay Disney handsomely for the right to distribute ESPN and other channels. Mr. Iger said Disney had not yet talked to cable providers. He added, however, that he had \u201call the confidence in the world\u201d in Disney\u2019s ability to maintain favorable deals with them.The ESPN streaming service will arrive early next year, Mr. Iger said. It will include baseball, hockey, tennis and college sports \u2014 about 10,000 regional and national events in its first year. Users will be able to access the service through an enhanced version of ESPN\u2019s current app, which includes news, highlights and scores. People who pay to receive ESPN the old-fashioned way (via a cable or satellite provider) will be able to access standard ESPN programming through the same app.Mr. Iger said Disney had lately noticed \u201ca dramatic increase in app-based media consumption,\u201d and not just for its own offerings.Disney will also offer a separate entertainment-oriented streaming service. (With traditional cable hookups, people are usually forced to pay for sports channels even if they do not watch them.) It will arrive in 2019 and provide exclusive access to new Disney films, including a sequel to \u201cFrozen,\u201d a live-action version of \u201cThe Lion King\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d (Netflix currently has rights to new Disney-branded films; Disney will take back those rights.)The Disney-branded entertainment service will also include a vast amount of library content, including movies and television programming from Disney Channel, Disney Junior and Disney XD. Mr. Iger said that Disney would also make a \u201csignificant\u201d investment in original movies and shows for the service, which will not have advertising.Mr. Iger said that Disney had not decided whether to include films from its Marvel and Lucasfilm (\u201cStar Wars\u201d) labels, in part because of their different fan bases.\u201cIt\u2019s possible we will continue to license them to a pay service like Netflix, but it\u2019s premature to say,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been talk about launching a proprietary Marvel service and \u2018Star Wars\u2019 service.\u201d He added, however, that Disney was cautious about stand-alone services for those film brands, in part because a large amount of content would be needed to satisfy subscribers.Disney declined to say how much subscriptions would cost. Mr. Iger said the goal was a price low enough to encourage widespread adoption but not so low that it would cannibalize traditional cable and satellite subscriptions. In the past, Mr. Iger has hinted about a \u201cdynamic\u201d model, with viewers able to pay based on how much they want to watch.In some ways, Disney is late to this party. CBS, for instance, introduced a direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service in 2014. But Disney is a media superpower, and its decision to aggressively pursue streaming could speed the entertainment industry\u2019s adoption of the platform.\u201cNo one is better positioned to lead the industry into this dynamic new era,\u201d Mr. Iger said, noting his company\u2019s trove of popular content and unrivaled connection to its audience \u2014 particularly children, who are a huge driver for streaming services.Meantime, cord-cutting continues to affect ESPN. Traditional subscriptions declined 3.5 percent in the most recent quarter; in the year-ago period, ESPN had a 2 percent decline.For its fiscal third quarter, the company had a profit totaling $2.37 billion, or $1.51 a share, compared with $2.6 billion or $1.59 a share, a year earlier. Disney had revenue of $14.2 billion in the quarter, down slightly from a year earlier.Adjusting for a one-time charge related to a legal settlement, Disney had per-share earnings of $1.58 in the most recent quarter. Analysts had expected $1.55.Among the biggest challenges for Disney in the quarter were costs at ESPN, which recorded about $400 million in incremental expenses because of a new contract with the National Basketball Association. As a result, operating income at Disney Media Networks, which includes ESPN, fell to $1.84 billion, a 22 percent decline.Expenses also increased at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, which opened an attraction in Florida based on \u201cAvatar\u201d and brought one of the Disney cruise ships in for refurbishment. But the theme park unit nonetheless reported an 18 percent increase in operating income, to $1.17 billion, because of the timing of the Easter holiday and improved results at overseas parks, including Disneyland Paris.Disney\u2019s movie studio had a difficult quarter. Its operating income fell 17 percent, to $639 million, because of a lineup of films that could not match last year\u2019s highs. In the most recent quarter, Disney released \u201cCars 3,\u201d \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201d In the year-ago quarter, the studio\u2019s blockbusters included \u201cFinding Dory,\u201d \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d and \u201cCaptain America: Civil War.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Rebecca Solnit Became the Voice of the Resistance", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySubjects that the author and essayist Rebecca Solnit has written about, some at considerable length, include Irish history, atlases, Alzheimer\u2019s, a traveling medical clinic, natural disasters, urban planning, tortoises, walking, gentrification, Yosemite National Park and Apple Inc.\u2018\u2018There\u2019s something interdisciplinary at best and wildly wandering at worst about how I think,\u2019\u2019 she told me recently over the phone from San Francisco, where she lives and works. \u2018\u2018I am interested in almost everything, and it can sometimes seem like a burden.\u2019\u2019 She cited Virginia Woolf and Henry David Thoreau as the writers most important to her: \u2018\u2018Each of them wrote exquisitely about experiential, immediate encounters with the tangible world but could also be very powerful political polemicists. And the arc of their work describes a space in which you can be both.\u2019\u2019In other words, Solnit is a certain kind of celebrity, if a reluctant one. \u2018\u2018I feel that it\u2019s really important to not depend on all this in any sense and not let this define my worth or work,\u2019\u2019 she said on the phone. \u2018\u2018I wrote \u2018Hope in the Dark\u2019 14 years ago. Am I somehow better or smarter now than I was then?\u2019\u2019 The answer, of course, is no. Strange as it is to say, Solnit\u2019s newfound popularity reveals more about her readers than it does her. That the book, and her other suddenly timely work, was not written in the last several months, but rather years prior, makes its ideas seem even truer, giving it the veneer of sacred text. She has become a Cassandra figure of the left, her writing, which seems magically to have long ago said the things that many Americans now most want to hear, consumed as both balm and rallying cry.Paul Yamazaki, the head book buyer at City Lights bookstore in San Francisco, which published Solnit\u2019s first book in 1991, adds the frank, genre-defying works of Kathy Acker and Jane Bowles to the list, but can\u2019t quite conjure a unifying theory of what all of these authors share. \u2018\u2018I wish I had one!\u2019\u2019 he laughed over the phone. \u2018\u2018I\u2019d be a much better bookseller if I did.\u2019\u2019 It\u2019s worth noting, however, that these belatedly embraced writers seem to be mostly female. Perhaps it\u2019s because no one listens to them the first time they speak.There\u2019s another reason, too, that we look to the past for our current intellectual decipherers and idols. In the Trump era, Solnit, who writes against corruption of all kinds \u2014 environmental, political, social \u2014 seems herself wholly uncorrupted: by these sorts of discussions of commercial popularity; by the harried activity of online life; by the social spheres of Washington, D.C., and New York City; by the aesthetic fetishization that so many women writers are subject to. \u2018\u2018If you think of a kind of ecology of ideas, there are more than enough people telling us how horrific and terrible and bad everything is, and I don\u2019t really need to join that project,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018There\u2019s a whole other project of trying to counterbalance that \u2014 sometimes we do win and this is how it worked in the past.\u2019\u2019 She continued, \u2018\u2018Change is often unpredictable and indirect. We don\u2019t know the future. We\u2019ve changed the world many times, and remembering that, that history, is really a source of power to continue and it doesn\u2019t get talked about nearly enough.\u2019\u2019For years, Solnit has been traveling with photographer friends to Lake Powell, a massive reservoir on the central border of Utah and Arizona that was formerly a series of magnificent sandstone gorges known as Glen Canyon. She has written about the awe-inspiring industriousness that is responsible for the lake \u2014 its creation, by damming the Colorado River, began in the late 1950s, and it took 17 years to fill to capacity \u2014 but also about the hubris that imbues it; it is, she says, \u2018\u2018failing quite spectacularly,\u2019\u2019 with water levels dropping significantly over the last two decades.The excursions come as a relief. \u2018\u2018Writing about the politics of this moment sort of feels like being stranded in the shallows, and means not writing about deeper cultural forces and longer timeframes in history,\u2019\u2019 she said. As the water levels of Lake Powell have dropped, the Colorado River has begun to re-emerge in some places. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s not exactly hopeful,\u2019\u2019 Solnit said. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s something that\u2019s neither victory nor defeat. That\u2019s really interesting to me.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google\u2019s War Over the Sexes", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMen and women are different. On this, almost everyone acquainted with reality agrees. How different is the more controversial question, to which there is one particularly interesting answer: A little more different than they used to be.Conservatives sometimes worry that our society features an unhealthy blurring of sexual identities, an androgyne confusion. The left tends to be more optimistic about such blurring, seeing it as a liberation from the rule of patriarchy and the prison of heteronormativity.But the opposite trend, the divergence of the sexes, might be more important. Some of our present difficulties may flow from an excess of feminine and masculine differentiation, from the sexes growing apart and losing common ground, from the decline of marriage\u2019s male-female partnership and the rise of a singlehood that\u2019s often more sex-segregated than family life.Certainly the frontiers of sexual license often feature strong male-female differentiation rather than androgyny or gender-neutrality. Think of the clich\u00e9s that prevail in internet pornography, or the gendered kinks of \u201cFifty Shades of Grey.\u201d Even our culture\u2019s highest-profile gender transition had a highly sex-specific presentation \u2014 Bruce Jenner was the ultimate male Olympian; Caitlyn Jenner, a busty, hyper-feminized Vanity Fair cover model.If you then asked a left-wing misandrist to do the same sort of parody in reverse, you\u2019d end up with something like the online far-right \u2014 nerds and autodidacts obsessed with cuckoldry, fascist cosplayers eager for evidence of their own racial superiority, would-be lotharios furious at feminism, libertarians with a ten-point case for despotism.The divergence of the sexes also provides a useful context for thinking about this week\u2019s culture-war controversy, the high-profile firing of a Google software engineer, James Damore, for a memo he wrote criticizing the company\u2019s diversity policies.But Damore also made reasonable points about different ways to pursue diversity and the costs and benefits thereof, in an earnest and dialogic style that a healthy corporate culture would have found a way to answer without swiftly giving him the ax.At the same time, there was a sense in which Damore had to be fired, precisely because of the intertwined realities that he described. Silicon Valley is a very male environment, a land of nerd kings and brogrammers whose deepest beliefs tend to be the sort that men come up with when they don\u2019t have very many women around \u2014 arch-libertarian, irreligious, utopian in a mechanistic style.I strongly suspect that more than a few Silicon Valley higher-ups agreed with the broad themes of Damore\u2019s memo. But just as tech titans accept some censorship and oppression as the price of doing business in China, they accept performative progressivism as the price of having nice campuses in the most liberal state in the union and recruiting their employees from its most elite and liberal schools. And for questioning that political performance while defending the disproportionate maleness that makes it necessary, the Google memo-writer simply had to go.This is not a healthy dynamic, obviously. Indeed, part of why the alt-right has such a strong (if sub rosa) presence in Northern California is because it\u2019s a predictable kind of male response to professional life under the rule of political correctness \u2014 a response that the Damore firing will only make more attractive.But since the usual way to reintegrate the sexes is to have them marry one another and raise kids, what Silicon Valley probably needs right now more than either workplace anti-microaggression training or an alt-right underground is a basic friendliness to family, pregnancy and child rearing.Advertisement"}
