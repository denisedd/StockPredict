{"Headline": "How This U.S. Tech Giant Is Backing China\u2019s Tech Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the Chinese government develops drones, the American technology giant Qualcomm is helping. The same goes for artificial intelligence, mobile technology and supercomputers. Qualcomm is also working to help Chinese companies like Huawei break into overseas markets in support of China\u2019s \u201cgo global\u201d campaign to develop big multinational brands.Qualcomm is providing money, expertise and engineering for Beijing\u2019s master plan to create its own technology superpowers.Big American companies fiercely protect their intellectual property and trade secrets, fearful of giving an edge to rivals. But they have little choice in China \u2014 and Washington is looking on with alarm.To gain access to the Chinese market, American companies are being forced to transfer technology, create joint ventures, lower prices and aid homegrown players. Those efforts form the backbone of President Xi Jinping\u2019s ambitious plan to ensure that China\u2019s companies, military and government dominate core areas of technology like artificial intelligence and semiconductors.Advanced Micro Devices and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are working with Chinese companies to develop server chips, creating rivals to their own product. Intel is working with the Chinese to build high-end mobile chips, in competition with Qualcomm. IBM has agreed to transfer valuable technology that could enable China to break into the lucrative mainframe banking business.\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of unease in Washington,\u201d said James Lewis, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cThe defense, intelligence agencies and others are concerned that advanced chip-making capabilities are going to China.\u201dQualcomm declined to comment, as did Intel.Qualcomm is caught in the middle.The world\u2019s dominant mobile phone chip maker, Qualcomm ran afoul of the Chinese government, getting hit in 2015 with a record $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior. To get back in Beijing\u2019s good graces, the company agreed to lower its prices in China, promised to shift more of its high-end manufacturing to partners in China, and pledged to upgrade the country\u2019s technology capabilities.The extent of Qualcomm\u2019s involvement with the Chinese government \u2014 and the complications for American tech giants \u2014 is seen in a low-slung office building in the southwest part of the country. There, a team of engineers is developing leading-edge microchips to compete with the finest made by Intel. The chips will help power a huge data and cloud center with the potential to strengthen the country\u2019s computing capabilities. No longer content to rely on buying the chips that go into cellphones, computers and cars, China now wants to design and build the brains that drive much of the digital world.The government is providing land and financing to the start-up formed with Qualcomm, called Huaxintong Semiconductor. Qualcomm has provided the technology and about $140 million in initial funding.\u201cQualcomm has a balancing act,\u201d said Willy Shih, who teaches at Harvard Business School. \u201cMost of the world\u2019s PCs are made in China, and most of the world\u2019s smartphones too, so they have to play along. It\u2019s a fact of life.\u201dQualcomm was early to break into China.In the mid-1990s, as China\u2019s economy began to boom, President Bill Clinton pressed the country\u2019s leaders to open to American technology companies.Members of the Clinton administration, including Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, and William M. Daley, the secretary of commerce, were dispatched to Beijing to hammer out the details. They pushed for one company by name: Qualcomm.\u201cAt the time, they were the only U.S. show in town,\u201d Ms. Barshefsky said.\u201cBill Daley and I pushed the Chinese hard on accepting the U.S. standard for wireless technology,\u201d she added, \u201cand that was Qualcomm.\u201dMobile phone adoption was taking off globally, largely backed by a European wireless standard called G.S.M., or global system for mobile communications. Qualcomm had a competing American standard called C.D.M.A., or Code Division Multiple Access.Irwin M. Jacobs, a founder of Qualcomm, spearheaded an aggressive lobbying campaign in Washington and Beijing, promoting the technology\u2019s potential to transform wireless communication markets.\u201cWe knew China would be important, and they didn\u2019t have their own system,\u201d said Perry LaForge, a former Qualcomm executive. \u201cWe also told them this system would give them an opportunity to manufacture their own handsets, and not rely on buying them from other countries.\u201dWhen Qualcomm first entered China in the late 1990s, it was slow to gain traction. The company struggled to find Chinese partners to produce mobile phones that worked with its network. China also tried to develop its own wireless standard.Qualcomm eventually won out, helping write the standards for next-generation mobile technology, 3G and 4G service. The standard championed by European telecom providers faded rapidly. And China\u2019s homegrown technology struggled.By 2013, virtually every wireless device around the world was reliant on either Qualcomm\u2019s chips or its patents \u2014 enough to provide some of the technology industry\u2019s fattest profit margins.With its dominance rising, global brands like Apple and Samsung began complaining to regulators around the world, citing \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d pricing practices and high royalty fees. In China, a trade group made up of the country\u2019s major handset makers complained about patent holders levying \u201cexorbitant licensing fees.\u201d\u201cThese days a smartphone is covered by about 250,000 patents,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational center based in Honolulu. \u201cA Chinese smartphone maker needs to negotiate license agreements with companies like Qualcomm that own the essential patents.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese government was worried about this,\u201d he added. \u201cThat all these costs could constrain Chinese companies.\u201dThe raids began at dawn, in late November 2013. Investigators descended upon Qualcomm\u2019s offices in Beijing and Shanghai, questioning the staff and hauling away laptops and documents.At the time of the raids, the San Diego-based company\u2019s senior managers were at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York, attending an investor conference. The executives were planning to talk about the company\u2019s strategy. Instead, they began fielding frantic phone calls from China.The China business, which accounted for more than half of its global revenue, was in trouble.A week later, one of the country\u2019s most powerful regulatory agencies, the National Development and Reform Commission (N.D.R.C.), announced that it was looking into whether Qualcomm had abused its power in the sale of mobile phone chips. \u201cQualcomm came to control so much of the chip market in China,\u201d said Louie Ming, a former Qualcomm executive in China. \u201cIt was clear they were eventually going to run into antitrust problems.\u201dWhile Qualcomm agreed to fully cooperate with the investigation, some senior executives appealed to the Obama administration, pressing the White House to raise the issue with China\u2019s senior leaders, according to a former administration official.Qualcomm\u2019s troubles went beyond China. The company was also under scrutiny by antitrust regulators in the European Union and South Korea, as well as by the United States Federal Trade Commission.China didn\u2019t back down. The head of the N.D.R.C. branded Qualcomm a monopoly.In February 2015, after a 15-month-long investigation, Qualcomm settled allegations in China that it had charged unfairly high prices for its chips and patents. The company agreed to pay the $975 million fine \u2014 about 8 percent of its annual revenue in China \u2014 and to lower the prices for chips sold in the country.\u201cWe are pleased that the resolution has removed the uncertainty surrounding our business in China, and we will now focus our full attention and resources on supporting our customers and partners in China,\u201d said Steve Mollenkopf, the company\u2019s chief executive, said at the time.Qualcomm then went into business with the Chinese government.There was a $150 million investment fund to help Chinese start-ups; new research and design facilities set up with Chinese companies such as Huawei and Tencent; and a partnership with a Beijing-based company called Thundersoft to develop drones, virtual reality goggles and internet-connected devices.Qualcomm is also helping the Chinese government develop supercomputers, a technology the United States government has discouraged American companies from supporting overseas. In May, Qualcomm agreed to form a joint venture with other state-backed firms to design and sell mass-market smartphone chips. And to help make Chinese chip manufacturing more competitive, Qualcomm has pledged to shift more of its high-end production \u2014 long done by outside contractors in Taiwan and South Korea \u2014 to China.\u201cThis is what China does better than anyone else,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank focused on technology policy that has conducted studies detailing the Chinese government\u2019s pressure on technology companies.\u201cThey have a large carrot and a large stick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have a market no C.E.O. can walk away from.\u201dQualcomm\u2019s biggest new venture is taking shape in southwest China\u2019s Guizhou Province. Determined to leap into advanced technology, China has designated a large parcel of land in the provincial capital of Guiyang as the home of a new industrial park for supercomputing, data centers and cloud computing. The country\u2019s large state-run telecom operators and its internet behemoths, including Alibaba and Tencent, are moving in, to build massive server farms. The region offers lower energy costs and abundant supplies of water, necessary to cool server farms.A year ago, Qualcomm set up a joint venture with the Guizhou government and pledged to invest about $140 million for a minority stake in the business, situated in a development zone that has also attracted the interest of Microsoft and Dell. Qualcomm says it received American government approval for the deal.The new Qualcomm joint venture, Huaxintong Semiconductor, broke ground on the site in 2016, and now operates in a 46,000-square-foot design and engineering center. A major test of the partnership will come when the joint venture\u2019s first server chips are released \u2014 helping Qualcomm and the Chinese government stake out new ground. The Chinese government will control the chips and reap most of the profits.In late March, Qualcomm\u2019s president, Derek K. Aberle, flew to Guizhou to meet a powerful local government leader, Chen Miner, a confidant of the Chinese president. Seated in a government hall, before an enormous landscape painting, Mr. Aberle pledged to \u201ccontinually cooperate\u201d with the Chinese government.A headline last Sunday with an article about Qualcomm\u2019s efforts in China misidentified the location of the company\u2019s headquarters. It is based in San Diego, not Silicon Valley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Transgender Bathroom Bill Falters Amid Mounting Opposition", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe effort is now focused on the House version, but State Representative Jonathan Stickland, one of the bill\u2019s 46 co-authors and a member of the Tea Party-backed Freedom Caucus, said he was pessimistic about its chances of being allowed to advance to a vote.\u201cI think the Straus team has already decided that they are not going to let it out,\u201d said Mr. Stickland, who, like other members of the staunchly conservative caucus, persistently defies the speaker\u2019s leadership. \u201cThis is clearly part of a national agenda that is being pushed by the progressive left, and I think that that is just all coming to a head here.\u201dThe Senate bill would require transgender people to use bathrooms in schools and local government buildings corresponding to the gender listed on their birth certificates or state-issued identification cards. The House bill would prevent school districts and county or local governments from adopting or enforcing nondiscrimination ordinances that would allow transgender people to use bathrooms of their choice. The ordinance override provision is also an element in the Senate bill.Although law enforcement, religious groups and transgender advocates have all been part of the opposing coalition, big business has been a dominant force throughout the debate.\u201cCorporate America is stepping forward, speaking loudly about the fact that this will have a chilling effect on business opportunity in this state,\u201d said State Representative Byron Cook, a Republican and the chairman of the House State Affairs Committee, who has thus far refused to call a hearing on the bill. \u201cI\u2019m hearing from many major corporations about this bill and the effect it will have.\u201dCorporations active in Texas that have opposed the measure include IBM, Amazon, Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Intel, Capital One, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Facebook, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines.The association is the most powerful business lobby in the state, representing companies with more than two million employees and $8 billion in business. The group\u2019s president, Chris Wallace, said the association moved quickly to form a coalition, Keep Texas Open for Business, against legislation when it became apparent that the bathroom battle was heading to Texas.\u201cWe do not want to do anything to tarnish Texas\u2019 brand,\u201d he said.The strategy has included a seven-figure radio ad buy, strategically targeted letters signed by prominent chief executives, lobbying blitzes throughout the Capitol and rallies on the Capitol grounds.Several dozen women, predominately business owners and executives, many accompanied by their children, gathered on the south steps of the state Capitol on Tuesday as 15 speakers attacked the legislation as the work of \u201cextremist\u201d politicians that will blunt the economy and foster discrimination and hate crimes.\u201cI don\u2019t want my child to be a statistic of the 2017 special session,\u201d said Kimberly Shappley, a registered nurse and ordained minister from the Houston suburbs who was accompanied by her 6-year-old transgender daughter, Kai.Mr. Patrick and other supporters of the legislation say the projections in Texas and the impact in North Carolina have been vastly exaggerated.Business\u2019s involvement has increasingly become a target for proponents as they accelerate their efforts in the remaining days of the session.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has seen corporations engage on an issue like this outside the framework of taxes and regulations in our memory,\u201d said Dave Welch of the Texas Pastor Council, which is a leading supporter of the legislation. \u201cI think it\u2019s a combination of a rising moral bankruptcy in corporate America, in which the only thing they support is their image and their bottom line.\u201dIf the session goes all 30 days \u2014 and it could end earlier \u2014 lawmakers would adjourn on Aug 16. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, has given no hints on whether he would call another session, although he has been particularly insistent that lawmakers give Texans new safeguards against rising property taxes.As for the bathroom legislation, the governor told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper on Friday that it was \u201cway premature\u201d to conclude that the House bill wouldn\u2019t come up for a vote.The intensity of the debate has raised questions about the future relationship between business groups and the state\u2019s Republican leadership, which have shared a decades-long bond. Mr. Wallace, president of the Texas business association, said the bond would remain unbroken despite the differences in the current showdown.\u201cNinety-plus percent of the time we are in agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just happen to disagree on this issue.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market\u2019s Surge Meets Dollar\u2019s Swoon", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix months into the Trump presidency, two symbols of American financial might \u2014 the Dow and the dollar \u2014 have taken divergent paths, highlighting the complexities that investors face as the global economy hums, while Washington is enmeshed in political turmoil.Over this same period, the United States dollar has lost about 10 percent of its value against a basket of six major currencies.The near-mirror image fall in the dollar has been especially pronounced in recent weeks, stemming in part from concerns that President Trump\u2019s political problems will hamper his ability to pass a major tax reduction or an infrastructure bill.Yet those concerns have yet to halt the stock market\u2019s seemingly unstoppable advance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to record highs in the Dow as a validation of his administration, posting on Twitter on Tuesday morning:\u201cStock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d\u201cWhether you like the administration, the people, the rhetoric or not, there is no overstating just how powerful the animal spirits have been,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer for Deltec International Group, an investment firm based in Nassau, Bahamas. \u201cYou are seeing it in the data and it is evident in the financial markets as well.\u201dWhile there is no doubt that the animal spirits have done their work, just as important to the market\u2019s recent rally has been the significant fall in the dollar \u2014 not just against the euro and the yen, but against more volatile currencies like the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.Even the Chinese renminbi, once criticized by Mr. Trump as artificially low, has gained value against the dollar, climbing more than 3 percent for the year.A dollar in retreat means that trillions more dollars are sloshing around the global economy, ending up in 100-year Argentine bonds, Turkish airline stocks, junk bonds with stripped down investor protections and, of course, Dow stalwarts like Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\u201cDollar weakness means that there is increased liquidity all around the world,\u201d said Mr. Lele, the investment officer. \u201cAnd all that is flowing into carry trades.\u201dThe carry trade is financial jargon that describes the flow of money from low return assets to those with a higher return \u2014 not least when investors use a cheaper asset (dollars) to pay for riskier assets that promise better performance.When central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, intervened aggressively in global markets after the financial crisis, the immediate effect was rock bottom interest rates, a weak dollar and a search for \u201ccarry\u201d by global investors.Yet this trade lost some of its urgency in recent years as investors bet that the Fed would raise rates and that Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive fiscal policies would give a boost to the United States economy and the dollar.Instead, Trump administration officials have veered from the standard practice of talking up the dollar by pretty much doing the opposite. This approach was spurred largely by the administration\u2019s tough talk on trade and support for American manufacturers whose exports benefit from a less robust dollar.But it is also true that Mr. Trump, both from within his cabinet and his outside panel of economic advisers, has heard the view from Wall Street that an overly strong dollar would not help American financial markets.Edward Yardeni, an independent investment strategist, refers to the recent run-up in stocks, after what has already been one of the longest bull markets in financial history, as a \u201cmarket melt-up.\u201dThink of it as a rush of perhaps less discerning money into stocks, propelling stock market indexes past one historical milestone after another.For example, as of Monday, the Dow had reached 30 record highs this year, according to research by Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm.In a recent strategy note, Mr. Yardeni highlighted the effect of investor money pouring into exchange traded funds, which are easily traded, low-cost funds that track all varieties of indexes and investment themes.Over the last year, $232 billion has flowed into E.T.F.s that invest in domestic equities. In recent months, as the dollar has softened, global E.T.F.s that invest in Europe and emerging markets have been deluged with money and have taken in $121 billion for the year.Leading the way have been E.T.F.s that invest in higher-yielding, harder-to-trade securities like emerging market bonds, leveraged loans and bonds issued by low-rated corporations.Institutional and retail investors use the funds to make quick and longer term investment bets. But much of the flows, of late, seem to be coming from retail investors, many of whom were sitting on the sidelines in the last few years, analysts say.\u201cRight now, the market thinks the future looks good,\u201d said Peter Mallouk, the founder of Creative Planning, an independent investment adviser managing more than $26 billion out of Leawood, Kan. \u201cCorporate earnings are up, corporate taxes are expected to drop and most importantly, unemployment continues to trend lower.\u201dBeyond the stimulative effect that a struggling dollar has on global investment flows, some analysts point to another, more specific reason that might explain the near perfect correlation between the dollar\u2019s fall and the Dow\u2019s rise.The Dow, much more so than the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, has a weightier concentration in multinationals that rely on exporting their goods overseas, like Caterpillar, Boeing and Coca-Cola, to name a few.The weak dollar and strong growth in Asia, Europe and many emerging markets will be a boon for these companies, a number of which suffered in past years when the dollar was ascendant and worries about Europe and developing nations abounded.\u201cThere is no doubt that the big news \u2014 a drop in the dollar \u2014 is benefiting the Dow more than other indices,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis.\u201cIt has multinationals, and it benefits from improved trade flows. So dollar weakness may propel the Dow to 22,000 and beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These talking points are pure fiction.Rather than cutting immigration, Congress should raise the employment-based quotas, which it has not adjusted since 1990 \u2014 when the United States had some 77 million fewer people and the economy was half the size it is now. A smart reform would double green cards and peg future work visas to economic growth, responding to market forces rather than political whims.Smart reforms, however, require that Congress first understand the basic facts: America has not seen a deluge of immigration. Low-skilled American-born workers have not faced more competition for jobs. Other countries accept more immigrants per capita. Until these facts penetrate the halls of the Capitol, the immigration debate will continue to be mired in ignorant proposals like this.Advertisement"}

Indianapolis, Lost for 72 Years, Is Found in the Pacific", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the 72 years since the Indianapolis, a United States Navy cruiser, sank about 12 minutes after being torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, the disaster has inspired controversy, dozens of books, a play and a famous scene in \u201cJaws.\u201dBut the resting place of the Indianapolis had remained a mystery.Only 316 men were saved after an aviator spotted them by chance.\u201cEven in a great tragedy like this one, there is valor, there is bravery,\u201d Rear Adm. Samuel J. Cox, who has retired from active duty and is director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, said a video posted on Mr. Allen\u2019s website.\u201cThere are also lessons learned, in this case many of them, that need to be preserved and remembered.\u201dThe discovery of the ship\u2019s remains required detective work to get a more accurate location for the Indianapolis when it was struck with two torpedoes from the Japanese submarine.Mr. Allen, whose father fought in World War II, has made a passion of finding and preserving artifacts from the war. His expedition said that the precise location of the Indianapolis would be kept secret from the public, and that the site would be respected as a grave, as American law requires.But as the Indianapolis plowed on in the dark of night, a Japanese submarine spotted it, and just after midnight unleashed six torpedoes, two of which struck the American cruiser. The explosions knocked out the ship\u2019s communications, and the order to abandon ship came only by word of mouth. The ship sank in minutes.For the 800 or so sailors and Marines who made it overboard, another, longer ordeal waited. They plunged into water covered in fuel oil, and many soon began vomiting. They had 12 or so rafts and few supplies, and it was unclear whether the distress messages had gone out before the communications system failed.The water was chilling at night, but the sun baked the clusters of bobbing men during the day, and their drinking water soon ran out. Those who drank seawater succumbed to diarrhea and other illnesses, and men began to suffer collective hallucinations, such as imagining that the Indianapolis was close by, brimming with food and drink.There were also the sharks, which have entered the legend of the Indianapolis, especially through \u201cJaws,\u201d the horror film released in 1975. In that movie, Quint, a fictional grizzled sailor played by Robert Shaw, recalls the attacks, though not entirely accurately.\u201cJaws\u201d helped revive interest in the disaster. But by most accounts, the sharks picked off the dead or near-dead men, though some survivors remembered the terror of the sharks bumping up against them.The floating men would break into prayer when planes buzzed high overhead. But the Navy station where the Indianapolis had been headed did not note the ship\u2019s lateness or send out a search alert, so the planes flew on without noticing. Into the fourth day, it seemed unlikely that the remaining survivors would be rescued.Captain McVay faced a different trauma: a court-martial, in which he was convicted of failing to steer the ship in a precautionary zigzag that may have thwarted the Japanese submarine.\u201cFor more than two decades I\u2019ve been working with the survivors. To a man, they have longed for the day when their ship would be found, solving their final mystery,\u201d Capt. William J. Toti, retired, who acts as a spokesman for survivors of the Indianapolis, said on Mr. Allen\u2019s website. \u201cThey all know this is now a war memorial.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Cohn and Steven Mnuchin. That is making some conservatives nervous.There is also the question of whether their experience in finance is enough to succeed in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington.\u2022 Mr. Mnuchin has made it clear that he has Mr. Trump\u2019s ear and is speaking for him. He is also more careful and more reserved than Mr. Cohn \u2014 and more deferential to lawmakers.The advisers have tried to avoid the mistakes that plagued the effort to repeal and replace the health care law, placing a premium on communicating with key members of Congress.Still, they have yet to produce the kind of comprehensive plan Mr. Trump has promised. And some worry that the men have made little progress.That might seem surprising as Houston is the fourth-largest American city and the center of a metropolitan area with economic output of half a trillion dollars a year. And indeed, the area does face years of rebuilding.And, while it is a macabre form of accounting, the need to repair buildings could create a surge in output.Still, the storm continues to wallop the Gulf Coast and it is too early to say that the economy is in the clear. But so far, the human damage is the greatest.Worth noting: Day traders have been pouring into the most arcane corners of markets, betting on whether the VIX, or the so-called fear gauge, will rise or fall.These wagers on expected volatility have traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors. But since the financial crisis, investment banks have offered VIX-linked products for purchase on the stock exchange, much like buying shares in IBM or Microsoft.But are all the investors aware of what they are getting into?\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d said Robert E. Whaley, a financial professor at Vanderbilt University known as the father of the VIX for his work on developing it. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201d\u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was.

In the case of voting, open-source software systems would be overseen by public-private partnerships between counties and vendors.Open-source systems are tried and tested. A majority of supercomputers use them. The Defense Department, NASA and the United States Air Force all use open-source systems, because they know this provides far more security. Every step in our voting process should use software that follows these examples.Despite its name, open-source software is less vulnerable to hacking than the secret, black box systems like those being used in polling places now. That\u2019s because anyone can see how open-source systems operate. Bugs can be spotted and remedied, deterring those who would attempt attacks. This makes them much more secure than closed-source models like Microsoft\u2019s, which only Microsoft employees can get into to fix.One reason for the software companies\u2019 resistance is the belief that it\u2019s impossible to make a profit from open-source software. This is a myth. Businesses that use open-source software still need all of the other things that software companies provide. Many major companies use open-source software in their products.If the community of proprietary vendors, including Microsoft, would support the use of open-source model for elections, we could expedite progress toward secure voting systems.With an election on the horizon, it\u2019s urgent that we ensure that those who seek to make our voting systems more secure have easy access to them, and that Mr. Putin does not.R.

They were not particularly welcomed in America, and were broke.\u201cEvery one of us cousins had a chip on our shoulders, having lost everything to the new Iranian government,\u201d said Hadi Partovi, a cousin of Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s. \u201cWe had a desire to build anew as entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi, 48, is on the threshold of becoming one of the world\u2019s most prominent entrepreneurs. On Sunday night, he was selected to be chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing company that is the world\u2019s most valuable start-up. The deal is almost official, according to the travel reservations site Expedia, which Mr. Khosrowshahi currently runs.His task will be to repair the internal culture, which had moved beyond gung-ho start-up to a company known for its divisiveness and tolerance for harassment. He will have to build Uber\u2019s business while preparing it for a self-driving future that competitors hope to dominate themselves. Sooner or later he will likely take Uber public.There is also the wild card of Mr. Kalanick, who might seize on any trouble to mount a comeback. And finally, he will have to manage all this under a much brighter spotlight than he has worked under before.Mr. Khosrowshahi was a long-shot candidate whose name did not become public until he had the job. Expedia is based in Bellevue, Wash., which makes him a Silicon Valley outsider. He had not commented on his new job as of Monday afternoon.His parents, Lili and Gary (short for Asghar) Khosrowshahi, were prosperous members of the Iranian elite in the 1960s and 1970s. Gary was an executive at an industrial conglomerate, where he worked with relatives. They fled as the government of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi collapsed.Four years later, Gary went back to Iran to take care of his ailing father, and he was detained for six years before he could return. Lili raised three children alone.\u201cHis mom raised him to be direct with people,\u201d said Mr. Partovi, the cousin. \u201cBy far the biggest challenge he faced, which is what all of us faced, was having to come to a new country and assimilate. Being an Iranian in America in the 1980s was not pleasant. People were singing \u2018Bomb bomb bomb Iran.\u2019 \u201dBut the tense environment also pushed them to succeed.Mr. Partovi and his twin brother Ali were early investors in Facebook, Dropbox, Airbnb and, as it happens, Uber; Dara\u2019s brother, Kaveh Khosrowshahi, is a managing director at the investment firm Allen & Company; another cousin, Farzad \u201cFuzzy\u201d Khosrowshahi, played a major role in the creation of Google Docs; yet another cousin, Amir Khosrowshahi, is an executive at Intel; and Avid Larizadeh Duggan, also a cousin, is a general partner at Google Ventures.Mr. Khosrowshahi, in addition to running Expedia since 2005, joined the board of The New York Times Company in 2015.His route to success took him to the investment firm of Allen & Company, where he spent most of the 1990s as an analyst. Barry Diller was a client, and Mr. Khosrowshahi eventually went to work for the media mogul.In 2001, Mr. Diller acquired Expedia, a travel booking site founded by Microsoft. Four years later, Mr. Khosrowshahi became Expedia\u2019s chief executive. The site has flourished, acquiring three major competitors in 2015 alone. Shares in the company, which is now publicly traded, have risen 35 percent over the last year, despite competition from Priceline on one flank and Airbnb on another.\u201cIf Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing \u2014 he\u2019s devoted 12 great years to building this company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes,\u201d Mr. Diller said in a note to Expedia employees on Monday.Uber, like Expedia a decade ago, has enormous promise but also faces enormous challenges. Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s supporters believe he can fix the problems.\u201cHe\u2019s a global travel executive \u2014 he understands competitive dynamics, geopolitical challenges, and the operating challenges of running a sprawling global travel company,\u201d said Brad Gerstner, founder of Altimeter Capital, an investor in Uber as well as Expedia.Under Mr. Kalanick, some Uber executives were considered untouchable, which contributed to a poisonous atmosphere. Shana Fisher, who worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi at Mr. Diller\u2019s IAC and is now a venture capitalist, said, \u201cPeople don\u2019t get an excuse with Dara. They have to be good and good. Good and good. He doesn\u2019t have tolerance for less than that.\u201dMr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s experiences as an immigrant gave him a personal perspective on the executive order that President Trump signed restricting travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries this year.Expedia, along with Amazon, gave early support to a lawsuit filed by Washington State\u2019s attorney general objecting to the travel ban. Around the same time, Mr. Khosrowshahi described his early experience as an immigrant in an email to employees.\u201cWe sure didn\u2019t feel like refugees, but in hindsight I guess we were \u2014 my father and mother left everything behind to come here \u2014 to be safe and give their boys a chance to rebuild a life,\u201d he wrote.Nick Wingfield contributed reporting from Berwyn, Pa.Advertisement"}

Now, the companies are in a very public fight.The lawsuit came as a surprise to Uber\u2019s directors, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.The battle has caused other technology investors to question Benchmark\u2019s tactics.The new Silicon Valley may be in China.Alibaba and Tencent are among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, with market capitalizations twice as big as the longtime tech leaders Intel, Cisco and IBM.They have joined an elite club of tech companies worth $400 billion and up that has been dominated by American businesses: Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.\u201cWe\u2019ve come to the point where China has finally caught up with the U.S. in the internet space,\u201d said Hans Tung, a managing partner at the venture capital firm GGV Capital.Alibaba and Tencent have grown to prominence by dominating e-commerce and online life in China, the world\u2019s largest internet market. Their growth has come as Western companies, such as Facebook, have been blocked by the country\u2019s tight internet controls.This week, Alibaba and Tencent reported financial results that were well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations and point to the growing influence of technology on the Chinese economy.Tencent is expected to soon become the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than a billion users, while Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. The Chinese companies\u2019 revenue also grew at a faster pace in the past three months than at Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.These included Jack Welch, the retired leader of General Electric, and W. James McNerney Jr., the former head of Boeing, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak about it.Their reasoning was a combination of patriotism and the hopes of salvaging a pro-business agenda.They did not succeed in persuading their peers, and the council disbanded in protest over comments by President Trump equating the actions of far-right hate groups with protesters opposing them, after a violent confrontation in Charlottesville, Va.The episode has highlighted the varied approach companies have taken in response, and the outside pressures leaders of public companies face.\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}

Then He Was Arrested.", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarcus Hutchins, the researcher, was widely praised for identifying a way to disable the WannaCry malicious software, or malware, attack that seized hundreds of thousands of computers this year. Researchers credited Mr. Hutchins\u2019s discovery of a so-called kill switch in the malware for stopping its spread and preventing the attack from infecting millions more computers.According to an indictment filed in federal court in Milwaukee that was unsealed on Thursday, Mr. Hutchins, 23, and an unidentified accomplice conspired to create and sell malware intended to steal login information and other financial data from online banking sites.Mr. Hutchins created the software and his accomplice offered to sell the program, known as the Kronos banking Trojan, for $3,000 on an internet forum, the indictment said. The accomplice sold a version of the Kronos malware for $2,000 in June 2015. The indictment did not include details on how widely that malware was used, or much specific evidence of Mr. Hutchins\u2019s involvement.The Justice Department said in a statement that a federal grand jury returned a six-count indictment against Mr. Hutchins last month after a two-year investigation. It said that the Kronos malware was built to \u201charvest and transfer\u201d user names and passwords from banking websites from an infected computer. Kronos, according to the Justice Department\u2019s statement, has been configured to strike banking systems in a number of countries, including Canada, Germany, Poland, France and the United Kingdom.When the Kronos malware was first advertised in underground Russian forums in 2014, the asking price of $7,000 indicated that the selling of malware was a lucrative business. Kronos was promoted as a hacking tool that could retrieve data including user names and passwords, A.T.M. PINs, and personal information useful in cracking security questions.The security community reacted with surprise and skepticism over the arrest of one of its well-regarded stars. Some warned that claims against Mr. Hutchins could strain the relationship between \u201cwhite hat\u201d hackers \u2014 researchers who look for software vulnerabilities to spot problems and fix them, rather than to commit a crime or sow chaos \u2014 and law enforcement.While the exact circumstances of Mr. Hutchins\u2019s involvement with the Kronos malware were unclear, security researchers have often skirted legal trouble while looking for vulnerabilities in computer code. In recent years, big tech companies have created \u201cbug bounties\u201d to formalize a process for researchers to report problems and to be compensated for their work.The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights organization, said in a statement that it was concerned about the arrest of Mr. Hutchins and was looking into the matter.The WannaCry ransomware infected computers running older versions of Microsoft Windows. Once spread, the software encrypted computers and locked users out of files, folders and drives. If an affected machine was connected to a network, other computers on the network could become infected as well. The attackers demanded that victims pay hundreds of dollars to a Bitcoin address.Mr. Hutchins, who works as a researcher for Kryptos Logic, a Los Angeles-based cybersecurity firm, said in the interview that he had skipped going to college and taught himself how to write software. The company did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Hutchins tried to remain anonymous, communicating with the media through his handle MalwareTech, but British tabloids revealed his identity. He was celebrated in the cybersecurity community for his achievement, winning a special recognition award at an SC Awards Europe industry event.An article on Friday about the arrest of a British security researcher misstated the year in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested a Russian encryption expert in his Las Vegas hotel room.

Twitter would not say how many accounts were addressed and declined to comment on Mr. Shapira\u2019s protest.\u201cWe continue to review and iterate on our policies and their enforcement,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.Starting in October, social media companies operating in Germany could face fines as high as 50 million euros, or nearly $59 million, if they do not respond to requests to remove illegal, racist or slanderous comments and posts within 24 hours of being notified.\u201cI can\u2019t see how Twitter is going to be able to do that,\u201d Mr. Shapira said. More than two days after his video was posted online, and weeks after he first reported the offending tweets, many of the messages remain on the site, he said. Others, however, have either been blocked in Germany or been removed entirely.With Twitter increasingly seen as a virtual free public space, Mr. Shapira\u2019s actions and Germany\u2019s new law have raised questions surrounding the role of private companies and to what extent they alone should be responsible for policing hate speech.Mr. Shapira said he also reported about 150 similar examples of hate on Facebook, 80 percent of which were removed within three days, he said.In its statement, Twitter stressed its policy of notifying users of the status of requests to remove hateful content. But Mr. Shapira said he had been left in the dark about many of his requests.\u201cI was hoping I could have real numbers at the end of this, but I have none because Twitter is so not transparent about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to say without exact numbers, but all I know was that there were too many that weren\u2019t taken care of.\u201dIn June, German police officers in 14 states raided the homes of 36 people accused of posting hateful social media messages, with most of the raids concerning politically motivated right-wing statements, including threats, coercion and incitement to racism.A study published in June by the executive arm of the European Union found that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft reviewed more than half of reports of hate speech within 24 hours, and that 60 percent of the messages were removed \u2014 up from just 28 percent in December. The E.U. study noted that all of the companies in question had improved their response rate.Unlike their digital inspiration, many of the messages sprayed on the sidewalk closest to the entrance to the Twitter offices were removed by a street cleaner several hours after Mr. Shapira painted them. Others remained visible awhile longer.\u201cYes, it\u2019s just words on Twitter, but if you post this on Twitter and you see there is no resistance and they let it stand, you will do it again,\u201d Mr. Shapira said. \u201cEventually you are not going to just post it on Twitter; you might actually go and do those things.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And Microsoft Agrees.", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "In an unusual partnership, Amazon and Microsoft are working together to extend the abilities of their voice-controlled digital assistants.Supported bySEATTLE \u2014 The crowded pack of voice-controlled digital assistants \u2014 Apple\u2019s Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana \u2014 are good at numerous things. They can help people play music, set up calendar appointments and check the weather.They can even get two rival tech executives, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Satya Nadella of Microsoft, to join hands in a rare partnership.For the past year, the two companies have been coordinating behind the scenes to make Alexa and Cortana communicate with each other. The partnership, which the companies plan to announce early Wednesday, will allow people to summon Cortana using Alexa, and vice versa, by the end of the year.It is unusual for big tech companies to cooperate on important new technologies that they want to stand out from the competition. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and nearly every other big tech company is pouring huge amounts of money into making digital assistants that are smarter and can do more, seeing them as a new way for people to interact naturally with devices and online services.But Mr. Bezos and Mr. Nadella are concerned that keeping assistants from working together could hold them back. The way they see it, each assistant has unique strengths that could benefit the other assistants.In an interview last Friday at one of Amazon\u2019s Seattle high-rises, Mr. Bezos predicted that over time people would turn to different digital assistants \u2014 also called \u201cA.I.s,\u201d for artificial intelligence \u2014 the same way they turn to one friend for advice about hiking and another for restaurant recommendations.\u201cI want them to have access to as many of those A.I.s as possible.\u201d Mr. Bezos said.As an example, Mr. Bezos cited Cortana's superior integration with Outlook, the popular calendar and email application that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software. Because Microsoft controls both products, Outlook is integrated more deeply with Cortana than with other voice assistants. Through its collaboration with Microsoft, Amazon said, Alexa users will get answers to some of the same questions that Cortana can now answer \u2014 for instance, when is the next budget review with the boss?Initially, getting the two systems to work together is going to be a little awkward. Someone working with an Alexa device will have to say \u201cAlexa, Open Cortana\u201d followed by their command, while someone starting with a Cortana machine will have to say \u201cCortana, Open Alexa.\u201dThe Amazon-Microsoft partnership started in May 2016, when Mr. Bezos raised the idea with Mr. Nadella at Microsoft\u2019s CEO Summit, an annual event for business leaders in the Seattle area. Mr. Nadella was receptive to the idea, so a short while later Mr. Bezos emailed a draft of a brief news release that described how their assistants would work together, both men said.It is standard at Amazon to create such news releases for internal consumption as part of what Mr. Bezos calls the company\u2019s \u201cworking backward process.\u201d Through that exercise, Amazon\u2019s teams depict in writing how a new product or service will look to its customers before engineers write a line of code.In a phone interview, Mr. Nadella compared digital assistants like Cortana and Alexa to competing web browsers that provide access to the same pools of online information. \u201cThe personality and expertise of each one will be such that if they interoperated, the user will get more out of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat resonated for me and for him, and then that\u2019s what led to the teams working.\u201dMr. Bezos said he had not reached out to Apple or Google to invite them to join in the effort and does not know if they would want to.\u201cI\u2019d welcome it,\u201d he said.\u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll be inspired by it,\u201d Mr. Nadella said. \u201cAt least that would be my hope.\u201dAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment, while a Google spokeswoman did not return a request for comment.Apple and Google may see competitive advantages in keeping their A.I.s separate from rival assistants, partly as a way to protect a selling point of their mobile software, iOS and Android. Apple is especially finnicky about wanting to control as much as it can of people\u2019s experiences with its iPhones and iPads.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason Google or Apple would offer it because they\u2019re trying to drive their own ecosystems,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, a technology research firm.By contrast, Alexa is mostly used on Echo speakers that sit around a home, and Cortana is largely used on PCs. Amazon says it has sold millions of Echo devices, accounting for around 70 percent of the market for smart speakers, according eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft says there are 145 million active monthly users of Cortana through Windows 10.The two companies have struggled in the smartphone business, which makes it hard to get people using Alexa and Cortana outside homes and offices. Amazon and Microsoft are cutting deals with carmakers to integrate their assistants directly into vehicles. While Amazon and Microsoft have released digital assistant apps for mobile devices running Google and Apple software, the apps are not as widespread and using them is usually not as effortless as the ones Apple and Google build into their devices.Eventually, Mr. Bezos predicted, the primary assistant on a device will be smart enough to automatically route a person\u2019s request to whichever assistant is best equipped to answer, without needing a verbal introduction between the two.\u201cIn my view of the world, because that would be best for the customer, that\u2019s probably what eventually happens,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Apple Is Experiencing Another Growth Spurt", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At 41 years old, Apple is a respected elder of the tech industry. But rather than easing slowly into retirement, the company is going through another growth spurt.\u201cThis handful of companies is writing the operating system for the new economy,\u201d said Brad Slingerlend, lead portfolio manager of Janus Henderson\u2019s global technology fund. \u201cThe bigger companies are both able to collect data and use that data to build into adjacent businesses.\u201dFor Apple, which is far more dependent on hardware sales than other tech leaders, the recent performance is all the more impressive after its dismal 2016, when quarterly revenue fell for the first time in 13 years and the company\u2019s sales in China dropped through the floor.In the most recent quarter, which ended July 1, Apple actually sold 2 percent more iPhones than it did during the same period last year, defying the usual sales slump that occurs before its new phones are introduced. The business in China stabilized.The iPad, a product line that was collapsing amid the rise of big-screen smartphones, rebounded, with the number of tablets sold increasing 15 percent as Apple cut prices at the low end and added features at the high end. The company\u2019s redesigned iMacs and MacBook Pros also gained market share in the slowly declining personal computer industry.In a harbinger of the company\u2019s future, digital services \u2014 the App Store, iCloud, movie and music downloads, and the Apple Music streaming service \u2014 have become the second most important category for the company, growing 22 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter. With 1.2 billion iPhones sold and millions of new customers joining the iPhone ecosystem each year, Apple is in a position to increase its income from services much faster than from accessories like the Watch.\u201cWall Street is waking up to the reality that the next great product might not be an Apple car or the TV or the Watch,\u201d said Trip Miller of Gullane Capital Partners, which loaded up on Apple shares when they were below $100. \u201cThe services business is the next great product.\u201dMr. Miller, who also owns stock in Alphabet and Amazon, said that part of what makes these companies so powerful is their strong balance sheets, with seemingly limitless cash and borrowing capacity. That has allowed Alphabet to slowly build YouTube\u2019s advertising business and move into self-driving cars.Even Facebook, which could sell more ads on its social network than it is willing to put into the news feed, is generating so much cash that it can afford to slowly increase ads on Instagram and its Messenger network while absorbing losses from its Oculus virtual reality business.Apple\u2019s sales have tended to be more cyclical, with big upgrades to its iPhones typically occurring every two years. The company is a year behind schedule this time, with its last major update in 2014. That has investors excited about the potential for a large spike in demand when the new phones come out this fall.\u201cAny product they release this year would be successful. There is pent-up replacement demand,\u201d said Amit Daryanani, a hardware analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \u201cMost of us are modeling 11 to 12 percent revenue growth in 2018, a super cycle.\u201dBut he said such growth is unlikely to continue in 2019, when excitement about the new iPhones has faded.Still, Apple\u2019s financial heft is likely to get it through any rough patches. It had $45 billion in revenue last quarter and is now sitting on $262 billion in cash and marketable securities.The risk is that customers decide to move on from the decade-old iPhone. Apple\u2019s new high-end phone, for example, is expected to cost more than $1,000, which could turn many away. And a technical flaw, like the burning batteries in Samsung\u2019s Note 7 phones last year, could prompt a costly recall.\u201cIf that happened to the iPhone, that would be devastating,\u201d Mr. Slingerlend said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Tax Plan May Free Up Corporate Dollars, but Then What?", "Date": "2017-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd as Mr. Trump prepares to outline his corporate tax overhaul ideas in a speech on Wednesday in Springfield, Mo., economists and tax experts warn that the path is likely to be treacherous.A pro-growth tax policy would presumably aim not only to reach profits kept abroad as a tax dodge, but also to encourage companies to use that money to expand their business and hire more workers.\u201cRepatriation has little effect on real investment in the United States,\u201d said Alan Viard, a tax expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.That\u2019s because repatriation is not really about geography. Most of the money is not stashed in some underground vault overseas, but already in American financial institutions and capital markets. Repatriation is in effect a legal category that requires a company to book the money in the United States \u2014 and pay taxes on it \u2014 before it can be distributed to shareholders or invested domestically.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that giving them an even higher share of profits, or a windfall, is going to lead to extra investment,\u201d she said.A recent survey of business leaders by the international accounting and advisory firm Friedman, for example, found that just 23 percent would reinvest repatriated funds. Most would use the money to pay dividends or engage in share buybacks.\u201cAnd we have low average rates\u201d \u2014 because of all the loopholes \u2014 \u201cwhich indicate that we\u2019re not collecting as much as we used to, given the very high level of corporate profits.\u201dThe crucial questions are how to pay for a lower rate and how to prevent abuses. Corporate tax cuts that lead to huge deficits could hobble the economy. And a territorial system without sufficient safeguards could end up encouraging even more businesses to shift profits, operations and jobs to countries with lower tax rates.Mr. Gardner argued that a broader definition of American competitiveness is needed that includes not only the tax system, but also the business infrastructure that the tax system supports \u2014 bridges and roads, health care, education and research and development. \u201cIf all you think about is the tax rate, then it should be zero,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetitiveness is about finding the right balance.\u201dThe damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey on Texas \u2014 which Mr. Trump has promised to help address with federal money \u2014 shows how quickly new budget demands can materialize.In general, though, Mr. Stiglitz argued that the link between tax cuts and economic growth is vastly overstated. \u201cThere is no evidence that cutting the tax rates stimulates more investment,\u201d he said.\u201cGrowth is low because labor force growth is slow,\u201d and it is only going to grow slower because of immigration restrictions, he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not investing in education and research, which is why productivity is slow. The notion that changing taxes is going to lead to a growth spurt is pure nonsense.\u201dFollow Patricia Cohen on Twitter: @patcohenNYTAdvertisement"}

After a day spent writing computer code inside a lab run by the Department of Energy, he would take the stage at a local juke joint, playing what he calls \u201cpunk-influenced bluegrass\u201d \u2014 \u201cJohnny Rotten crossed with Johnny Cash.\u201d But what he really wanted to do was combine his days and nights, and build machines that could make their own songs. \u201cMy only goal in life was to mix A.I. and music,\u201d Mr. Eck said.\u201cIt\u2019s about creating new ways for people to communicate,\u201d he said during a recent interview inside the small two-story building here that serves as headquarters for Google A.I. research.The project is part of a growing effort to generate art through a set of A.I. techniques that have only recently come of age. Called deep neural networks, these complex mathematical systems allow machines to learn specific behavior by analyzing vast amounts of data. By looking for common patterns in millions of bicycle photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a bike. This is how Facebook identifies faces in online photos, how Android phones recognize commands spoken into phones, and how Microsoft Skype translates one language into another. But these complex systems can also create art. By analyzing a set of songs, for instance, they can learn to build similar sounds.As Mr. Eck says, these systems are at least approaching the point \u2014 still many, many years away \u2014 when a machine can instantly build a new Beatles song or perhaps trillions of new Beatles songs, each sounding a lot like the music the Beatles themselves recorded, but also a little different. But that end game \u2014 as much a way of undermining art as creating it \u2014 is not what he is after. There are so many other paths to explore beyond mere mimicry. The ultimate idea is not to replace artists but to give them tools that allow them to create in entirely new ways.Much as a neural network can learn to identify a cat by analyzing hundreds of cat photos, it can learn the musical characteristics of a bassoon by analyzing hundreds of notes. It creates a mathematical representation, or vector, that identifies a bassoon. So, Mr. Eck and his team have fed notes from hundreds of instruments into a neural network, building a vector for each one. Now, simply by moving a button across a screen, they can combine these vectors to create new instruments. One may be 47 percent bassoon and 53 percent clavichord. Another might switch the percentages. And so on.For centuries, orchestral conductors have layered sounds from various instruments atop one other. But this is different. Rather than layering sounds, Mr. Eck and his team are combining them to form something that didn\u2019t exist before, creating new ways that artists can work. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next film camera,\u201d Mr. Eck said. \u201cWe\u2019re making the next electric guitar.\u201dThe tools are new, but the attitude is not. Allison Parrish, a New York University professor who builds software that generates poetry, points out that artists have been using computers to generate art since the 1950s. \u201cMuch like as Jackson Pollock figured out a new way to paint by just opening the paint can and splashing it on the canvas beneath him,\u201d she said, \u201cthese new computational techniques create a broader palette for artists.\u201dA year ago, David Ha was a trader with Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. During his lunch breaks he started toying with neural networks and posting the results to a blog under a pseudonym. Among other things, he built a neural network that learned to write its own Kanji, the logographic Chinese characters that are not so much written as drawn.Then, you ask them to, say, draw a pig with a cat\u2019s head, or to visually subtract a foot from a horse or sketch a truck that looks like a dog or build a boat from a few random squiggly lines. Next to NSynth or DeepDream, these may seem less like tools that artists will use to build new works. But if you play with them, you realize that they are themselves art, living works built by Mr. Ha. A.I. isn\u2019t just creating new kinds of art; it\u2019s creating new kinds of artists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Teaches Autonomous Gliders to Make Decisions on the Fly", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAWTHORNE, Nev. \u2014 As the glider turned and flew south, four men gave chase in a sport utility vehicle below, rolling through the Nevada desert.Soon, the glider took another turn. It gently circled an invisible column of rising hot air while climbing slowly skyward. \u201cIt\u2019s soaring,\u201d Mr. Kapoor said, pointing at the glider as it spiraled higher and higher on a stream of warm air. \u201cIt found a thermal.\u201dLast week, in the desert valley surrounding Hawthorne, Nev., 130 miles south of Reno, Mr. Kapoor and his fellow Microsoft researchers tested two gliders designed to navigate the skies on their own. Guided by computer algorithms that learned from onboard sensors, predicted air patterns and planned a route forward, these gliders could seek out thermals \u2014 columns of rising hot air \u2014 and use them to stay aloft.Led by Mr. Kapoor, who is an artificial intelligence researcher and a licensed pilot, the project was part of a growing effort to build aircraft, automobiles and other machines that can make decisions on their own when faced with uncertainty \u2014 an essential skill for any machine trying to navigate the world on its own.But that only gets them so far. To navigate the world on their own, they must also mimic the way humans intuitively predict what will happen next and adjust their behavior accordingly. Projects like those at Microsoft, Google and Berkeley are reaching in that direction.It was also a way of pushing the boundaries of the mathematical techniques that control a machine in a relatively safe but still very real environment. \u201cWith a glider, you can test these algorithms with minimal risk to people and property,\u201d Mr. Kochenderfer said.In building their algorithms, Mr. Kapoor and his team relied on techniques that date back decades \u2014 something called Markov decision processes. Essentially, this is a way of identifying and responding to uncertainty.The approach is like the one you take when looking for change in a backpack crammed with random stuff. If you just stick your hand in the bag and start rummaging around, you face enormous uncertainty. You don\u2019t know where to grab. But if, first, you remove the larger items like books and pencils that you know aren\u2019t coins, the change falls to the bottom and the task gets easier. That is what Microsoft\u2019s algorithms do \u2014 in a mathematical sense. They work to limit uncertainty, to reduce the scope of the problem.When he joined Microsoft\u2019s research group four years ago, Mr. Kolobov fed these ideas into the company\u2019s Windows operating system and its Bing search engine. Back then, he was dealing with uncertainty in the digital world. Now, he\u2019s applying them in the physical world. \u201cThe number of applications where these methods are used is growing,\u201d Mr. Kolobov said.In the Nevada desert, the team launched its two gliders with help from a hand-held remote control. Once airborne, the gliders \u2014 or sailplanes \u2014 were left to their own devices. They were forced to fly with help from the wind and other air patterns.Through those onboard algorithms, the gliders could analyze what was happening around them and then change directions as need be. They could learn from their environment, and although they could never be completely sure what would happen next, they could at least make educated guesses. Because it is dependent on phenomenon it has no control over, the glider must reason and plan in advance, Mr. Kolobov said.The gliders planned their own paths to locations that could provide lift, and then they worked to exploit this lift, to ride those columns of rising air. When Mr. Kapoor pointed skyward from his Jeep, this is what happened. The math worked.Still, these aircraft were far from perfect. Using a fiberglass glider with a 16-foot wingspan, the team hoped to set a record for autonomous flight time by a sailplane \u2014 more than five hours aloft. But after two days of trial and error, thanks to problems with radios and other equipment, that didn\u2019t happen.That researchers can improve on these sorts of learning algorithms has become an imperative to improving autonomous vehicles. To navigate the real world on their own, machines must mimic the way humans intuitively plan for their next action and deal with events they\u2019ve never before experienced.\u201cThe core problem for robotics is uncertainty,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a professor at University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThis is what differentiates robotics from a game like Go or chess.\u201dThat\u2019s the big reason Microsoft is building autonomous gliders. As Mr. Kolobov put it: \u201cThe A.I. systems of tomorrow will face all the same challenges.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Smartphone\u2019s Future: It\u2019s All About the Camera", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 We all know the drill. For the last decade, smartphones have gotten thinner and faster and thinner and faster and, well, you get the picture.But it\u2019s too soon to write off our smartphones as boring. The gadgets are still evolving with new technologies. And for a clue as to what the smartphone of the future might look like, turn your attention to the device\u2019s cameras and the software and sensors that make them tick.Here\u2019s a peek into how the camera may come into play: As soon as you pick up your gadget, it will see you and know you are the owner and unlock the screen. Overseas, you will be able to point the camera at a restaurant menu to translate items into your native language. When shopping for furniture, you can point your phone camera at your living room floor and place a virtual rendering of a coffee table down to see how it looks and move around and peek underneath it.Some of this futurism is already starting to happen.\u201c2018 will be the year where the smartphone camera takes a quantum leap in technology,\u201d said Philip-James Jacobowitz, a product manager for Qualcomm, a chip maker that provides components to smartphone makers.Mr. Jacobowitz added that emerging camera technologies would be the key to stronger security features and applications for so-called augmented reality, which uses data to digitally manipulate the physical world when people look through a smartphone lens.Here\u2019s a rundown on what this all means for how your next smartphone will work.For the last few years, we have become accustomed to unlocking our smartphones by scanning our fingerprints or entering a passcode. But when Apple shows its new iPhones next month, including a premium model with a starting price of $999, the company will introduce infrared facial recognition as a new method for unlocking the device.How would the new iPhone do that exactly? Apple declined to comment. But Qualcomm\u2019s Spectra, a so-called depth-sensing camera system, is one example of how face scanning works.The Spectra system includes a module that sprays an object with infrared dots to gather information about the depth of an object based on the size and the contortion of the dots. If the dots are smaller, then the object is farther away; if they are bigger, the object is closer. The imaging system can then stitch the patterns into a detailed 3-D image of your face to determine if you are indeed the owner of your smartphone before unlocking it.\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the contours of the head \u2014 it\u2019s not just the front of the face as you\u2019re typically thinking about,\u201d said Sy Choudhury, a senior director of product security for Qualcomm.Because of the uniqueness of a person\u2019s head shape, the likelihood of bypassing facial recognition with the incorrect face is 1 in a million, he added. That compares with a false acceptance rate of 1 in 100 for previous facial recognition systems, which had very poor security.There are, however, limitations to infrared-scanning technologies. For example, objects that you wear, like a hat or a scarf, might throw off the camera, according to Qualcomm. In addition, experts said infrared light can get drowned out by bright sunlight outdoors, so face scanning might work less reliably on the beach.It remains to be seen how exactly face scanning will work in the next iPhone. But Apple is well acquainted with depth-sensing camera technologies. In 2013, the iPhone maker acquired PrimeSense, a company that developed sensors for Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, a depth-sensing camera system that let Xbox players control games using body movements. Analysts expect some rendition of PrimeSense\u2019s technology to appear in future iPhones.Depth-sensing cameras may be crucial to enhancing augmented reality, a jargony industry term that probably makes your eyes glaze over. But bear with me for one moment: Augmented reality will have major implications for future mobile apps.It\u2019s no secret that Apple is bullish about augmented reality. In a recent financial earnings call, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called augmented reality \u201cbig and profound,\u201d with major implications for gaming, entertainment and business products. This fall, Apple will release iOS 11, its next mobile operating system that includes support for applications made with ARKit, a tool kit for app developers to easily create augmented-reality applications.ARKit uses a combination of the iPhone\u2019s camera and motion sensors, including the accelerometer and gyroscope, to let people lay digital objects on top of the real world and interact with them with precise movements.I got a demo of ARKit from Ikea, the furniture maker, with its coming app Ikea Place. I placed an Ikea bed on the floor and was able to move around and look underneath it. This type of application would be useful for getting a sense of how an item looks and fits alongside other furniture in a space before placing an order.\u201cThis is like a real application that real people can use to make real-life decisions,\u201d said Michael Valdsgaard, the head of digital transformation at Ikea.But the limitations of the Ikea Place app underscore what\u2019s missing from ARKit. For placing virtual objects, the app can detect horizontal surfaces, like a table surface or the ground, but it cannot yet detect walls.Vertical planes like walls are trickier to detect because they are not as smooth as floors \u2014 with doors, windows and picture frames getting in your way. Depth-sensing cameras make wall detection much easier for future iPhones, said Blair MacIntyre, a research scientist who is working on augmented reality for Mozilla, the organization that makes the Firefox web browser.Mr. MacIntyre said augmented reality has huge potential when it matures. He envisioned people being able to take a tour of a natural-history museum, pointing their smartphone cameras at a fossil exhibit to bring a dinosaur back to life.But he said that augmented reality on smartphones was a stopgap to the inevitable: wearing data in front of your face at all times through some kind of headset.\u201cIf you look at science fiction, a lot of it has this characteristic of being always on and serendipitous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a lot closer to that when you get a head-mounted display.\u201dUntil that happens, smartphones are about to become much smarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Ukraine, a Malware Expert Who Could Blow the Whistle on Russian Hacking", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 The hacker, known only by his online alias \u201cProfexer,\u201d kept a low profile. He wrote computer code alone in an apartment and quietly sold his handiwork on the anonymous portion of the internet known as the dark web. Last winter, he suddenly went dark entirely.Profexer\u2019s posts, already accessible only to a small band of fellow hackers and cybercriminals looking for software tips, blinked out in January \u2014 just days after American intelligence agencies publicly identified a program he had written as one tool used in Russian hacking in the United States. American intelligence agencies have determined Russian hackers were behind the electronic break-in of the Democratic National Committee.But while Profexer\u2019s online persona vanished, a flesh-and-blood person has emerged: a fearful man who the Ukrainian police said turned himself in early this year, and has now become a witness for the F.B.I.\u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d he wrote in one of his last messages posted on a restricted-access website before going to the police. \u201cIt won\u2019t be pleasant. But I\u2019m still alive.\u201dIt is the first known instance of a living witness emerging from the arid mass of technical detail that has so far shaped the investigation into the election hacking and the heated debate it has stirred. The Ukrainian police declined to divulge the man\u2019s name or other details, other than that he is living in Ukraine and has not been arrested.There is no evidence that Profexer worked, at least knowingly, for Russia\u2019s intelligence services, but his malware apparently did.That a hacking operation that Washington is convinced was orchestrated by Moscow would obtain malware from a source in Ukraine \u2014 perhaps the Kremlin\u2019s most bitter enemy \u2014 sheds considerable light on the Russian security services\u2019 modus operandi in what Western intelligence agencies say is their clandestine cyberwar against the United States and Europe.It does not suggest a compact team of government employees who write all their own code and carry out attacks during office hours in Moscow or St. Petersburg, but rather a far looser enterprise that draws on talent and hacking tools wherever they can be found.Also emerging from Ukraine is a sharper picture of what the United States believes is a Russian government hacking group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28 or Fancy Bear. It is this group, which American intelligence agencies believe is operated by Russian military intelligence, that has been blamed, along with a second Russian outfit known as Cozy Bear, for the D.N.C. intrusion.Rather than training, arming and deploying hackers to carry out a specific mission like just another military unit, Fancy Bear and its twin Cozy Bear have operated more as centers for organization and financing; much of the hard work like coding is outsourced to private and often crime-tainted vendors.In more than a decade of tracking suspected Russian-directed cyberattacks against a host of targets in the West and in former Soviet territories \u2014 NATO, electrical grids, research groups, journalists critical of Russia and political parties, to name a few \u2014 security services around the world have identified only a handful of people who are directly involved in either carrying out such attacks or providing the cyberweapons that were used.This absence of reliable witnesses has left ample room for President Trump and others to raise doubts about whether Russia really was involved in the D.N.C. hack.\u201cThere is not now and never has been a single piece of technical evidence produced that connects the malware used in the D.N.C. attack to the G.R.U., F.S.B. or any agency of the Russian government,\u201d said Jeffrey Carr, the author of a book on cyberwarfare. The G.R.U. is Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and the F.S.B. its federal security service.United States intelligence agencies, however, have been unequivocal in pointing a finger at Russia.Seeking a path out of this fog, cybersecurity researchers and Western law enforcement officers have turned to Ukraine, a country that Russia has used for years as a laboratory for a range of politicized operations that later cropped up elsewhere, including electoral hacking in the United States.In several instances, certain types of computer intrusions, like the use of malware to knock out crucial infrastructure or to pilfer email messages later released to tilt public opinion, occurred in Ukraine first. Only later were the same techniques used in Western Europe and the United States.So, not surprisingly, those studying cyberwar in Ukraine are now turning up clues in the investigation of the D.N.C. break-in and related hacking, including the discovery of a rare witness.Security experts were initially left scratching their heads when the Department of Homeland Security on Dec. 29 released technical evidence of Russian hacking that seemed to point not to Russia, but rather to Ukraine.He had made it available to download, free, from a website that asked only for donations, ranging from $3 to $250. The real money was made by selling customized versions and by guiding his hacker clients in its effective use. It remains unclear how extensively he interacted with the Russian hacking team.After the Department of Homeland Security identified his creation, he quickly shut down his website and posted on a closed forum for hackers, called Exploit, that \u201cI\u2019m not interested in excessive attention to me personally.\u201dSoon, a hint of panic appeared, and he posted a note saying that, six days on, he was still alive.Another hacker, with the nickname Zloi Santa, or Bad Santa, suggested the Americans would certainly find him, and place him under arrest, perhaps during a layover at an airport.\u201cIt could be, or it could not be, it depends only on politics,\u201d Profexer responded. \u201cIf U.S. law enforcement wants to take me down, they will not wait for me in some country\u2019s airport. Relations between our countries are so tight I would be arrested in my kitchen, at the first request.\u201dIn fact, Serhiy Demediuk, chief of the Ukrainian Cyber Police, said in an interview that Profexer went to the authorities himself. As the cooperation began, Profexer went dark on hacker forums. He last posted online on Jan. 9. Mr. Demediuk said he had made the witness available to the F.B.I., which has posted a full-time cybersecurity expert in Kiev as one of four bureau agents stationed at the United States Embassy there. The F.B.I. declined to comment.Profexer was not arrested because his activities fell in a legal gray zone, as an author but not a user of malware, the Ukrainian police say. But he did know the users, at least by their online handles. \u201cHe told us he didn\u2019t create it to be used in the way it was,\u201d Mr. Demediuk said.A member of Ukraine\u2019s Parliament with close ties to the security services, Anton Gerashchenko, said that the interaction was online or by phone and that the Ukrainian programmer had been paid to write customized malware without knowing its purpose, only later learning it was used in Russian hacking.Mr. Gerashchenko described the author only in broad strokes, to protect his safety, as a young man from a provincial Ukrainian city. He confirmed that the author turned himself in to the police and was cooperating as a witness in the D.N.C. investigation. \u201cHe was a freelancer and now he is a valuable witness,\u201d Mr. Gerashchenko said.It is not clear whether the specific malware the programmer created was used to hack the D.N.C. servers, but it was identified in other Russian hacking efforts in the United States.While it is not known what Profexer has told Ukrainian investigators and the F.B.I. about Russia\u2019s hacking efforts, evidence emanating from Ukraine has again provided some of the clearest pictures yet about Fancy Bear, or Advanced Persistent Threat 28, which is run by the G.R.U.Fancy Bear has been identified mostly by what it does, not by who does it. One of its recurring features has been the theft of emails and its close collaboration with the Russian state news media.Tracking the bear to its lair, however, has so far proved impossible, not least because many experts believe that no such single place exists.Even for a sophisticated tech company like Microsoft, singling out individuals in the digital miasma has proved just about impossible. To curtail the damage to clients\u2019 operating systems, the company filed a complaint against Fancy Bear last year with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia but found itself boxing with shadows.As Microsoft lawyers reported to the court, \u201cbecause defendants used fake contact information, anonymous Bitcoin and prepaid credit cards and false identities, and sophisticated technical means to conceal their identities, when setting up and using the relevant internet domains, defendants\u2019 true identities remain unknown.\u201dNevertheless, Ukrainian officials, though wary of upsetting the Trump administration, have been quietly cooperating with American investigators to try to figure out who stands behind all the disguises.Included in this sharing of information were copies of the server hard drives of Ukraine\u2019s Central Election Commission, which were targeted during a presidential election in May 2014. That the F.B.I. had obtained evidence of this earlier, Russian-linked electoral hack has not been previously reported.Traces of the same malicious code, this time a program called Sofacy, were seen in the 2014 attack in Ukraine and later in the D.N.C. intrusion in the United States.Intriguingly, in the cyberattack during the Ukrainian election, what appears to have been a bungle by Channel 1, a Russian state television station, inadvertently implicated the government authorities in Moscow.Hackers had loaded onto a Ukrainian election commission server a graphic mimicking the page for displaying results. This phony page showed a shocker of an outcome: an election win for a fiercely anti-Russian, ultraright candidate, Dmytro Yarosh. Mr. Yarosh in reality received less than 1 percent of the vote.The false result would have played into a Russian propaganda narrative that Ukraine today is ruled by hard-right, even fascist, figures.The fake image was programmed to display when polls closed, at 8 p.m., but a Ukrainian cybersecurity company, InfoSafe, discovered it just minutes earlier and unplugged the server.State television in Russia nevertheless reported that Mr. Yarosh had won and broadcast the fake graphic, citing the election commission\u2019s website, even though the image had never appeared there. The hacker had clearly provided Channel 1 with the same image in advance, but the reporters had failed to check that the hack actually worked.\u201cFor me, this is an obvious link between the hackers and Russian officials,\u201d said Victor Zhora, director of InfoSafe, the cybersecurity company that first found the fake graphic.\u201cIt was the first strike,\u201d Mr. Zhora said of the earlier hack of Ukraine\u2019s electoral computers. Ukraine\u2019s Cyber Police have also provided the F.B.I. with copies of server hard drives showing the possible origins of some phishing emails targeting the Democratic Party during the election.In 2016, two years after the election hack in Ukraine, hackers using some of the same techniques plundered the email system of the World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, which had accused Russian athletes of systematic drug use.That raid, too, seems to have been closely coordinated with Russian state television, which began airing well-prepared reports about WADA\u2019s hacked emails just minutes after they were made public. The emails appeared on a website that announced that WADA had been hacked by a group calling itself the \u201cFancy Bears\u2019 Hack Team.\u201dIt was the first time Fancy Bear had broken cover.Fancy Bear remains extraordinarily elusive, however. To throw investigators off its scent, the group has undergone various makeovers, restocking its arsenal of malware and sometimes hiding under different guises. One of its alter egos, cyberexperts believe, is Cyber Berkut, an outfit supposedly set up in Ukraine by supporters of the country\u2019s pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was ousted in 2014.After lying dormant for many months, Cyber Berkut jumped back into action this summer just as multiple investigations in Washington into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow shifted into high gear. Cyber Berkut released stolen emails that it and Russian state news media said had exposed the real story: Hillary Clinton had colluded with Ukraine.An earlier version of this article misstated how a type of malware known as P.A.S. was used in Russian hacking efforts in the United States that included the electronic break-in at the Democratic National Committee. The agencies identified the malware as a tool used in Russian hacking, but they did not specify in which attacks it was used.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Tim Cook Barnstorms for \u2018Moral Responsibility\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 \u201cThe reality is that government, for a long period of time, has for whatever set of reasons become less functional and isn\u2019t working at the speed that it once was. And so it does fall, I think, not just on business but on all other areas of society to step up.\u201dThat was Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, across the table from me over breakfast here in downtown Austin late last week at the end of a mini-tour across the country during which he focused on topics usually reserved for politicians: manufacturing, jobs and education.He had just spent the prior day in Ohio, where he toured CTS, a technology company that produces the equipment that Apple uses to test water resistance and dust protection for the iPhone and the Apple Watch. He then flew to Des Moines, where he announced plans to make a $1.3 billion investment in a 400,000-square-foot data center in nearby Waukee to help store and move giant amounts of information for its services like iCloud and FaceTime. And he arrived here to announce that Austin Community College will begin offering its 74,000 students a curriculum that Apple developed to teach them how to write code to create apps for iPhones. Austin is one of 30 community colleges that will offer the curriculum.As Mr. Cook\u2019s breakfast arrived \u2014 two scrambled egg whites, crispy bacon (they didn\u2019t have his preferred turkey bacon), sugar-free cereal with unsweetened almond milk \u2014 he described his week, punctuated by a visit the night before to the L.B.J. Presidential Library, the museum of President Lyndon B. Johnson.\u201cOne of the things that hits you,\u201d he said, is \u201call of the major acts, legislation, that happened during just his presidency.\u201d His eyes widened as he listed some: \u201cYou have the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Act, you have Medicare, you have Medicaid, you have several national parks, you have Head Start, you have housing discrimination, you have jury discrimination.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your politics,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou look at it and say, \u2018My gosh.\u2019\u201dMr. Cook\u2019s comments weren\u2019t a dig at President Trump so much as they were a critique of Washington\u2019s seemingly perpetual state of gridlock.And now Mr. Cook is one of the many business leaders in the country who appear to be filling the void, using his platform at Apple to wade into larger social issues that typically fell beyond the mandate of executives in past generations.He said he had never set out to do so, but he feels he has been thrust into the role as virtually every large American company has had to stake out a domestic policy.He was vocal, for example, in criticizing Mr. Trump after Charlottesville in a memo to his staff: \u201cI disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans.\u201dWatching Mr. Cook over the years, I\u2019ve been fascinated to see how he has become as animated when talking about big issues like education and climate change as he is when talking about Apple.\u201cI think we have a moral responsibility to help grow the economy, to help grow jobs, to contribute to this country and to contribute to the other countries that we do business in,\u201d he said.He added, \u201cI think there\u2019s still probably a more significant group that feels my sole responsibility is to Wall Street.\u201dHis critics will, of course, say all this happy talk is a P.R. ploy for a company that makes its most popular products on the other side of the world and keeps nearly a quarter-trillion dollars abroad, untaxed by Uncle Sam. In fairness, Apple is one of the largest taxpayers in the country, paying $28 billion in federal taxes between 2014 and 2016 at an average rate of 26 percent, which is in the middle for big multinational American corporations.And Mr. Cook is paid handsomely: On Thursday, as a result of the company\u2019s financial outperformance compared with its peers, Mr. Cook was given nearly $90 million of stock as part of his previously agreed upon compensation plan. (He has said he plans to give away all of his wealth.)But there\u2019s a more nuanced version of Apple\u2019s story \u2014 and Mr. Cook\u2019s transformation of the company after taking over as its chief executive in 2011 \u2014 that has been lost amid the din of nonstop chatter about the company in Silicon Valley and Washington.When Mr. Cook announced, for example, the new data facility in Waukee, he said it would run fully on renewable energy. But he slipped in another fact that has largely gone unnoticed: Over the past several years, Mr. Cook has gotten all of the company\u2019s corporate facilities in the United States to run on wind and solar energy \u2014 in their entirety.\u201cWe\u2019re running Apple a hundred percent on renewable energy today\u201d in the United States, he said over breakfast, \u201cand we\u2019ve now hit that in 23 other countries around the world.\u201dHe is hoping the curriculum turns into jobs. Last year, according to Apple, 150,000 new jobs were created through the App Store.

{"Headline": "A Hunt for Ways to Combat Online Radicalization", "Date": "2017-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtLaw enforcement officials, technology companies and lawmakers have long tried to limit what they call the \u201cradicalization\u201d of young people over the internet.The term has often been used to describe a specific kind of radicalization \u2014 that of young Muslim men who are inspired to take violent action by the online messages of Islamist groups like the Islamic State. But as it turns out, it isn\u2019t just violent jihadists who benefit from the internet\u2019s power to radicalize young people from afar.White supremacists are just as adept at it. Where the pre-internet Ku Klux Klan grew primarily from personal connections and word of mouth, today\u2019s white supremacist groups have figured out a way to expertly use the internet to recruit and coordinate among a huge pool of potential racists. That became clear two weeks ago with the riots in Charlottesville, Va., which became a kind of watershed event for internet-addled racists.Ms. Donovan and others who study how the internet shapes extremism said that even though Islamists and white nationalists have different views and motivations, there are broad similarities in how the two operate online \u2014 including how they spread their message, recruit and organize offline actions. The similarities suggest a kind of blueprint for a response \u2014 efforts that may work for limiting the reach of jihadists may also work for white supremacists, and vice versa.In fact, that\u2019s the battle plan. Several research groups in the United States and Europe now see the white supremacist and jihadi threats as two faces of the same coin. They\u2019re working on methods to fight both, together \u2014 and slowly, they have come up with ideas for limiting how these groups recruit new members to their cause.Their ideas are grounded in a few truths about how extremist groups operate online, and how potential recruits respond. After speaking to many researchers, I compiled this rough guide for combating online radicalization.Recognize the internet as an extremist breeding ground.The first step in combating online extremism is kind of obvious: It is to recognize the extremists as a threat.When it comes to fighting white supremacists, though, much of the tech industry has long been on the sidelines. This laxity has helped create a monster. In many ways, researchers said, white supremacists are even more sophisticated than jihadists in their use of the internet.After the horror of Charlottesville, internet companies began banning and blocking content posted by right-wing extremist groups. So far their efforts have been hasty and reactive, but Ms. Ramalingam sees it as at the start of a wider effort.\u201cIt\u2019s really an unprecedented moment where social media and tech companies are recognizing that their platforms have become spaces where these groups can grow, and have been often unpoliced,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really kind of waking up to this and taking some action.\u201dEngage directly with potential recruits. If tech companies are finally taking action to prevent radicalization, is it the right kind of action? Extremism researchers said that blocking certain content may work to temporarily disrupt groups, but may eventually drive them further underground, far from the reach of potential saviors.One factor is a skepticism of mainstream media. Whether on the far right or ISIS, people who are susceptible to extremist ideologies tend to dismiss outlets like The New York Times or the BBC, and they often go in search of alternative theories online.Another key issue is timing. There\u2019s a brief window between initial interest in an extremist ideology and a decision to join the cause \u2014 and after recruits make that decision, they are often beyond the reach of outsiders. For instance, Jigsaw found that when jihadists began planning their trips to Syria to join ISIS, they had fallen too far down the rabbit hole and dismissed any new information presented to them.Jigsaw put these findings to use in an innovative way. It curated a series of videos showing what life is truly like under the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. The videos, which weren\u2019t filmed by news outlets, offered a credible counterpoint to the fantasies peddled by the group \u2014 they show people queuing up for bread, fighters brutally punishing civilians, and women and children being mistreated.Then, to make sure potential recruits saw the videos at the right time in their recruitment process, Jigsaw used one of Google\u2019s most effective technologies: ad targeting. In the same way that a pair of shoes you looked up last week follows you around the internet, Jigsaw\u2019s counterterrorism videos were pushed to likely recruits.Moonshot CVE, which worked with Jigsaw on the Redirect project, put together several similar efforts to engage with both jihadists and white supremacist groups. It has embedded undercover social workers in extremist forums who discreetly message potential recruits to dissuade them. And lately it\u2019s been using targeted ads to offer mental health counseling to those who might be radicalized.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s really effective to go beyond ideology,\u201d Ms. Ramalingam said. \u201cWhen you offer them some information about their lives, they\u2019re disproportionately likely to interact with it.\u201dStill, just about every hate crime and terrorist attack, these days, was planned or in some way coordinated online. Ridding the world of all of the factors that drive young men to commit heinous acts isn\u2019t possible. But disrupting the online radicalization machine? With enough work, that may just be possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Anita Hill: Class Actions Could Fight Discrimination in Tech", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe recent leak of a Google engineer\u2019s screed against the company\u2019s diversity initiatives is a reminder that the notion of Silicon Valley as the seat of human progress is a myth \u2014 at least when it comes to the way the women behind the latest in technology are treated.The tech industry is stuck in the past, more closely resembling \u201cMad Men\u201d-era Madison Avenue or 1980s Wall Street than a modern egalitarian society. It may take the force of our legal system to change that.Sadly, these types of cases represent only one element of the industrywide discrimination against women in tech. There\u2019s also an alarming gap in pay and promotions, which has devastating effects on women\u2019s careers.Instead, women in the industry should collectively consider their legal options. Top among these would be class-action discrimination cases against employers.The tech sector is not the first white-collar \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d to demand an industrywide correction. In the 1990s, Wall Street firms faced a slew of class-action discrimination lawsuits. Perhaps the most notable was the 1996 \u201cBoom Boom Room\u201d case. A group of 23 women filed a class-action lawsuit against the Smith Barney stock brokerage firm, charging it with rampant harassment and gender discrimination. By the time Smith Barney settled the case for $150 million, nearly 2,000 women had joined the suit and helped expose a culture of sexism to the outside world.As a result of this and other cases that similarly challenged systemic practices at other Wall Street firms, many of these companies now have more extensive human-resource policies addressing sexual harassment and gender discrimination. While pay and promotion discrimination still exists, more women on Wall Street are advancing in their careers to managing directorship and other leadership roles. The lesson of these cases is clear: Class-action lawsuits can force industrywide change, even in the most entrenched, male-dominated industries.Women in tech no doubt have hurdles to bringing class-action lawsuits, including the requisite preponderance of statistical evidence and the prevalence of confidentiality clauses and arbitration agreements, which are, in effect, designed to pre-empt class actions. But this challenge doesn\u2019t mean the suits cannot be brought, or won. This is a route that the women of Silicon Valley should consider, especially if regulation is not an immediate and viable solution.It\u2019s not just the female plaintiffs who would win if they were to be victorious in court. The economic benefits could be remarkable. Advancing women\u2019s equality, which includes minimizing the gender gap in labor force participation, holds the potential to add $12 trillion to global G.D.P. by 2025.The male-dominated leadership of Silicon Valley has proved unwilling or unable to solve systemic gender inequality, and the leaked Google memo should serve as an alert about how deeply and passionately anti-equality attitudes are held. It\u2019s time women in tech consider taking advantage of the law to disrupt the industry once and for all.Anita Hill is of counsel to Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, a national plaintiffs\u2019 law firm.Advertisement"}

Amazon did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.Beijing has become increasingly emboldened in pushing America\u2019s internet giants to follow its local internet laws, which forbid unregistered censorship-evasion software. Analysts say the government has been more aggressive in pressuring companies to make concessions following the passage of a new cybersecurity law, which went into effect June 1, and ahead of a sensitive Communist Party conclave set for late autumn.The government has been intent on tightening controls domestically as well. It recently shut down a number of Chinese-run VPNs. New rules posted to government websites in recent days said Communist Party members can be punished for viewing illegal sites and that they must register all foreign or local social media accounts.Ms. Wang, who said that Sinnet handles Amazon Web Services operations across China, said that the company has sent letters warning users about such services in the past but that the government had been more focused on other issues.Amazon Web Services allows companies small and large to lease computing power instead of running their websites or other online services through their own hardware and software. Because Amazon\u2019s cloud services allow customers to lease servers in China, it could be used to give Chinese internet users access to various types of software that would help them get around the Great Firewall.While Microsoft and Amazon both run cloud services in China, similar ones run by local Chinese internet rivals dwarf them in scale. In particular Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba runs its own cloud services, which have grown rapidly in China.

Change comes with dogged, on-the-ground work, not a list of demands, according to Harvard Resistance School.Marshall Ganz, shirt sleeves rolled up, spread his arms wide with a \u201cjoin me.\u201d Hands came together, slowly at first, then in a flurry of rapid, synchronized thwacks. A member of the old left \u2014 he dropped out of Harvard in 1964 to fight for civil rights in Mississippi and for California farmworkers with Cesar Chavez \u2014 Dr. Ganz was teaching the unity clap, the audible calling card of the United Farmworkers of America 50 years earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s not a trivial thing at all,\u201d said Dr. Ganz, who had returned to his studies and is now a Harvard professor. Clapping is a collective action that builds cohesion and gets attention, and chanting is \u201ca way of celebrating and honoring the values that are being enacted through this work.\u201dThis was the fun stuff. Political organizing is tedious. It involves gathering people, setting group norms, defining roles and goals. And dogged on-the-ground labor.These also happen to be the core aims of Dr. Ganz\u2019s audience, members of an unsanctioned \u201cschool\u201d created last spring by Harvard graduate students cold-cocked by the Trump victory. For those on the left, the election yanked away the scrim of sweet reason.\u201cFor a long time we have been able to think that things have been pretty O.K.,\u201d said Yasmin Radjy, one of 11 founders of the Resistance School, four sessions on political advocacy and action held in a lecture hall at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Opposing forces now look more threatening. It is what spurred the students to invite professors and political veterans to lecture on the tools necessary to drive sustainable political change. Semester two is in the works.The Resistance School focuses on \u201cpractical skills for taking back America\u201d at a moment when front-porch politicking seems lost to likes and shares, online memes and long lists of diversity demands.A 50-person army, many in their navy blue Resistance School T-shirts, operated in teams with elflike efficiency at the Kennedy School, working at odd hours to produce video highlights, lecture notes, syllabus materials and homework assignments. During lectures, students gathered in the \u201cwar room,\u201d its conference table dotted with room-temperature pizza slices, to live tweet and select questions for the speaker from Facebook submissions.In a wave of interest that surprised the founders, the videos have had more than 175,000 views; Yale and Grinnell students held \u201cwatch parties.\u201dThe point of the Resistance School is to support groups like Ms. Vyedin\u2019s in promoting progressive values, including in city councils and state legislatures. \u201cWe feel it is a mistake to make it all about the presidency,\u201d said Ms. Radjy, who graduated in May. Yet the election made clear that, \u201cas a generation, we are not as politically trained as we should be.\u201d\u201cPolitics requires in-person, face-to-face interactions,\u201d she said, which is why homework assignments call for live conversations and group gatherings. \u201cIf you are not used to negotiating and listening to the other side, it\u2019s easy to caricature the other side,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Disney, Ditching Netflix, Grabs a New Key to the Kingdom", "Date": "2017-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseIs content still king?It was Bill Gates of Microsoft who declared it so in 1996, but the proposition has been repeated so often by Disney executives that it could have served as the company\u2019s corporate slogan.When AT&T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago, Disney\u2019s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said the deal proved yet again that \u201ccontent is king.\u201d\u201cIs the network \u2014 the platform \u2014 now most important?\u201d asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution \u2014 in whatever form it takes \u2014 is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution \u2014 and a potential new revenue source.These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\u201cAnyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,\u201d said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. \u201cThey have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.\u201dNetflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney\u2019s popular children\u2019s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney\u2019s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming \u2014 especially in the coveted children\u2019s market long dominated by Disney.Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss\u2019s \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children\u2019s programming.\u201cDisney served its purpose,\u201d Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix \u201chas reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn\u2019t really need Disney anymore.\u201dThe question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.And it\u2019s hedging its bet. For now, Disney\u2019s Marvel and \u201cStar Wars\u201d programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn\u2019t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it\u2019s Disney \u2014 and only a few others.\u201cAfter Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,\u201d Mr. Olson said.\u201cDisney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,\u201d said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. \u201cBut they\u2019re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they\u2019ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.\u201dAs Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney\u2019s move is putting \u201ca very settled and successful part of the business model\u201d at risk and \u201cmore aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.\u201dMr. Olson agreed. \u201cIf anyone can do it from a content perspective, it\u2019s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re coming from way behind.\u201dInvestors didn\u2019t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney\u2019s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company\u2019s move wasn\u2019t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. \u201cWe can both do really well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no zero-sum game here.\u201dAlthough it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney\u2019s move into direct-to-consumer distribution \u2014 not to mention the tech world\u2019s rush into original programming \u2014 demonstrates that \u201ccontent is everything these days.\u201dUnlike the old world of cable and broadcast, \u201cthe barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,\u201d he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. \u201cAll the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We\u2019re already good at both.\u201d (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)In short, from Disney\u2019s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, \u201ccontent is more king than ever.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With those resources, Mr. Son is now able to deploy more money in one deal than most venture capital firms can dream of spending in years.At first blush, WeWork\u2019s connection to the future of technology appears more tenuous than, say, the British virtual reality start-up Improbable, which SoftBank poured $500 million into in May.Founded in New York, the company leases real estate and then offers desk space to both individual members and companies like Microsoft.Though the privately held company does not disclose its financial report, one of the people briefed on the deal said that it expected to generate $1 billion in revenue this year.WeWork already counted among its investors Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and the venture capital firm Benchmark.In its announcement on Thursday, SoftBank said only that it believed in WeWork using \u201cits own proprietary data systems to radically transform the way people work.\u201dMr. Son added, \u201cWe are thrilled to support WeWork as they expand across markets and geographies and unleash a new wave of productivity around the world.\u201dWeWork\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, Adam Neumann, said, \u201cThis support from SoftBank and the Vision Fund will provide even more opportunities for creators as we set out to humanize the way people work and live.\u201dAs part of the deal, two SoftBank directors, Ronald D. Fisher and Mark Schwartz, will join WeWork\u2019s board.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber\u2019s C.E.O. Choice Faces a Question of Ambitions", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe similarities were clear. Amazon began as an online bookstore, but it was never just about selling books; over two decades, Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, methodically expanded his company\u2019s range, operational infrastructure and ambitions to ultimately pose an existential threat to the entire retail industry.Uber, in Mr. Kalanick\u2019s expansive vision, was similarly never just about hailing rides. To him, a taxi-like car service has always been a gateway for a business model that he believed would upend the entire trillion-dollar global transportation industry, altering the way people and things move around the world \u2014 and turning Uber into one of the handful of American tech giants that will lord over this century.Mr. Khosrowshahi is a cipher in Silicon Valley. Much about the future of transportation, as well as the start-up scene in Silicon Valley, rides on his still unknown plans. Expedia declined to comment and Uber did not return a request for comment.His tenure also suggests a very different outlook from Mr. Kalanick\u2019s. In one of the biggest misses of Expedia\u2019s history, Mr. Khosrowshahi appeared wary of taking a big, potentially lucrative risk on a groundbreaking new idea in his industry \u2014 and he came out the loser. To his credit, he helped steer Expedia to adjust from that mistake. But his initial impulse may suggest a more risk-averse mindset than Mr. Kalanick\u2019s \u2014 though that, of course, may be just what Uber needs now.Its hotel booking business grew out of an acquisition that Mr. Khosrowshahi made while he was an executive at IAC in the late 1990s, and for several years, it looked unstoppable and deliciously lucrative.Expedia then operated according to what\u2019s known as the \u201cmerchant model.\u201d Under this system, when you booked a hotel, you would pay up front to Expedia, which would take a profitable cut of the deal and buy the room on your behalf. Expedia\u2019s margins were startling \u2014 the company got 25 percent or more of what you paid for the room.Instead of taking a large cut of the room, Booking.com used what is known as the \u201cagency model.\u201d The site let hotels set their own far smaller commissions \u2014 as low as 12 percent. And it also let hotel guests pay when they got to the hotel rather than up front.\u201cI think it was because we were attached to the merchant model and we were attached to high margins at the time,\u201d he told Mr. Schaal. \u201cAnd I think in hindsight that blinded us.\u201dUnder Priceline, Booking.com quickly became the largest hotel booking site in the world, because its cheaper model created a dynamic that Mr. Khosrowshahi and others at Expedia had not anticipated. It lowered prices and vastly expanded the number of hotels participating on the site \u2014 making Booking.com very popular with hotel-seekers, and making it impossible for hotels to pass up.This history, Mr. Thompson wrote, might inform how Mr. Khosrowshahi approaches Uber. In the same way that Booking.com became popular with hotel guests because it had the largest inventory of hotels, Mr. Khosrowshahi might understand Uber\u2019s secret is its popularity with riders.\u201cIn fact, what makes Uber so valuable \u2014 and still so attractive, despite all of the recent troubles \u2014 is its position with riders,\u201d Mr. Thompson wrote. \u201cThe more riders Uber has, the more drivers it will attract, even if the economics are worse relative to other services: driving at a worse rate is better than not driving at a better one.\u201dThis sounds reasonable enough. Yet I still found myself fixated on Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s initial dismissal of Booking.com. I suspect that if you told Mr. Kalanick, not to mention Mr. Bezos, that there was a competitor out there that had figured out a way to sell the same product at a vastly lower price, they would have moved instantly to purchase or copy it, regardless of the risks to short-term profits. Sacrificing lots of money today for a potentially huge share of the market in the future \u2014 that\u2019s classic Mr. Bezos, and then classic Mr. Kalanick.In fact, that\u2019s pretty much what Mr. Kalanick did when he created UberX, a cheaper version of his original black-car service, in response to lower-priced entrants like Lyft.That Mr. Khosrowshahi did not do that suggests he has a very different appetite for risk. It also suggests he may seek to turn Uber into a more normal, slower, less intense, less globe-swallowing company \u2014 but perhaps also a better company to work for, and one that may begin making money instead of losing it.For everyone who\u2019s had enough of Uber\u2019s drama lately, that may be a fine trade.The State of the Art column on Tuesday, about challenges facing Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s pick as its next chief executive, misstated the year Dennis Schaal of the travel news site Skift spoke with Mr. Khosrowshahi. It was 2016, not 2014.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The World\u2019s Biggest Tech Companies Are No Longer Just American", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Alibaba Group and Tencent Holdings, Chinese companies that dominate their home market, have rocketed this year to become global investor darlings. They are now among the world\u2019s most highly valued public companies, each of them twice as valuable as tech stalwarts such as Intel, Cisco and IBM.While American technology giants dominate people\u2019s online lives in Western countries, Tencent and Alibaba have soared by essentially carving up China, the world\u2019s single-largest internet market with more than 700 million online users. That is roughly twice the size of the population of the United States. Chinese people also spend more money online than Americans.Their rise is emblematic of a rebalancing of global technological influence. In recent years, places from Paris to Seoul have claimed the mantle of the next Silicon Valley. Yet the cluster of fast-growing start-ups and internet behemoths coming out of China has emerged as the one true rival in scale, value and technology to the West Coast homes of the American technology renaissance.Mr. Tung, who invests in many Chinese start-ups, said the main advantage for Alibaba and Tencent was that the United States still had efficient \u201coffline\u201d \u2014 or non-internet \u2014 options for shopping or entertainment. But in China, where there are fewer appealing options offline, Tencent and Alibaba play a central role in how people buy and pay for goods and services, communicate and entertain themselves.The ascendance of Tencent and Alibaba is evident in their scale. Soon, Tencent will be the only company other than Facebook to have a social network with more than one billion users. (Facebook is still ahead with more than two billion members.) Tencent recently said its messaging app, WeChat \u2014 which includes payments and a social network \u2014 had 960 million monthly active users.Alibaba has more than 500 million monthly active users for its online shopping apps. Over the past three months, the revenue for both Tencent and Alibaba jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago, meaning they are growing more quickly than both Facebook and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.In Hong Kong, Tencent\u2019s market capitalization rose above $400 billion in early trading on Thursday before closing just below that threshold at $396 billion. Alibaba closed in New York trading on Thursday with a market value of $415 billion. The two companies still lag Amazon and Facebook, which are valued at more than $450 billion, and are significantly smaller than Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company with a market capitalization exceeding $800 billion.In Silicon Valley, some tech companies have begun taking cues from their Chinese rivals. Tencent\u2019s WeChat offered speedier in-app articles before Facebook, created a walkie-talkie function before WhatsApp, and made use of QR codes as a way to connect on a social network long before Snapchat.Both Alibaba and Tencent have long been successful in China, but recent events have given them an added push. In China, people often talk about three internet companies that dominate the technology world: Alibaba, Tencent and a search company called Baidu, which is sometimes called the Google of China.But Baidu has stumbled as Chinese users skipped personal computers entirely and turned to smartphones, and it has had trouble competing in a financial arms race between Tencent and Alibaba. The two companies have been plowing money into new businesses like food delivery and online video.Despite their size, Alibaba and Tencent are mostly anchored in China, though both are pushing to expand. Most of Alibaba\u2019s earnings come from its ad and commissions business in China. The company had just under $400 million in revenue from international commerce. While Tencent has games like League of Legends that are played across the world, the bulk of its revenue comes from games and ads in China.Both have made use of investments and acquisitions to enter into new markets in recent years \u2014 with uneven results. Alibaba has invested in a payments company in India, and it bought into three different e-commerce companies in Southeast Asia. With Amazon also readying its own Southeast Asian campaign, the hugely populated region of disparate cultures could be the first place the two e-commerce Goliaths compete face-to-face on neutral ground.Even with their new pre-eminence, Tencent and Alibaba face some daunting challenges. China\u2019s internet world cannot grow forever, and both companies have stumbled in many of their efforts to get their popularity at home to translate into success in the United States and other markets.Both have made expensive forays into Hollywood with lackluster results. And they face rising pressure from a Chinese government that has become increasingly aware of the power of digital information \u2014 and has plans to use it to better track its populations.Still, there is an opportunity for the companies to emerge as global leaders in areas like gaming, e-commerce and communications, said David Chao, co-founder of the venture capital firm DCM Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re a legitimate force to be reckoned with on the world stage,\u201d he said.For now, a market of 700 million internet users in China is enough to keep Alibaba and Tencent going.\u201cThe majority of businessmen in China now are playing the game,\u201d said Zhang Guangyi, 25, a businessman from Beijing who estimates he has spent about $1,500 in the game. \u201cOnce I met a client and when we added each other on WeChat, I noticed that he was also playing and that my level is higher than his. I proposed that I escort him in the game. Soon after that, we had the contract signed.\u201dPaul Mozur reported from Hong Kong. Daisuke Wakabayashi contributed reporting from San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Matthew Prince of Cloudflare on the Dangers of Fast Growth", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorner OfficeQ. What were your early years like?Tell me about your parents.Both my parents are entrepreneurs. My dad has done a million things over the years. He\u2019s been a journalist. He started his own stock brokerage firm. He owns more than 30 restaurants across three states now. I definitely saw the struggles of entrepreneurship. Restaurants are a really tough business.My mom owned a collection of gift stores, and I would work for her when I was in school. She has a really great eye for spotting the next trend.How have they influenced your leadership style?My dad was always good at what I would describe as panicking early, which I think of as looking way out over the horizon and thinking through a decision and the 50 steps down the road. That\u2019s served me really well.My mom would always say that it\u2019s better to have a couple of nice things than a lot of mediocre things. We\u2019ve applied that lesson at work, to do a few things really well.Did you have an idea what you wanted to do for a career when you went to college?When I was 7 years old, my grandmother gave me an Apple II Plus for Christmas, and I took to it like a duck to water. Computers made a lot of sense to me. My mom used to sneak me into computer science classes at the University of Utah, pretending that she was taking the continuing education classes, and I would basically do all the work.So I planned to study computer science. But I took a couple of courses and I was bored out of my mind. So I transferred my major to English literature, and kept computer science as a minor.When I graduated, I had job offers at a bunch of tech companies that I thought weren\u2019t going to go anywhere, like Netscape and Yahoo and Microsoft. And I remember thinking that I didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of my life sitting in front of a computer writing code. So I decided to go to law school.I eventually found my way to the world of start-ups. I became pretty hooked on starting something from scratch. Working at a start-up is almost like a drug. There\u2019s something very powerful about going from an idea on a piece of paper to enough money in a bank account to fund it, to building a team.I started working on Cloudflare as a business-school project in 2009, and my co-founders and I opened an office in California in January 2010.What are some leadership lessons you\u2019ve learned?The three of us who started Cloudflare each have our strengths and weaknesses. But together we formed a really great foundation. The way my co-founder Michelle [Zatlyn] describes it is that when you\u2019re starting a business, you\u2019ve got a certain surface area that you\u2019ve got to cover.It\u2019s kind of like a Venn diagram. You want people who can cover as much of that surface area as possible. You don\u2019t want them so completely disparate that they can\u2019t even communicate, so you need a little bit of overlap. If you\u2019ve got too much overlap, then you end up fighting over whose job it is.What else?When the company was just eight of us, a younger engineer suggested a new tradition \u2014 every Friday after work, we go get drinks at a local pub, talk about the week and get to know each other outside of work.Michelle and I vetoed that idea, and people said, \u201cWhy? Are you the fun police?\u201d I explained that when you look at successful organizations, they\u2019re defined by their ability to pull from the broadest possible pool of people. At some point, we\u2019re going to want to hire a 50-year-old single mom or dad who has to pick up their daughter from soccer practice on Friday afternoons.If they can\u2019t feel like they\u2019re part of the team, then they\u2019re not going to come work for us. That\u2019s going to massively narrow the pool of people we can hire from. We wanted to make Cloudflare a place where, no matter who you were, you could come here and work, and you\u2019d be judged on that work. We weren\u2019t trying to recreate college.I also watched other companies stumble because they grow too fast. If you\u2019re growing faster than doubling the number of employees in any 12-month period, then inherently you\u2019re going to have more new people than old people. And in the short term, maybe that\u2019s fine. But the culture can start to suffer because there\u2019s nothing foundational to keep you stable.We have a rule across the organization, and on a team level, to never grow faster than doubling in any 12-month period. For start-ups like us, there\u2019s constant pressure to grow faster, but if you do that, then there are no culture-keepers of the organization.How do you hire?I look for an incredibly high degree of curiosity \u2014 people who just relentlessly want to learn new things and put themselves in new situations \u2014 and a high degree of empathy. If people are curious and empathetic, they can learn just about anything.One of the best ways to tell whether someone\u2019s curious and empathetic is to ask them for the questions they have. You can see how their mind works and how thoughtful they are.What career and life advice do you give to new college grads?Really understand your strengths and weaknesses, and surround yourself with people who complement you and challenge you. That will help you continue to grow.As I look back on my career, I\u2019ve always had partners in crime. Starting a company on your own can be horrifically lonely.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Crowded TV Marketplace Gets Ready for Three Tech Giants", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has more than $1 billion budgeted for original programming, Facebook wants its own version of \u201cScandal\u201d and Google is ready to spend up to $3 million per episode on a drama.The three digital giants have signaled to Hollywood that they are serious about entering a television landscape that Netflix and Amazon shook up just a few years ago. Their arrival will make an already hypercompetitive industry even more ferocious. This year, there are expected to be more than 500 scripted TV shows, more than double the number six years ago.With the prospect of a flood of tech money about to rush in, Hollywood has welcomed the news.\u201cIf you ask the creative community if we\u2019re going to be competitive, the answer is yes,\u201d said Robert Kyncl, the chief business officer at YouTube, which is owned by Google.Mr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg were certainly regarded in Hollywood as talented studio executives, having shepherded hit series like \u201cThe Crown,\u201d \u201cThe Goldbergs\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d But their move to Apple, and their programming budget of a little more than $1 billion, has suddenly made them among the most powerful executives in television.That budget also puts them on a par with the most elite programmers in television. FX, which makes shows like \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d and \u201cFargo,\u201d has a programming budget of around $1 billion. HBO\u2019s budget is believed to be around $3 billion, and Netflix will spend about $6 billion on content this year.FX\u2019s chief executive, John Landgraf, has been outspoken about his uneasiness with the amount of money now pouring into the industry and what it will mean for competitors with smaller budgets.\u201cIt\u2019s like getting shot in the face with money every day,\u201d he said at a news media event this month. \u201cAnd I have no idea how much capital Apple is going to deploy, how many shows they\u2019re going to buy.\u201dMr. Erlicht and Mr. Van Amburg started at Apple a few weeks ago. In the coming months, they are expected to hire a few dozen people as they staff up at the Culver City, Calif., offices they share with Beats Electronics, which Apple acquired for about $3 billion in 2014.It is not clear how people will be able to watch or pay for Apple\u2019s original programs. Without any current acquisitions, it will take at least a year for any of the company\u2019s projects to be ready for the viewing public. The entertainment drive is also unique from Apple Music \u2014 programs like \u201cPlanet of the Apps\u201d and \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d are currently available on the service \u2014 and it is possible that a new app will be made to stream the new original series.But as Apple starts to gear up, Facebook is already well on its way.And while many new entrants into scripted television want big shows with mass appeal like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or Emmy-bait like \u201cHomeland,\u201d Facebook has a more targeted plan.It has indicated it wants shows that are attractive to people in their midteens up to those in their mid-30s, along the lines of frothy fare like \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Those shows generate plenty of talk on social media platforms, and Facebook executives are apparently dedicated to programming that they believe will ignite conversation on the social network.Unlike Netflix, which releases all episodes of its series at once so that they can be binge-watched, Facebook is expected to release episodes on a more traditional schedule (it is unclear whether that will be once a week). Facebook also plans to have so-called mid-roll ads, or brief commercials, during episodes.A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.YouTube is in the process of green-lighting series. Like Facebook, the Google-owned video site is focused mainly on series that appeal to 16- to 35-year-olds, according to a person briefed on the plans. YouTube executives have said they will spend up to $2 million an episode on a comedy, and more than $3 million on a drama, this person said.Although Mr. Kyncl would not discuss budgets, he said the company\u2019s efforts in scripted television were genuine.

{"Headline": "Microsoft Shifts From Paying Outside Lawyers by the Hour", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompanies have long chafed at law firms\u2019 practice of billing by the hour.Now, a huge corporation, Microsoft, is taking steps to move away from the traditional billing arrangement.David Howard, Microsoft\u2019s deputy general counsel, said that under a program begun last month, the software giant planned to rely much more heavily on alternative fee arrangements.Microsoft is aiming to move 90 percent of the company\u2019s legal work to such arrangements within two years, he said in a phone interview this week.The company\u2019s legal department has been examining its relationships with law firms over the past year, said Mr. Howard, who oversees litigation for Microsoft, an area in which expenditures are several hundred million dollars a year.The company\u2019s review, he said, found that it \u201cwould benefit from moving further away from a transactional model to one that encouraged deeper engagement between our lawyers and key trusted advisers.\u201dAs a result, \u201cwe\u2019ll do more work with firms on a retainer basis,\u201d he said, an approach that will \u201cembed our firms much more deeply in our work.\u201dHe emphasized that the move was less about saving money than it was about deepening relationships between Microsoft and the law firms that execute its legal strategy.\u201cWe want to create a situation that encourages our lawyers to be able to pick up the phone \u2014 without going through bureaucracy or worry about how to pay for it \u2014 and talk to the law firm about whatever is needed,\u201d he said. \u201cA firm usually handles a case, then you don\u2019t hear from them about legal developments in an area of concern, and we want to change that.\u201dThe change in Microsoft\u2019s relationship with its law firms could help spur more companies to abandon the billable hour method of charging for legal services.Corporations have been grumbling about billable hours for nearly a decade, with complaints rising after the 2008 financial crisis prompted cuts in legal budgets.Companies began hiring more in-house lawyers, reducing costs by handling more routine legal work themselves rather than assigning it to outside counsel.Most corporations have remained willing to pay for seasoned lawyers to resolve high-stakes legal matters, but they have been increasingly reluctant to subsidize additional costs like training entry-level lawyers. As demand for law firm services has decreased in recent years, firms have been more willing to agree to alternative arrangements like fixed fees to handle legal matters. Corporations have pushed this approach because it gives more certainty to their annual legal expenditures.The firms that will be part of Microsoft\u2019s revised program are Arent Fox; Covington & Burling; Davis Wright Tremaine; Fish & Richardson; Greenberg Traurig; K & L Gates; Latham & Watkins; Merchant & Gould; Orrick; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Perkins Coie; Sidley Austin; and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.Mr. Howard also said Microsoft planned to work more closely with law firms on diversity, which its legal department, along with those of companies like Facebook, has increasingly emphasized as a way to encourage firms to employ a broader variety of lawyers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Is Said to Open Broad Inquiry Into China\u2019s Trade Practices", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is preparing to open a broad investigation into China\u2019s trade practices, according to people with knowledge of the Trump administration\u2019s plans, amid growing worries in the United States over a Chinese government-led effort to make the country a global leader in microchips, electric cars and other crucial technologies of the future.The investigation will focus on alleged Chinese violations of American intellectual property, according to three people with a detailed knowledge of the administration\u2019s plans. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations were not yet public.Any move by the Trump administration to punish China over its trade practices would raise tensions within the world\u2019s largest trade relationship between two countries. China\u2019s export sector still contributes heavily to its economy growth despite Beijing\u2019s efforts to diversify its economy, and China represents a lucrative market for American automakers, technology companies like Apple, farmers and many others.At the same time, the Chinese government has demanded that American companies cut the licensing fees that they charge for key patents and has insisted that companies set up joint ventures to do business in China.Chinese officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He Weiwen, a former Commerce Ministry official and longtime trade expert who is now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, a Beijing research group, said that the Chinese government would study any American trade case before deciding how to respond and whether to seek intervention from the World Trade Organization, which hears trade disputes.\u201cChina thinks that the bilateral trade relation is governed by W.T.O. rules, not American domestic law,\u201d Mr. He said.Then the policy began to founder.The two sides met on July 19 to produce a series of trade deals that could be portrayed as an \u201cearly harvest\u201d in the three months following Mr. Trump\u2019s meeting with President Xi Jinping of China last spring at Mar-a-Lago, Trump administration officials and trade policy advisers said. The two sides were unable to agree on any deals that went significantly beyond what China had previously promised the Obama administration, they said. Both sides ended up abruptly canceling the news conferences they had scheduled to discuss what were supposed to have been their accomplishments.China has also publicly dismissed linking trade and North Korea policy and defended its efforts to improve intellectual property protections. \u201cChina highly emphasizes intellectual property protection and has taken many effective measures,\u201d said Sun Jiwen, a Commerce Ministry spokesman, in May following criticism from American trade officials.Under the process that the Trump administration plans to set in motion, the Office of the United States Trade Representative will start an investigation into China\u2019s trade practices. Following the investigation, which could be completed in as little as a few months, the United States could impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports, rescind licenses for Chinese companies to do business in the United States, or take other measures. The process is known as a Section 301 investigation, after the relevant portions of the 1974 Trade Act.Much is at stake for both sides. Exports to the United States represent more than 4 percent of China\u2019s entire economic output. Those exports have created tens of millions of jobs in China and prompted multinationals to shift thousands of factories to China along with much of their latest technology. American exports to China are much smaller, representing about two-thirds of 1 percent of the American economy.American companies have tended to supply the Chinese market using factories and staff in China, instead of exports from the United States. But their profits from the Chinese market are large enough that many corporate executives have been loath to cooperate with United States trade officials, for fear that Chinese government ministries may retaliate against them.The potential impact of the American investigation is unclear at this early stage. Still, previous cases suggest their effect on China\u2019s industrial ambitions may be limited.Mindful of those limits, Congressional Republicans discussed in recent months whether to include what is known as a border adjusted tax, which would penalize all imports while benefiting exports, in their plans to overhaul the tax code this year. But the proposed tax ran into heavy opposition from retailers like Wal-Mart that rely heavily on selling goods imported from China.Until a couple weeks ago, it had looked as though the first industry on which the Trump administration would confront China would be steel. But any move to punish Chinese steel imports could hit other nations, too, and the Trump administration decided last month to rely instead on negotiations among the Group of 20 member countries scheduled for August and November.The United States used Section 301 energetically against other countries during the Reagan administration and the administration of President George Bush. Mr. Lighthizer was a deputy United States trade representative in the Reagan administration and has been an advocate of shielding the American industrial base from government-assisted foreign competitors.But the cases then thoroughly antagonized America\u2019s trading partners.\u201cIt was really the aggressive uses of this in the late 1980s and early 1990s that prompted the rest of the world to set up the dispute resolution system\u201d of the World Trade Organization, said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics here.Follow Keith Bradsher on Twitter, @KeithBradsherJane Perlez contributed reporting, and Ailin Tang in Shanghai contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Solution to Hackers? More Hackers", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftIf there\u2019s a single lesson Americans have learned from the events of the past year, it might be this: Hackers are dangerous people. They interfere in our elections, bring giant corporations to their knees, and steal passwords and credit card numbers by the truckload. They ignore boundaries. They delight in creating chaos.But what if that\u2019s the wrong narrative? What if we\u2019re ignoring a different group of hackers who aren\u2019t lawless renegades, who are in fact patriotic, public-spirited Americans who want to use their technical skills to protect our country from cyberattacks, but are being held back by outdated rules and overly protective institutions?In other words: What if the problem we face is not too many bad hackers, but too few good ones?The topic of ethical hacking was on everyone\u2019s mind at Def Con, the hacker convention last week in Las Vegas. It\u2019s the security community\u2019s annual gathering, where thousands of hackers gathered to show their latest exploits, discuss new security research and swap cyberwar stories. Many of the hackers I spoke to were gravely concerned about Russia\u2019s wide-ranging interference in last year\u2019s election. They wanted to know: How can we stop attacks like these in the future?Partly, that\u2019s because private sector jobs tend to pay more. But it\u2019s also because the government can be an inhospitable place for a hacker. Talented hackers can be disqualified for government jobs by strict background checks, and dissuaded by hiring processes that favor candidates with more formal credentials. At Def Con, I heard stories about hackers who had interviewed for government security jobs only to be turned away because they\u2019d smoked pot as a teenager, or violated copyright law by jail-breaking their video game console.These rules may keep a few bad apples away from critical government systems, but they also prevent many talented hackers from contributing. At Def Con, I spoke with Sean Kanuck, a former C.I.A. intelligence analyst who served as the federal government\u2019s national intelligence officer for cyberissues from 2011 to 2016. He said that hackers could be enormously valuable, if they were properly enlisted in the fight against attacks.\u201cThese people may be all hackers, and they may occasionally break the law, but they all still want the banking system to work,\u201d Mr. Kanuck said. \u201cAll of them, if they end up in a hospital room, they want the infusion pump working. There\u2019s common ground. And the knowledge here is incredible.\u201dThe private sector has already discovered the benefits of hackers. Most major tech companies \u2014 including Facebook, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 offer \u201cbug bounty\u201d programs, in which they offer financial rewards to hackers who find holes in their security measures. These companies know that paying hackers up front for their expertise is significantly cheaper than cleaning up after a breach, and they understand that the risk of a hacker going rogue inside their systems is outweighed by the benefits of having well-trained experts catch bugs and vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.The most talked-about session at this year\u2019s Def Con was when hackers were let loose on a series of computerized voting machines. These machines had been used in recent American elections, and most ran on comically outdated software. Hackers eventually broke into every machine and were able to manipulate the software to register fake ballots and change vote totals. (One enterprising hacker even rigged a voting machine to play the music video for Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Gonna Give You Up.\u201d)There is, of course, the problem of outdated software. But some of the world\u2019s best security researchers have also been prohibited from poking and prodding at these machines by a thicket of copyright and anti-tampering laws. (The reason Def Con was able to test them at all is a 2015 exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that gave researchers a temporary pass to experiment on voting machines.) Now that white-hat hackers have found flaws in these machines, they can pass that knowledge on to the manufacturers and election officials, who can secure the machines ahead of the next election cycle.Hackers, it turns out, respond to incentives. But current laws don\u2019t allow hackers to test critical government systems outside of official agency-sponsored programs. As a result, we\u2019re missing out on important advice.Not all hackers are so helpful. But many are, and we should take advantage of their willingness to help secure our national infrastructure. Maybe federal workers should be subjected to a simulated hack before being allowed to access sensitive information. Or perhaps the government could create a white list of approved security researchers with a track record of ethical hacking, who would be given legal immunity for their work. Private sector companies have figured out how to bring in outside security expertise carefully, without creating a hacker free-for-all, and the government can, too.Spending a weekend at Def Con is a good way to learn how many dangers lurk in the digital world. (It wasn\u2019t just voting machines, hackers also demonstrated hacks on cars, kitchen appliances and all manner of other connected devices.) It\u2019s also a way to appreciate how necessary ethical hackers are to a modern democracy, especially one that is under siege from foreign online attackers.To paraphrase an organization with close ties to the government: The only thing that stops a bad guy with a hack is a good guy with a hack.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Washington Tries to Protect Tech, China Could Fight Back", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As the Trump administration moves to take on China over intellectual property, Washington will find it has limited firepower. Beijing has a strong grip on American technology companies, and global trade rules could favor China.But China can play a strong defense. The country has broad latitude, under special rules it negotiated with the World Trade Organization, to maintain restrictions within its market.\u201cThe problem is that U.S. trade negotiators agreed to provisions allowing China to limit market access for U.S. companies unless they engaged in joint ventures,\u201d said Michael R. Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, which Congress created to monitor the relationship between the two countries.\u201cPotential Chinese partners demand the family jewels,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies can say no, but too many give in to Chinese pressure to make a quick buck.\u201dThe current trade frictions trace back to the Clinton administration.When China was entering the W.T.O. in 1999 and 2000, American negotiators gave Beijing some leeway, a position later supported by the administration of George W. Bush. As a developing country, China was allowed extra protections, such as requirements that companies in critical industries work with Chinese partners. China, in return, promised to shed the extra rules gradually as its economy matured.But Beijing did not open up, even as China evolved into an economic powerhouse. Quite the opposite has happened under President Xi Jinping, who has pursued a more nationalistic agenda than his reform-minded predecessors.China now sees the technology sector as a critical piece of its industrial policy \u2014 a policy that Beijing is aggressively enlisting American tech giants to support and that the leadership will most likely go all out to protect.Beijing\u2019s demands have been partly driven by security concerns, particularly after disclosures by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, of electronic spying by the United States on China\u2019s rapid military buildup.China has also been explicit about its economic motives, seeking to dominate fast-growing global industries that could create millions of well-paid jobs for a generation of increasingly well-educated young Chinese.The Trump administration faces the problem that China\u2019s high trade barriers are allowed by the World Trade Organization, because China entered the group as a developing country and insists it still is one.In several cases, China\u2019s strategy to control technology approaches the kind of oversight most countries reserve for industries serving the military or government.In the chip sector, a major initiative intended to lift Chinese capabilities has drafted America\u2019s biggest makers of the electronic brains that run everything from smartphones to driverless cars. Over the past four years, America\u2019s largest chip companies have entered into a dizzying network of partnerships unlike anything they have anywhere else.Qualcomm works with a company in southwest China to develop server chips. In 2014, Intel signed agreements with two Chinese chip makers, Spreadtrum and Rockchip, to give it a leg up in the market for China\u2019s smartphones and tablets. Last year, Intel agreed to a partnership with the influential Tsinghua University in China as part of a bid to make server chips that match local specifications.American technology companies can find themselves at a serious disadvantage in China unless they agree to cooperate with government-linked Chinese businesses.Take cloud computing, the fast-growing business of leasing computer power to companies. Chinese laws require foreign companies to join with local partners and allow them only a minority stake. International businesses are also blocked from branding such services under their own names.Both Microsoft and Amazon, dominant forces in cloud computing in the United States, have local partnerships in China. By contrast, China\u2019s e-commerce giant Alibaba operates two data centers in the United States without any partner.Another rule calls for data about Chinese consumers or business operations to be stored in China. Apple and Amazon recently set up data centers in China, again with local partners, to store more customer information in the country.Against that backdrop, the call for trade action is attracting bipartisan support.China can make its own play under global trade rules. Beijing can quickly demand binding arbitration \u2014 and could have a good chance of winning. China was allowed into the W.T.O. with very few limits on its ability to regulate services or foreign investment, two categories in which China was fairly weak when it entered the organization in 2001.If China did win a W.T.O. case, it would then have the right to restrict American exports to the same extent that the United States restricts Chinese imports.China consistently exports four times as much to the United States as it imports. Even so, China could penalize American companies like Apple and Starbucks that have very large operations that produce and sell in China with minimal imports from the United States.\u201cU.S. negotiators, I think, basically dropped the ball,\u201d said Nicholas R. Lardy, a longtime trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, referring to the rules on services that were negotiated when China entered the W.T.O. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think China was very important.\u201dOn Twitter follow Keith Bradsher, @KeithBradsher, and Paul Mozur, @PaulMozurPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai.Advertisement"}

Golden, a former logistics manager at a Target store, fires up the computer in his home office in northern Florida and does what he has done for years: Put on bets that Wall Street\u2019s index of volatility, the VIX, will keep falling.\u201cThere has been a lot of white noise,\u201d said Mr. Golden last Tuesday on a day that the VIX plummeted more than 10 percent, allowing him to lock in profits from short trades. \u201cYou had North Korea, Afghanistan, Trump people resigning. But I was never nervous \u2014 so today I just sat back, ate some popcorn and cashed in my profits.\u201dOn Monday, the index ticked up, after falling 8 percent on Friday, as investors took the view that the Fed would not be raising interest rates soon after a speech by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.Now, a new generation of day traders, deploying an expanding array of opaque, high-risk, high-return trading vehicles concocted by Wall Street, are pouring into one of the market\u2019s most arcane corners, making bets on whether the VIX \u2014 otherwise known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 will rise or fall.Wagering on the fear gauge, a measure of how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead, has traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors with the cash and financial relationships to purchase the derivatives that facilitate these trades.In the years after the financial crisis, however, investment banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse came out with VIX-linked investments that investors could purchase on the stock exchange, just as if they were buying shares of IBM or Microsoft.Called exchange traded notes, they were a racier version of the exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that track every variety of index and investment strategy and now have more than $4 trillion in investor assets.Led by Barclays iPath S&P 500 Short Term Futures ETN (VXX), these investments have attracted over $14 billion in investor flows since 2012, according to FactSet, a data-gathering firm.There are now more than 30 different VIX-themed investment choices (including some that use leverage, amplifying gains and losses) that investors can snap up on a public exchange.Because they are so easy to trade and because the question driving the trade \u2014 Will the markets succumb to fear or won\u2019t they? \u2014 borders on the existential, a new wave of millennial day traders has been at the forefront of this trade.And many are using Stock Twits, the social media investing website embraced by stay-at-home investors, as well as Twitter and Facebook to passionately promote their strategies.But this explosion in interest is prompting concerns that investors may not be truly aware of what they are getting into.In theory, the murky nomenclature of these investments ought to be warning enough for amateur investors to tread with caution. And it is also true that the fund prospectuses warn bluntly that investors can lose large sums of money if they buy and hold these investments.\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d Mr. Whaley said. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201dIndeed, the most popular of the funds, the Barclays iPath fund, known broadly by its ticker symbol VXX, has since its inception averaged a yearly return of negative 58 percent, according to FactSet.While many professionals will purchase these securities to hedge their exposure to the stock market, analysts say that day traders are now using them to gamble on a sharp spike in the VIX.\u201cYou have seen this infusion of millennials coming in and buying VXX and UVXY,\u201d Mr. Moadel said, referring to the main VIX product and its leveraged cousin. \u201cBut most of the time they just get killed.\u201dDoing the killing, so to speak, have been investors like Mr. Golden, who consistently shorts VXX and UVXY whenever they spike upward.His bet is founded on two principles: one being that VXX and UVXY, because they track a basket of VIX futures, not the index itself, will decline in value over time as the contracts expire.He describes it as a heavy anvil weighing down on the value of each security.Mr. Golden also believes that in the decades since the VIX was introduced in 1993, its long-term trend has been to push consistently downward. Yes, there will be spikes as during major cataclysms (9/11, the 2008 financial crisis) and other less tumultuous events (a devaluation in China, a North Korea crisis or even a presidential tweet).But after every spike of fear must follow a longer period of calm, Mr. Golden contends, which, he argues, is a perfect scenario if your bias is to always bet against fear.\u201cThe nature of volatility is that it desensitizes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why the index has been tracking down for so long.\u201dJust as the frenetic buying of tech stocks by day traders in 1999 and 2000 came to be seen as a major factor behind the boom and bust, market experts say that traders like Mr. Golden who persistently short the VIX have distorted the market.\u201cThe VIX spikes have become more extreme \u2014 on the upside and the downside,\u201d said Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist at Deutsche Bank.Mr. Golden, who is 40, lives in a suburb of Ocala, Fla. Since he has been shorting VIX, he says his net worth has gone to $12 million from $500,000 in about five years.But, as with any trader on a roll, he likes to keep score, and he is quick to spar on Twitter with the traders who appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d program.Now, he is starting a hedge fund dedicated to wagering against the VIX. Investors, he says, have been pounding on his door to get in early, offering him $100 million for starters.That is a lot of money for a onetime Target manager.\u201cYes, it is a crowded trade,\u201d Mr. Golden acknowledged. \u201cBut I don\u2019t worry about crowds \u2014 I just worry what the next existential shock might be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated where Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist, works.
