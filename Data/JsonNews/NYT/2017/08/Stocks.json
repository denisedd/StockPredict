{"Headline": "Wall Street\u2019s Patience With Retailers\u2019 Turnaround Efforts Runs Thin", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last time Macy\u2019s increased its sales, Donald J. Trump had not started running for president and the Chicago Cubs still had not won a World Series in more than a century.Traditional department stores like Macy\u2019s have been trying to reinvent themselves, shedding stores and expanding their e-commerce operations to try to compete with Amazon and other online retailers. But this week, Wall Street\u2019s patience with such turnaround efforts wore thin, amid a string of unsettling earning reports by brick-and-mortar retailers.After Macy\u2019s reported another sales decline in the second quarter on Thursday, its share price fell more than 10 percent.On Friday, J. C. Penney shares hit their lowest price in a decade, falling 16 percent after the company said its profit margins had softened more than analysts had expected. Kohl\u2019s also fell on Friday after it reported earnings. And some analysts expect Sears to report a third consecutive double-digit decline in same-store sales for the second quarter.Before releasing second-quarter earnings this week, the retailers had raised Wall Street\u2019s hopes that the industry was showing signs of a comeback.\u201cThe expectations were getting higher that maybe things were starting to improve,\u201d said Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst at Citigroup. \u201cBut the results didn\u2019t meet those expectations.\u201dWhen J. C. Penney announced on July 10 that its chief financial officer was leaving, the company said that it expected to report \u201csignificantly improved top line results this quarter versus the first quarter.\u201dOther glimmers of improvement appeared across the department store industry. Foot traffic in malls was still down, but not as much as in previous quarters. Credit card data, which investors scour for clues about the retail sector, showed more people shopping in big department stores.That brightening outlook put pressure on a group of investors \u2014 mostly hedge funds \u2014 that have been shorting retail stocks, or betting that the share prices will fall.The retail sector is the second most actively shorted industry in the stock market behind the software and internet sector, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm. And short bets on retailers have increased 18 percent since Jan. 1.Other investors and industry specialists have dismissed such apocalyptic warnings as overblown. While some of the weaker companies with large debt loads may collapse, stronger brick-and-mortar retailers \u2014 not just Amazon \u2014 will take market share, these people say.\u201cThis is going to be the best of times for retailers that are well capitalized,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail consulting firm.Then came the actual second-quarter results this week. J. C. Penney said its sales rose in the quarter, but its gross profit margins were far lower than what analysts had predicted.The company was hit particularly hard because it is more indebted than many retailers and has been losing money.Like Macy\u2019s, J. C. Penney has been selling many of its stores. But analysts say the quality of its real estate is not as high as that of Macy\u2019s, which has prime locations in New York and San Francisco.The results announced by Macy\u2019s were slightly better than expected, but analysts noted that challenges in the company\u2019s fundamental retail business of selling clothing and home goods were being masked by profits it was generating through the sale of stores and from the income it collects on Macy\u2019s credit cards.Morgan Stanley\u2019s retail analyst described the Macy\u2019s results in a research note Friday as \u201cless bad, but not enough.\u201dNordstrom\u2019s, which also reported results this week, has been able to win over more investors to its strategies for integrating its stores and e-commerce sites.Nordstrom\u2019s, which is based in Seattle, said on Thursday that it was expanding the number of cities where shoppers can reserve clothing item online and try it on in a store \u2014 a service that few other retailers offer.On Wall Street, the reality is setting in that reinventing a business model that dates back generations will be time-consuming and expensive at best, and may not work.Retailers are gaining from finding new uses for unprofitable stores. But the costs of creating a network of e-commerce warehouses and top-flight digital capabilities are eating into precious profit margins.\u201cA big challenge changing from one channel to another,\u201d said Christian Buss, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse, \u201cis the expense.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They will arrive in Corpus Christi in the morning for a briefing on relief efforts, and then head to Austin for a tour of the Emergency Operations Center and a briefing with state leaders.The Army Corps of Engineers on Monday began releasing water from flood-control reservoirs, which is likely to worsen flooding in parts of Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.The Buffalo Bayou, the major waterway flowing west to east through the heart of the city, is already at record-high flood levels, and was projected to remain that way for days, even without the release from the Addicks and Barker reservoirs at the western edge of Houston.\u201cAs they increase the water and it comes down, the water level along Buffalo Bayou, in all probability, it will increase,\u201d Mr. Turner said at a news conference. People who were not in a crisis state yesterday may find themselves in a crisis state today,\u201d he added.With the reservoirs at capacity, the Army Corps began releasing water from them before dawn. Mr. Turner said the release was 5,000 cubic feet per second, and would increase to 8,000.Rescues of people stranded by floodwaters continued throughout southeastern Texas, and Gov. Greg Abbott said the state was sending hundreds more boats and high-clearance vehicles to the region to aid those efforts.The city of Dallas is opening a \u201cmega-shelter\u201d to house up to 5,000 evacuees from the battered Gulf Coast, and Mayor Mike Rawlings said on Monday the North Texas city has been asked to brace for \u201cnumbers that could be up in the tens of thousands.\u201d In Fort Worth, 30 miles west of Dallas, Mayor Betsy Price said city officials are also preparing to activate shelters once the state requests assistance.In San Antonio, empty warehouses were being readied as shelters for 4,100 evacuees.The cars, it seemed, were everywhere, abandoned with few clues as to how their drivers had escaped or what became of those people afterward.As Harvey continued to unleash itself on Houston, abandoned vehicles became eerie symbols of the storm\u2019s destruction.Cars sat half-smashed on the side of the road and alone in muddy fields. A red sedan was trapped in a road-turned-river in the Galleria area. A cluster of trucks and S.U.V.s were stuck in a highway-turned-lake on U.S. 59 East.Harvey so far has caused at least eight refineries in Texas to shut down.The AAA said gasoline was selling for $2.37 a gallon on average across the country, four cents more than a week ago.Whether prices rise further depends on the damage ultimately sustained by refineries in the Texas Gulf Coast area, said Jeanette Casselano, an AAA spokeswoman. \u201cThe situation is still pretty fluid,\u201d she said.The affected refineries represent about 12 percent of the nation\u2019s refining capacity, according to a report by Goldman Sachs.Ms. Casselano noted that oil companies had ample stocks of oil and gasoline, which should limit the chances of immediate shortages. \u201cThroughout the country we have high levels of supplies,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gasoline in bulk storage in Houston, but right now you can\u2019t get to it.\u201dAn exit ramp on Beltway 8, a freeway that encircles Houston, has become an impromptu boat ramp.Coast Guard vehicles, state troopers in sport utility vehicles and a raft of amateur rescuers in trucks used the ramp as a kind of staging area, backing trailers into the floodwaters and sending boats speeding off toward houses in the distance, in a flooded area opposite the Sheldon Reservoir a few miles from Bush Intercontinental Airport.John Malbrough, 35, steered his 14-foot ski boat through the waters and tied up at the side of the ramp and took a smoke break.

{"Headline": "Uber Board Considers 3 Investment Offers to Buy Company\u2019s Shares", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Uber\u2019s board has voted to move forward on proposals by two investment groups to buy shares in the ride-hailing service and is considering a third offer, with any final decision set to affect who gains the upper hand at the company.The three proposals were described by four people close to the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The offers \u2014 which are mostly focused on buying Uber stock from current shareholders, rather than issuing new shares \u2014 are preliminary. At this stage, the investment groups will begin a due diligence process that could eventually lead to formal investment terms.Yet even as Uber undergoes leadership troubles, the company \u2014 which is largely funded by venture capital and private equity firms \u2014 remains an attractive investment because it is the world\u2019s biggest ride-hailing service and is growing fast.Uber itself does not need new money; the company has raised more than $10 billion in debt and equity and has some $5 billion in the bank.But the board considered the proposals for a variety of reasons. For some of Uber\u2019s existing shareholders, selling stock now could help lock in a hefty profit at a time when the company\u2019s future is unclear. One of the proposals could also lead to the ouster of one investor whose firm \u2014 Benchmark \u2014 has an Uber board seat and that some other board members believe is deliberately damaging the company.One concern has been whether a share sale could end up negatively affecting Uber\u2019s valuation, which stands at $68.5 billion and has made the company the most highly valued private start-up in the world.Two of the three proposals include buying shares at a discount to Uber\u2019s valuation, but also provide a face-saving way for the company to maintain its $68.5 billion value. Dragoneer\u2019s investment coalition wants to buy out shareholders at a discount to Uber\u2019s current valuation, and SoftBank is offering to buy shares at a lower valuation as well. But both groups would also purchase a small amount of new shares at Uber\u2019s current valuation to keep the company\u2019s value propped up on paper.The group led by Mr. Pishevar said it would purchase the shares at the current valuation. Whichever deal ultimately gets approved, this would be the first time that Uber has sold a large chunk of shares at a price that was the same on paper as a previous round of financing.A spokesman for Uber and a spokeswoman for Uber\u2019s board declined to comment, as did SoftBank and a spokeswoman for Mr. Pishevar. Dragoneer did not respond to a request for comment.SoftBank emerged as one of the first to be interested in buying Uber shares. For months, the conglomerate has angled to purchase the shares from existing investors at a discount to the company\u2019s current valuation. To let Uber preserve its $68.5 billion valuation on paper, SoftBank agreed to put a small amount of new money into the company at that price.More recently, an investor coalition led by Dragoneer, which includes the private equity firm General Atlantic and others, has emerged with a deal that would protect Uber\u2019s valuation. The proposal incudes a small purchase of new shares at the current valuation, but the bulk of the investment would come through buying out existing shareholders at a discount via a so-called Dutch auction \u2014 an auction that begins with a high price that declines until a buyer says yes.Uber\u2019s board voted a little more than a week ago for the Dragoneer deal to move forward.The deal was complicated by the emergence last week of another investor consortium led by Mr. Pishevar. The group made a straightforward offer to buy Uber shares from an existing investor at the company\u2019s $68.5 billion valuation.But as a condition of the sale, Mr. Pishevar wants to buy out 75 percent of the shares held by Benchmark, one of Uber\u2019s earliest and largest investors. That would cause Benchmark to step down from its seat on Uber\u2019s board.\u201cWhile I publicly asked you to resign from the Uber board in light of the overall circumstances, I do have tremendous appreciation for your role in helping the company\u2019s development in the past,\u201d Mr. Pishevar said in a new letter to Benchmark on Saturday, which was obtained by The New York Times.A spokeswoman for Benchmark did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s a Myth That Corporate Tax Cuts Mean More Jobs", "Date": "2017-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorEvery $1 billion in tax savings would create 7,000 well-paying jobs, Mr. Stephenson went on to say. The correlation between lower corporate taxes and more jobs, he assured viewers, runs \u201cvery, very tight.\u201dAs Congress prepares to take up tax legislation this fall, including an effort to reduce the corporate tax rate, this bold jobs claim merits examination. Notably, it comes from the chief executive of a company that\u2019s already paying comparatively little in federal taxes.Despite the enormous savings AT&T has realized, the company has been downsizing. Although it hires thousands of people a year, the company, by our analysis at the Institute for Policy Studies, reduced its total work force by nearly 80,000 jobs between 2008 and 2016, accounting for acquisitions and spinoffs each involving more than 2,000 workers.Companies buy back their stock for various reasons \u2014 to take advantage of undervaluation, to reward stockholders by increasing the value of their shares or to make the company look more attractive to investors. And there is another reason. Because most executive compensation these days is based on stock value, higher share prices can raise the compensation of chief executives and other top company officials.Since 2008, Mr. Stephenson has cashed in $124 million in stock options and grants.Many other large American corporations have also been playing the tax break and loophole game. Their huge tax savings have enriched executives but not created significant numbers of new jobs.Our report analyzes the 92 publicly held American corporations that reported a profit in the United States every year from 2008 through 2015 and paid less than 20 percent of their earnings in federal income tax.We chose this particular tax threshold because, as Mr. Stephenson mentioned, House Republicans are proposing to reduce the federal statutory corporate tax rate to 20 percent, down from the current 35 percent. President Trump wants an even deeper cut, down to 15 percent.If claims about the job-creation benefits of lower tax rates had any validity, these 92 consistently profitable firms would be among the nation\u2019s strongest job creators. Instead, we found just the opposite.The companies we reviewed had a median job-growth rate over the past nine years of nearly negative 1 percent, compared with 6 percent for the private sector as a whole. Of those 92 companies, 48 got rid of a combined total of 483,000 jobs.At the companies that cut jobs, chief executives\u2019 pay last year averaged nearly $15 million, compared with the $13 million average for S&P 500 companies.Instead of tax-rate cuts for these big corporations, the coming tax debate in Congress should focus on making wealthy individuals and big corporations pay their fair share.American multinationals hold $2.6 trillion in profits \u201coffshore,\u201d on which they would owe $750 billion in federal taxes if the money was repatriated. In most cases, these foreign profit stashes are merely an accounting fiction. Companies retain full access to these funds for use in the United States and could, if their executives so chose, use them to create jobs here.Ordinary Americans have to pay all the taxes they owe each and every year. Offshore corporations should be required to do the same.Beyond closing loopholes, we need to explore new ways to raise revenue fairly, including a tax on Wall Street speculation.Most of us already pay a sales tax on gasoline, clothes and other basics. Why should hedge fund investors and other Wall Street traders pay no tax at all when they engage in short-term buying and selling of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of stocks and derivatives? A fee of just a small fraction of 1 percent on each Wall Street trade would encourage longer-term investment while generating huge revenue for real job creation.The message policy makers really need to hear? Stop peddling the myth that \u201ctax relief\u201d for big companies will be good for the rest of us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Stocks Reach New Heights, What\u2019s Trump Got to Do With It?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBook\u201cBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dIt was, all things considered, a factually accurate statement. Business is looking better. The stock market is at a high. And, yes, it did not happen by itself.The question, however, is this: Has anything that has happened at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had anything to do with it?Putting aside the administration\u2019s inability to successfully pass any meaningful legislation thus far \u2014 and that\u2019s a lot to put aside \u2014 can Mr. Trump fairly take any credit for the market\u2019s trajectory? After all, when I and others talk to C.E.O.s and investors, one constant refrain we hear is that they actually expect little to get done on the legislative front.Where they repeatedly said they were expecting big changes \u2014 that will translate into higher profits \u2014 was in Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to lower regulatory burdens and costs, something that he could accomplish, in part, through executive orders and the appointment of regulators who are less inclined to enforce the rules aggressively.But that\u2019s not right. Listen to the earnings conference calls of the biggest publicly traded companies over the past several weeks \u2014 which are the real reason the stock market has soared \u2014 and virtually none of those phone calls attributed higher profits to reduced costs to comply with regulations.The only time the word \u201cregulation\u201d was even used on Apple\u2019s earnings call \u2014 during which the company described how it beat analysts\u2019 estimates by a wide margin \u2014 was in reference to China. The word did not get a mention on Amazon\u2019s earnings call, nor was there any reference to Washington at all, despite constant chatter about how antitrust policy should be applied to the retailing behemoth.Even on Goldman Sachs\u2019s earnings call, which included several questions and answers related to regulations, not once did any official suggest that the firm\u2019s earnings were a result of lighter regulatory burdens. Indeed, the bank warned several times that it was too early and too difficult to predict exactly how deregulation efforts would affect its various businesses.\u201cThe administration is, at a minimum, telling a one-sided story \u2014 it\u2019s a bit disingenuous,\u201d Charles Campbell, managing director at MKM Partners, said about Mr. Trump and his team\u2019s taking credit for the rising stock market. \u201cFor the average American who is uninformed, it probably passes\u201d as sounding correct, he lamented.But Mr. Campbell said it was \u201ca little early\u201d for companies to see direct benefits from deregulation efforts. \u201cThis is the first full reporting period, quite honestly,\u201d since Mr. Trump took office, he noted.In industries like finance, Mr. Campbell said, stocks are trading with the expectation that there will be business-friendly changes in the regulatory environment. \u201cIt is the anticipation that there will be an effect,\u201d he said.It is very true that Mr. Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda should eventually make its way into the earnings reports of United States companies, but to suggest that it has already happened is a stretch.The larger issue is, when it does happen, how much can deregulation really help juice the economy?The answer will not satisfy those who have been clamoring for a change in policy.According to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a conservative economist who served in the George W. Bush administration and advised Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, deregulatory efforts will not do nearly as much as some people assume.But here\u2019s the rub: It isn\u2019t that simple, in large part because a huge amount of that figure is a transfer in wealth to comply with the regulations. Mr. Holtz-Eakin estimates the real savings of deregulation are more like $225 billion.Twitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Market\u2019s Surge Meets Dollar\u2019s Swoon", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySix months into the Trump presidency, two symbols of American financial might \u2014 the Dow and the dollar \u2014 have taken divergent paths, highlighting the complexities that investors face as the global economy hums, while Washington is enmeshed in political turmoil.Over this same period, the United States dollar has lost about 10 percent of its value against a basket of six major currencies.The near-mirror image fall in the dollar has been especially pronounced in recent weeks, stemming in part from concerns that President Trump\u2019s political problems will hamper his ability to pass a major tax reduction or an infrastructure bill.Yet those concerns have yet to halt the stock market\u2019s seemingly unstoppable advance. Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to record highs in the Dow as a validation of his administration, posting on Twitter on Tuesday morning:\u201cStock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22,000 today. Was 18,000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d\u201cWhether you like the administration, the people, the rhetoric or not, there is no overstating just how powerful the animal spirits have been,\u201d said Atul Lele, chief investment officer for Deltec International Group, an investment firm based in Nassau, Bahamas. \u201cYou are seeing it in the data and it is evident in the financial markets as well.\u201dWhile there is no doubt that the animal spirits have done their work, just as important to the market\u2019s recent rally has been the significant fall in the dollar \u2014 not just against the euro and the yen, but against more volatile currencies like the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.Even the Chinese renminbi, once criticized by Mr. Trump as artificially low, has gained value against the dollar, climbing more than 3 percent for the year.A dollar in retreat means that trillions more dollars are sloshing around the global economy, ending up in 100-year Argentine bonds, Turkish airline stocks, junk bonds with stripped down investor protections and, of course, Dow stalwarts like Amazon, Microsoft and Boeing.\u201cDollar weakness means that there is increased liquidity all around the world,\u201d said Mr. Lele, the investment officer. \u201cAnd all that is flowing into carry trades.\u201dThe carry trade is financial jargon that describes the flow of money from low return assets to those with a higher return \u2014 not least when investors use a cheaper asset (dollars) to pay for riskier assets that promise better performance.When central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, intervened aggressively in global markets after the financial crisis, the immediate effect was rock bottom interest rates, a weak dollar and a search for \u201ccarry\u201d by global investors.Yet this trade lost some of its urgency in recent years as investors bet that the Fed would raise rates and that Mr. Trump\u2019s expansive fiscal policies would give a boost to the United States economy and the dollar.Instead, Trump administration officials have veered from the standard practice of talking up the dollar by pretty much doing the opposite. This approach was spurred largely by the administration\u2019s tough talk on trade and support for American manufacturers whose exports benefit from a less robust dollar.But it is also true that Mr. Trump, both from within his cabinet and his outside panel of economic advisers, has heard the view from Wall Street that an overly strong dollar would not help American financial markets.Edward Yardeni, an independent investment strategist, refers to the recent run-up in stocks, after what has already been one of the longest bull markets in financial history, as a \u201cmarket melt-up.\u201dThink of it as a rush of perhaps less discerning money into stocks, propelling stock market indexes past one historical milestone after another.For example, as of Monday, the Dow had reached 30 record highs this year, according to research by Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm.In a recent strategy note, Mr. Yardeni highlighted the effect of investor money pouring into exchange traded funds, which are easily traded, low-cost funds that track all varieties of indexes and investment themes.Over the last year, $232 billion has flowed into E.T.F.s that invest in domestic equities. In recent months, as the dollar has softened, global E.T.F.s that invest in Europe and emerging markets have been deluged with money and have taken in $121 billion for the year.Leading the way have been E.T.F.s that invest in higher-yielding, harder-to-trade securities like emerging market bonds, leveraged loans and bonds issued by low-rated corporations.Institutional and retail investors use the funds to make quick and longer term investment bets. But much of the flows, of late, seem to be coming from retail investors, many of whom were sitting on the sidelines in the last few years, analysts say.\u201cRight now, the market thinks the future looks good,\u201d said Peter Mallouk, the founder of Creative Planning, an independent investment adviser managing more than $26 billion out of Leawood, Kan. \u201cCorporate earnings are up, corporate taxes are expected to drop and most importantly, unemployment continues to trend lower.\u201dBeyond the stimulative effect that a struggling dollar has on global investment flows, some analysts point to another, more specific reason that might explain the near perfect correlation between the dollar\u2019s fall and the Dow\u2019s rise.The Dow, much more so than the S.&P. 500 and the Nasdaq composite index, has a weightier concentration in multinationals that rely on exporting their goods overseas, like Caterpillar, Boeing and Coca-Cola, to name a few.The weak dollar and strong growth in Asia, Europe and many emerging markets will be a boon for these companies, a number of which suffered in past years when the dollar was ascendant and worries about Europe and developing nations abounded.\u201cThere is no doubt that the big news \u2014 a drop in the dollar \u2014 is benefiting the Dow more than other indices,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for the Leuthold Group, an investment firm based in Minneapolis.\u201cIt has multinationals, and it benefits from improved trade flows. So dollar weakness may propel the Dow to 22,000 and beyond.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Uber Investor Sues Ex-C.E.O. Travis Kalanick", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravis Kalanick may no longer be Uber\u2019s chief executive, but he\u2019s still a major figure at the ride-hailing company.The lawsuit filed in Delaware Chancery Court is the latest flare-up over the fate of Uber, the privately held company founded eight years ago by Mr. Kalanick that is valued at nearly $70 billion.The litigation is focused on how Mr. Kalanick gained control of several Uber board seats in 2016. Benchmark asserts that he did so through \u201cmaterial misstatements and fraudulent concealment\u201d of information and his \u201coverarching objective is to pack Uber\u2019s board with loyal allies in an effort to insulate his prior conduct from scrutiny and clear the path for his eventual return as C.E.O. \u2014 all to the detriment of Uber\u2019s stockholders, employees, driver-partners, and customers.\u201dThe lawsuit says Mr. Kalanick deliberately hid problems at Uber and fraudulently obtained the right to select three new board seats when the board expanded to 11 directors in 2016.After he stepped down, Mr. Kalanick left the board seat designated for the chief executive, but immediately reappointed himself to one of the three seats he controlled, the lawsuit asserts. He has since refused to give up control of the other two board seats, according to the lawsuit.A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick said, \u201cThe lawsuit is completely without merit and riddled with lies and false allegations.\u201d The spokesman said Benchmark was acting in \u201cits own best interests\u201d instead of in those of Uber, and added that Mr. Kalanick \u201cis confident that these entirely baseless claims will be rejected.\u201dRelated ReadingAn index known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d surged from historically low levels on Thursday as markets declined.The VIX stayed in single-digit territory for many weeks this year, unusual for an index that had long traded around 20.\u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201d asked Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo.The company, which has become a bellwether for the struggling retail industry, saw its shares fall more than 10 percent as investors worried about traditional brick-and-mortar stores.The rise in e-commerce has hurt Macy\u2019s and other traditional retailers.

{"Headline": "Car Owners Inundate Insurers With Claims After Hurricane Harvey", "Date": "2017-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuto insurers were already bracing for another bad year when the downpour started in Texas, producing potentially hundreds of thousands of new claims.\u201cWe do know that approximately 100,000 claims have come in\u201d as of Thursday, said Matt Stillwell, manager of governmental and regulatory communications at the Insurance Council of Texas, a trade association. He said the number was expected to climb as high as 500,000.\u201cIt is looking to be a huge impact on the auto insurance market,\u201d he said.That means few people moved their cars out of harm\u2019s way before the flooding started. Texas drivers are not required to have comprehensive auto insurance \u2014 the type that covers flood and other types of damage. People holding only the legally required insurance \u2014 liability coverage for damage done to other people\u2019s cars \u2014 will not have valid claims, Mr. Stillwell said.Those who have comprehensive insurance should get a payment based on replacement value minus depreciation, if their car is a total loss.For insurers, the losses will affect some more than others. The big, household-name auto insurers \u201chave sufficient geographic and product diversification to absorb the losses,\u201d S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a report on the impact of the storm and flooding on various parts of the insurance industry.But \u201csome of the regional and local players could face significant hits to their earnings, and possibly their capital,\u201d the ratings firm added.As a possible example, it cited Hochheim Prairie Insurance, a mutual insurer that does business solely in Texas, offering auto insurance and other personal lines. Mutual insurers are owned by their policyholders and do not issue stock in the public markets, so they cannot raise fresh capital by selling new shares.Pam Lahodney, a vice president of marketing and underwriting at Hochheim, said in an email that it was too early for the company to assess the financial effects of the storm on its business. \u201cAt this time, our focus is to provide assistance to those members impacted by Hurricane Harvey,\u201d she said.State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, Allstate Insurance, Farmers Insurance Exchange, National Indemnity Company (an affiliate of Geico), the Progressive Group, and Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance (a unit of MetLife) are among the big companies that write a large portion of their auto insurance business in Texas.Representatives of Allstate, Progressive and MetLife said they were busy dealing with policyholders in the flooded region and it was too early to estimate the magnitude of the disaster.Many auto insurers have been troubled in recent years by underwriting losses caused by factors unrelated to floods: texting and otherwise distracted drivers who cause accidents; increasingly complicated car components that cost more to repair; more miles driven, thanks to lower gasoline prices; and increasingly severe crashes that are raising the cost of treating the injured.A few large insurers, including Geico, Allstate and Progressive, have managed to avoid losses on underwriting in recent years. But in March, Fitch Ratings said auto insurers in the aggregate were reporting their weakest performance in 15 years.State Farm, the nation\u2019s largest property and casualty insurer, is also the leading example of the negative underwriting trend. It reported in February that its 2016 underwriting losses on auto insurance had increased to $7 billion, from $4.4 billion in 2015. Its other lines of business were generally profitable.State Farm is a mutual insurer, and therefore does not have any shares whose price would swing in response to the news. Nor does it have shareholders to pressure it to turn around its financial performance quickly. Like the other insurers, State Farm seeks to earn investment income that would offset its underwriting losses.Fitch\u2019s analyst, James B. Auden, said the auto insurers were already increasing their rates last year in response to their rising claim costs. He cited a 7.6 percent annual increase as of February, significantly higher than the overall rate of inflation. But state regulators often limit rate increases in a given year, so more increases are likely.Mr. Auden said the losses in Texas could drive up rates in the state, but were unlikely to affect insurance premiums elsewhere, because rate-setting is handled state by state.Kai Pan, an insurance equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, noted that insurance stocks generally decline immediately after a natural disaster, reflecting the possibility of big losses, then bounce back three to six months later \u201cas losses become more defined and rates respond positively.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street, Climbing Sharply, Skips Washington\u2019s \u2018Soap Opera\u2019", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the disorder in Washington \u2014 with a revolving door at the White House and roadblocks on Capitol Hill \u2014 Wall Street and corporate America are booming.\u201cNone of the soap opera in Washington matters,\u201d said Frank Sullivan, chief executive of RPM International, a Cleveland-based maker of specialty coatings and sealants like Rust-Oleum. \u201cNobody in business cares about who talked to who in Russia.\u201dWhat does matter, Mr. Sullivan said, is stronger global demand in heavy industries like mining and oil and gas, a weaker dollar that helps exporters, and a lighter regulatory touch by the new administration.The initial stock market rally that followed Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in November \u2014 the so-called Trump bump \u2014 was fueled by optimism among investors that long-sought action on tax reform and infrastructure spending might finally be at hand.Few analysts are so sanguine now, especially after Republicans could not agree last month on how to repeal the Affordable Care Act, after years of promising to do so. If anything, simplifying the tax code or investing in new roads and bridges seems farther out of reach than ever.But a market surge based on political hopes has been replaced by one more firmly grounded in the financial realm.Besides steady economic growth or less regulation, investors also have been encouraged by the loose reins of central banks like the Federal Reserve, which have helped keep interest rates not far above their historic lows. Inflation, too, remains tame, with price increases in recent months actually falling short of the Fed\u2019s targets.At the same time, with yields on safe assets like government bonds so minuscule, there are few appealing alternatives to stocks for investors, according to Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.\u201cNo matter how you look at valuations, they are high,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as money flows into pension funds every month and needs to be invested, why would I put it in bonds?\u201cCorporations in America and Europe are still inventing new products and finding ways of doing things more efficiently,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cThis is separate from the political theater around the world.\u201dMoreover, corporate earnings \u2014 the fundamental driver of individual stock performance \u2014 have been robust.\u201cThe first six months of the year have been the best period for earnings growth since 2011,\u201d said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.Still, many Wall Street investors who are bullish over the longer-term, including Mr. Orlando, concede that the risk of a stock market correction was rising.\u201cWe\u2019ve had this fabulous run since the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut could we see an air pocket in the next few months? Absolutely. Our best guess is that the next 5 percent move is more likely to be down than up.\u201dBut for now, whichever way the stock market goes, most economic metrics like hiring, consumer sentiment and home prices continue to point in the right direction.\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of it in Cleveland, and small businesses are looking forward instead of over their shoulder,\u201d said Mr. Sullivan, who is the older brother of Senator Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican.\u201cWhen Washington practices the Hippocratic oath toward business \u2014 first, do no harm \u2014 it\u2019s amazing what the American economy can do,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder the prior administration, you had a very, very aggressive regulatory environment in which businesses felt under attack.\u201dEasing regulation is also something Mr. Trump can do with the stroke of a pen or with appointments to agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Federal Reserve, which require confirmation but not legislation.To be sure, the glow from Wall Street extends only so far. According to the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, less than 15 percent of American households owned individual stocks and only half had any exposure to the broader market, including through mutual funds or retirement plans.\u201cOnly people with assets like stocks and houses are benefiting, and that\u2019s why this recovery has been weak,\u201d Mr. Slok said.The contradictory signals between the markets and the political world are hardly unique to the United States. \u201cMost investors in Europe are rolling their eyes at the U.S., but what\u2019s ironic is that it\u2019s similar to the European situation,\u201d Mr. Slok said.As in Washington, Mr. Slok said, there has been a lot of uncertainty in Brussels and other capitals over major issues, including Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union, the economic drag from the continent\u2019s restrictive labor laws and Greece\u2019s fiscal problems.If the stock market\u2019s prospects are unclear, then the outlook in Washington six months into the Trump administration is downright gloomy.The year began with Mr. Trump promising to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act; pass the most significant overhaul to the tax code since 1986; and get Congress to pass legislation to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. None of that has been accomplished, as Republicans have struggled to shift from being an opposition party to one that governs.Beyond those disappointments, fiscal land mines lie ahead that could rattle the economy if Republicans and Democrats cannot cooperate.By the end of September, Congress must reach a deal to lift the debt ceiling and fund the government for the coming fiscal year. Republicans remain divided over whether conditions such as spending cuts should be attached to raising the statutory borrowing limit. A standoff with Democrats over Mr. Trump\u2019s request to finance a border wall could lead to a partial government shutdown.The lack of progress has only led to more sniping among Republicans. This week Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cI think what\u2019s hurting the legislative agenda is Congress\u2019s inability to get things passed.\u201dMr. Trump has pointed to the growing economy and strong employment figures as evidence that his agenda is thriving. The data is indeed encouraging, but not very different from the figures he used as a candidate to paint a picture of economic despair.Still, the stock market\u2019s gains were likely to hold up as long as earnings remained buoyant, said Laszlo Birinyi, a longtime stock market analyst.\u201cWhile people may have strong feelings in other areas, the stock market is predicated on dollars and cents,\u201d he said.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking the Addiction Out of Smoking", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe new F.D.A. chief, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, didn\u2019t mince words in making the announcement. He noted that tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, resulting in nearly half a million annual fatalities. And he pointed out that the cigarette is the only consumer product that kills when used as directed \u2014 half of its long-term users, in fact \u2014 and that nicotine is the root cause of cigarette addiction.Reducing nicotine in cigarettes so that they are \u201cminimally or nonaddictive,\u201d he asserted, \u201cis a cornerstone of our new and more comprehensive approach to effective tobacco regulation.\u201dCigarettes with nonaddictive nicotine levels would be radically different from what used to be known as \u201clow tar\u201d or \u201clight\u201d cigarettes, marketing gimmicks now barred by law. Those cigarettes were advertised as delivering less nicotine and tar into the lungs, even though there was no actual reduction.Under the F.D.A. proposal, nicotine in cigarettes would be set at a level so low that smokers would not be able to extract enough to create or sustain addiction. Cigarette makers today keep the nicotine at between 1 and 2 percent by weight, having found this to be the Goldilocks optimum, neither too harsh nor too mild. Reducing this percentage by a factor of 10 would make it very difficult for cigarettes to become addictive. Reducing it even further would make addiction virtually impossible. Kids might start smoking, but they wouldn\u2019t have trouble quitting.Nicotine is water-soluble and easy to remove by simply soaking the tobacco leaf. Nicotine-free cigarettes date from the 19th century, and sophisticated techniques developed after World War II allow the manufacture of cigarettes with any nicotine level desired in the finished leaf.In the 1980s, genetic engineering produced tobacco plants that were entirely free of nicotine. Philip Morris even rolled out three brands of cigarettes from which 97 percent of the nicotine had been removed \u2014 Merit De-Nic, Benson & Hedges De-Nic and Next. But sales were disappointing, in part because high-nicotine cigarettes remained on the market, and the industry\u2019s campaign to deny all evidence of harm precluded an advertising campaign highlighting the benefits of these new products.Of course, we can expect the industry to fight this new proposal, which threatens the historical mainstay of their business. It will claim that lowering the nicotine in cigarettes to such a low level amounts to a de facto ban, which is prohibited by the F.D.A.\u2019s charter. Tobacco companies no doubt will warn of the rise of a bootleg-era black market for high-nicotine cigarettes.The industry would still be able to sell nicotine in other forms, like e-cigarettes, nicotine orbs, sticks and lozenges, for example, and gums and patches. And people would still be able to buy cigarettes. But the important point is that they would also be able to quit at will. Smoking would return to being a matter of free choice.How quickly will the F.D.A. move to establish a nicotine standard? One worrisome sign is that the plan is part of a \u201cmultiyear road map.\u201d But there is an urgency here that should not be forgotten. Dr. Gottlieb himself warned that if present consumption rates continue into the 2050s, 17 million more Americans will lose their lives to tobacco.If the industry is serious about what it claims to want, maybe cigarette makers should sit down with the F.D.A. and hammer out a plan to end this catastrophic and entirely preventable epidemic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wine War in Southern France Has Streets Running Red", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVigilante vignerons had previously raided two big wine distributors nearby, in the Languedoc wine-producing region, smashing offices and dumping a river of red wine into the streets.The businesses had one thing in common: They had struck deals to import inexpensive wine from Spain, prompting a backlash among local winemakers who feared their livelihoods were under attack.\u201cI was stupefied,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Vergnes, a native of Languedoc who has run the Passerieux Vergnes wine brokerage business for 35 years. \u201cEverything was destroyed.\u201dMr. Vergnes was the latest target in a wine war across France\u2019s largest winegrowing area, pitting independent wine producers against imports from other European Union countries, and the businesses that deal in them.Wine rebels have executed dozens of attacks in protest since last summer, including ambushing Spanish wine trucks at the border and dumping the payload on highways.The most aggressive rebels are part of a secret commando organization that targeted businesses like Mr. Vergnes\u2019s, which had brokered a handful of Spanish wine contracts for French clients.\u201cMany people are just scraping by, but no one is listening,\u201d said Lionel Puech, a co-president of the Young Farmers Association, a union that has admitted to joining some of the militant actions, none of which have yet resulted in prosecutions.France has sought to calm nerves. Last month, the government held a meeting of French and Spanish wine representatives and ministers. They condemned the violence and agreed to strengthen relations.In Languedoc territory, where vineyards stretch from the Rh\u00f4ne Valley to the Spanish border, such statements make little difference.While some local wineries have invested in higher-quality products, many vignerons still produce inexpensive table wine for the budget-conscious market.But with labor costs and taxes nearly twice as high as those in Spain, French producers struggle to compete on price. France also imposes strict grape growing regulations that are more costly to follow than rules in Spain and other European countries.\u201cSpanish wine doesn\u2019t conform to our rules, but the E.U. requires us to accept it,\u201d said Mr. Puech, who owns a small vineyard in La Rouvi\u00e8re, a village north of N\u00eemes. \u201cThe E.U. is proving to be a hollow shell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt creates competitive disadvantages within the single market.\u201dSpanish wine producers see that argument as an excuse for protectionism. \u201cWe can produce the wine at lower cost because salaries are less,\u201d said Juan Corbal\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, who represents the Agri-Food Cooperatives in Brussels. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re doing unfair competition.\u201dYet when everything is tallied, small Languedoc vignerons take home little more than France\u2019s monthly minimum wage. Even that can quickly turn negative if a harvest is poor or retailers cut orders.This time, wine merchants and brokers like Mr. Vergnes turned to Spain to fill the shortfall. When the harvest rebounded, Languedoc producers were stuck with vast amounts of unsold wine.Languedoc vintners revolted.Thousands demonstrated, petitioning the government to even the playing field by reducing taxes and regulatory costs. Unions met with retailers to demand more-visible country-of-origin labeling.When the meetings produced no results, vignerons took matters into their own hands.Mr. Puech and other activists smashed thousands of bottles at retailers like Carrefour, which carried cheap Spanish wines made to look French, with pictures of chateaus and lavender fields, and selling them at the same price as the competing Languedoc fare, creating sizable margins for the retailers.The Comit\u00e9 R\u00e9gional d\u2019Action Viticole, a radical group that goes by the acronym CRAV, also sprang into action. Known for violent actions that have included dynamiting some targets, it has operated underground in Languedoc for over a century, resurfacing when fresh financial hardship hits winegrowers.One CRAV vigilante, a Languedoc winegrower who insisted on anonymity, citing the police investigation, said people had been pushed to their limits. He added that activists were halting their actions for now, but could resume if things didn\u2019t improve.The winegrower said he had seen his father and other Languedoc families fall into a debilitating debt spiral during earlier wine crises, and wanted to head off new hardship.\u201cI\u2019m not doing this for pleasure,\u201d he said of his participation in the raids. \u201cBut in the global system, it\u2019s always those at the bottom of the ladder who suffer. We want to be heard.\u201dMr. Vergnes was still reeling from the impact that message had on his business. But as a native of the area, he admitted it resonated.\u201cLanguedoc has always been a hot-blooded place,\u201d Mr. Vergnes said.\u201cBut I can understand that they are in a crisis,\u201d he added. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t done all this, would things really change?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gary Cohn, Trump\u2019s Adviser, Said to Have Drafted Resignation Letter After Charlottesville", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Cohn ultimately changed his mind and decided in recent days to remain on as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, said one person familiar with his thinking.Mr. Cohn is an architect of a broad set of tax reforms that the White House hopes will deliver the first legislative victory of Mr. Trump\u2019s tumultuous administration. The president next week will travel to Springfield, Mo., in a push to sell the tax reform package.But Mr. Cohn was anguished, according to a friend and two other people familiar with his thinking, by Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks after the Aug. 12 violence that resulted in the death of a 32-year-old woman who was protesting neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan demonstrators in Charlottesville.On Aug. 15, Mr. Cohn stood nearby in the lobby of Trump Tower, where the president told reporters there also were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the Charlottesville rally. After Mr. Trump left, Mr. Cohn stood uncomfortably fielding questions about the president\u2019s statements, and he repeatedly declined to comment.He debated for over a week with his wife and friends on whether to quit, according to the people familiar with his thinking. This week, Mr. Cohn decided to remain in his job, believing he could be more effective as a public servant inside the White House than out of it.As Mr. Trump stood by his equivocal comments on Charlottesville and business leaders left presidential advisory panels in protest, Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, he felt \u201cenormous pressure\u201d to step down. Various friends, and Mr. Cohn\u2019s wife, were at one point among those who were urging him to resign, said several people familiar with their advice.A senior administration official said the president was not surprised by Mr. Cohn\u2019s remarks to The Financial Times. Another official said the sentiments had been relayed clearly to Mr. Trump, and Mr. Cohn had said that if asked, he would say how he felt.But on Friday, Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, tweeted that Mr. Cohn \u201cshould be fired immediately for his public attack on the president.\u201d In his tweet, Mr. Stone misspelled the name of Mr. Cohn, whom he has aggressively criticized, and said the economic adviser was \u201crecommended for his White House job by Jared Kushner.\u201dIt is highly unusual for a senior member of any presidential administration to publicly discuss the possibility of stepping down. Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, said even though Mr. Cohn did not criticize Mr. Trump by name in the Financial Times interview, \u201cthe comments are still very tough and very blunt, including his comments about the push-and-pull whether to stay and whether to go.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no effort to conceal the fact that what Trump said was wrong and troubling,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to think of very many precedents for somebody like that who is a high-ranking presidential adviser.\u201dMr. Cohn told The Financial Times that \u201cas a Jewish American, I will not allow neo-Nazis ranting \u2018Jews will not replace us\u2019 to cause this Jew to leave his job.\u201dBut the job has not been easy. For Mr. Cohn, said two people familiar with his thinking, every day at the White House requires a different calculus over how best to spend his political capital. Right now, these people said, he will focus on economic policies that he believes are essential to the stability of the markets and the United States work force \u2014 even when other issues worry him.Nudging Mr. Trump toward a more free-trade stance that avoids harsh steps toward China and other economic partners is paramount, these people said. Part of that, they added, is opposing tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods that might damage relationships with American allies.But using political capital on those fights means avoiding others, even when the president espouses policies that run contrary to Mr. Cohn\u2019s own principles, the two people said. Among other things, they said, Mr. Cohn disagrees with the president\u2019s directive banning transgender people from joining the military, but will leave that fight to others.On Aug. 17, with word of Mr. Cohn\u2019s unhappiness percolating on Wall Street, some traders and investors got jittery. Seeing Mr. Cohn as a key player in pushing forward the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, some sold American stocks, pushing prices down.Mr. Cohn, a onetime silver trader who eventually became president of Goldman Sachs, was struck by the market move, said two people familiar with his thinking. He continued to huddle with friends and family over what steps to take, attending meetings in Washington during the process.At some point during the past 10 days, Mr. Cohn penned a tentative resignation letter, said the three people familiar with the draft. It was not immediately clear what day the letter was written, or if Mr. Trump was ever made aware of it.But during a private Aug. 18 meeting with the president at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., Mr. Cohn relayed his concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Charlottesville, said people with knowledge of the gathering. The exact details of the talk are not clear, but the president urged Mr. Cohn to stay.\u201cI have had numerous private conversations with the president on this topic,\u201d Mr. Cohn told The Financial Times, adding that \u201cI have not been bashful saying what I think.\u201dOne possible part of Mr. Cohn\u2019s calculus is the chance that he could be named Federal Reserve chairman early next year, a move Mr. Trump has said he is considering. Mr. Cohn has in the past expressed interest in the job, said two people close to him. But unlike past Fed chairmen, Mr. Cohn is not an economist, and some of his friends have said it is hard to imagine him in the more reserved, less dynamic environment of the Fed, which would be a huge contrast to the pace of Goldman Sachs or the White House.Eileen Sullivan and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Stock Market Has Been Magical. It Can\u2019t Last.", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesSome things just can\u2019t last. The nearly magical stock market that has persisted so valiantly this year is one of them.The stock market has been so placid that declines of a mere 1.5 percent have been treated like real news. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped that much on Thursday. Days like that can be unsettling, but in the span of market history, they amount to the slightest of headaches.The deeper news isn\u2019t immediately visible day to day, but it is this: The stock market has been operating in an extremely rarefied world of heightened calm, one that is unlikely to continue. It is as if, after the election in November, Wall Street entered an enchanted zone. That is bound to end.Several statistical measurements demonstrate how unusual this market environment has been.The most obvious is the bull market\u2019s longevity, fueled largely by the Federal Reserve\u2019s ultralow interest rates and voracious bond buying. The upward trend in stocks already ranks as the second longest in American history since 1900 and the third highest in percentage gains, according to a tally by Bespoke Investment Group. From the trend\u2019s start, in 2009, through its latest high, on Aug. 7, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has risen 267 percent.\u201cIt is difficult to appreciate how unusual 2017 is,\u201d Mr. Mehta said, \u201cor to use the distant past to draw lessons about it.\u201d Clearly, though, neither then nor now, political turmoil had little or no effect on the pervasive calm in the stock market.Mr. Mehta, the former director of research and analytics for the Treasury\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program and the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, pointed to several other indicators of uncanny market placidity this year.And despite occasional bursts of market-driven angst, the downturns so far in 2017 have been paltry. Ryan Detrick, a senior market strategist for LPL Financial, has found that the S.&P. 500 through Friday has not had a 5 percent decline, from peak to trough, since June 28, 2016. That sell-off, 6.1 percent over several days, occurred after Britain\u2019s surprise vote on June 23, 2016, to leave the European Union.Other measurements show the same pattern. For the three weeks through Aug. 10, the closing levels of the S.&P. 500 never had a daily swing of more than 0.3 percent, Mr. Detrick said: \u201cThat never happened before in the history of the S.&P. 500.\u201d And for 2017 so far, the average daily trading range has been 0.55 percent, the lowest ever.\u201cWe have been living in a very unusual world,\u201d Mr. Detrick said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think we are going to stay here for very long.\u201dSimilarly, Mr. Mehta said that this stretch of smooth sailing has gone on for so long that it has become statistically improbable. That isn\u2019t a firm prediction of a decline because the future is uncertain. But, he said, it is quite likely that a stock market decline of at least 5 percent \u2014 from peak to trough \u2014 will be coming in the not-too-distant future.\u201cMere reversion to the mean is likely,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. \u201cFrom a probability standpoint, the run we\u2019ve been on is very rare, and it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll return to something more normal relatively soon.\u201dWill there be a downturn big enough to derail the bull market? Of course. But, alas, no one knows when it will happen.In traditional Wall Street parlance, a bull market ends and a bear begins with a drop of 20 percent from the market\u2019s last peak, which happens to have occurred on Aug. 7, when the S.&.P. closed at 2,480.91. The market has dropped 1.9 percent since then. It hasn\u2019t had a 3 percent decline since before the November election, in the longest such streak since 1995, Mr. Detrick said.We are long overdue, he said, adding that he expected \u201ca very healthy decline of 5 percent or more,\u201d which would be \u201ca buying opportunity for people who have stayed out of the stock market.\u201d Stock valuations are stretched, he said, but when you factor in low interest rates and low inflation, current prices are reasonable, in his view.\u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age, they die of excesses,\u201d Mr. Detrick said. And there is no indication, he added, that an end to the market\u2019s long-term rising trend is imminent.One of these days, these various streaks will end. A big stock market decline could well precede and predict a recession. But barring a disastrous geopolitical, economic or financial shock \u2014 there are plenty of possibilities, take your pick \u2014 it is likely that both the bull market and the economic recovery will keep grinding on for a while.But don\u2019t count on it. We are pushing our luck. Even if you believe in magic, the markets rarely stay calm and buoyant for such an exceedingly long time.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Makes Caligula Look Pretty Good", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor one thing, Caligula did not, as far as we know, foment ethnic violence within the empire. For another, again as far as we know, Rome\u2019s government continued to function reasonably well despite his antics: Provincial governors continued to maintain order, the army continued to defend the borders, there were no economic crises.Finally, when his behavior became truly intolerable, Rome\u2019s elite did what the party now controlling Congress seems unable even to contemplate: It found a way to get rid of him.Journalists have stopped seizing on brief moments of not-craziness to declare Trump \u201cpresidential\u201d; business leaders have stopped trying to curry favor by lending Trump an air of respectability; even military leaders have gone as far as they can to dissociate themselves from administration pronouncements.Put it this way: \u201cNot my president\u201d used to sound like an extreme slogan. Now it has more or less become the operating principle for key parts of the U.S. system.Despite this, it may seem on the surface as if the republic is continuing to function normally. We\u2019re still adding jobs; stocks are up; public services continue to be delivered.So who\u2019s going to ensure that these critical deadlines are met? Not Trump, who\u2019s too busy praising white supremacists and promoting his businesses. Maybe Republican leaders in Congress will still be able to wrangle their extremist members, who see crippling the government as a good thing, into the necessary deals.But the revelation that these leaders were lying about health care all those years has destroyed their intellectual credibility \u2014 remember when people took Paul Ryan\u2019s pretense of policy expertise seriously? And their association with President Caligula has destroyed their moral credibility, too. They could keep the government functioning by dealing with Democrats, but they\u2019re afraid to do that, for the same reason they\u2019re afraid to confront the madman in the White House.The good news is that the founding fathers contemplated that possibility and offered a constitutional remedy: Unlike the senators of ancient Rome, who had to conspire with the Praetorian Guard to get Caligula assassinated, the U.S. Congress has the ability to remove a rogue president.But a third of the country still approves of that rogue president \u2014 and that third amounts to a huge majority of the G.O.P. base. So all we get from the vast majority of elected Republicans are off-the-record expressions of \u201cdismay\u201d or denunciations of bigotry that somehow fail to name the bigot in chief.It\u2019s not just that Republicans fear primary challenges from candidates pandering to the racist right, although they do; Trump is already supporting challengers to Republicans he considers insufficiently loyal.The fact is that white supremacists have long been a key if unacknowledged part of the G.O.P. coalition, and Republicans need those votes to win general elections. Given the profiles in cowardice they\u2019ve presented so far, it\u2019s hard to imagine anything \u2014 up to and including evidence of collusion with a foreign power \u2014 that would make them risk losing those voters\u2019 support.So the odds are that we\u2019re stuck with a malevolent, incompetent president whom nobody knowledgeable respects, and many consider illegitimate. If so, we have to hope that our country somehow stumbles through the next year and a half without catastrophe, and that the midterm elections transform the political calculus and make the Constitution great again.If that doesn\u2019t happen, all one can say is God save America. Because all indications are that the Republicans won\u2019t.David Brooks is off today.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Tower, a Home for Celebrities and Charlatans", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHillary Clinton slept here.The year was 2000. Mrs. Clinton was in the middle of her first political campaign, running to be New York\u2019s junior senator.Donald J. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were on good terms back then. He donated money to her candidacy and called her \u201ctough and smart.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Trump was skilled in the art of spinning his associations with celebrities into publicity.This was particularly true at Trump Tower.Johnny Carson, Liberace and Paul Anka had condominiums there in the 1980s, and Michael Jackson rented one in the 1990s. In 2000, Bruce Willis closed on a place too.Pre-opening reports of Prince Charles and Princess Diana moving in turned out to be false, but that didn\u2019t stop Mr. Trump from using them to his advantage. The \u201csale that never occurred,\u201d as Mr. Trump called it in \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d was \u201cthe one that most helped Trump Tower.\u201dThe completion of a grand tower in Midtown\u2019s high-end retail district cemented Mr. Trump\u2019s status as a force to be reckoned with in New York while also setting him apart from his father, the developer Fred C. Trump, who made his fortune with an empire of middle-class housing units in boroughs outside Manhattan.Then Mr. Trump went to the nearby Olympic Tower for a dinner held by the Saudi billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, encountered a living room bigger than his own and decided to remodel.By the time Trump Tower opened, more than half the building\u2019s condominium units had been sold, and all but a small percentage would be gone within the next few years. Paul Goldberger, then The Times\u2019s architecture critic, whom Mr. Trump had once called \u201can idiot,\u201d sounded amazed by how much he actually liked it.\u201cIf overbearing publicity and overdressed guards do not a good building make, neither do they a good building deny,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTrump Tower,\u201d he added, \u201cis turning out to be a much more positive addition to the cityscape than the architectural oddsmakers would have had it.\u201dFew residents garnered as much publicity for the building as Michael Jackson, who for 10 months around 1994 rented a duplex apartment near the top and turned one of the bedrooms into a mirrored dance studio.Mr. Trump made Mr. Jackson\u2019s acquaintance in 1988, when he attended a Madison Square Garden concert that was part of the singer\u2019s tour in support of his \u201cBad\u201d album. After the show, he made a backstage visit.In 1990, Mr. Trump persuaded Mr. Jackson to show up at the opening of the Trump Taj Majal in Atlantic City, parading him in front of camera crews and reporters. The next day, Mr. Jackson\u2019s friend Ryan White died of AIDS, and the developer accompanied him on a visit to the grieving family in Indianapolis, bringing along a journalist to document the deed.After Mr. Jackson moved into his Trump Tower apartment, Mr. Trump took him to a low-key dinner at Le Cirque. \u201cThere was no entourage, no posse,\u201d said Mario Wainer, the restaurant\u2019s longtime ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel. \u201cHe came as a guest of Mr. Trump, and that was it.\u201dMr. Jackson barely touched his risotto, Mr. Wainer recalled, and Mr. Trump had fish and drank no alcohol.Given Mr. Trump\u2019s feuds with celebrities such as Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Snoop Dogg, it may not come as a surprise that some of his relationships with well-known tenants ended poorly.A few years later, Mr. Trump traded insults with the singer and actress Pia Zadora during a dispute with her husband, the dime-store magnate Meshulam Riklis, who rented office space in the building.Later, when Ms. Zadora heard Mr. Trump using similar language in his feuds with Megyn Kelly and Ms. O\u2019Donnell, she realized \u2014 as she said in an interview last week \u2014 \u201cI was a pioneer!\u201dAs Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987 best seller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d \u201cthe cycles of buyers at Trump Tower were always something of a barometer of what was going on in the international economy.\u201dThe first group, Mr. Trump wrote in the book, included many people hailing from the Middle East, some of them from nations the newly elected president would later seek to put on a travel ban list. There have also been residents of Mexico, a country Mr. Trump targeted through his candidacy. Juan Beckmann Vidal, who has a majority stake in Jose Cuervo Tequila, purchased and combined three units on the 31st floor in 2007.Although Mr. Trump called himself \u201cthe law and order candidate\u201d in 2016, his namesake tower has been welcoming to those who have run afoul of the law.\u201cCriminals got to go somewhere,\u201d said Robby Browne, a broker at the Corcoran Group.After being charged with drug trafficking, Mr. Weichselbaum rented an apartment owned by Mr. Trump himself at the Trump Plaza building on East 61st Street. Mr. Trump wrote a letter on his behalf to the presiding judge in the case, calling him a \u201ccredit to the community\u201d shortly before Mr. Weichselbaum pleaded guilty and was given a three-year sentence.In 1988, Jay Weinberg, a New York-bred career criminal, moved into Unit 63-A while under indictment for running what prosecutors said was the largest Medicaid fraud in history. After being convicted of using his low-cost, Brooklyn-based medical clinic to improperly bill Medicaid for $16 million in fees from 381,000 appointments that never took place, he was sentenced to seven to 21 years in prison. As prosecutors noted, he was literally robbing the poor to feed the rich.At least Mr. Nahmad and Mr. Trincher have not been charged in connection with anyone\u2019s death, a dubious distinction held by Isaac Chehebar, a real estate investor and scion of the 1,300-store Rainbow retail chain.Mr. Chehebar served a four-and-a-half-month sentence for criminally negligent homicide. In 2006, Mr. Chehebar spent $4.3 million for a 2,200-square-foot apartment on the 42nd floor of Trump Tower, property records show.Steven Hoffenberg, who was convicted in 1997 of bilking investors of Towers Financial Corporation of $462 million, leased office space on the 16th floor shortly after his legal difficulties began.Asked last year by Bloomberg why Mr. Trump rented to him when he was facing charges of running one of the largest Ponzi schemes in history, Mr. Hoffenberg said: \u201cHe\u2019s very objective. Renting space has nothing to do with color or race \u2014 or indictment. It has to do with if you can pay the rent.\u201dSince Mr. Trump\u2019s political career took off, there have been questions about his possible ties to Russia. In January 2017, he took to Twitter saying, \u201cI HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA \u2014 NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201dBut in 2002, the Bayrock Group, a real estate investment fund run by two Russian-born entrepreneurs, Tevfik Arif and Felix Sater, moved into office space on the 24th floor of Trump Tower, where they began work on the future Trump SoHo and used their connections to explore a possible Trump building in Moscow.He avoided jail time by becoming a government informant who, according to the former attorney general Loretta Lynch, provided crucial intelligence about a variety of international crime syndicates.Mr. Trump has repeatedly tried to play down his involvement with Mr. Sater.In 2007, he told The Times that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know [Mr. Sater] very well.\u201d In 2015, he told a reporter from The Associated Press that he was \u201cunfamiliar\u201d with him.In 2017, Mr. Sater met with Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, at the Loews Regency on Park Avenue. There, Mr. Sater gave him a letter proposing the lifting of sanctions against Russia.The letter, The Times later reported, was delivered to Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser at the time. The next week, Mr. Flynn was fired.Of late, Mr. Trump has also been distancing himself from another Trump Tower resident with ties to Russian interests. In addition to holding the deed to an apartment on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower since 2015, he was for several months last year the manager of his landlord\u2019s presidential campaign.His name: Paul Manafort.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bumpy Times in Brazil, but Hedge Funds Boom", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 After more than a decade as an asset manager for large multinational banks, a Brazilian, M\u00e1rcio Appel, wanted to make it on his own. The political and economic upheaval in his country was not going to deter him.Even on the heels of a new scandal erupting in May that rocked the markets, the hedge fund firm he co-founded here, Adam Capital, started raising money for its newest fund. It is expected to be a $6.1 billion macro global fund, or one that invests based largely on the political and economic prospects of various countries.If it succeeds, the firm could become one of the top independent asset managers in Latin America, based on total assets under management, and among the largest worldwide of its vintage.Mr. Appel is going solo as Brazil\u2019s hedge fund sector is growing even though the short-term prospects of the economy remain uncertain.Total assets under management in June increased to $85 billion, a jump of 15 percent from the $74 billion in June 2016, according to data provided by the Brazilian Financial and Capital Markets Association, known by its Portuguese acronym Anbima.Brazilian macro funds had a total under management of $30.79 billion (or 97 billion reais) in June, a 51 percent increase from the same month one year earlier. Just in the first six months of this year, that figure grew by 18 percent.Such funds are more and more sought after out here. They received a net increase of $5.3 billion (or 16.7 billion reais) in the first half of this year, a turnaround from the net outflow of $412.7 million (or 1.3 billion reais) over the same period last year, according to Anbima.Even with all that money going into hedge funds, it is still an unusual time to form a new investment vehicle here and court investors.Brazil\u2019s president continues to be investigated for corruption, his low popularity has eroded even further, and his ability to shepherd unpopular reform measures considered by bankers as essential to turn around the economy has diminished.Yet Adam Capital\u2019s founding partners, Mr. Appel and his longtime colleague Andr\u00e9 Salgado, are no strangers to crisis.\u201cBrazil is a very good place to make money. It always has been,\u201d said Mr. Appel in a recent interview at the firm\u2019s office in the upscale Leblon neighborhood near the beach.From 2001 to 2008, Mr. Appel led asset management at the Spanish banking giant Santander\u2019s Brazil subsidiary. Then he did that for Banco Safra from 2008 to October 2015. There he gained acclaim for his performance with their Galileo fund, which gained 199.43 percent during his tenure, according to the brokerage firm XP Investimentos.But, he said, \u201cI always dreamt of opening my own firm.\u201dThe two founding partners met while at Santander \u2014 Mr. Salgado headed its brokerage house from 2003 to 2010 and later held a similar role at Safra.Adam Capital opened its initial funds in April last year. Two weeks earlier, Brazil\u2019s lower house had voted to move forward the impeachment process of Dilma Rousseff, then president.Still, the firm ended up raising $2.9 billion for its flagship macro fund and accumulated a total of about $3.3 billion in under nine months. That was in part because several private banks, including Itau Unibanco and Safra, agreed to be distributors, providing access to their private banking clients.Adam Capital \u201chas had very strong success in raising funds,\u201d said Michael Viriato Araujo, a professor of finance at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based business school Insper. \u201cFor Brazil, the speed at which they raised was impressive,\u201d he said.The firm\u2019s performance has been well above benchmarks. As of July 31, the flagship fund is up 27 percent since inception. That is about 1.65 times the return of the CDI, a type of certificate of deposit common among Brazilians and considered risk-free as it is tied to local interest rates, which have long been sky-high.The firm currently holds about $4.51 billion in assets under management, according to Mr. Salgado.That ranks it first globally among hedge fund managers established in 2016 or later and based on total assets under management, according to the research firm Preqin.Black and White Capital in the United States is in second place with $2.8 billion. Only two others have surpassed the $1 billion threshold in assets under management. Those are the Holocene Advisors and Sagewood in the United States.Adam Capital so far has focused on investing in equities, mostly indexes, foreign exchange and interest rates. It has done so in the United States, Japan, and Europe as well as in emerging markets like Brazil, Turkey, South Africa and Mexico.Until May, the firm kept about a 50/50 split between investments in Brazil and overseas, its founders said. The leak of a taped conversation between Joesley Batista, chief executive of J & F Investments, the parent of the meatpacking giant JBS, and Brazil\u2019s president, Michel Temer, who seemed to endorse Mr. Batista\u2019s bribery, resulted in a market panic.Immediately afterward, Adam reduced everything related to Brazil: stocks, local interest rates and the real. Its flagship fund fell 3.52 percent that month.Yet the firm\u2019s funds have since rebounded, as has their exposure to Brazil, including even betting on the real over the dollar. \u201cAs of today, we\u2019re just back to pre-Batista levels,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cNow it\u2019s back to 50/50.\u201dThey also feel like they passed an important test during that episode. \u201cGenerally I think it was bad because nobody likes to lose money,\u201d Mr. Salgado said. \u201cBut we managed to prove to the market that our size was manageable even with an event of this proportion.\u201dIn Brazil, several factors have buoyed independent asset managers. Interest rates falling significantly in the past year forced normally conservative Brazilian investors to start taking more risks. The emergence of new brokerage firms, some online, has also cut into the dominance banks used to have in controlling hedge funds.Large banks are starting to sell to independent managers, said Mr. Appel. \u201cThat is what allowed us to get that big that fast,\u201d Mr. Salgado noted.That bodes well for other firms, too. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely the industry will continue to grow,\u201d said Professor Viriato, the hedge fund expert at Insper.The minimum amount needed to invest has also fallen, making the funds more accessible.\u201cHedge funds in the past were for the ultrarich in Brazil,\u201d said Mr. Salgado. Now a hedge fund investor needs only a minimum investment of $3,175 and can make that through his bank or other firms.Reflecting that change, Adam Capital already has about 18,000 individual investors in its funds.Mr. Salgado said that to put money in hedge funds in Brazil today, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a millionaire anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Boeing Goes, So Goes the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBoeing.While investors have been piling into high-tech growth stocks, the giant commercial aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor has quietly emerged as the best-performing stock in the Dow. This week its shares rose above $240, and even after falling back with the broader market on Thursday, they\u2019ve gained 50 percent this year.That\u2019s way ahead of second-place Apple, which is up about 34 percent.And it\u2019s better than Netflix, not a Dow component, which is up 37 percent. Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, can\u2019t match it, either.When it comes to valuation, there\u2019s only one thing stock investors really care about, which is earnings. And the broad economic forces driving Boeing\u2019s gains are lifting the earnings at many large multinational companies, which is in turn driving the major stock indexes to new heights.Seth Seifman, a J.P. Morgan analyst, called the quarter a \u201cwatershed.\u201dDennis Muilenburg, a Boeing veteran who took over as chief executive in 2015, is reaping praise for increasing profit margins and improving tense labor relations. But in many ways, the company is simply cashing in on the same dynamics that are driving earnings \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 of many of the biggest components of the market indexes.Here are the key elements.\u201cBoeing definitely represents one of the big multinational companies that is benefiting from global economic growth,\u201d said Michael Arone, a managing director and investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. \u201cWe\u2019re having a more global, synchronized recovery.\u201dHe noted that Europe had outpaced the United States in economic growth this year, and that earnings at S.&P. 500 companies had shown double-digit growth for the first time in six years. In emerging markets like India and China, rising incomes are driving demand for leisure travel. \u201cGlobal travel demand is rising much faster than its historical norm,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, a longtime aviation and aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.In Boeing\u2019s earnings conference call last month, Mr. Muilenburg noted that air passenger traffic had outpaced global economic growth this year, and that air cargo traffic was up a solid 10 percent for the first five months of the year. Demand for Boeing products \u201cis more geographically diverse and balanced across the globe,\u201d he said.This is especially true of the once-troubled 787 Dreamliner, whose delays, cost overruns and other problems now seem behind it. Mr. Seifman\u2019s report said the 787\u2019s performance had exceeded \u201ceven the more bullish estimates.\u201dBut Boeing isn\u2019t alone. \u201cAt a time of sluggish growth in the economy and top-line revenue growth, companies have been very adept at managing costs and maintaining margins,\u201d Mr. Arone said.\u201cBoeing is a huge beneficiary of low interest rates,\u201d said Mr. Aboulafia, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers \u201chave every incentive to replace aging planes with more fuel-efficient versions.\u201dAnd the purchase of an aircraft is a large capital investment typically financed by borrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s true of many large manufacturers,\u201d Mr. Arone said, which is why large-capitalization stocks have done better this year than their small-cap counterparts, which typically don\u2019t make products that require large capital expenditures.Low interest rates also mean that investors seeking income have few alternatives to stocks. That\u2019s driven all the indexes higher.\u201cYou should have seen the Boeing executives fawning over Trump in South Carolina,\u201d Mr. Aboulafia said. \u201cThey basically pursued a campaign of radical sycophancy, and it\u2019s paid off handsomely.\u201dTo what degree the president deserves credit for the rise in stock prices remains a subject of debate, but so far, he has been far more market-friendly than his campaign pronouncements suggested. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of tough talk, but not much follow-through on the issues investors care about most,\u201d like immigration and trade, Mr. Arone said.Can all of this continue, given increasingly high valuations and an aging bull market? \u201cThat\u2019s the dilemma,\u201d Mr. Arone said. Boeing, for example, isn\u2019t exactly cheap at nearly $240 a share, and its price-to-earnings ratio for the trailing 12 months is pushing 30, far above the market average. Cost cutting can only go so far. That hasn\u2019t stopped the analysts from raising their target prices on Boeing: to $300 (Cowen & Company), $280 (J.P. Morgan) and $275 (Bank of America Merrill Lynch).As for other large multinationals and the broader market indexes, Mr. Arone sees no immediate threat to further gains. None of the warning signs he looks for \u2014 more-frequent market corrections, higher interest rates and widening credit spreads \u2014 have yet materialized. \u201cNone is flashing red,\u201d he said. \u201cNot even yellow.\u201d While conceding the bull market \u201cis getting long in the tooth,\u201d he said, \u201cBull markets don\u2019t die of old age.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Market Is High. Beware of Portfolio Drift.", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesInvest at the bottom of the market and sell at the top. That\u2019s solid advice, but it\u2019s not easy to follow.Consider the stock market right now, for example. Is this the top of the market? Is it time to sell?What\u2019s more, the market has been so placid this year \u2014 despite the turmoil emanating from Washington \u2014 that the calm on Wall Street has been almost supernatural. By some measures, stocks haven\u2019t been this steady in more than 50 years. Furthermore, the economic expansion now underway is already the third longest since 1854. It takes little imagination to envision a sudden rout.Those observations unnerved some readers who asked what they, as investors, should do now. Simply put, my answer is this: If you\u2019re a stock investor, be prepared for a major decline, not because one is necessarily coming soon but because no one can predict where the markets are heading.I spoke to Fran Kinniry, principal in Vanguard\u2019s investment strategy group. \u201cI always tell people to be consistent in their thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think they are O.K. with their portfolios now, and why not? They\u2019re probably sitting on big gains.\u201cBut then I ask, imagine that you have a $1 million portfolio and you lose 30 percent, because that can happen, and that\u2019s $300,000. Now you\u2019ve got just $700,000. How do you feel now? Would you be willing to stay in the stock market \u2014 and even sell some bonds, which have held on to their value, and use the money to buy more stocks, which are relatively cheap now? If the answer is no, it\u2019s important to know that now and to act on it.\u201dThat said, there is no reason to conclude that a big stock market decline is starting tomorrow. That might happen, but stocks may well rise for quite a while. Some astute analysts, like Laszlo Birinyi, an independent stock analyst in Westport, Conn., believe they probably will.\u201cWe are in a bull market,\u201d he declared in an email, adding that there are plenty of opportunities in individual stocks which continue to gyrate, even if the overall market is surprisingly stable. Valuation concerns and technical indicators like market breadth and investor sentiment are worth considering, he said, but \u201cnone of them end up with a SELL\u201d signal for the entire market. Mr. Birinyi says there is still money to be made by buying stocks. He may be right.Still, after so many years of gains, there are hidden dangers.Many investors are suffering from portfolio drift. As Mr. Kinniry of Vanguard says, even if your long-term strategy is well thought out, the colossal gains in the stock market could mean that you hold far more stock than you ever intended. In that case, you have taken on unintended risk because your portfolio has drifted far from its original moorings.\u201cIf you have not looked at your portfolio for a long time,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said, \u201cthe chances are very high that you should rebalance.\u201dRebalancing implies returning to the mix of assets that is appropriate for you. What that mix should be is a personal question. Major mutual fund and brokerage companies and individual financial advisers offer counsel. And there are standard guidelines, though no one-size-fits all solutions. The financial quizzes I\u2019ve taken all suggest that my holdings should be 60 to 70 percent stock, offset by 30 to 40 percent bonds, and I have remained within those parameters for 20 years. I\u2019m closer to 70 percent stocks right now. I probably should rebalance.Why hold stocks at all? It is because over periods of 20 years or more, stocks have almost always outperformed bonds, although stocks swing more wildly. That\u2019s why it is generally thought that people with a long horizon should hold a bigger proportion of stocks than those who are living off their investments, or will soon do so.\u201cRebalancing is more a risk-control measure than a return-generator,\u201d said Dougal Williams, an independent financial adviser.The problem, however, is that maintaining the right mix takes work. Someone else can do it for you, or you can do it yourself. If you have been letting things slide, it is time to rebalance.Consider what would have happened if you were fortunate enough to hold a $1 million portfolio at the end of 2008, containing 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds (a 60-40 portfolio). Recall that the United States stock market fell a whopping 37 percent in 2008. Holding as much as 60 percent stock after that debacle required some fortitude, along with a belief that the stock market would eventually rise. And it did. But look at what the market has also done:That\u2019s why it may be time to take some money off the table, even if, by doing so, you will be giving up some of the gains that will come when the stock market rises.\u201cBe capable of sticking with your strategy in the best of times and the worst of times,\u201d Mr. Kinniry said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier to think clearly now than in the middle of a big market downturn.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Praises the Stock Market at 22,000 That He Said Was a Bubble at 18,000", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As America\u2019s stock markets have reached record highs, they have had few louder cheerleaders than President Trump.Before the stock exchanges\u2019 opening bell on Tuesday, Mr. Trump pointed out in a tweet that the Dow Jones industrial index\u2019s recent surge started just after he was elected. (He also lamented, incorrectly, that the press was downplaying that fact: \u201cMainstream media seldom mentions!\u201d)And on Thursday, Mr. Trump made clear that he thinks he deserves credit for the latest record high, tweeting, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t just happen!\u201dBusiness is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!The Dow Jones average closed at another record high Thursday. But it was not long ago that Mr. Trump, as a presidential candidate bent on casting the economy as a disaster, said that the stock market was a bubble that should make investors wary.In the early days of his candidacy, Mr. Trump assailed the economic recovery as a mirage and mused about a potential conspiracy that was being plotted between Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, and President Barack Obama. The theory was that she was keeping interest rates low so that the president would not leave office as another recession began.Before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump decided to dispense some financial advice. The recent dip in stocks was a harbinger of worse things to come, he warned, and he hoped that the coming crash did not happen after Mr. Obama left office.Although he was feeling confident about locking up the Republican nomination in April 2016, Mr. Trump was feeling increasingly bearish about stocks. He told The Washington Post that they were overvalued and that the strong data that showed a healthy economy were essentially phony.By September, he was arguing that the Federal Reserve was propping up a \u201cfalse economy\u201d that is actually weak.Mr. Trump saved his most brutal assessment of the stock market, and the economy, for his first presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. In response to her criticism of his economic proposals, he said that the recovery was the worst since the Great Depression and that it would come crashing down the moment that interest rates rise.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Houston, Anxiety and Frantic Rescues as Floodwaters Rise", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe chaos inflicted by the remains of Hurricane Harvey played out across an enormous swath of Texas, most conspicuously in this metropolitan area of 6.6 million that has long been used to major storms blowing in off the Gulf of Mexico, but that has seldom, if ever, faced a scene quite like this one.\u201cThis event is unprecedented & all impacts are unknown & beyond anything experienced,\u201d the federal service said on Twitter on Sunday. \u201cFollow orders from officials to ensure safety.\u201dAt a news conference in Houston on Monday morning, Mayor Sylvester Turner said that 5,500 people had been taken in by the city\u2019s shelters and that he expected that number to rise \u201cexponentially,\u201d adding that close to 300 people had been recovered in water rescues since midnight.Speaking with the city\u2019s police and fire chiefs and other officials, Mr. Turner said that the city\u2019s goal on Monday was to reach all remaining people facing immediate danger, even as he stressed that officials were facing a quickly changing situation that was bound to frustrate residents.\u201cPeople who may not have been in a crisis state yesterday may find themselves in a crisis state today,\u201d he said.The city\u2019s police chief, Art Acevedo, said the city had handled 56,000 calls to 911 since 6 p.m. Friday and had rescued 2,000 people. He said the city was aware of about 185 requests for rescue that had not yet been handled.\u201cA lot of people are frustrated,\u201d Chief Acevedo said. \u201cHopefully today we\u2019ll get to the rest of you. Please don\u2019t give up on us. None of us are going to give up.\u201dIn Houston, harrowing close calls shook many families.Maya Wadler, 17, recalled the moments before she was rescued from her home Sunday around 4 a.m. The water, she said, \u201cbubbled up from the doors, seeped in from the windows.\u201d\u201cEverywhere you turned,\u201d she said, \u201cthere would just be a new flowing puddle. It just kept filling. It passed the outlets. I was so scared. We didn\u2019t know what would happen. And there is no one you can call.\u201dMs. Wadler was eventually helped onto a dump truck driven by rescue workers.\u201cI was sitting in the corner holding my dad really tight,\u201d she said. \u201cI usually just trust my parents that everything is going to be O.K. But I looked up and I saw that my dad was closing his eyes, the water was getting in his eyes. And I just thought: He has absolutely no idea where we are going to go.\u201dFlooding was reported in numerous communities in the Texas interior between Houston, to the east, and Austin and San Antonio, to the west. On Sunday, a mandatory evacuation order was issued for the city of La Grange, where the National Weather Service projected that the Colorado River would crest at 49.1 feet, according to the city\u2019s website.As inland communities struggled with the flooding crisis, coastal communities that took the brunt of the hurricane\u2019s pounding remained punch-drunk.In Rockport, where the storm made landfall, hundreds of homes, apartments, businesses, churches and government offices were damaged or destroyed. On Sunday morning, parts of the city were a wreck, pervaded by the sweet stench of gas, wind-battered and littered with downed power lines and tilting utility poles. Injured dogs wandered the streets.The storm also blew through key areas for the United States oil and gas industry, and it has already caused some disruption to production. Exxon Mobil, for instance, said on its website on Sunday that it was shutting down operations at its huge Baytown refining and petrochemical complex because of flooding, while heavy rain prompted Royal Dutch Shell to close a large refining facility at Deer Park.Shell, one of the largest producers in the Gulf of Mexico, said it had closed two offshore production platforms, Perdido and Enchilada Salsa, and had evacuated most of the workers.Still, the gulf produces substantial quantities of oil and gas, and analysts say it is likely that the impact on energy prices and supplies will be limited; substantial stocks of oil are available, and products like gasoline are on hand because of a long period of booming global output.In the long term, Texas is likely to face a massive, multibillion-dollar rebuilding effort that may affect a generation \u2014 and what is sure to be a daunting and sometimes depressing era of government trailers, red tape and fights with bureaucrats and insurance companies.The federal government is promising a muscular response, with 5,000 federal employees \u2014 including members of the Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agriculture Department \u2014 on site in Texas and Louisiana to assist state and local officials.\u201cWe\u2019re setting up and gearing up for the next couple of years,\u201d Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program on Sunday.For President Trump, the storm is the first domestic disaster to test his administration\u2019s competence. On Sunday, in a flurry of tweets, the president wrote, \u201cGood news is that we have great talent on the ground.\u201d He announced plans to travel to Texas on Tuesday.Hanging over this narrative is the suffering caused by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago. President George W. Bush was blamed by many for the blundering federal response.Texans, however, responded with great empathy and even heroism. Boat owners crossed the Sabine River to conduct water rescues in New Orleans, and the city of Houston threw open its arms to thousands of evacuees.Now the Texas government will face rebuilding after a disaster of similar scope, both emotional and geographic: Gov. Greg Abbott said on Sunday that 18 counties were covered by a federal disaster declaration signed by Mr. Trump.Chief Acevedo was among those who said that the state\u2019s mythic toughness would help Texans soldier on. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Chief Acevedo said in a live video posted to Twitter. \u201cIt breaks your heart for our city and our state. But it\u2019s Texas. We\u2019ll get through.\u201dThe Houston Independent School District said schools and offices would be closed for the week. The city\u2019s two main airports announced on Sunday that they had ceased all commercial operations. The Federal Aviation Administration estimated that George Bush Intercontinental Airport would reopen at noon on Monday but that William P. Hobby Airport would remain closed until Wednesday morning.Many of Houston\u2019s streets were rendered impassable, complicating the focus on rescuing residents isolated by floodwaters or trapped in areas where the water was rising. Harris County officials asked the public to contribute boats and high-water vehicles, which they said were \u201cdesperately\u201d needed to help rescue people before nightfall.As hard rains continued to fall, cars lay wrecked or stalled out on Houston\u2019s interstate highways. People walked the roadways, looking for shelter or help, some vainly holding umbrellas skyward. Others waded through waist-high water, or paddled pirogues and little inflatable rafts. Rescue crews traversed the city in high-water vehicles, their crews in life jackets and helmets, and in trucks towing boats and Jet Skis.At Ben Taub Hospital, a Level 1 trauma center in the sprawling Texas Medical Center complex, officials were waiting for rescue workers to evacuate their 350 patients, starting with roughly 18 patients on ventilator support in critical care units, said Bryan McLeod of the Harris Health System.Mr. McLeod said that floodwater had entered the basement, and that a sewage pipe had burst. Cafeteria, pharmacy and other operations were suspended. \u201cThere\u2019s still about waist-deep water around the facility,\u201d he said.Elsewhere, ghostly scenes underscored the destruction in a place long seen as one of the nation\u2019s most dynamic generators of growth and prosperity. Near the Galleria, Houston\u2019s famous shopping mall, a stretch of South Rice Avenue had more than two feet of water in some places.Gloria Maria Quintanilla appeared as a speck on the horizon, wading through waist-high waters in the middle of the road with a sack thrust over one shoulder and an umbrella perched on the other. Ms. Quintanilla, 60, seemed to epitomize Houston\u2019s work ethic, its resolve and its shock.\u201cI worked at the hotel up there,\u201d she said when a reporter approached. As she walked, she explained that she was an immigrant from El Salvador, here since 1982. She makes $10 an hour washing and ironing sheets and towels at the Doubletree.She had started the journey from home more than an hour before.\u201cIt was my day to work, and I\u2019m a very responsible person,\u201d she said, speaking in Spanish. \u201cI had no idea it was going to be like this.\u201dJulie Turkewitz and Alan Blinder reported from Houston, and Manny Fernandez from Rockport, Tex.

{"Headline": "Investing Short-Term When Stocks Are High? Imagine a Painful Drop", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyEvery week brings a new worry, something or another that could finally, truly, end our eight-year-plus bull market in American stocks.If it\u2019s not conflict with North Korea, then it\u2019s concern over a damaging showdown in Congress over the federal debt. And if it\u2019s not debt, it\u2019s the possibility of a trade war or a hurricane season to end all hurricane seasons.Given how little anyone can know about what will end the bull market and when, most people should try to avoid making predictions, let alone investing based on them. But there is one group of people who deserve to worry at any particular moment: those who will need most or all of their investment money soon.Consider the people who are trying to scrape together a down payment but who also want their savings to keep up with the rise in real estate prices, if possible. Or the parent \u2014 say, me \u2014 who hopes to send a firstborn child off to college in seven years. How much money should any of us have in stocks right now?If you poll investment experts, there is no consensus about a perfect mix of stock, bonds and cash. There never is. But there is probably an answer that is right for you, as long as you know how comfortable you are with the possibility of losing some money and have thought through every detail of what you\u2019re willing to sacrifice if you do.Figuring out how low your portfolio\u2019s value might drop ought to be much easier than it is. In a perfect world, every brokerage firm and 529 college savings account administrator would have two buttons on their web pages.The first, a \u201cWhat if?\u201d button, would let you see how much portfolio pain you\u2019d be in for if your stock investments fell by 10 or 20 percent \u2014 or some more apocalyptic amount \u2014 and if bonds earned nothing over some period. The second, a \u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d button, would let you input the portfolio percentage decline of your choosing and then set the site to work estimating the odds of anything like that happening based on what has happened in the past.If you don\u2019t have access to anything like that, you can at least approximate the \u201cwhat if\u201d math yourself if you know what\u2019s in your portfolio. (With the age-based funds that some people put their 529 money into, it can take a little digging to figure out what percentage of the investments are in stocks.)A good financial adviser will put the numbers in front of you and demand that you reckon with them. Paul V. Sydlansky, a financial planner in Binghamton, N.Y., recently went through this exercise with a couple who hope to buy a home in Spain in two to four years. And because it could indeed take 48 months, they don\u2019t want to leave their money in cash, earning very little, for that long.So Mr. Sydlansky put it to them this way: If they have $180,000 split equally between stocks and bonds, a 30 percent stock market decline would leave them with $153,000. How would that feel if the perfect house came along? Not good, they decided, and they elected to have just 30 percent of their money in stocks.This conversation probably gets harder if you\u2019re a first-time homeowner. Sure, you could hope that housing prices in your area would fall as much as your portfolio, but there is rarely precise alignment in the choreography of market corrections and crashes.So, would you be comfortable passing up the perfect property if your down payment account had fallen by 10 or 20 percent? How would it feel to sacrifice the dream of buying your \u201cforever\u201d home and settle for a starter one? What about buying the bigger house in the second-choice suburb? And let\u2019s say you have a spouse. Better be sure that you two are on the same page. Have you asked?Or perhaps you would just borrow more. Easy, right? But could you afford it, if interest rates are a point or two higher then? That could happen. And how much would all that extra interest cost you over time? Or would the bank even lend you that much?And don\u2019t forget this possibility either: How much would you kick yourself over the lost stock market gains if the market continues to rise? If you have all of your down payment money in cash for years while the housing market outruns you, as it has for many people in expensive coastal markets this decade, it wouldn\u2019t feel so good.Now, consider a college savings account, perhaps for a middle-school student. You\u2019re reasonably sure that there will be some kind of stock market calamity between now and when the kiddo leaves home. How bad might things get?It\u2019s tempting to consider how you reacted to the stock market declines at the end of the last decade in figuring out how you might react in the future. If you had decent nerves back then when your child was in preschool, perhaps you were betting that you were buying stocks on sale.How bad could things get over the next 10 years? Given how rough things got last time, I asked Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s Dow Jones Indices, to calculate what people might have seen if they\u2019d been looking back at total S.&P. 500 returns (including reinvested dividends) over a previous 10-year period. Any decade ending between January 2009 and September 2010 would have been negative, he said. In the first four months of 2009, you would have been facing a decade-long decline between 21 and 29 percent.You\u2019d hope that few with children about to start college were invested entirely in large United States stocks then. One benefit of diversification, as Preeti Shah, an accountant and financial planner in Matawan, N.J., reminded me this week, is that even over the four years of college, you can pull from the investments that aren\u2019t hurting as much (say, the bond or cash portion of your portfolio) during the first year or two. Then, you cross your fingers that the stocks will recover during the latter part of your child\u2019s undergraduate years. Indeed, stocks nearly doubled from their March 2009 lows within two years.But something more conservative may be better for you. Again come the pressing questions, perhaps even more emotion-laden since they involve your son or daughter: How much more could you pay out of pocket if your college savings portfolio suffered a big loss? What if your employer cast your aging self off during the recession that might come with a big stock market decline?Perhaps you attended a private college and hope to give your child a shot at the same thing. Would you insist upon the state university where you live \u2014 and nothing else more expensive \u2014 if your aggressive portfolio took a big dive?

{"Headline": "Why Tesla Motors Is Fueling Up on Debt", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElon Musk is an entrepreneur in a bubble.Forced to choose between issuing a bit more of Tesla\u2019s turbocharged stock or tapping the overheated junk-bond market to finance the Model 3 ramp-up, Mr. Musk, the company\u2019s founder, opted for the latter. It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel.Tesla has just over $3 billion in cash, but it is burning through roughly $1 billion a quarter as it embarks on one of the most daunting gambits in automotive history: taking production of its mass-market vehicle from zero to 400,000 or more a year in just 18 months.Fortunately for Mr. Musk, investors can\u2019t seem to shower his ambitions with too much money. Tesla\u2019s stock has risen by 67 percent this year. The company is valued at some 27 times 2020 earnings, implying the kind of growth that even the most bullish of analysts don\u2019t expect, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations.The textbook financing solution would be to issue more of that high-priced paper. Selling five million shares at a 15 percent discount to market would raise the same $1.5 billion and dilute Mr. Musk\u2019s 20.4 percent stake by only 3 percent, assuming he didn\u2019t pitch in more himself.But he doesn\u2019t have to when the high-yield bond market is on a tear. Investors desperate for income have depressed the yield gap between single-B-rated junk bonds and United States Treasury bonds by nearly 2 percentage points over the past year, to 3.59 points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings affirmed its B-minus rating on Tesla, saying the boost to liquidity should offset the company\u2019s \u201csignificant execution risks.\u201dThe bond sale will raise debt to a lofty 5.5 times forecast 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. But Ebitda is set to more than double next year to $2.2 billion and then almost triple by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Even if Mr. Musk is not as successful as Wall Street estimates, he should sell more than enough cars to make the leverage, and the additional interest bill, easy for bondholders to swallow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Morning Agenda: Are Markets Due for a Reckoning?", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a decade after the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, concerns are rising that euphoric markets may be headed for a hard fall.Technology companies have been an important driver behind the increase in financial markets in recent years, with seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies now coming from that sector.The so-called Faang stocks \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and the Google parent Alphabet \u2014 have had some of the biggest gains in the past 12 months.And a stunning amount of money (more than $60 billion a year for the past three years) has flowed into the tech sector through venture capitalists and private equity funds.\u2022 Many of the gains have been concentrated around a small number of stocks, rather than resulting in a broader rise.\u2022 Tech companies may face increasing scrutiny from regulators.Google was fined a record $2.7 billion this summer by European Union antitrust officials for unfairly favoring some of its own services over rivals. The Europeans also have gone after Apple for $14.5 billion what they see as unpaid tax and have opened a separate inquiry into Amazon\u2019s tax practices in Europe.In China, the government appears to be limiting the use of software that allows people to surpass the Great Firewall \u2014 the nickname for a sophisticated set of internet filters used to stop the public from accessing foreign news outlets, as well as Facebook, Google and Twitter.Related ReadingWhen he ran for office, President Trump said he would bring business leaders into government and use the best corporate practices to make it more efficient.Many expected that Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, would apply those types of management skills as secretary of state \u2014 namely picking a trusted staff and delegating small issues, so he could focus on the big ones.Mr. Tillerson has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of the department\u2019s highest-ranking positions and is instead working with a small group of personal aides to review operations.A spokesman for Mr. Tillerson said that he was focused on simply tackling problems that had been ignored by his predecessors and, as he has learned more about the department, he has uncovered more issues in its bureaucracy.Sprint, the cellular network operator controlled by SoftBank of Japan, continues to seek a deal to make it bigger and a more formidable competitor to American wireless giants Verizon and AT&T.Charter has expressed little interest in an alliance, saying it had no desire to buy Sprint, which is worth about roughly a third of Charter\u2019s $99 billion value.SoftBank pursued a combination of Sprint with T-Mobile, but ended those talks in 2014 after drawing strong opposition from the Obama administration.Sprint also has had talks in recent years with Charter and Comcast about offering its wireless service to their cable and broadband customers.For Sprint, joining with a cable company would give it greater resources to upgrade its network to 5G and keep pace with rivals.Local leaders who have actively recruited foreign companies and overseas investment to bolster their economies are increasingly concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s talk on trade.Tennessee has hit a record low jobless rate as dozens of foreign companies have built plants and created thousands of jobs in Chattanooga and the surrounding region.But political and business leaders in Hamilton County, where Mr. Trump won a majority, are concerned that protectionist policies could ultimately end up hurting consumers and local workers.\u201cTrade and foreign investment is a big part of Tennessee\u2019s portfolio, and it affects many people in our area,\u201d said Andy Berke, the mayor of Chattanooga. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know exactly what the policies will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bannon Was Set for a Graceful Exit. Then Came Charlottesville.", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, told Stephen K. Bannon in late July that he needed to go: No need for it to get messy, Mr. Kelly told Mr. Bannon, according to several people with firsthand knowledge of the exchange. The two worked out a mutually amicable departure date for mid-August, with President Trump\u2019s blessing.At the same time, New York real estate investor friends told Mr. Trump that the situation with Mr. Bannon was untenable: Steve Roth on Monday, Tom Barrack on Tuesday and Richard LeFrak on Wednesday.By Thursday, after Mr. Bannon undercut American policy toward North Korea in an interview published by a left-leaning magazine, Mr. Trump himself had concluded that Mr. Bannon was too much of a liability.By Friday, when he was forced from his job as Mr. Trump\u2019s chief strategist, Mr. Bannon had found himself wholly isolated inside a White House where he once operated with such autonomy that he reported only to the president himself.This account is based on interviews with a dozen White House aides, associates of the president\u2019s and friends of Mr. Bannon\u2019s.A former Naval officer, Mr. Bannon speaks often in the language of combat \u2014 of escalating conflict to \u201cnuclear\u201d levels and driving his enemies \u201cballistic.\u201d But in the end, he had lost the war against a list of enemies that included nearly everyone in the West Wing. They included not just the adversaries whose conflicts with Mr. Bannon were widely aired \u2014 Gary D. Cohn, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser; Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter; and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law.Even the market tumbled on the prospect that Mr. Bannon could come out on top. Blue chip stocks slid last week after an erroneous report said that Mr. Cohn\u2019s resignation was imminent because of his disgust with Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to more forcefully denounce the racist Charlottesville, Va., demonstrators. Friends and former colleagues of Mr. Cohn\u2019s said the economic adviser criticized Mr. Trump in such strong terms that at least one wondered how he could possibly remain in his position.As soon as Mr. Bannon arrived at the White House on Inauguration Day, he seemed to realize that he would not be long for the job. He felt that Mr. Trump had treated him as a peer during the presidential campaign, but, he often complained to friends, \u201cwhen I got to the White House, all of a sudden I was just a staffer.\u201dOpponents\u2019 mythology around Mr. Bannon often held that he was the evil genius who pushed the president to make some of his more audacious decisions. And Mr. Bannon\u2019s political opponents believe his departure has removed one of the biggest impediments to stability inside the White House.\u201cMy view is that the president has his own mind,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and a former White House political director under George W. Bush. \u201cPeople make too much of the idea that he\u2019s some kind of blank slate that advisers can push one way or the other.\u201dSteve Schmidt, who helped manage Senator John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign in 2008 and is a critic of the president, said: \u201cWe are seeing all of the personal qualities and character of the president on a daily basis. It\u2019s not restrainable or controllable because he is who he is.\u201dMr. Bannon\u2019s opponents had long argued that he inflated his importance in White House debates and took more than his fair share of credit in plotting Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. But he was someone with whom the president, for the most part, had long enjoyed spending time.The two men, whose friendship was cemented during the two and a half months in which Mr. Bannon helped rescue Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, reinforced each other\u2019s rough-around-the-edges tendencies. Both could be gratuitously foul-mouthed, viciously cutting to their enemies and unapologetically politically incorrect. \u201cDude, he\u2019s Archie Bunker,\u201d Mr. Bannon would say with fondness when talking about Mr. Trump.Mr. Bannon fed Mr. Trump\u2019s paranoid streak and shared the president\u2019s penchant for believing in conspiracies. He viewed not just intelligence agencies but most of government as stocked with a devious bureaucratic underbelly, the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Mr. Trump, who has never worked in government, eagerly adopted that view.Mr. Bannon was notorious for maintaining his own, shadowy presence within the White House. He would frequently skip meetings where policy was discussed, injecting his views into the process in other ways, according to two administration officials. He did not use a computer, preferring to have paper printed and handed to his assistant to stay outside the formal decision-making process.Mr. Bannon favored a culture similar to the one Mr. Trump brought with him from the business world to the White House \u2014 a flat structure with blurred lines of responsibility and competing power centers. And early on Mr. Bannon benefited from that structure, sitting at the top, free to slip unvetted materials to the president without a gatekeeper to get past.\u201cTheoretically, a more coherent staff should produce a more coherent policy,\u201d said David Axelrod, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s senior adviser and the person in a comparable role to Mr. Bannon in the White House. \u201cBut that presupposes a president who embraces the process and the policy.\u201dWith little process to speak of, tensions over policy swelled. Ideological differences devolved into caustic personality clashes. Perhaps nowhere was the mutual disgust thicker than between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law.Mr. Bannon openly complained to White House colleagues that he resented how Ms. Trump would try to undo some of the major policy initiatives that he and Mr. Trump agreed were important to the president\u2019s economic nationalist agenda, like withdrawing from the Paris climate accords. In this sense, he was relieved when Mr. Kelly took over and put in place a structure that kept other aides from freelancing.\u201cThose days are over when Ivanka can run in and lay her head on the desk and cry,\u201d he told multiple people.Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner, who had helped oust Mr. Kelly\u2019s predecessor, whom they saw as ineffective, also told people that they wanted a new system for the same reason.Mr. Bannon made little secret of the fact that he believed \u201cJavanka,\u201d as he referred to the couple behind their backs, had na\u00efve political instincts and were going to alienate Mr. Trump\u2019s core coalition of white working-class voters.He told White House colleagues including the president that too many conservative Republicans in Congress would balk if Mr. Trump took their advice and showed more flexibility on immigration, particularly toward young undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.He also advised that ideological softening would buy the president no good will from Democrats or independent voters, whom Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump believe Mr. Trump still has a chance of reaching.\u201cThey hate the very mention of his name,\u201d Mr. Bannon told them. \u201cThere is no constituency for this.\u201dHis advice for the president: \u201cYou\u2019ve got the base. And you grow the base by getting\u201d things done.Mr. Bannon\u2019s disdain for General McMaster also accelerated his demise. The war veteran has never quite clicked with the president, but other West Wing staff members recoiled at a series of smears against General McMaster by internet allies of Mr. Bannon. The strategist denied involvement, but he also did not speak out against them.By the time Charlottesville erupted, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump had a powerful ally in Mr. Kelly, who shared their belief that Mr. Trump\u2019s first statement blaming \u201cmany sides\u201d for the deadly violence needed to be amended.Mr. Bannon vigorously objected. He told Mr. Kelly that if Mr. Trump delivered a second, more contrite statement it would do him no good, with either the public or the Washington press corps, which he denigrated as a \u201cPretorian guard\u201d protecting the Democrats\u2019 consensus that Mr. Trump is a race-baiting demagogue. Mr. Trump could grovel, beg for forgiveness, even get down on his knees; it would never work, Mr. Bannon maintained.\u201cThey\u2019re going to say two things: It\u2019s too late and it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Mr. Bannon told Mr. Kelly.In truth, long before Charlottesville, Mr. Trump had begun losing patience. The arrival of Mr. Kelly to play precisely the gatekeeping role that would stymie aides like Mr. Bannon hastened his departure.The president believed that Mr. Bannon had been leaking unauthorized stories about infighting in the administration for months before he ultimately took action.Mr. Trump was irritated by a book, \u201cDevil\u2019s Bargain,\u201d that portrayed Mr. Bannon as a brilliant political Svengali but put Mr. Trump in a supporting role.When one Trump ally noted to him recently that Mr. Bannon did help him at the end of the race, Mr. Trump interrupted, \u201cYou know, he came very late.\u201dThe week of Aug. 7, Mr. Bannon suggested timing the departure to Aug. 14, which was a day after his one-year anniversary working for Mr. Trump on the campaign. It made sense to everyone.Mr. Bannon\u2019s physical appearance was crumbling, and his mood swings had become pronounced.In late July, after a weekend with Robert Mercer, the hedge fund billionaire who finances some of his projects, Mr. Bannon told him, \u201cI dread going back\u201d to the White House.But after Charlottesville, Mr. Bannon maintained that an Aug. 14 exit would look like part of the president\u2019s response to the violence. He did not want that, and others were understanding. So they discussed moving the date to around Labor Day weekend, although two administration officials said Mr. Bannon sought to entirely renegotiate the terms of his departure.Then came Mr. Bannon\u2019s unguarded comments to The American Prospect, published on Wednesday evening. He denigrated some colleagues, specifically identified one that he was going to see fired and said of striking North Korea, \u201cThere\u2019s no military solution here, they got us\u201d \u2014 a direct contradiction to the message Mr. Trump had been sending. Mr. Bannon could buy no more time.Kate Kelly contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The results are delicious.Supported byCan you create a farm-to-table restaurant if you have 100 tables in an 8,750-square-foot main dining room, 80 more tables downstairs, nine in a cozy lounge, 50 outside overlooking an Arcadian lake and, on certain nights, eight in a capacious kitchen?Mohonk, the idyllic resort founded by Albert Smiley in 1869, was not a logical candidate for a chef-driven restaurant with a focus on local sourcing. It\u2019s not a cafe, bistro or gastropub. It\u2019s big. The hotel, a National Historic Landmark on more than 2,000 acres in the Shawangunk Mountains, has 265 rooms in five wings that date to 1879.On a busy night \u2014 and there are many busy nights \u2014 its restaurant serves 600 diners. On Thanksgiving, 1,450; Mother\u2019s Day, 1,400. The kitchen orders 2,000 pounds of beef a week, 1,200 each of chicken and fish, 40 cases of eggs.\u201cIt\u2019s funny how things change,\u201d Mr. Palmeri said early one morning in the Mohonk kitchen, where the staff was already focused on prepping for the lunch and dinner crowds. \u201cWhen I first started cooking, everybody wanted the exotic. Ostrich was going to be the next red meat. Now they want to know what you buy locally. They want to know how far the farm is from the hotel.\u201dMr. Palmeri, 54, has been the executive chef at Mohonk for 10 years, and although he long had an interest in local products, the volume needed at a resort that serves more than 500,000 meals a year was a hurdle.\u201cIn the old days they\u2019d bring us a box of lettuce and half of it was dirt and grubs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as nice as that sounds we can\u2019t have a guy just cleaning lettuce.\u201dBut new purveyors brought new opportunities to showcase Hudson Valley products, and \u201cthe next challenge for me is to implement more of that into the dining experience.\u201dWhen he arrived in New Paltz, where the trees lean toward pine and maple, Mr. Palmeri had to \u201cget my head around\u201d Mohonk. Unlike resorts and hotels with multiple options \u2014 or proximity to cities with plenty of good restaurants \u2014 Mohonk has one dining room for dinner. (That room, which was first used in 1893, is grand; the ceilings are as high as 23 feet 10 inches.)\u201cThere\u2019s no choice for our guests, really,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have one opportunity, the dinner menu, to make someone from the city feel that they\u2019ve had a good meal, or someone who wants a steak and potato and that\u2019s it.\u201dOne of the first things Mr. Palmeri did was address the kitchen\u2019s \u201clow, low staffing levels,\u201d adding cooks to a crew that included Joe Serrecchio (35 years), the butcher, and Greg Becker (37 years), who makes all of the deeply flavored soups. For his stocks, most of which are made in 40-gallon pots, Mr. Becker gets 900 pounds of veal bones a week and 400 pounds of chicken.With an expanded team \u2014 there can be as many as 70 staff members during the summer in a kitchen that is quiet only between midnight and 3:30 a.m. \u2014 Mr. Palmeri set about elevating the food. Mohonk began making its own pasta two and a half years ago. It also started smoking brisket, bacon, pork belly and other meats. And Ms. Billups has transformed the desserts: lemon-thyme posset with shortbread, apple brown-sugar cheesecake with apple cider caramel and a dusting of brown butter sugar.\u201cWe can get all these things now easily,\u201d Mr. Palmeri said of the local produce and poultry. \u201cBefore, we were so busy and we were short-staffed, so you had to give your attention to the most pressing thing, which was surviving the day.\u201d (Of course, not everything is local; no one is pulling sea bass and blue cod out of Lake Mohonk.)Last summer, Mohonk introduced a Chef\u2019s Table meal in the kitchen, with seating for eight. It is a chance for the chefs to show what they can do but not show off (Mohonk is not braggy): 11 courses, matching wines, spirited group, total fun. On the night I went, the procession included a silky cylinder of Hudson Valley foie gras with compressed apples and plum compote; a poached local egg with hollandaise foam and English muffin crumbles; a smoked sea scallop and velvety Iberico lardo atop potato cream; and a crisp-skinned Finger Lakes duck breast with sherry sauce and duck-confit tortellini. As J. K. Rowling wrote of the dishes that awaited Harry Potter at Hogwarts: \u201cHe had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table.\u201dAnd then there were desserts, which included vanilla wafer cones filled with Chambord ice cream made tableside by Mr. Anson, and a showstopper orchestrated by Ms. Billups. After the table was covered with a white plastic mat (\u201ca blank canvas,\u201d she said), Ms. Billups spooned and scattered the following for each diner (this a partial list but you\u2019ll get the picture): hot fudge sauce, pistachio sabayon, an ounce of warm chocolate cake, cubes of amaretto gel\u00e9e. It was a finger-painting with one burst of flavor \u2014 sweet, tart, tangy \u2014 after another.At meal\u2019s end, Mr. Palmeri and Mr. Anson said a modest good night and did a slow fade out of the kitchen \u00e0 la Rick Blaine and Louis Renault \u2014 \u201cCasablanca\u201d but with stockpots.Mr. Palmeri\u2019s latest project is the rethinking of the Granary, the cliff-top outdoor restaurant. This year, there is flavorful grass-fed beef in the burgers, and savory chicken, both from the region.\u201cThe Granary is outdoor barbecue,\u201d Mr. Palmeri said. \u201cIt should all be local, right?\u201dNone of this happened overnight, which is in keeping with Mohonk, where it\u2019s not supposed to (employees were still harvesting ice from the lake in 1965). One of the hotel\u2019s infinite charms is how steadfast it is. There have never been televisions in rooms. A sign tells guests that \u201chorseplay\u201d is prohibited at what is still called the bathing beach. Meditation sessions are held every morning. Tea and cookies are served each afternoon in the Lake Lounge.You go back to Mohonk looking forward to doing the things you did the last time: strolling on a trail or scrambling up the rocks to Sky Top Tower, with a sweeping view of the cliff called the Trapps. Finding serenity on a bench in one of the scores of gazebos known as summerhouses (the view from Huntington Lookout is spectacular). Making a paper lantern in an afternoon craft session. Piling into the Parlor after dinner to see the ventriloquist Sylvia Fletcher or to venture an answer in a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll quiz conducted by Bruce Morrow, a.k.a. the longtime D.J. Cousin Brucie. (I won a Gladys Knight & the Pips CD; totally wanted it.)Any changes to the place are deliberated by the Smiley family.The expansive spa, for one, was discussed for a decade before it opened in 2005. As Eric Gullickson, the general manager and a fifth-generation member of the Smiley family, said, it\u2019s important that Mohonk is \u201cnot just reacting to something that\u2019s a trend.\u201d (\u201cDisruption\u201d is not in the Mohonk vocabulary.)The small bar called the Carriage Lounge was a similar story. Albert Smiley, from a temperate Quaker family, did not serve alcohol when he opened Mohonk in what had previously been a 10-room tavern owned by John Stokes, which most definitely did.That didn\u2019t mean some guests didn\u2019t drink. \u201cThey would bring these suitcase travel bars to their room, and they would try to get enough of a shine on to get them through dinner and sometimes they overshot,\u201d Mr. Palmeri said. \u201cThe way they judged the captain in the dining room was, was he able to carry a guest back to their room?\u201dThe dining room began serving liquor in 1970. The Carriage Lounge opened in 2005, and Spirits on the Sunset, drinks on a broad porch with the Catskill Mountains as backdrop, in 2016.The emphasis on local food, though, isn\u2019t a change as much as it\u2019s a back-to-the-garden moment. For decades Mohonk had its own farms \u2014 at one time there were seven \u2014 which provided food for its dining room. (Mohonk Farms Milk was still listed on the menu in 1958.) One farm, Mountain Rest, is now part of the hilly Mohonk golf course, and others, like Home Farm and Spring Farm, have prominent places in the 85-mile Mohonk trail system.The kitchen\u2019s recent focus on Hudson Valley farms aligns with \u201chealth and wellness and nature and all the things that emanate out of that,\u201d Mr. Gullickson said.\u201cMohonk is very much founded on those principles,\u201d he continued.Whether they featured local items or not, Mohonk\u2019s menus, some of which are displayed at the vast Barn Museum on the property, are a captivating chronicle of American cooking.For supper in the 1890s, guests could order cornmeal mush and choose from 10 different kinds of cold meat, among them roast beef and tongue. (The story goes that Stokes\u2019s tavern was known to serve peacock, a dish Mohonk did not carry over to its own dining operation.) There also was a list of stomach-soothing waters, including Saratoga Vichy and Apollinaris from Germany.In 1934, straight out of Escoffier, poached eggs Colbert (the recipe has them in a tartlet with b\u00e9chamel). Diners could get a leg of veal with pan gravy in 1958 and, for a starter, jellied turkey bouillon.In 1972: saut\u00e9ed frog legs Proven\u00e7al, creamed Welsh rabbit on a Holland rusk, and, in a gust of brand names, \u201cHollywood Diet Bread\u201d and \u201cSteamed Uncle Ben\u2019s Rice.\u201dMy first visit to Mohonk was in 1987, when my wife and I celebrated our first anniversary on what we remember as a muddy May weekend. Our dinner orders have been lost to time, but we were so taken with the place \u2014 including the warmth of the longleaf-pine-walled main dining room \u2014 that we have returned on a number of occasions with our three children (first as grade-schoolers, then as grown-ups), a grandmother or a passel of friends.Dinner was always dependable and, in recent years, became much more ambitious and delicious. It wasn\u2019t a thunderclap; true to Mohonk tradition, Mr. Palmeri plays a long game. (He also knows which flames to keep \u2014 he loves Thanksgiving at Mohonk \u2014 turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce. \u201cIt really glows. I think it\u2019s us at our best, to be honest.\u201d)\u201cOur goal is to have people come here for the food,\u201d Mr. Palmeri said. \u201cSomeone who will remain nameless \u2014 they laughed at me \u2014 they said, you can\u2019t really think that, can you? My response was: How could you not expect me to?\u201dThere was also house-made pappardelle pasta Bolognese, a dish that is close to Mr. Palmeri\u2019s heart.Mr. Palmeri grew up in a large Italian family in Greendale, a suburb of Milwaukee; his mother, Mary, was an accomplished cook who read Bon App\u00e9tit and watched \u201cThe Galloping Gourmet.\u201d\u201cI just fell in love with the passion that she had for food,\u201d he said.Which is why the pappardelle and a sauce made with 40 pounds of ground meat for each batch is a regular on the Mohonk menu, though Mr. Palmeri said there was some initial skepticism in the kitchen about offering a simple, if classic, pasta dish.\u201cBolognese is something I\u2019ve always done, it\u2019s one I grew up on,\u201d he said. He paused for a beat and smiled. \u201cBolognese stays!\u201dIt may not be farm-to-table but it is mom-to-table, and sometimes that\u2019s just as good.Steve Reddicliffe is the deputy Travel editor for The New York Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Case Some Executives Made for Sticking With Trump", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs corporate chieftains on a White House advisory panel debated on Wednesday on whether to disband, a few spoke up in favor of sticking with President Trump.They made their case in terms of business self-interest, patriotism and pragmatism.Jack Welch, the retired leader of General Electric, said the business leaders should not abandon the president, according to a person briefed on the call, who was not authorized to speak about it.W. James McNerney Jr., the former head of Boeing, reminded the corporate executives that they wanted a business-friendly administration. Mr. McNerney, the person said, told the group that he was in favor of condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks but that the pro-business agenda was too important to justify dissolving the council and losing influence.But they were lonely voices.The group ultimately decided to disband to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s equating far-right hate groups with the groups opposing them in Charlottesville, Va.The apparent retreat from Mr. Trump by many corporate executives has added to concerns that chaos in the White House and the president\u2019s propensity to inflame crises as opposed to tamping them down are jeopardizing his agenda to overhaul taxes and put in place an infrastructure plan.Stocks slid on Thursday in part on worries that the president\u2019s ruptured relations with business would damage his plans to jump-start economic growth. The decline steepened after the terrorist attack in Barcelona.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index closed the day down 1.54 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 1.24 percent. The closely watched VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, better known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, soared more than 30 percent.On Thursday, the White House announced that a presidential advisory group on infrastructure policy and investment was also disbanding.A number of companies, including Merck, Under Armour, Intel, Pepsi, G.E., IBM and Johnson & Johnson, made public statements this week condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks that \u201cmany sides\u201d were responsible for the violence in Virginia as being at odds with their corporate values.Some of his supporters in the business world and several corporate members of the advisory groups, meanwhile, have not said anything publicly about Charlottesville.One of the more vocal supporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group, has condemned the events in Charlottesville.As the one who conceived of and, at the president\u2019s request, led the most prominent of the shuttered White House councils, he has felt the recent tensions between corporate America and the president most keenly. Mr. Schwarzman, of all the council members, maintained the most consistent contact with the president.According to people who have spoken with him, Mr. Schwarzman was disappointed that the panel was not able to fulfill its ultimate function, which was to help the president deliver on his pro-growth promises by offering tips and advice from the front lines of business and finance.Now that the panel has disbanded, it remains unclear if Mr. Schwarzman will continue to discuss policy with the president.Mr. Schwarzman declined to comment.The unfolding corporate response to Mr. Trump \u2014 and the varied reactions by companies \u2014 reflects the constellation of outside pressures top corporate executives face today, management experts say.\u201cPrincipled stances are not common,\u201d said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThey wait for public opinion to tell them what to do.\u201d\u201cC.E.O. courage is in short supply,\u201d she said.That is more the case these days than back in the 1960s and 1970s, when business leaders like Irving S. Shapiro of DuPont, Reginald H. Jones of G.E. and Thomas Watson Jr. of IBM often led public opinion, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management.Some business leaders, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, were advocates for the creation of federal environmental protection programs, and Mr. Jones of G.E. popularized the phrase \u201ccorporate social responsibility.\u201dBut their contemporary counterparts, he said, are under much greater pressure to deliver quarterly profits, travel constantly and work almost round the clock.\u201cThey don\u2019t have the time or the support in their boardrooms to be corporate statespeople,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said.The modern C.E.O., said Michael Useem, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, holds a job that calls for \u201cgreat pragmatism\u201d under scrutiny from shareholders, consumers, employees and advocacy groups, all of which is amplified by the instantaneous communication of social media.In dealing with Mr. Trump, corporate executives had to weigh speaking out against the risk of being the target of a presidential tweetstorm or the potential loss of lucrative government contracts.Mr. Trump may be mercurial and unpredictable, but access to the White House can put a favored executive or investor in a position to influence policy.Peter Thiel, who was the only major figure in Silicon Valley to endorse Mr. Trump, has parlayed that endorsement and a last-minute $1.25 million donation to the candidate\u2019s campaign into an unofficial role as his top tech adviser.In March, Mr. Thiel\u2019s chief of staff, Michael Kratsios, became the White House\u2019s deputy chief technology officer. Mr. Thiel recently participated in administration discussions that resulted in a harder line toward China over possible intellectual-property violations.Mr. Thiel has given no indication he is backing off from his support for Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Thiel declined to comment Thursday.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies in business come from the private precincts of Wall Street investors, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. They face few of the pressures that the chief executives of public companies must juggle.Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in the hedge fund industry have included Paul Singer, Steven A. Cohen and John Paulson. And Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, is an unpaid adviser to Mr. Trump on regulatory matters. (All did not respond to requests for comment.)Mr. Trump has long relied on a close and informal circle of advisers to give him a quick read on economic and financial matters. Among the more prominent in this regard is Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire real estate investor who has known the president for decades.Mr. Barrack, who made his fortune snapping up undervalued real estate assets, is the executive chairman of Colony NorthStar, and has been a trusted confidant to Mr. Trump during the campaign and since he took office.Kenneth G. Langone, billionaire co-founder of Home Depot and a prominent Republican fund-raiser, has been a vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic agenda.\u201cI had high hopes \u2014 the president has blown a great opportunity,\u201d Mr. Langone said in an interview on Thursday. \u201cHe completely mishandled the situation in Charlottesville. There was no gray area here \u2014 these people were repulsive.\u201dMr. Langone said that the president\u2019s provocative comments on the protests were a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that would hurt his ability to address pressing national needs like infrastructure.Still, despite their building frustrations and disappointments, some Trump supporters may feel that they should stick by him, betting on his proven ability as a survivor.\u201cDo I have a choice? No,\u201d Mr. Langone said. \u201cI still believe he can get a lot done and he has an uncanny knack of surviving \u2014 I mean who would have thought he was going to win in the first place?\u201dDavid Streitfeld, Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beneath Markets\u2019 Calm Are Signs of Growing Investor Caution", "Date": "2017-08-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump threatened nuclear war with North Korea, and the markets yawned.While stocks in Asia sold off initially, the main market measures in the United States fell less than half a percent on Wednesday and ended the day nearly unchanged, as investors stuck to focusing on buoyant economic fundamentals and ignoring the chaos of American politics.But beneath the calm there were signs that investors \u2014 who have been conditioned since the presidential election in November to embrace risk instead of running from it \u2014 are becoming more cautious.The price of gold, a traditional safe investment, has been rising, and on Wednesday it continued its march, increasing more than 1 percent on the day.Gold\u2019s strong move pushed it just barely ahead of the benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index for the year \u2014 up 10.75 percent, compared with 10.69 percent for the S.&P., according to Y Charts, a data-gathering company.On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 and the narrower Dow Jones industrial average ended the day virtually flat.Earlier, the Nikkei index in Japan closed down 1.29 percent, while the Kospi index in South Korea ended down 1.10 percent. European stocks were also lower, with London down 0.56 percent and Frankfurt down 1.12 percent.Prices of United States Treasury securities \u2014 often in demand in times of turmoil \u2014 rose early in the day, driving their yields, which move in the opposite direction, lower. But Treasury prices gave up ground in the afternoon, and the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.25 percent, from 2.26 percent on Tuesday.Gold futures rose 1.59 percent, to $1,282.40 an ounce.Gold tends to outperform stocks when the markets are sliding, so it is unusual for such a conservative investment to beat equities when they have been on a tear as has been the case this year.What is driving this anomaly, some say, is a recognition that eventually investors will not be able to ignore recent headline risks \u2014 whether nuclear tensions with North Korea, a trade war with China or a debt ceiling crisis in Washington.\u201cThere has been a Pavlovian response by investors to disregard any piece of bad news or any spike in volatility, and that has been a very profitable strategy,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, a portfolio manager for BlackRock\u2019s $39 billion Global Allocation Fund. \u201cBut we do think that there are risks in the world that are not being priced in.\u201dThe VIX rose nearly 9 percent on Wednesday after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about North Korea, before settling up just 1.37 percent, at 11.11 for the day. The index has been trading at historically low levels, and many investors continue to wager that lots of money pouring into markets and an improving global economy will keep the index quiescent.Mr. Koesterich, however, has been taking the opposite side of that trade. Since the beginning of the year, he has been adding to his gold position, and it is now the Global Allocation Fund\u2019s second-largest position, according to Y Charts.Mr. Koesterich is not alone in adopting a wary stance, especially now in August, when trading desks on Wall Street empty out and lower levels of buying and selling can result in sharper downward moves in the market.While few people are predicting an actual crash, a growing number of stock market specialists are warning that in the coming months, markets are likely to start reacting more to so-called macro events such as political volatility and the realization that central bankers in Europe and the United States are moving toward a more restrictive stance on interest rates and intervening in markets.That is because the benign market conditions of recent months have been spurred by better economic news, and, in particular, by a very good spate of second-quarter earnings.Once investors return from vacation, the theory goes, and with no good earnings news to inspire them, they will be more sensitive to headline events.That could result in sharper moves downward in stock market indexes.\u201cThere are risks,\u201d said Marko Kolanovic a market strategist and derivatives specialist at JPMorgan Chase, who warned in a recent report about an increase in trading volatility this fall. \u201cChina, North Korea and the normalization of policies by central banks, which has been underappreciated by the market.\u201dBut while many investors have shaken off scares such as Britain exiting the European Union or political unrest in Washington, the view is taking hold that gold can be a very good hedge against more serious threats like nuclear confrontation in Asia.\u201cThere has been a wall of money supporting markets so far,\u201d said Stuart Culverhouse, a market strategist at Exotix Capital in London. \u201cBut this time we are not just talking about a macro surprise \u2014 we are talking about full-on military action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was the sharpest daily decline in the benchmark S.&P. 500 since May 17.Gold held at $1,283.70 an ounce after its strong run of late, and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan steadied from its fall on Wednesday, closing at 19,730. The relative safety of United States Treasury securities continued to appeal, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 2.20 percent from 2.25 percent on Wednesday. (Yields and prices move in opposite directions from each other.)At the root of investors\u2019 nervousness was a jump in the VIX, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, the index measures investor expectations that stocks will experience sharp moves in the future.On Thursday, the VIX surged 44 percent from its historically low levels to close the day at 16.04, its highest close since Election Day in November.For many weeks this year, the VIX hovered persistently in single-digit territory, unusual for a barometer that historically trades around 20.The index\u2019s long period of placidity amid constant upheaval in Washington has posed a persistent riddle for Wall Street prognosticators.Some analysts warned that expectations of low volatility had lured a rush of recent investment, particularly from retail investors piling into exchange traded funds tied to the S.&P. 500, the Nasdaq and other indexes and strategies.A sharp upward trend in the VIX could well prompt many of those newcomers to flee at the same time, which could turn a market downturn into something more severe.The potential risks extend beyond those who are new to the party. In recent years, hundreds of billions of dollars have flowed into risk parity and other machine-driven funds that are programmed to start selling stocks and bonds once volatility rises sharply.In a period of investment calm and artificially low interest rates, automated funds, which churn out consistent if unspectacular returns, have become very popular among yield-hungry investors.\u201cBy definition, investors tend to be long the most risk when volatility is at its lowest levels,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company based in Vail, Colo., that advises large money management firms on global investments. \u201cSo the question is: How much more volatility do we need to see before funds start to disgorge assets mechanically?\u201dAfter many years in which investors made a mint by betting against the VIX, a number of investors have begun to argue that the time has come to wager on the VIX \u2014 not against it.Of course, it may be too early to predict the end of one of the longest bull markets in financial history. The global economy continues to grow, and companies in the United States remain highly profitable, with earnings and sales in the quarter that ended in June handily beating expectations.The VIX\u2019s sharp move could also simply be a reversion to its mean and not a sign of panic in the markets.Analysts noted that a long period of stock market calm is highly unusual and that a correction should not come as a shock.Charlie Bilello, an analyst with Pension Partners, a financial advisory firm, said that before today\u2019s sell-off, the S.&P. 500 had experienced only two down days of more than 1 percent this year; the last similarly long period of financial calm was in 1964.That reserve of buying power, be it retail or institutional, has cushioned stock market drops in the past, and optimists are hoping that it will do so again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shut Down the Government, and This Time, Investors Will Care", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair Game\u201cIf we have to close down our government, we\u2019re building that wall.\u201dAnd with those words, the president managed to rattle investors in two big financial markets \u2014 United States Treasuries and stocks.In recent years, government shutdowns have become so common that markets have either embraced them or shrugged them off. But as investors absorb the possibility of a closure this fall, market tremors are likely to intensify, experts say. The past will not necessarily be prologue this time around.Investors are grappling with two matters right now: the need to raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling in September so the government can pay its obligations, and the desire to have a federal budget in place by Oct. 1 to avoid a shutdown.But the next day Mr. Trump invoked the government shutdown, spooking Treasury investors. Faced with the possibility of problems with both the debt ceiling and a shutdown, investors holding T-bills maturing in early October began selling. Short-term Treasury investors, like the institutions that oversee money market funds, can\u2019t afford to wait around to see if they\u2019ll be paid on time. It\u2019s easier to bail out of the holdings that could be affected.Stocks also weakened on the prospect of a shutdown \u2014 a very different investor response than has been seen during recent government closures.Mr. Boltansky looked back at the stock market\u2019s performance during all 18 government shutdowns, starting in 1976. He found that the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index averaged just a 0.6 percent loss over the course of those closures.Early on in shutdown history, investors reacted very negatively. Closures in 1976 and 1977 coincided with 3 percent declines in the S. & P. 500.As investors grew more accustomed to shutdowns, they seemed to become more blas\u00e9 about them. During the mid-1990s and the 2013 closure, for instance, stocks actually rose. They gained 3.1 percent during the 2013 stoppage.Although stocks rose on Friday, investors should not expect such a performance this time, Mr. Boltansky said. One reason is that a government closure would raise serious doubts about the ability of the Republicans in Congress to get anything done.\u201cIt will confirm one of the market\u2019s fears that the Republicans are not a political party but a government coalition made up of leadership loyalists, conservatives and moderates,\u201d Mr. Boltansky said. \u201cIf you have that dynamic, how can you get anything done legislatively?\u201dRemember that investors have been propelling stocks to record highs in part because of their expectations for pro-business action in Washington. A government shutdown could douse those hopes and drag down shares.Plans among Republicans for broad-based tax reform may also be hurt by a government shutdown. Investors looking for big increases in corporate earnings as a result of lower tax rates may be in for a disappointment.Here\u2019s another question: How can the Federal Reserve Board begin to normalize monetary policy, as it has said it would, amid a government closure?Then there\u2019s the real disruption that government closures bring. Federal employees are furloughed, national parks closed and loans to small businesses halted. These shutdowns can result in real downturns in economic activity.The report\u2019s list of negative effects from the shutdown is long. It said the stoppage delayed Food and Drug Administration approvals of medical devices and drugs, stalled almost $4 billion in refunds to taxpayers, halted or curtailed services for veterans, and cost the National Park Service $500 million. Some 700 small businesses that had applied for roughly $140 million in loans during the shutdown had to wait until it ended to gain approval.In short, the ripple effects resulting from a government shutdown are likely to be significant. Investors who have grown used to stock prices that only go up might want to strap themselves in for a bumpy ride.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thanks to a Shopping Spree, Japan Is Looking Up. It May Not Last.", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s long-sluggish economy has found its spark. To keep it flickering, Japan needs to find more big spenders like Sayaka Sakata.Ms. Sakata, a 49-year-old mother of four, recently moved to a rented house from an apartment in the city of Yokohama after her husband got a new job. That meant buying new stuff: a washing machine, a refrigerator, some appliances and even a used car. Saving, she said, was no longer her top priority.\u201cI\u2019m an optimistic person,\u201d she said. \u201cI think spending money on my family is more important.\u201dThe unexpected surge in economic growth reported in Japan this week was thanks in large part to an unexpected source: Japanese consumers.Long known as aging penny pinchers, Japanese shoppers in recent months have decided to spend. Data showed they bought more cars, air-conditioners, television sets and other appliances during the three months that ended in June, fueling an unusually high annualized growth rate of 4 percent.But the June quarter results have left many economists scratching their heads. Despite low unemployment figures and a year and a half of slow-but-steady economic growth, worker pay in Japan has been mostly stagnant. Overall wages fell in June compared with a year ago, according to official data.This week\u2019s figures could suggest paychecks will start to rise and Japan\u2019s consumers are feeling better. Or, economists say, the figures could be a fluke, leaving Japan to keep looking for ways to escape its slow-growth rut.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is permanent consumption,\u201d said Kozo Ueda, a professor of political science and economics at Waseda University in Tokyo. \u201cI think it\u2019ll decrease in the next quarter because the figures in this quarter are too strong.\u201dWhen workers retire, Japanese companies often replace them with temporary workers, who make less than regular hires, depressing wages even more. Temporary workers, like freelance or contract workers, make up about one-third of the country\u2019s work force.\u201cThere\u2019s still question marks all over wages,\u201d said Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research for the Asia-Pacific region at ING, the Dutch bank.That has left some workers feeling confident. Jimmy Yoon, for example, just bought his dream car: a Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicle.The Jeep will not be cheap. Mr. Yoon, a 26-year-old South Korean living in Japan, has committed to paying $1,000 a month for the next three years. But he just got a job in logistics in Tokyo at an e-commerce company and his stock investments are beginning to pay off.\u201cI\u2019ve been working on my stocks since university, and I\u2019ve actually been aiming to get a car since when I was 21 years old,\u201d Mr. Yoon said. \u201cThat was the final goal, to get the money.\u201dA new job also gave Mika Funaba, 26, new confidence. Last year, while working in hospitality, she was reluctant to spend. But then she got a position in a Yokohama salon as a beauty therapist specializing in eyelash extensions. Feeling more secure, she recently spent about $3,000 on improving her teeth and took a trip to the Philippines.Of her new, $4,500-a-month income, Ms. Funaba said, \u201cI know that it will never go down, but it won\u2019t necessarily go up.\u201dStill, economists say the consumer sales rise could be explained by more temporary factors.For one, several different kinds of durable goods have reached the end of their life cycles, said Professor Ueda of Waseda University. Six years ago, Japan ended analog TV service, prompting demand for flat-screen TVs. And the government has encouraged the purchase of environmentally friendly appliances.The key to wage growth may be productivity. Franz Waldenberger, director and chief economist of the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo, says low unemployment will not result in significant wage increases by itself.Wages could rise if productivity does, he said, and \u201cthat would be an excellent performance given the demographic condition of an aging population.\u201dStill, Ms. Sakata of Yokohama said that she has reason to believe the good times will stick.\u201cI remember four years ago reading a lot about young graduates finding it hard to get a job,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t really see that anymore. I\u2019ve encouraged my 21-year-old son, who\u2019s studying in Australia, to come back to Japan because the job market looks good.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Will the Tech Bubble Burst?", "Date": "2017-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the height of a market mania in 1967, the author George Goodman captured the mood perfectly, comparing it to a surreal party that ends only when \u201cblack horsemen\u201d burst through the doors and cut down all the revelers who remain. \u201cThose who leave early are saved, but the ball is so splendid no one wants to leave while there is still time. So everybody keeps asking \u2014 what time is it? But none of the clocks have hands.\u201dEvery decade since, the global markets have relived this party. In the late 1960s the mania was for the \u201cnifty 50\u201d American companies like Disney and McDonald\u2019s, which had been the \u201cgo-go\u201d stocks of that decade. In the late 1970s it was for natural resources, from gold to oil. In the late 1980s it was stocks in Japan, and in the late 1990s it was the dot-com boom. Last decade, investors flocked to mortgage-backed securities and big emerging markets from Brazil to Russia. In every case, many partygoers were still in the market when the crash came.Today, tech mania is resurgent. Investors are again glancing at a clock with no hands \u2014 and dismissing the risk. The profitless start-ups that were wiped out in the dot-com crash have consolidated into an oligopoly composed of leading survivors such as Google and Apple. These are giants with real earnings, yet signs of an irrational euphoria are growing.One is pitchmen bundling investments with very different outlooks into a single package. Last decade they bundled Brazil, Russia, India and China to sell as the BRICs. More recently they packaged Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google as FANG, then, as names and prospects shifted, subbed in Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft to make Faama. Others are hyping the hottest tech companies in China as BAT, for Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent. Whatever the mix, acronym mania is usually a sign of bubbly thinking.Seven of the world\u2019s 10 most valuable companies are in the tech sector, matching the late 1999 peak. As the American stock market keeps marching to new highs \u2014 the Dow hit 22,000 this week \u2014 the gains are increasingly concentrated in the big tech stocks. The bulls say it is inevitable that Apple will become the first trillion-dollar company.No matter how surreal the endgame, booms tend to begin with real innovation. In the past, manias have been triggered by excitement about canals, the telegraph and the automobile. But not since the advent of railroads incited market booms in the 1830s and 1840s has the world seen back-to-back booms like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the one we are in now.The dot-com era saw the rise of big companies that were building the nuts and bolts of the internet \u2014 including Dell, Microsoft, Cisco and Intel \u2014 and of start-ups that promised to tap its revolutionary potential. The current boom lacks a popular name because the innovations \u2014 from the internet of things to artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 are sprawling and hard to label. If there is a single thread, it is the expanding capacity to harness data, which the Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, calls the \u201celectricity of the 21st century.\u201dMarket excitement about authentic technology innovations enters the manic phase when stock prices rise faster than justified by underlying economic growth. Since the crisis of 2008, the United States economy has been recovering at the rate of around 2 percent, roughly half the rate seen for much of the past century. The areas of growth are limited in this environment. Oil\u2019s not very euphoric, with prices depressed, while regulators are forcing banks to keep the music down. In the most direct echo of 1999, technology is once again seen as the best party in town.It is true that prices today are not quite as widely overvalued as in 1999. Large technology stocks are up 350 percent this decade, the low end of the range for the hot stocks from earlier booms, which saw gains of 300 to 1,900 percent. Only a few select technology companies \u2014 mainly the internet giants \u2014 are trading close to the valuations of the dot-com era, when the average price-to-earnings ratio for tech companies hit 50. The average ratio for that sector today is 18.However, the scale of today\u2019s tech boom is not readily visible because much of the investment action has moved into the hands of big private players. In 1999, nearly 550 start-ups went public, and after many ended in disaster, the government tightened regulation of public companies. In part to avoid that red tape, this year only 11 tech companies have gone public. Many are raising money instead from venture capitalists or private equity funds. Venture capitalists have poured more than $60 billion into the technology sector every year for the past three years \u2014 the highest flows since the peak in 2000 \u2014 and private equity investors say there has never been a better time to raise money.These new private funding channels are creating \u201cunicorns,\u201d companies that haven\u2019t gone public but are valued at $1 billion or more. Unicorns barely existed in 1999. Now there are more than 260 worldwide, with technology companies dominating the list. And if signs emerge that the privately owned unicorns are faltering, the value of publicly owned tech companies is not likely to hold up either.We can never know when the end will come. Still, there are three critical signals to watch for.The first is regulation. The tech giants are seen today as monopolizing internet search and commerce, and they are angling to take over industries such as publishing and automobiles, raising alarms at antitrust agencies in Europe and the United States. Fear that new internet technologies are doing more to waste time and brainpower than to increase productivity has already provoked a backlash in China, where officials recently criticized online gaming as \u201celectronic heroin.\u201d A regulatory crackdown on tech giants as either monopolies or productivity destroyers could pop the allure of tech stocks.The other signals are more familiar. Going back to the \u201cnifty 50\u201d stocks of the 1960s, nearly every big market mania ended after central banks tightened monetary policy and many people who had borrowed to get in the game found themselves in trouble. The dot-com bubble peaked in 2000, after the Federal Reserve had increased interest rates multiple times. The current boom will likewise be at risk if an increase in inflation compels the Fed to raise interest rates beyond the modest rise the market currently expects.Finally, watch for tech earnings to start falling short of analyst forecasts. The dot-com boom was driven in part by increasingly optimistic predictions for technology company earnings, and it imploded when earnings started to miss badly. Investors realized then that their expectations about profits from the internet revolution had become unreal.Of course, no two booms will unfold exactly the same way. We are now eight years into this bull market, making it the second longest in history, behind only the run-up of the late 1990s. No bull market lasts forever, and while it is clear that we are entering the late stages of this cycle, it is impossible to say whether this moment is like 1999, or 1998 \u2014 or earlier.The clocks have no hands, and the black horsemen may appear at any time.Ruchir Sharma, author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is the chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jobs, Factories and Stocks Provide Economic Lift for Trump", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA stock market hitting record highs. Foreign corporations announcing big new plants in the United States. And robust hiring that has brought the unemployment rate to a 16-year low.That convergence added up to a solid economic report card on Friday that President Trump was happy to present to the nation as a sign of good work.On the hiring front, the Labor Department reported that 209,000 jobs were added in July, somewhat above Wall Street economists\u2019 expectations, with the unemployment rate matching May\u2019s 4.3 percent, the lowest since early 2001.And while the stock market had a relatively quiet day, the Dow Jones industrial average reached another high, two days after it closed above 22,000 for the first time.As all that positive economic news ricocheted through Wall Street, on social media and around office cubicles, conversation inevitably turned to one question: How much credit does Mr. Trump deserve?President Trump has taken to Twitter to celebrate his handling of the economy. But how much credit can he really claim?In a series of early-morning tweets, the president claimed quite a bit.On the hiring news, he declared, \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released \u2014 and I have only just begun.\u201d Earlier, in addition to saluting the \u201cgreat investment\u201d by Toyota and Mazda, he noted, \u201cConsumer confidence is at a 16 year high .... and for good reason.\u201d Both tweets pointed to a looser regulatory environment as a factor.Of course, as economists are fond of saying, correlation is not causation. Many of the trends Mr. Trump is benefiting from \u2014 falling unemployment, steady hiring, a rising stock market \u2014 were firmly in place under his predecessor, Barack Obama.And in the case of Friday\u2019s jobs data, Mr. Trump is citing figures he called phony not long ago on the campaign trail.In the end, there is no way to quantify exactly how much credit the president is due for attracting foreign investment or encouraging the creation of jobs here instead of overseas.But even some skeptics of his overall approach concede that Mr. Trump\u2019s promises of tax reform and higher infrastructure spending, as well as pressure to increase domestic manufacturing, are resonating in boardrooms in the United States and abroad.\u201cIt\u2019s still 80 percent lip service in the corporate world, but there are some executives who want to support Trump\u2019s initiatives,\u201d said Howard Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies who covers aerospace and defense giants like Boeing and United Technologies.Ravin Gandhi, founder and chief executive of GMM Nonstick Coatings in Chicago, is a case in point.The son of immigrants from India, Mr. Gandhi fiercely opposed Mr. Trump before the election, even appearing on CNBC to denounce the candidate\u2019s proposals on trade, immigration and health care.After Mr. Trump was elected, however, \u201cI bought into the economic growth rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said. \u201cI was hearing stories about 4 percent growth, about tax reform and my health care costs going down.\u201dNone of that has come to pass, of course.But this year Mr. Gandhi has invested $3 million to expand domestically and hired more than 20 employees, even though sales are flat compared with 2016, when they were up by double digits.\u201cIt\u2019s nuanced,\u201d he said, noting that his company was recently purchased by a Japanese conglomerate and that the American houseware firms he supplies make their pots and pans mostly overseas.\u201cA lot of us who were against Trump are still rooting for him to succeed because as citizens we want the economy to do well,\u201d Mr. Gandhi said. \u201cBut so far, it\u2019s been all hat and no cattle.\u201dDespite generally strong earnings, many manufacturers continue to shed jobs.In December, Mr. Trump persuaded United Technologies, parent of Carrier, not to proceed with a shutdown of an Indianapolis plant, but the company did go ahead with several hundred previously announced layoffs last month.\u201cWhen it matches the market, companies are still establishing production outside the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Rubel said.\u201cIf it\u2019s a tossup, though, companies seem more willing to keep the work here,\u201d he added. \u201cThe optics are better, especially if it will help them in their pitch for tax reform, infrastructure or to get defense contracts.\u201dPerhaps even more than outsourcing, the real threat to job growth for Mr. Trump\u2019s blue-collar base comes from automation and other efforts to improve productivity on the factory floor. In Mr. Obama\u2019s final year in office, Boeing\u2019s work force fell to 148,138 from 159,469, according to Mr. Rubel.Boeing reported stellar earnings recently, lifting its stock to record levels, but it has cut another 4,500 positions since Mr. Trump moved into the White House.The factory sector has been showing signs of life this year, although experts said that has more to do with improving economies overseas and a weaker dollar that benefits exporters than with any specific White House policies. Still, manufacturers added 16,000 jobs in July, lifting employment in the sector to its highest level since January 2009.On the other hand, wage growth, the missing ingredient throughout the recovery, has remained tepid. The Labor Department said wages grew by 0.3 percent last month, bringing the 12-month gain to 2.5 percent, down from 2.8 percent a year ago.It is not such good news for American workers, but moderate salary gains are just fine with Wall Street. The lack of upward pressure on wages gives the Federal Reserve ample room to maneuver before its next rate increase.\u201cThis is a Goldilocks report for the markets,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, meaning it was not too hot or too cold, but just right for investors and Fed policy makers. The Dow closed up 66.71 to finish the week at 22,092.81.Mr. Gapen said the latest jobs figures suggested the central bank would stick with the plan Wall Street has been anticipating: a reduction in its bond holdings in September as the central bank gradually reduces its stimulus efforts, followed by a rate increase in December.For Mr. Trump and leaders from both parties on Capitol Hill, business owners say the key is to requite their increased optimism and hiring with actual accomplishments.\u201cWe may not agree in corporate America with the president on social issues like global warming or transgender people serving in the military,\u201d said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing company.But Mr. Gimbel, who opened a new office in Nashville on Monday and plans to add 100 workers this year, said he remained confident that the president and Congress would deliver on their promise of business-friendly legislation in the next year or two.\u201cTrump hasn\u2019t done anything tangible yet, but he has injected hope for corporate growth, tax reform and deregulation among business leaders, and that\u2019s driving hiring,\u201d Mr. Gimbel said.An earlier version of this article misstated the increase in average hourly earnings in July. It was 0.3 percent, not 0.4 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hotel at Night: Lobbyists, Cabinet Members, $60 Steaks", "Date": "2017-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It was nearing midnight at the Trump International Hotel, and the president\u2019s son was eating macaroni and cheese.Enveloped in the smooth tones of jazzy hotel music, soft light from a million tiny chandelier crystals and the scent of candied bacon, Eric Trump, fresh from a rally this month in West Virginia, declined a question from a reporter and instead posed one of his own.\u201cIs everything perfect?\u201d he asked, much like an attentive concierge.From the Trump family\u2019s point of view, how could it not be?The hotel \u2014 a melting pot for Trump family members, Trump surrogates, tourists, YouTube celebrities, journalists and the occasional white nationalist \u2014 has earned that status in no small part because it is home to the only Washington restaurant that President Trump visits.\u201cIt\u2019s the same old cesspool,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, one of the lawyers in the group and an ethics counsel in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cIt\u2019s just that now the president is getting a cut of the revenue.\u201dBut for those who are happy to spend money here, the hotel, dripping in crystals, slicked with marble and upholstered in blue velvet, feels a bit like a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d theme park.Several visits in August by reporters for The New York Times confirmed that some of the swamp\u2019s most prominent Republicans come out at night and gather in the lobby of the 263-room hotel, conveniently located on Pennsylvania Avenue five blocks from the White House.Where to look first? Opulence overwhelms the senses, making it hard to focus.Waiters say the commander in chief prefers a well-done Kansas City-cut steak, a Bible-thick slab of meat that is wheeled over on a large trolley stocked with tiny cups of ketchup. Visitors can wash it down with a $16 Manhattan Tea Party cocktail or \u2014 if the waiter is successful with his upcharge pitch \u2014 a $150 glass of Louis XIII cognac. A $22 cheesecake lollipop tree comes with a dollop of bubble gum whipped cream that feels more like putty and tastes not unlike dental fluoride. It is a best-seller.Not everyone goes for the red meat. During a brief period last month when Anthony Scaramucci was the hotel\u2019s most notorious resident, he preferred fish.\u201cAnthony is here,\u201d a solemn-faced hotel employee said that evening, requesting anonymity out of fear that he, too, might be fired for speaking indiscreetly. \u201cHe\u2019s angry. He\u2019s sad. He\u2019s staying at the hotel.\u201d\u201cThere are no protesters,\u201d Ms. McDonald said of her visit. \u201cIt\u2019s a very safe environment. The guard at the door was pretty buff.\u201dThere are plenty of other dimly lit restaurants in Washington that offer high-profile political sightings, but none are nearly as friendly to smartphone-waving tourists.But only one place offers the promise of spotting a Trump in the gilded wild.For two evenings during the first week in August, that was Eric Trump, the main attraction in the lobby and one of two Trump sons overseeing the president\u2019s real estate empire. Seated at a table facing the lobby entrance, Mr. Trump\u2019s presence caused a stir. Bystanders craned their necks to get a good look. A waiter shattered a glass. Another waiter spilled a glass of water on this reporter\u2019s purse.Mr. Trump shook hands, accepted confections from dessert-bearing chefs \u2014 no lollipop trees, though \u2014 and took selfies. At one point, a man approached Mr. Trump and persuaded him to move to a spot near the bar, where several other men had requested a picture-taking session.\u201cThese are true loyalists,\u201d the man said as he took the real estate scion\u2019s elbow.\u201cHe\u2019s very generous with his time,\u201d Mr. Gimenez said after he approached Eric Trump to say hello.Holding court on a blue velvet sofa some yards away was Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s digital strategist. Mr. Parscale spends a couple of evenings a week at the hotel \u2014 no discounts, he said \u2014 meeting with vendors or keeping an eye on the journalists who circulate the room.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t take my wife on a date there,\u201d Mr. Parscale said later. \u201cYou can\u2019t just sit around and just talk. When I\u2019m in that lobby, I\u2019m kind of like at work.\u201dDuring his visits, Eric Trump was at work, too. In an email sent after his visit, he said that greeting everyone, including supporters and reporters who interrupt his macaroni and cheese, is just part of the family business.\u201cAs to being approachable,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, \u201cI am always happy to take a picture with a fan or a guest \u2014 aside from being a kind person, we are in the hospitality industry and a warm and friendly environment is really the core of our business and who we are as a family.\u201dMr. Painter and other ethics experts say that is the gist of the problem \u2014 the hotel\u2019s political appeal has turned it into one giant lily pad where tourists, lobbyists and foreign leaders can schmooze and win favor with Trump loyalists.Some members of the Republican Party are happy to pump money into the business. According to recent Federal Election Commission filings, at least 22 Republican political campaigns have spent money at the hotel on lodging, food and event expenses since Mr. Trump was inaugurated.Jennifer Watson, the chief of staff for Representative Tom Rice, Republican of South Carolina, said the congressman\u2019s re-election campaign spent $1,200 on catering for an event at BLT Prime because of the appeal of a new steakhouse in a historic building. It was not, she said, because it was part of the Trump empire.\u201cYou don\u2019t see Trump, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the draw,\u201d Ms. Watson said of the president. \u201cIt\u2019s a new venue, and people want to try it.\u201dOthers say they visit because they hold political views that are unpopular in Washington.Linger long enough in the lobby, late enough at night, and you will almost always see the safe zone in action.Noah Weiland, Amy Fiscus, Mikayla Bouchard, Rachel Shorey and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nations Will Start Talks to Protect Fish of the High Seas", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 More than half of the world\u2019s oceans belong to no one, which often makes their riches ripe for plunder.Now, countries around the world have taken the first step to protect the precious resources of the high seas. In late July, after two years of talks, diplomats at the United Nations recommended starting treaty negotiations to create marine protected areas in waters beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 and in turn, begin the high-stakes diplomatic jostling over how much to protect and how to enforce rules.\u201cThe high seas are the biggest reserve of biodiversity on the planet,\u201d Peter Thomson, the ambassador of Fiji and current president of the United Nations General Assembly, said in an interview after the negotiations. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in an ungoverned way if we are concerned about protecting biodiversity and protecting marine life.\u201dWithout a new international system to regulate all human activity on the high seas, those international waters remain \u201ca pirate zone,\u201d Mr. Thomson said.In this series on lawlessness on the high seas, Ian Urbina reveals that crime and violence in international waters often goes unpunished.And so, the negotiations need to answer critical questions. How will marine protected areas be chosen? How much of the ocean will be set aside as sanctuaries? Will extraction of all marine resources be prohibited from those reserves \u2014 as so-called no-take areas \u2014 or will some human activity be allowed? Not least, how will the new reserve protections be enforced?Several countries, especially those that have made deals with their marine neighbors about what is allowed in their shared international waters, want regional fishing management bodies to take the lead in determining marine protected areas on the high seas. Others say a patchwork of regional bodies, usually dominated by powerful countries, is insufficient, because they tend to agree only on the least restrictive standards. (The United States Mission to the United Nations declined to comment.)The new treaty negotiations could begin as early as 2018. The General Assembly, made up of 193 countries, will ultimately make the decision.Not least, creating protected areas can also allow vulnerable species to spawn and migrate, including to areas where fishing is allowed.Some scientists fear that West Antarctica\u2019s immense ice sheet may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration.Fishing on the high seas, often with generous government subsidies, is a multibillion-dollar industry, particularly for high-value fish like the Chilean sea bass and bluefin tuna served in luxury restaurants around the world. Ending fishing in some vulnerable parts of the high seas is more likely to affect large, well-financed trawlers. It is less likely to affect fishermen who do not have the resources to venture into the high seas, said Carl Gustaf Lundin, director of the global marine program at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In fact, Mr. Lundin said, marine reserves could help to restore dwindling fish stocks.High-seas fishing is not nearly as productive as it used to be. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the effort,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve knocked out most of the catches.\u201dWhy is such a treaty necessary? At the moment, a variety of regional agreements and international laws govern what is permitted in international waters. The countries of the North Atlantic must agree, by consensus, on what is allowed in the high seas in their region, for instance, while the International Seabed Authority regulates what is allowed on the seabed in international waters, but not much more.Pew offers a list of fragile high-seas ecosystems that should be protected. At the top of the list is the Sargasso Sea in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, which is under increasing pressure from fishing trawlers, Ms. Wilson writes, and home to 100 species of invertebrates, 280 species of fish and 23 types of birds.Follow @NYTClimate on TwitterAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Real Tax Reform Could Be", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter their protracted failure to repeal Obamacare, congressional Republicans have indicated that taxes will be next on their agenda. It\u2019s a misnomer to call their plans \u201ctax reform,\u201d though, because they have proposed little more than the same deep cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals that they\u2019ve always wanted.Real reform would honestly confront the fact that in the next decade we will need roughly $4.5 trillion more revenue than currently projected to meet our existing commitments without increasing the federal debt as a share of the economy. Even more would be needed if the government were to make greater investments to lift productivity and living standards through education, infrastructure and scientific research. Real reform would do this by diversifying methods of taxation while targeting individuals and sectors best able to pay.While the wages of most Americans have stagnated for years, incomes of the wealthiest have soared. So it would make sense to increase the top rates on them and eliminate a break on income from investments.And dividends and capital gains from investments are taxed at a total top rate of only 23.8 percent. It would be reasonable to tax wages and investments at the same rates.Over all, the richest 1 percent pay 33 percent of their total income in taxes; if rates were changed so they paid 40 percent, it would generate $170 billion of revenue in the first year, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.There is rare bipartisan consensus that closing loopholes in order to lower the top corporate rate of 35 percent would help American businesses compete globally. But there is no agreement on which loopholes to close or where to set the rate.But even before lawmakers get into the weeds of corporate write-offs, they should agree to close a single huge loophole: the ability of corporations to defer tax on profits earned abroad or placed in overseas entities through accounting maneuvers. Intended to allow companies to more easily invest the profits abroad, this benefit has morphed into an abusive tax shelter that now shields $2.6 trillion.To tax the untaxed sums, Democrats should give up their opposition to granting corporations a discounted tax rate for the profits they bring home. Republicans should give up their support for only a voluntary repatriation at a near-zero rate. A compromise would give corporations a modest discount but require them to pay the tax and prevent them from stashing untaxed profits abroad anymore.A value-added tax would be akin to a national sales tax, but harder to evade than traditional sales taxes and thus an efficient revenue raiser well suited to a consumer-oriented economy. Since it would unduly burden low-income people, who spend most of their income, a VAT would need to be paired with measures like an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for the working poor.Real reform entails more than just cutting taxes, and will require hard work. But the net result could be a fairer and more productive system.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Samsung\u2019s Size Could Make It Tough to Keep Its Leader in Prison", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySamsung Town, an office park in the Gangnam Station area of Seoul. The Samsung brand, known abroad primarily for electronics and appliances, encompasses many more sectors in South Korea.\u00a0SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 This is a partial list of the businesses of Samsung, the South Korean business empire: smartphones, microchips, insurance, gas ovens, hospitals, dishwashers, cargo ships, stocks, microwave ovens, apartment buildings, vacuum cleaners, credit cards, pharmaceuticals, air-conditioners and bidets.Samsung is South Korea\u2019s No. 1 brand and, when all its products are added together, its single biggest export. It dominates South Korean business and social life in a way that can be difficult for outsiders to comprehend.That dominance may make it difficult to keep its top executive in prison.Mr. Lee is not the first big business figure in South Korea to be convicted, but if he stays in prison it would represent something of a milestone. His father, Samsung\u2019s longtime chief, was twice convicted of crimes and twice pardoned by a South Korean president. Other top business South Korean leaders have avoided conviction, negotiated light sentences or been allowed to run their corporate empires from prison.South Korea\u2019s government is now run by a president, Moon Jae-in, and a political party that have criticized the excesses of the country\u2019s biggest companies. That has many in South Korea predicting that Mr. Lee, if his conviction is upheld, will serve out his prison term.But to many South Koreans, Samsung and its many corporate offshoots symbolize the country\u2019s rise from war and poverty to become one of the original Asian economic success stories. Should Samsung stumble while Mr. Lee is in prison, public pressure could mount to free him.\u201cSamsung is the No. 1 brand of Korea, one we\u2019re proud of,\u201d said Cho Wung-ki, a 78-year-old retired businessman, whose son works at a Samsung company that provides engineering services, runs resorts and owns a fashion line.\u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe putting Lee Jae-yong in jail actually helps the country at all.\u201dSamsung is among a group of family-run companies called chaebol, \u201crich clan\u201d in Korean. The 10 largest chaebols generate revenue accounting for over 80 percent of South Korea\u2019s gross domestic product. They are among the companies that South Korea\u2019s pre-democratic military rulers partnered with to build a global exporting powerhouse after the Korean War \u2014 a partnership that South Korean school textbooks credit with helping the country\u2019s rise.\u201cIt\u2019s high time to think hard about whether the chaebol system is the right one for Korea,\u201d said Yoo-Kyung Park, director at APG Asset Management, the investment manager of the Dutch pension fund that holds stakes in Samsung companies. She added, \u201cIn the 21st century, you can\u2019t have one person calling the shots. That is too dangerous.\u201dThe sentence could put greater pressure on front-line Samsung executives like Kwon Oh-hyun, head of the company\u2019s huge and profitable semiconductor business. Samsung portrays Mr. Lee, the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics and its acting leader since his father slipped into a coma three years ago, as the company\u2019s strategic visionary, though experts say the businesses are generally run by technocrats.But even behind bars, Mr. Lee could still hold effective control over the Samsung empire. Other South Korean companies have been run by powerful family members behind bars, and Mr. Lee will most likely have significant access to top Samsung executives while in prison.\u201dIf they need to pursue M.&A.s and make crucial investments, they will do it,\u201d said Lee Seung-woo, a senior analyst at Eugene Investment & Securities in Seoul, referring to mergers and acquisitions. \u201cThey would have a road map and fundamentally the course wouldn\u2019t be altered.\u201dPart of that power comes from the sheer breadth of the Samsung business. Beyond its famous smartphone and television brands, it makes heavy equipment like cargo ships and even manages some of the country\u2019s most respected hospitals. Samsung sponsors some of South Korea\u2019s highest-achieving athletes, and many children of the elite seek employment there.Samsung was also among the first major businesses to offer name-brand apartments. Samsung built scores of apartment complexes around the country under brand names that included Raemian, which means \u201cmay the future be beautiful and comfortable.\u201d The complexes, which became popular in a country where American-style single-family houses are unusual, offered a brand and reputation that suggested a strong resale value. They also symbolized aspirational wealth, as portrayed in a 2007 commercial in which a boy who lives in a Raemian complex wins over a classmate through its well-appointed playground.\u201cI\u2019ve had good experiences with Samsung products and customer service,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is no relation to the Samsung-controlling family.That combination of business success and familial power-hoarding complicates Mr. Lee\u2019s fate. In some ways, his sentence reflects frustration from South Koreans outraged that his father, Lee Kun-hee, twice avoided prison despite his convictions.At the same time, the Lee family rivets attention in ways that would be unusual for business figures in other countries. When the younger Mr. Lee appeared at a parliamentary hearing on the bribery scandal last year, the lip balm he sporadically used on camera was among the top-searched items on Naver, the country\u2019s most popular search engine.Kim On-soo, 30-year-old administrative staff member of a university in the South Korean city of Daejeon, said he had been taught from an early age that the more South Korean companies exported, the better it was for the country. Samsung, with its world-famous Galaxy brand of smartphones, represented an example of that success.\u201cUntil the Galaxy was released, my American friends thought Samsung was Japanese,\u201d he said.Mr. Kim said the bribery trial had soured his view of Samsung, though he would still buy the brand.\u201cI sometimes wonder if we\u2019ve all been brainwashed,\u201d he said.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China and India Agree to Ease Tensions in Border Dispute", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 India and China agreed on Monday to back away from their confrontation over a tiny slice of territory high in the Himalayas, easing tensions between the world\u2019s two most populous countries.Both sides agreed to give some ground in order to end the standoff. In a short statement, the Indian government said it had reached an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with Beijing and had agreed to an \u201cexpeditious disengagement\u201d along the border, pulling back troops who had been sent to the disputed area to block the Chinese from building a new road.China seemed willing to compromise as well, still claiming the disputed territory, but making no mention in its statements on Monday that it was continuing to build the contentious road.Minutes after the announcement, Indian stocks rallied and many in India claimed victory. \u201cThe Himalayan ice has melted,\u201d one Indian newspaper wrote. An Indian TV station issued a breaking news bulletin that said: \u201cDiplomatic win over China.\u201dBut some analysts said that India realized, after initially talking tough and sending the troops into the area, that it was overmatched, economically and militarily.\u201cWhat we are seeing is face-saving,\u201d said C. Raja Mohan, the director of Carnegie India, a branch of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the agreement on Monday, though it vowed to continue to patrol the disputed area. The state-controlled news media portrayed the agreement as a victory for China and a sign that the nation was acting as a \u201cresponsible big country\u201d in handling global affairs.Clearly, analysts said, China had its own sound reasons to end the dispute. \u201cIt would be a strategic disaster for China to make a mortal enemy out of India,\u201d said Daniel C. Lynch, a professor of Asian and international studies at the City University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe last thing an aging, economically less vibrant China needs is to fall into a generations-long cold war with India.\u201dWhile the agreement does not amount to a permanent solution, the two sides appeared to have found a way to avoid a serious confrontation. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, suggested that China might even reduce troop levels in the area, which number in the hundreds.\u201cGiven that the situation has changed, the Chinese will make necessary adjustments and deployments in line with current conditions,\u201d Ms. Hua said at a daily news briefing in Beijing. While vowing that China would \u201cprotect territorial sovereignty,\u201d she added that \u201cthe Chinese government values the development of good-neighbor relations with India.\u201dIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is scheduled to visit China next week for an international conference, which may have placed pressure on Chinese and Indian officials to find a solution before he arrived.Still, some experts warned that relief could be temporary. \u201cAnother standoff is completely possible,\u201d said Zhang Li, an expert on India at Sichuan University in southwest China. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be overly optimistic.\u201dThe disputed territory, 34 square miles of an area called the Doklam Plateau, is not claimed by India. It lies on the border of Bhutan and China, but India sees it as a buffer zone that is close to other disputed areas with China and not too far from the strategically vital strip of land known as the chicken neck.The narrow passage connects the bulk of India to its northeastern states, and India is always vigilant about any military activity in the vicinity.Tensions erupted in June when India sent troops to halt a plan by China to extend an unpaved road on the Doklam Plateau, where China, India and the kingdom of Bhutan meet. India maintained that it was acting on behalf of Bhutan, a close ally.Chinese officials were furious and demanded that India pull back. The standoff seemed to grow more tense by the day. Videos emerged of soldiers throwing rocks and bumping torsos.Chinese news outlets produced anti-India propaganda with racist themes.

{"Headline": "Derek Jeter\u2019s Group Is Said to Have Deal to Buy Marlins", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe owner of the Miami Marlins has agreed to sell the team for $1.17 billion to an ownership group led by the venture capitalist Bruce Sherman, with the former Yankees star Derek Jeter serving as a partner and the head of baseball operations.The sale, first reported by The Miami Herald, was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the deal who requested anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly about it.The Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria engaged in an unusually lengthy and public bidding process before settling on Sherman and Jeter. Jeter would achieve a longstanding goal of owning a team \u2014 at least part of one, in this case.Until recently, Jeter had insisted on being the leading bidder despite not having the largest amount of money invested, the source said. But Jeter assented to Sherman\u2019s being the so-called control person, allowing the deal to move forward.Jeter is expected to control the player-development side of the organization. He becomes one of the few former players to own a professional sports team after retirement. Michael Jordan, who owns the N.B.A.\u2019s Charlotte Hornets, is also a part of the ownership group.Major League Baseball owners will meet next week in Chicago but are not expected to vote on the agreement because they will not have had enough time to evaluate it. Their next opportunity to vote on it will be in October.But since then, Jeter and Bush had a falling out, leading Bush to join Romney\u2019s group. Jorge Mas, a Miami businessman and a leader of the movement against the Castro regime in Cuba, also entered the bidding, complicating baseball\u2019s efforts to get the team sold.It appears that the rival bidders were unsuccessful against the lure of Sherman\u2019s money and Jeter\u2019s prestige.Sherman, 69, co-founded the asset management firm Private Capital Management, based in Naples, Fla., in 1986. He retired in 2009, after Private Capital lost large sums from its bets on newspaper stocks and in Bear Stearns\u2019s collapse.Loria, 76, has owned the Marlins since 2002. He had previously owned the Montreal Expos, but in a complicated and controversial move, he sold the team to the 29 other M.L.B. owners and bought the Marlins for $158.5 million from John Henry. Henry then bought the Boston Red Sox.The Marlins won the World Series in Loria\u2019s second year of ownership but have not returned to the playoffs since. The team consistently ranks near the bottom of the league in both payroll and attendance.But the team is still an attractive target, because of the growing value of teams across professional sports and because it moved into a new stadium in 2012, financed primarily by Miami-Dade County and the city of Miami.Ken Belson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Would It Take for Trump to Get His Corporate Tax Wish?", "Date": "2017-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFor President Trump, 15 is the magic number.That\u2019s the percentage at which he wants to cap the corporate tax rate, a steep cut from the current top rate of 35 percent and much lower than the ordinary income rates paid by many partnerships and small-business entities.There\u2019s no doubt that a cut to 15 percent would be big, bold and historic. It might even be the biggest cut ever in corporate tax rates, to use another superlative Mr. Trump is fond of invoking.It might do wonders for economic growth, level the competitive playing field, and encourage United States corporations to keep their headquarters in this country and invest trillions in cash currently stashed in offshore accounts.A 15 percent rate would take the United States from having the highest corporate tax rate among industrialized nations to having one of the lowest. Britain is moving to 17 percent, Canada\u2019s federal rate has already gotten to 15 percent, and Ireland\u2019s is at 12.5 percent.After last week\u2019s collapse of health care legislation, many believe Republicans can\u2019t afford to fail again, especially on what is widely considered their signature issue: taxes. As Scott A. Hodge, president of the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told me this week: \u201cIf the Republicans fail with tax reform, it would be truly catastrophic. It\u2019s really all or nothing at this point.\u201dThere\u2019s only one major stumbling block to a 15 percent rate, and the conventional wisdom is that it\u2019s an intractable one: how to pay for it.According to estimates by the Tax Foundation, a cut in the corporate rate to 15 percent would add $2.2 trillion to the deficit over 10 years on a \u201cstatic\u201d basis, which assumes no additional economic growth. After factoring in growth and higher resulting tax receipts, known as \u201cdynamic\u201d scoring, the deficit would grow by $1 trillion, according to the foundation.And if rates also go to 15 percent for pass-through entities \u2014 businesses that pay taxes at individual rates, like limited-liability corporations and partnerships \u2014 that adds another $1.5 trillion on a static basis, and $1.3 trillion on a dynamic basis, the foundation estimates. (A cut in pass-through rates has much less impact under dynamic scoring, because individuals and small businesses spend far less on capital projects and thus do less to stimulate the economy.)Paying for corporate tax cuts of that magnitude \u201cis a tremendous challenge if you don\u2019t want to blow a hole in the deficit,\u201d Mr. Hodge said. \u201cAnyone writing tax legislation will find that the options are very limited.\u201dHow big is the challenge? In their tax blueprint, House Republicans could only get the corporate rate to 20 percent. The 2014 proposal from Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who was then the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, struggled to reach 25 percent. And when President Barack Obama nearly reached a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on tax reform with Republicans in 2013, he could only get to 28 percent, with 25 percent for some manufacturers.\u201cThe math is really hard,\u201d said Ray Beeman, a tax expert at Ernst & Young and a former adviser to Mr. Camp. \u201cThere\u2019s really no big source of revenue that won\u2019t rile people up.\u201dAnd yet 15 percent just might be possible.For starters, eliminating the deductions and loopholes in the corporate tax code would go a long way toward paying for a significant corporate rate cut. There are so many of these that few companies actually pay the 35 percent statutory rate.\u201cCorporations benefit from all kinds of loopholes, especially the one allowing earnings to accumulate offshore without being taxed,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that in 2016 the corporate income tax raised $300 billion in revenue, while what it called \u201ctargeted subsidies\u201d cost about $270 billion. In other words, Congress could eliminate the subsidies and cut the corporate rate nearly in half without any significant loss in revenue.Another possibility would be to shift at least some of the tax burden from corporations to shareholders, by raising tax rates on capital gains and dividend income. Many economists favor that approach, because it reduces the double-taxation problem embedded in the current system. (Corporations pay taxes on profits, and then, when these are distributed, shareholders pay.) The added tax burden would fall primarily on affluent taxpayers since they tend to own stocks, helping to rebut the argument that slashing the corporate rate would be a tax cut for the wealthy.While it\u2019s difficult to estimate how much additional tax revenue would be generated if dividends and capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, it would surely be substantial, another big step toward a 15 percent corporate rate.Taxing ordinary income, capital gains and dividends at the same rate would also greatly simplify the tax code. The notion does, however, run up against Republican orthodoxy that low capital-gains rates stimulate growth.There are many other ways to raise revenue, of course. House Republicans proposed a border adjustment tax, popular with many pro-growth economists, which powerful retail interests shot down. Most European countries fund their low corporate taxes with some form of a value-added tax, on consumption rather than income. House Republicans have nodded in that direction, but a value-added tax runs afoul of many of the same interests that opposed the border tax, and has never been popular in the consumption-friendly United States.Environmentalists and many economists would love to see a carbon tax, which would presumably be repellent to an administration that is skeptical of climate change and wants to promote the coal industry.The point, however, is that if Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress are serious about a 15 percent rate without vastly increasing the deficit, there are many ways to get there.Then there\u2019s the 15 percent pass-through rate. While taxing small businesses and partnerships at the same rate as corporations has a superficial appeal, there\u2019s nothing that says they have to be the same. As the Tax Foundation maintains, cutting rates on these businesses has relatively little impact on growth. The House Republican blueprint was comfortable with a rate of 25 percent for small businesses and pass-through taxpayers, still a significant reduction from current ordinary income rates. And the 1986 reform act didn\u2019t require that pass-through entities pay the same rate as corporations.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about 15 percent,\u201d Mr. Rosenthal said.The closer the pass-through rate is to ordinary income rates, the lower the incentive for lawyers, accountants, doctors and other service professionals to reorganize themselves into pass-through entities to avoid paying the higher rates. How to distinguish individual professionals from actual businesses has long vexed legislators trying to rewrite the tax code. \u201cA big issue has always been, how do you prevent a pass-through owner who is really a wage earner or service provider from escaping the higher ordinary income tax rate?\u201d Mr. Beeman said.Everyone I spoke to mentioned that lowering corporate tax rates to anything close to 15 percent requires political courage and leadership to overcome the powerful special interests that benefit from existing loopholes \u2014 starting with real estate. Whether Mr. Trump can set aside personal interests and rise to the challenge remains to be seen.Many tax experts hope he will.\u201cWhat\u2019s important is not just getting a home run under his belt,\u201d Mr. Hodge said. \u201cThe Republicans have to get tax reform right. They have to make sure it delivers the kind of growth that boosts productivity and real wages and living standards. If they do get it right, it can dramatically improve the lives of the people who feel most aggrieved about globalization and the state of the economy \u2014 the same people who voted for Trump.\u201dThe Common Sense column on Friday, about hurdles that President Trump faces in reducing corporate tax rates, misstated an estimate by the Tax Policy Center for the 10-year federal revenue increase from eliminating the interest deduction. The projection is $700 billion, not $700 million.Second in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might take.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a sociology term derived from \u201cprecarious\u201d that describes the growing class of people \u2014 \u201cthe 99 percent\u201d invoked by the Occupy movement \u2014 left behind by the rise of global capitalism. \u201cPrecariat\u201d would certainly apply to two of Cohen\u2019s main characters, Yoav Matzav and Uri Dugri, Israeli Defense Forces veterans who have immigrated to New York City, where they\u2019ve taken off-the-books jobs at King\u2019s Moving, a company that enlists them in evicting delinquent tenants and homeowners who\u2019ve defaulted on their mortgages. The term would also apply to Imamu Nabi, born Avery Luter, a Vietnam veteran and drug addict who is one of those in default.Israeli veterans, an African-American veteran who has (at least in name) converted to Islam: As a premise for a novel, this conflict between evictors and evicted seems built for thematic complexity, as it brings to mind gentrification, the Israeli occupation of Palestine and much more. Indeed, the suspense in \u201cMoving Kings\u201d derives not from traditional narrative momentum but from our wondering how Cohen is going to take these dangerous ingredients and make meaning out of them. What is he going to say about Jews evicting blacks, for example, or, to drill down further, about Israeli Jews evicting African-American Muslims, or veterans evicting veterans? What will come out of the vexed dynamic between Yoav, Uri and Imamu? Something to do with the word \u201cprecariat,\u201d I thought, when I came across that striking word 170 pages in.I was grasping, in other words. In its initial long section, the novel slogs through the story of Yoav\u2019s middle-aged cousin, David King, the \u201cMoving King,\u201d an American Jew and Republican Party donor whose economic status is the opposite of precarious. We first encounter David at a Fourth of July fund-raiser in the Hamptons, \u201cwhich had required attendees to donate upwards of $4K for the privilege of drinking diluted booze and eating oversauced BBQ.\u201d (Here, in a sign of things to come, both \u201cdiluted\u201d and \u201coversauced\u201d seem more close-to-hand than precise.) Unsurprisingly, David turns out to be impotent and in poor shape: \u201cThe booze and red meat and dairy. The pills ostensibly for bloodpressure and the pills ostensibly for cholesterol and the pills he wasn\u2019t sure what they did: for anxiety.\u201d This broad smirking at a milieu that\u2019s made for easy mockery also includes \u201cskinny flagpole women flying dresses in red, white and blue,\u201d conversations about \u201cstocks, about realestate \u2026 about renovations and how draining it was to open a house for the season,\u201d and an aside about \u201cjazz that turned the whole world into an elevator.\u201d \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d could muster a more astute caricature of the Fox News crowd than this.David Foster Wallace, one of Cohen\u2019s conspicuous influences, lived and wrote in terror of solipsism, though no matter how hard he strove to imagine characters unlike himself (and he had huge range), you always saw Wallace, almost his actual face, through the unmistakable style. This struggle gave him pathos. By contrast, Cohen\u2019s stance seems to be deliberately against any idea of \u201clikability.\u201d Almost everyone in his book is loathsome, though in a facile way that says as much about the portrayer as the portrayed. David\u2019s daughter, Tammy, because she goes to N.Y.U., naturally toys with heroin and also \u201cdabbled in anorexia and bulimia, her head like a brunette plunger in the toilet.\u201d Uri\u2019s girlfriend, with whom he remains obsessed throughout the novel, nevertheless is described in their single love scene as having \u201ctiny hairs on her ass like browned grass\u201d and \u201cgangling nipples like carob pods.\u201d Imamu, before becoming a drug addict, frequents a bodega where he buys \u201chis minty Cope dips and all the three ingredients of Robitussin Wine, the third ingredient being the pineapple Jolly Ranchers.\u201d Perhaps this is funny to the kind of person who thinks it\u2019s funny to make sexually or racially disparaging jokes when you\u2019re aware that it\u2019s in bad taste. Or perhaps the message here is that these characters and whatever they represent don\u2019t even deserve the attentiveness of actual satire.After the David section, in a kind of nadir, we get the strange interpolation of a letter from a handicapped widow on Staten Island who has lost her son and home, either so that Cohen can make fun of her broken English, or present her as some kind of holy fool, or imply that she\u2019s lying \u2014 it\u2019s unclear. And so it\u2019s a relief when we finally get to the story of the Israelis, Yoav and Uri, wherein the novel leaves off with its reflexive contempt and shows an almost human heart. Cohen does an able job of evoking the torpor and drift of the squadmates\u2019 lives after combat. \u201cHe\u2019d miscalculated, apparently,\u201d Yoav broods, \u201cby thinking that to leave Israel he could avoid Israel, could evade the Jews, the news \u2014 by thinking, like nearly all the customers he\u2019d moved, that just by changing the walls around him he\u2019d be changed within, as if all that junk that\u2019d been pumped into his head would come tumbling out in the transit.\u201d The squalid poetry of convenience stores is one of Cohen\u2019s fortes, and among the many memorable descriptions of them, one of particular note is of Yoav becoming attuned to \u201cthoughts or intimations or taints of impatience that might come from being stuck in line behind a grubby slow salaaming human of another race who kept changing his mind about his Powerball digits at the deli \u2014 he\u2019d have to break with those thoughts. He couldn\u2019t stay in America without breaking those thoughts and dealing with the guilt.\u201dThis sense of displacement and the wish to begin a new, better life chimes in a moving way with our recollection of David King\u2019s shallow, dubious fealty to Israel. In the first section, King has a heart attack, which causes in him the surge of Zionism that leads to his reconnecting with his distant cousin Yoav and bringing him to the United States to work (eventually with Uri) for King\u2019s Moving. \u201cWhile being treated, he\u2019d been infected with sentiment, nostalgia, a nasty nosocomial case. Out of nowhere, David had found himself yearning, but not for the immediate, for the far. Distance gave a grandeur to the emotions, expanded the dwindling self, expanded its purchase, by imbuing each desire with an ancestry, a mystery, a primitive significance.\u201dSeen through this passage, the book\u2019s thematic logic is that spoiled losers like David King finance devastation in distant places \u2014 the Palestinian Territories, the outer boroughs \u2014 carried out by members of the precariat like Yoav and Uri against other members of it like Imamu. Jews evicting blacks, Israeli Jews evicting African-American Muslims, veterans evicting veterans: I see this schematic, but Cohen\u2019s book has no capacity for real outrage, sorrow or grief. In this way, like its antihero David, it\u2019s a victim of its own safe distance.Zachary Lazar\u2019s most recent novel is \u201cI Pity the Poor Immigrant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Threats on Health Law Hide an Upside: Gains Made by Some Insurers", "Date": "2017-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has not been a market for the faint of heart.Supporters of the Affordable Care Act achieved a major victory this past week when, thanks to cajoling and arm-twisting by state regulators, the last \u201cbare\u201d county in America \u2014 in rural Ohio \u2014 found an insurer willing to sell health coverage through the law\u2019s marketplace there. So despite earlier indications that insurance companies would stop offering coverage under the law in large parts of the country, insurers have now agreed to sell policies everywhere.But a moment of truth still looms for the industry in the coming weeks under the law known as Obamacare. Companies must set their final plans and premiums by late September, even as the Trump administration continues to threaten to cut off billions of dollars in government subsidies promised by the legislation. Insurers are also awaiting Senate hearings set to start on Sept. 6 for a hint of what steps, if any, lawmakers may take to stabilize the market.With congressional Republicans\u2019 yearslong quest to dismantle the Affordable Care Act dead for now, the fate of the landmark law depends in large part on the health of the insurance marketplaces and the ability of insurers to make a viable business out of selling coverage to individuals. When the law passed seven years ago, insurers saw a potential bonanza: tens of millions of brand-new paying customers, many backed by generous government subsidies and required by the new law to have health coverage. Now, about four years after the law\u2019s marketplaces opened for business, most of the industry\u2019s biggest players have pulled out.\u201cOutside of the noise,\u201d the surviving companies \u201care seeing a path forward in this marketplace,\u201d said Deep Banerjee, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s who has examined the financial results of more than two dozen Blue Cross insurers.\u201cIt is still a new market,\u201d he added, \u201cand everyone is adjusting to it.\u201dThe healthier business outlook has been achieved at a big cost to consumers. To stanch their losses, many companies raised their prices substantially for this year while narrowing their networks of providers to hold down costs. In Phoenix, for example, a typical plan\u2019s monthly premiums more than doubled. Although people with incomes low enough to qualify for federal subsidies were shielded from the brunt of the steep increases, the higher prices prompted Republicans to blame the law for plans that were out of many people\u2019s reach.In some cases, companies will seek even higher rates for 2018; the lone insurer left in Iowa is asking for a nearly 60 percent increase, on average.A New York Times analysis of insurance market data.Under the health law, in exchange for the wellspring of new customers, insurers agreed to operate using a fundamentally different business model. As the law required, they offered coverage to everyone, including people with existing medical conditions, and no longer charged people in poor health sharply higher prices.But the industry\u2019s enthusiasm gave way to misgivings as insurers lost billions of dollars in the law\u2019s first years. Eager to enroll as many people as possible, many companies set prices too low because they had no experience covering these new customers. Some people, especially if they were young and healthy, complained about higher premiums, even though the prices were often below the actual cost of providing medical care. Insurers had a hard time managing people with the biggest medical expenses, and fewer healthier people than expected signed up.Some of the nation\u2019s largest and best-known companies, including Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group, lost tens, even hundreds, of millions of dollars each. Aetna said it has lost roughly $900 million since 2014.\u201cThis market proved to be quite cutthroat,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cSome of the big, old-time, insurers couldn\u2019t compete on cost.\u201d The companies modeled their plans on those they offered in the employer market, where there were broad, and expensive, networks of hospitals and doctors.Most of the insurance start-ups inspired by the Affordable Care Act, including Northwell\u2019s CareConnect and the so-called co-ops created under the law, could not survive.Pointing to what he described as the failures of the federal government and Congress, Michael J. Dowling, Northwell\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that it had become \u201cincreasingly clear that continuing the CareConnect health plan is financially unsustainable.\u201dThe individual market is estimated to encompass around 20 million people, including those who buy coverage directly from a broker or insurance company and do not qualify for a subsidy. In contrast, about 155 million Americans get coverage through their jobs. The large insurers abandoned the individual market under the health law because it was not worth the energy required to make it work, said Ana Gupte, an analyst with Leerink Partners. \u201cThey were losing money, and they have other businesses that are very profitable.\u201d Those businesses have helped push many insurers\u2019 stocks to record highs.But among the insurers that are still in the game, Centene, a for-profit company, is now making money in the individual market and expanding. Some of the Blue Cross insurers, including Health Care Service Corp., which operates plans in multiple states, including Texas and Illinois, and Independence Blue Cross, which has 300,000 customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, began to turn a profit in the market this year.\u201cIt does take a couple of years, and our membership has climbed steadily,\u201d said Daniel J. Hilferty, the chief executive of Independence Blue Cross. The company is currently seeking to raise rates around 8.5 percent next year but the increases could be sharply higher, especially if the administration decides to effectively end the penalty people face for not enrolling, Mr. Hilferty said. He worries about what could happen next in Washington.The company is \u201cmoving in the right direction,\u201d said Joel Klein, a senior executive with Oscar, one of whose founders is Joshua Kushner, the brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.The health law has also provided insurers, including major players, with another opportunity to make money: the expansion of Medicaid, the state-federal government program for low-income people that now covers nearly 75 million people, according to the Kaiser foundation. About 14 million people enrolled in the program in states that accepted federal funding.The insurers that stayed in the individual market have come to realize that the individual market was more like Medicaid than the employer business. Some customers have chronic conditions that have been poorly treated in the past, and insurers need to manage their care more closely. People shopping for a plan are very concerned about price, making it essential for insurers to find hospitals and doctors that provide care at the lowest cost.Companies in a position to offer low-cost plans have thrived. Centene made use of its experience, including setting up networks of hospitals and doctors that care for Medicaid patients, to sell coverage. The company now insures about 1.1 million people in the individual market, and almost half of the counties left bare by its competitors. \u201cFor 2018, we intend to grow this profitable segment of our business,\u201d Michael Neidorff, the company\u2019s chief executive, told investors last month.The lack of clarity over both the market\u2019s future and the efforts to stabilize it could also lead to much higher prices next year. Some insurers are requesting rate increases of 20 to 30 percent or more. \u201cJust as they\u2019re getting their footing, they have the worst thing that can happen to an insurance company: uncertainty about the business model,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Ondra, a former insurance executive who worked in the Obama administration.Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to stop reimbursing insurers for plans that waive deductibles and co-payments for low-income people are particularly worrisome. Under the law, insurers must offer these more generous plans, and they priced their policies assuming they would receive about $7 billion from the government this year to cover the costs. The companies are paid monthly, and Congress has not appropriated the money. Mr. Trump could stop the checks.Insurers can still choose to leave in the coming weeks if they decide there is too much confusion about what will happen next year, especially if they are asked to lock in prices that assume government funding without a guarantee, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThere are so many unknowns,\u201d she said.Follow Reed Abelson on TwitterAdvertisement"}

We should all have such nice things, and we may yet someday. But meanwhile, sit back and take in the details, as they hold lessons for all of us.Given how good those federal employees have it, how do you get the older ones who are eligible to move their money out of the plan to do so? According to the S.E.C., you pretend that you\u2019re affiliated with the plan and the government.Look further on the firm\u2019s website and you\u2019ll find the following testimonial from someone named Judy, who said, \u201cThis service is the best-kept secret in the government\u201d \u2014 which certainly implies a connection. Call its phone number even now, and you can press 3 for \u201cThrift Savings Plan review\u201d information.About those investments. According to the S.E.C., about 200 people ended up with roughly 200 variable annuities with a face value of over $40 million. For their efforts, the four individuals that it named in the complaint \u2014 Christopher S. Laws, Jonathan Dax Cooke, Danny S. Hood and Brandon P. Long \u2014 shared about $1.7 million in commissions. Some of their client reports, according to the complaint, never even mentioned that they were putting people in variable annuities, which are complex insurance products.After the S.E.C. action, Mr. Laws sent me a news release that accused the agency of defamation and bullying. It said that the agency should have disclosed that he and Mr. Cooke did not know that their colleagues were involved in the alleged misdeeds. The release also noted that there were hundreds of other customers whom the firm told to stay in the T.S.P. or roll their money over into an individual retirement account, and it accused the S.E.C. of using this case as a way of discouraging others from transferring money away from the T.S.P.The S.E.C. declined to comment on this, too. When I called Mr. Laws to ask him whether a fiduciary rule might have prevented his firm from getting in this much hot water, he referred me to the news release (which does not utter the words \u201cfiduciary rule\u201d) and then hung up on me.Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said that the move to expensive annuities would have violated a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard. She also noted that rules affect the norms of behavior, which means that the brokers might not have even bothered trying to approach the Thrift Savings Plan participants with such offerings if a fiduciary rule standard had been in effect.Jack Dolan, on the other hand, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurers, didn\u2019t want to opine on the case specifically, but said that a fiduciary rule did not necessarily deter bad actors from committing outright fraud.These tactics won\u2019t inoculate you from every professional bearing bad advice. But they are likely to scare people who wish to do you harm just enough that they will move on to some other mark, at least until decent investment plans are standard for everyone and federal rules are strict enough to drive all the shady characters out of business completely.Twitter: @ronlieberAdvertisement"}

Officials are pursuing banks and corporations for violating foreign exchange regulations, and investigations are reportedly underway into big offshore investments by private companies. There are signs that capital is still sneaking out of China through disguised channels like tourism spending. Thus the only currency liberalization under consideration is a widening of the yuan\u2019s trading band, a move that would make no practical difference.But conservatism is not costless. China wants more overseas money in the debt markets, to lift the pressure on domestic banks, introduce more market discipline and push the internationalization of its currency. Capital controls deter otherwise enthusiastic foreign institutions from investing. Lifting them would help convince skeptics that Beijing is ready to resume reform. It would also serve as a sign of confidence that might dissuade Chinese onlookers from rushing for the exits before they close even tighter.To be sure, some caution is warranted. If the United States economy keeps heating up, the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates aggressively, and the dollar could rise again. Alternatively, a disaster \u2014 like a war with North Korea \u2014 could set off a flight to dollar safety.But even if the dollar were to strengthen again, that would not necessarily result in another round of panicked outflows. Many of the worries that aggravated capital flight in 2016 have since eased.

{"Headline": "Why the Dow Isn\u2019t Really the Stock Market", "Date": "2017-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesDespite a few rocky days recently, the stock market is having a great year. But exactly how great depends on what you mean by \u201cthe stock market.\u201dAre you talking about the Dow Jones industrial average, the oldest and best-known measuring stick for the American stock market? If so, that one has risen more than 18 percent over the last 12 months, a spectacular return.Or are you referring to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the benchmark for large companies used by many stock professionals? If so, that market has been far less impressive, with a gain in the last 12 months of a little over 12 percent.Or do you mean something else entirely?The divergence between the two big indexes began in November, when the Dow started to surge ahead of the S.&P. 500. Though the shift in the indexes was little noticed at the time, the Dow has gained more than 20 percent since then, while the S.&P. is up about 15 percent. A gap of this magnitude is unusual: The two indexes usually move within a percentage point or two of one another. Why has this happened? To a surprising extent, the divergence depends on just two stocks, Apple and Boeing, and on the ways in which the two indexes are constructed.Both companies have had outstanding performances recently. Boeing stock, which trades at about $235, is up roughly 50 percent for the calendar year. Apple, which trades at roughly $157, has risen about 36 percent. But what may appear puzzling is that while Boeing has had a barely noticeable impact on the S.&P. 500, it has provided a gigantic lift to the Dow.According to data supplied by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, Boeing accounts for one quarter of the Dow\u2019s entire increase for 2017. That\u2019s almost double Apple\u2019s contribution.Yet Apple is the most valuable company in the entire stock market; its market capitalization is more than $800 billion. Boeing, while hardly small, has a market capitalization of only about $135 billion. Such considerations are critical in the S.&P. 500. Stocks with a bigger market cap have a proportionately bigger impact on the index. That\u2019s why it is known as a \u201cmarket-weighted index,\u201d and why professionals use it much more widely than the Dow.\u201cThe S.&P. tells you much more about how the market is really doing,\u201d said Jeremy J. Siegel, a finance professor and market historian at the Wharton School. \u201cModern indexes that track stock markets are generally market weighted.\u201dThe Dow is not a modern index. It is old and simple, created more than a century ago by Charles Dow, who was the co-founder of Dow Jones and the first editor of The Wall Street Journal. For many , the Dow is synonymous with the American stock market. \u201cIf you say, how many points did the market move today, you\u2019re talking about the Dow,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a crazy way to measure the market.\u201dOnly 30 stocks are included in the index, which uses a measuring system so simple that it seems arbitrary: Stocks are weighted by price. That means that the highest-priced share of a stock \u2014 which happens to be Boeing at the moment \u2014 has the greatest sway in the index.Consider the implications of using that kind of index. Imagine that you are creating a food index based on all of the items you have bought in the last year.You purchased one jar of caviar and 1,000 cans of tuna fish. In a price-weighted index, caviar will have the biggest overall impact because it\u2019s the most expensive item you\u2019ve bought, even though you spent far more money on tuna. The rise and fall of caviar is the powerhouse that controls your price-weighted food index, even if you never buy caviar again in your life.\u201cNo one would build a stock market index that way today,\u201d Professor Siegel said. \u201cBut remember, Charles Dow did it without computers, and it basically works. It tells you how the market performed and it requires relatively little calculation.\u201d It has some idiosyncrasies, though. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a $1,000 stock in it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a stock like Amazon in it without all kinds of adjustments because its price is too high and it will change the index too much.\u201dConsider what the Dow looks like now. Through Thursday, Boeing\u2019s weighting in the index \u2014 based entirely on the price of a single share of Boeing stock \u2014 was 7.3 percent, Mr. Silverblatt said. Close behind were Goldman Sachs at a 7.07 percent weighting; 3M, with a 6.47 percent weighting; United Health, at 6.04 percent; and McDonald\u2019s, at 4.91 percent. Apple was only in sixth place in the Dow, with a weighting of 4.85 percent.Because of this price-weighting system, Boeing has more than nine times the stature in the Dow as General Electric. Yet G.E.\u2019s total value \u2014 its market capitalization \u2014 is much greater than Boeing\u2019s. No matter. Boeing has a far bigger impact on the Dow, and on \u201cthe market,\u201d if we are using the Dow as a shorthand way of talking about all stocks, than G.E. does.Is there a better way of defining the stock market? Absolutely. There are many other indexes. The S.&P. 500 does a good job of measuring large-capitalization stocks but it misses thousands of smaller ones.By that broader and no less precise definition, the market is not doing quite as well as either the Dow or the S.&P. would have you believe. The CRSP index is trailing the Dow by more than 2 percentage points this year, and is behind the S.&P. by more than three quarters of a percentage point. That may be why your stock portfolio, if it is diversified enough to capture the entire market, isn\u2019t turning in a performance as spectacular as the daily news reports may suggest.The problem may just be that everybody is talking about the Dow. They are not really talking about the stock market.Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Online Giants Back $12 Billion Deal to Shake Up State Firm", "Date": "2017-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Some of China\u2019s biggest technology players are backing a plan to invest nearly $12 billion in one of the country\u2019s telecommunications giants, the latest move in a broader government push to shake up the country\u2019s bloated state-run companies.But it is an effort that, so far, has left experts unimpressed.Chinese leaders hope more private investors will push the leaders of state-run companies to pare down wasteful businesses and shift to more productive ways to make money. It would also put experienced managers in boardrooms and spur more professional practices.Since the plan was announced, under the firm guidance of Beijing, some state-run companies have sought out investments from private firms as well as state-run companies from other industries.In the case of China Unicom, the country\u2019s three biggest internet companies are investing: Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant; Tencent Holdings, which runs China\u2019s most popular social-messaging service; and Baidu, the online search company that is sometimes called the Google of China. The biggest new shareholder would be China Life Insurance, a state-run firm, which would have about a 10 percent stake, China Unicom said.\u201cThere is an immediate, serious problem with this initiative in that the best outcome is more competition, not cooperation\u201d between state companies and private firms, said Derek Scissors, a China-focused resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.\u201cIt still could be an improvement over the current situation, if private firms are permitted to genuinely change S.O.E. practices,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. He added, however, \u201cThere\u2019s been no evidence of this yet.\u201d\u201cIt seems for the last two-and-a-half years the tide has been moving toward state capital at the expense of private capital,\u201d said Arthur Kroeber, a partner at Gavekal, a research firm. \u201cThat\u2019s not very encouraging.\u201dStill, China Unicom\u2019s deal has the potential to be different because some successful private companies are involved, Mr. Kroeber said.\u201cThis can be fairly interpreted as a signal that there\u2019s a fairly serious effort to restart this mixed ownership reform in more or less the format that was originally planned,\u201d he said.China\u2019s technology firms have quickly outmaneuvered state-run telecom businesses, with social-messaging apps that replaced text messaging and by building their own e-commerce networks. While state-owned firms have built the highways, private companies have learned how to go the fastest.Martin Lau, president of Tencent, told investors on an earnings call on Wednesday that the deal represents a \u201cmonumental step\u201d in China\u2019s economic overhaul effort, and added that Tencent does not expect the deal to result in more regulatory pressure on the company. An Alibaba spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Other companies involved include JD.com, which like Tencent is an Alibaba rival, suggesting the new shareholders may not always have the same agenda.Under Wednesday\u2019s deal, the company that is China Unicom\u2019s immediate shareholder will sell new and existing shares to the new owners. The largest shareholder of that company will remain China United Network Communications Group, China Unicom\u2019s state-controlled ultimate parent.Paul Mozur contributed reporting in Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Day Trading in Wall Street\u2019s Complex \u2018Fear Gauge\u2019 Proliferates", "Date": "2017-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEach morning, at the market\u2019s open, Seth M. Golden, a former logistics manager at a Target store, fires up the computer in his home office in northern Florida and does what he has done for years: Put on bets that Wall Street\u2019s index of volatility, the VIX, will keep falling.\u201cThere has been a lot of white noise,\u201d said Mr. Golden last Tuesday on a day that the VIX plummeted more than 10 percent, allowing him to lock in profits from short trades. \u201cYou had North Korea, Afghanistan, Trump people resigning. But I was never nervous \u2014 so today I just sat back, ate some popcorn and cashed in my profits.\u201dOn Monday, the index ticked up, after falling 8 percent on Friday, as investors took the view that the Fed would not be raising interest rates soon after a speech by Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.Now, a new generation of day traders, deploying an expanding array of opaque, high-risk, high-return trading vehicles concocted by Wall Street, are pouring into one of the market\u2019s most arcane corners, making bets on whether the VIX \u2014 otherwise known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index \u2014 will rise or fall.Wagering on the fear gauge, a measure of how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead, has traditionally been the province of highly specialized investors with the cash and financial relationships to purchase the derivatives that facilitate these trades.In the years after the financial crisis, however, investment banks like Barclays and Credit Suisse came out with VIX-linked investments that investors could purchase on the stock exchange, just as if they were buying shares of IBM or Microsoft.Called exchange traded notes, they were a racier version of the exchange traded funds, or E.T.F.s, that track every variety of index and investment strategy and now have more than $4 trillion in investor assets.Led by Barclays iPath S&P 500 Short Term Futures ETN (VXX), these investments have attracted over $14 billion in investor flows since 2012, according to FactSet, a data-gathering firm.There are now more than 30 different VIX-themed investment choices (including some that use leverage, amplifying gains and losses) that investors can snap up on a public exchange.Because they are so easy to trade and because the question driving the trade \u2014 Will the markets succumb to fear or won\u2019t they? \u2014 borders on the existential, a new wave of millennial day traders has been at the forefront of this trade.And many are using Stock Twits, the social media investing website embraced by stay-at-home investors, as well as Twitter and Facebook to passionately promote their strategies.But this explosion in interest is prompting concerns that investors may not be truly aware of what they are getting into.In theory, the murky nomenclature of these investments ought to be warning enough for amateur investors to tread with caution. And it is also true that the fund prospectuses warn bluntly that investors can lose large sums of money if they buy and hold these investments.\u201cThese are incredibly complex products when you consider their price dynamics,\u201d Mr. Whaley said. \u201cThe volume in these things is huge, and my concern is that investors don\u2019t understand what they are and how their prices behave.\u201dIndeed, the most popular of the funds, the Barclays iPath fund, known broadly by its ticker symbol VXX, has since its inception averaged a yearly return of negative 58 percent, according to FactSet.While many professionals will purchase these securities to hedge their exposure to the stock market, analysts say that day traders are now using them to gamble on a sharp spike in the VIX.\u201cYou have seen this infusion of millennials coming in and buying VXX and UVXY,\u201d Mr. Moadel said, referring to the main VIX product and its leveraged cousin. \u201cBut most of the time they just get killed.\u201dDoing the killing, so to speak, have been investors like Mr. Golden, who consistently shorts VXX and UVXY whenever they spike upward.His bet is founded on two principles: one being that VXX and UVXY, because they track a basket of VIX futures, not the index itself, will decline in value over time as the contracts expire.He describes it as a heavy anvil weighing down on the value of each security.Mr. Golden also believes that in the decades since the VIX was introduced in 1993, its long-term trend has been to push consistently downward. Yes, there will be spikes as during major cataclysms (9/11, the 2008 financial crisis) and other less tumultuous events (a devaluation in China, a North Korea crisis or even a presidential tweet).But after every spike of fear must follow a longer period of calm, Mr. Golden contends, which, he argues, is a perfect scenario if your bias is to always bet against fear.\u201cThe nature of volatility is that it desensitizes over time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is why the index has been tracking down for so long.\u201dJust as the frenetic buying of tech stocks by day traders in 1999 and 2000 came to be seen as a major factor behind the boom and bust, market experts say that traders like Mr. Golden who persistently short the VIX have distorted the market.\u201cThe VIX spikes have become more extreme \u2014 on the upside and the downside,\u201d said Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist at Deutsche Bank.Mr. Golden, who is 40, lives in a suburb of Ocala, Fla. Since he has been shorting VIX, he says his net worth has gone to $12 million from $500,000 in about five years.But, as with any trader on a roll, he likes to keep score, and he is quick to spar on Twitter with the traders who appear on CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money\u201d program.Now, he is starting a hedge fund dedicated to wagering against the VIX. Investors, he says, have been pounding on his door to get in early, offering him $100 million for starters.That is a lot of money for a onetime Target manager.\u201cYes, it is a crowded trade,\u201d Mr. Golden acknowledged. \u201cBut I don\u2019t worry about crowds \u2014 I just worry what the next existential shock might be.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated where Salil Aggarwal, a derivatives strategist, works.

{"Headline": "The Incredible Shrinking Sears", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "How a financial wizard took over a giant of American retailing, and presided over its epic decline.Supported byImagine a retailer that began by specializing in just one product, then grew into a mammoth that redefined the American shopping experience.Among its innovations: No matter where you lived, it shipped your order directly to you, whether you were looking for cast-iron cookware, a mandolin, the newest technological marvel, or the latest in petticoats.Amazon, right? Actually, it was Sears \u2014 a century ago.The brainchild of a pocket-watch salesman, Sears navigated retailing through the end of the stagecoach era, the rise (and fall) of downtown department stores and the malling of suburban America. Recently it has been battling to stay relevant with the advance of online retailers \u2014 like Amazon.For many, the story of Sears is a reflection of the carnage occurring throughout much of retail right now. In recent days, the stocks of J.C. Penney, Macy\u2019s and Dillard\u2019s all tumbled after they reported another round of quarterly sales declines. Some analysts expect Sears to report a third consecutive double-digit decline in same-store sales in the second quarter.But what may ultimately lead to the collapse of the once-great retailer is a dose of Wall Street financial engineering.Under the direction of the hedge-fund moneyman Edward S. Lampert, Sears has borrowed to the hilt. Many of its most valuable assets have been sold off. Its stores have been starved for cash and attention. An early shift in the organizational structure designed to create competition among store departments \u2014 a strategy used by some hedge funds to allocate company resources \u2014 instead led to infighting.It was all done in search of a profit that, for Mr. Lampert and his investors, has not materialized.\u201cI don\u2019t think it was inevitable that Sears would find itself in the position it is in today,\u201d said Arthur Martinez, who orchestrated a turnaround of Sears as its chief executive in the late 1990s. \u201cThe Sears brand has become largely irrelevant,\u201d he said, \u201cand it breaks my heart to say that.\u201dToday, Sears Holdings, the publicly traded entity that is the result of the 2005 merger of Sears and Kmart, coordinated by Mr. Lampert, is on analysts\u2019 short list of most-likely-to-go-bankrupt retailers.Over the past decade at Sears, more than $26 billion of market value has disappeared. Revenue has been halved, as has its work force, with 175,000 people losing their jobs.This year, Sears has sued two vendors to force them to continue supplying goods even as many others reduce shipments to the retailer, concerned they could wind up empty-handed if Sears files for bankruptcy protection. One suit was settled; the other is in progress.Mr. Lampert declined to be interviewed. Responding to questions through emails, the company said it continued to work on its transformation in a difficult retail environment and that it had no plans to file for bankruptcy.The company also disputed the idea that Mr. Lampert had focused on financial engineering, noting that many retailers rely heavily on integration of financial and operational structures. The company also said Mr. Lampert began responding to the e-commerce shift more than a decade ago, well before many retailers did. Just last month, shortly after announcing additional store closings (so far this year, 155 Sears and Kmarts around the country have been shuttered) Sears announced a deal to sell its Kenmore appliances through Amazon.Mr. Lampert said on the company blog this summer that Sears was continuing a strategic transformation that would return it to profitability. \u201cWhile there is still work to do,\u201d Mr. Lampert wrote, \u201cwe are determined to do what is necessary to remain a competitive retailer in a challenging environment.\u201dAt the turn of the 20th century, as Americans established roots across the nation, they turned to Sears. Through its robust mail-order business \u2014 some catalogs were more than 500 pages \u2014 Sears shipped groceries, rifles, corsets, cream separators, davenports, stoves and entire prefab houses to some of the most remote regions of the country.For decades, as Americans shifted the ways they shopped, Sears deftly evolved. In fact, it was often at the forefront of changing demands as it moved from catalogs featuring pages of saddles and bridles, to showrooms full of glistening home appliances, to auto-repair shops outside the mall.As Americans moved from rural communities to larger cities, many no longer needed to shop by thumbing through the catalog; they preferred to visit dazzling department stores. Sears began opening hundreds of stand-alone retail stores, some with soda fountains, dentist\u2019s offices and pet shops alongside tombstones and farm tractors.The set of \u201cThe Donna Reed Show\u201d in the 1960s featured a Kenmore stove, dishwasher and washer and dryer, all must-have appliances in American homes. And as TV culture grew in the \u201960s, Sears ramped up its advertising campaigns and signed licensing agreements with celebrities like the baseball player Ted Williams, the golfer Arnold Palmer and the model Cheryl Tiegs.In the 1980s, as Americans\u2019 fondness for credit grew, Sears introduced its wildly popular Discover card, which was the first to offer cash rewards to customers based on the volume of their purchases. Within four years, 20 million people had the card. Within a decade, credit operations accounted for a big chunk of Sears\u2019s revenues.When malls became the meeting place of American youth, Sears moved with them. Its stores anchored shopping centers all over the country.By the 1990s, however, Sears\u2019s dominance of the retail landscape had ended. It was surpassed by the discount shopping retailers Walmart and Kmart, the so-called big-box stores. By 2001, Walmart\u2019s revenues were about five times that of Sears.The new players were nimble, able to change inventory and prices quickly. Sears\u2019s overhead costs were higher, and catalog prices were usually set months in advance in order to meet printing and mailing schedules.But big-box stores were only one threat. Online shopping would soon emerge as an even more powerful force, one that Sears, with its hundreds of brick-and-mortar stores needing constant face-lifts and upkeep, was also ill prepared to compete with.That\u2019s when the hedge-fund titan came knocking.In late 2004, newspapers were still running articles about the coming $11 billion takeover of Sears by the discount giant Kmart when Arthur Martinez\u2019s phone rang. Mr. Martinez had been the chief executive and president of Sears in the late 1990s.On the line, he said, was Edward Lampert.A financial wizard who started his career on the vaunted risk arbitrage desk at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Lampert had just arranged the megadeal that created the nation\u2019s third-largest retailer. Among the new members of its board were Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert\u2019s former roommate at Yale and the current Treasury secretary.\u201cHe asked me if he had just done the stupidest thing in the world by buying Sears,\u201d Mr. Martinez recalled.Over a 90-minute meeting in Greenwich, Conn., where they both had offices, Mr. Martinez advised Mr. Lampert to focus on high-value businesses like appliance sales, Sears\u2019s crown jewel. He also noted that Sears was a capital-intensive business, requiring steady investments not only in the stores, but also in training and retaining employees.\u201cHe appears to have roundly ignored everything I told him to do,\u201d Mr. Martinez said.Sears disputed Mr. Martinez\u2019s recollections, saying it was Mr. Martinez who requested the meeting, and denied that Mr. Lampert had made the comment about buying Sears. The company also said Mr. Lampert had not ignored Mr. Martinez\u2019s advice.At Sears, Mr. Lampert typically led from afar. As the largest shareholder through his hedge fund and, since 2013, the company\u2019s chief executive, Mr. Lampert has overseen the company\u2019s operations via videoconference from his home in Miami. He sets foot inside Sears headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., roughly once a year for the annual meeting, according to interviews with several former executives.In the early days of the merger, when times were better, Sears used its cash to buy back shares, a move businesses often use to try to drive share prices higher. From 2005 to 2012, the company spent $6 billion buying back its own shares at prices as high as $174 a share.Today, Sears Holdings stock trades at $9.30 a share, a decline of 95 percent from its highs.Besides the share buybacks, one of the earliest moves by Mr. Lampert was to decentralize the managements of Sears and Kmart, effectively creating more than three dozen silos of business lines such as men\u2019s wear, shoes and home furnishings, each with its own management team and board of directors.It is similar to a strategy sometimes used at hedge funds, where different teams compete with one another for scarce company resources. At Sears, though, the design led to infighting between divisions for everything from space in the weekly advertising circulars to floor shelving.One former executive described how the clashes played out in Sears showrooms, whether in the jewelry or the tools departments. Managers would tell their sales staff not to help customers in adjacent sections, even if someone asked for help. Mr. Lampert would praise policies like these, said the executive, who asked not to be named because he still works in retail.The company said the descriptions by former employees presented an \u201cincomplete perspective\u201d and that the company had adopted different organizational models. It noted that it had recently consolidated its management structure to speed up decision making.Mr. Lampert\u2019s grand vision for Sears, many former executives said, was to position it to compete with Amazon. Instead of spending on store upkeep, he plowed investment, new talent and marketing into Sears\u2019s website and a customer loyalty program called Shop Your Way. The program allows customers to earn points, for purchases not only at Sears but at partnering businesses including Burger King, Under Armour and Uber, that can be redeemed for Sears merchandise.Sears, Mr. Lampert argued, had a big edge: Its hundreds of stores nationwide could act as distribution centers. People could order things online and have them delivered locally.The problem, former executives and employees said, was that the bulk of Sears\u2019s revenue still came from its stores. And they were rapidly losing traffic.\u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret has a $1 billion online business selling $25 bras and such because customers are totally comfortable going to victoriassecret.com, because they felt connected to the brand and the store experience,\u201d said Gary Schettino, a former vice president of merchandising at Sears Holdings. \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret understood the overlap of the store and the online customer in a way that Sears never did.\u201dKmart and Sears stores around the country became dilapidated, their personnel demoralized. Employees at some Kmarts didn\u2019t receive raises for several years. Some salespeople who worked solely on commission said that they had been slashed to nearly nothing about three years ago.Customers walking into a Sears store in Kokomo, Ind., were greeted by stained carpets, broken mannequins and cracked display tables, recalled Amanda Marquand Householder, an assistant manager there before she left in 2014. The Kokomo store closed this spring.The problems extended to Kmart stores as well. Kristin Hamm, an assistant manager at a branch in Lancaster, Pa., from 2011 to 2014, said managers knew exactly where to put the buckets they kept handy \u2014 all 10 of them \u2014 to catch water from the leaky roof when it rained.Ms. Hamm also said inventory was hit and miss. On Black Friday one year, Kmart heavily promoted a particular television to drive traffic into its store. She said the Lancaster Kmart was given only one to sell.The store did receive plenty of items, however, from the body-conscious clothing line by the hip-hop star Nicki Minaj. \u201cIt didn\u2019t sell well,\u201d Ms. Hamm said. \u201cI mean, our store was located in the middle of one of the largest Mennonite populations in the country.\u201dKmart ended its partnership with Ms. Minaj late last year. The Kmart store in Lancaster, which opened in 1970, closed in March.In a statement, Sears said that the execution of Mr. Lampert\u2019s strategy has had its challenges, but that the company was making progress \u201cin a very difficult retail environment where many retailers, including Victoria\u2019s Secret, have also been challenged.\u201dRegarding pay and commissions, Sears said that rather than increase compensation in some outlets, it chose to keep people employed, and stores open, as long as possible. As for upkeep, Sears noted that at the end of last year it had 1,400 operating stores and that it spent a \u201csignificant amount\u201d on store appearance and \u201cnever wants a store\u2019s appearance to disappoint its customers.\u201dThe company also noted that other retailers have gone under even after investing in store renovation. Regarding inventory control, Sears said that given the scale of its business, there would be \u201csituations where the company doesn\u2019t always get this right.\u201dThe fallout from Sears\u2019s mistakes have hit its work force hard.\u201cSears was the greatest job ever. A1. No doubt,\u201d said Edd Oliver, who, for the past decade worked as a salesman at a Sears in Columbus, Ga. \u201cPeople were raising families and sending children to college off of this company.\u201dA member of the Sears \u201cmillion-dollar club\u201d for three consecutive years in which he sold more than $1 million of appliances, Mr. Oliver said his job started to take a downward turn around 2014. That was when commissions, which had once been as high as 6 percent for some items, were cut to around 1.3 percent, he recalled.Paid solely on commission, Mr. Oliver\u2019s take-home pay, which topped out at around $60,000 in 2014, fell sharply in 2015 and then fell some more in 2016. The store also cut back on local advertising, Mr. Oliver said, hurting foot traffic.In April, Mr. Oliver lost his job when his store closed.\u201cI still today would tell anyone to go to Sears and buy the appliances and get the warranty. It is the best,\u201d Mr. Oliver said. \u201cBut after working there all of those years and then losing my job, it hurts. I\u2019ve taken a big emotional hit from this.\u201dIn recent years, Sears has been kept afloat largely by selling off its most valuable assets. At the same time, Mr. Lampert has taken steps to protect his investment in the company.Since 2012, Sears has been raising cash through a series of spinoffs or sales of entities including Sears Hometown and Outlet, a national retailer that focused on appliances and lawn and garden equipment, as well as Lands\u2019 End and Sears Canada. More recently, the company sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker, for $900 million.In many of the spinoffs, Mr. Lampert, through his hedge funds and other entities, invested significantly. Those stakes appear to be under water.But one move that could yet prove profitable for Mr. Lampert and others was the 2015 sale of more than 266 Sears and Kmart properties for $3 billion to a publicly traded real-estate investment pool called Seritage Growth Properties.The sale drew intense scrutiny on the pricing of the properties as well as a shareholder lawsuit, which argued that there had not been an independent, fair valuation of the properties and that there were myriad conflicts of interest. Mr. Lampert was the chief executive and largest shareholder of Sears, as well as the chairman of the board of trustees for Seritage. The lawsuit was settled this year for $40 million.Cutting companies into two pieces \u2014 a real estate side and an operations side \u2014 is a move hedge funds and private-equity investors have been performing for years. This can sometimes strain the operations side as it uses its cash to make rental payments.For Sears Holdings, the Seritage deal meant it now had to pay rent on properties it once owned. Sears Holdings paid an additional $200 million in rent and other expenses to Seritage in 2016.In its statement, the company said rent payments would decline as Sears Holdings reduces the size of its stores, as more customers shop online. This year, it expects rent payments to total $160 million.But as Sears Holdings exits those leases, higher-paying tenants are coming in, which benefits Seritage shareholders, including Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge funds. \u201cIn properties where Sears has given up the lease,\u201d said Wes Golladay, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, \u201cSeritage has moved in restaurants, small grocers, gym chains, a pretty broad-based group of new lessees who are paying more than $18 a square foot, from the $4 that Sears was paying.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Lampert has played the role of Sears Holdings\u2019s primary banker, collecting fees while providing loans to the operations side of the company. As a result, Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund and other entities hold a significant portion of Sears Holdings\u2019s debt, in effect making him one of the company\u2019s biggest lenders. The bulk of that debt is secured by property or inventory.The debt ensures that even if Sears Holdings goes into bankruptcy, Mr. Lampert has a prominent seat at the table \u2014 and a voice in its future course \u2014 since debt-holders come before shareholders in working out a corporate restructuring through the courts.Some observers say it is difficult for them to imagine a scenario in which Sears doesn\u2019t go into bankruptcy. \u201cThere has been a long, steady sale of assets to the point where the cupboard is pretty bare,\u201d said Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, which provides independent research to institutional investors. \u201cIt has been a long, slow bleed to keep the company afloat.\u201d\u201cIt is a shame,\u201d Mr. Perkins added, \u201cbecause this was such an iconic retailer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Doubles Down on Threats Against North Korea as Nuclear Tensions Escalate", "Date": "2017-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEWATER, N.J. \u2014 President Trump escalated his war of words with North Korea on Thursday by declaring that his provocative threat to rain down \u201cfire and fury\u201d might not have been harsh enough, as nuclear tensions between the two nations continued to crackle.Rejecting critics at home and abroad who condemned his earlier warning as reckless saber-rattling, Mr. Trump said North Korea and its volatile leader, Kim Jong-un, have pushed the United States and the rest of the world for too long.\u201cFrankly, the people who were questioning that statement, was it too tough? Maybe it wasn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d he told reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this to our country for a long time, for many years, and it\u2019s about time that somebody stuck up for the people of this country and for the people of other countries. So if anything, maybe that statement wasn\u2019t tough enough.\u201dAsked if that was a dare, Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a dare. It\u2019s a statement. Has nothing to do with dare. That\u2019s a statement. He\u2019s not going to go around threatening Guam and he\u2019s not going to threaten the United States and he\u2019s not going to threaten Japan, and he\u2019s not going to threaten South Korea. No, that\u2019s not a dare, as you say. That is a statement of fact.\u201dNorth Korea\u2019s ballistic missile program has recently accelerated faster than expected.Mr. Trump made his latest comments on North Korea during a pair of televised media events that covered a dizzying array of topics. He assailed Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, for not passing his legislative priorities, calling it \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the party\u2019s health care plan failed by one vote and hinting that the leader should step down if he cannot do better. Mr. Trump also said he would declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency and defended his decision to bar transgender people from the armed forces, saying he was \u201cdoing the military a great favor.\u201dIn his first response to Russia\u2019s decision to force the United States to slash its diplomatic staff in half, the president said he would thank President Vladimir V. Putin for helping him trim payroll costs. Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, whose house was raided last month by law enforcement agents as part of an investigation into Russia ties, calling him \u201ca very decent man.\u201d He said he was not considering firing Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.After nearly a week of his working vacation here, the president was in an expansive mood and seemingly eager to talk and take on all issues. While his press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, held a sign in the back of the room saying \u201cone more question,\u201d Mr. Trump kept plowing ahead, taking one after another until he was satisfied.Joining him at the club were Vice President Mike Pence and several aides, including Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his national security adviser, who has been under fire from the alt-right media after purging his staff of several hard-liners thought to be close to Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief strategist. Mr. Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d had confidence in General McMaster.Democrats complained that the president was inflaming the confrontation and called for diplomacy instead. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s escalatory rhetoric is exactly the wrong response to dealing with North Korea\u2019s provocative behavior,\u201d said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s East Asia Subcommittee. \u201cIt unnecessarily heightens the risk of miscalculation and creates the very fog that can lead to war.\u201dMore than 60 House Democrats sent a letter on Thursday to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson asking him to restrain the president. \u201cThese statements are irresponsible and dangerous, and also senselessly provide a boon to domestic North Korean propaganda, which has long sought to portray the United States as a threat to their people,\u201d the letter said.Former President Jimmy Carter, who has visited North Korea three times as a private citizen, added his voice to the criticism. \u201cIn addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries, especially China and Russia,\u201d he said in a statement. He added that all parties must assure the North Koreans that they would forgo \u201cany military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.\u201dFor all the bellicose words, Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he was open to negotiations, as Mr. Tillerson has urged. But the president expressed skepticism that talks would lead to a reasonable outcome, given the experiences of his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, none of whom was able to resolve the issue through negotiations.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll always consider negotiations,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been negotiating now for 25 years. Look at Clinton. He folded on the negotiations. He was weak and ineffective. You look what happened with Bush, you look what happened with Obama. Obama, he didn\u2019t even want to talk about it. But I talk. It\u2019s about time. Somebody has to do it.\u201dMr. Trump likewise said he doubted that sanctions passed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council last weekend would ultimately succeed. But he again suggested that he would bargain with China by backing down from a planned trade war if Beijing did more to resolve the North Korea impasse.\u201cWe lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know how I feel. It\u2019s not going to continue like that. But if China helps us, I feel a lot differently toward trade, a lot differently toward trade.\u201dHe was vague about exactly where the line would be if North Korea did not back down, and refused to say whether he would consider a pre-emptive military strike without an attack by Pyongyang.Asked what would be \u201ctougher\u201d than \u201cfire and fury,\u201d he demurred. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll see, you\u2019ll see.\u201dStress within the administration over North Korea again spilled over and into public view on Thursday. Speaking with reporters en route to Seattle, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the president was entitled to use whatever language he thought appropriate. \u201cI was not elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people elected the president.\u201dBut asked about his own equally tough but less colorful statement about North Korea, issued on Wednesday, Mr. Mattis said, \u201cThe rhetoric is up to the president. This is my rhetoric.\u201dA White House aide, meanwhile, said no one should listen to Mr. Tillerson on military matters related to North Korea after the secretary of state said he saw no imminent likelihood of war and urged Americans to sleep soundly.That drew a sharp retort from Mr. Tillerson\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cHe\u2019s a cabinet secretary,\u201d Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s fourth in line to the presidency. He carries a big stick.\u201dAdvertisement"}
