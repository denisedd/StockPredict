{"Headline": "The Internal Combustion Engine Is Not Dead Yet", "Date": "2017-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsAmong all the world\u2019s uncertainties, at least one matter seems settled: Batteries and electric motors will have a major role in powering the cars and trucks of our future. What is far less certain is how large that role will be, or how quickly the shift to electrification will happen.The trend of electric-powered cars has grown far beyond hybrids like the ubiquitous Toyota Prius. Early this year, Ford Motor announced that it would develop hybrid versions of both its brawny F-150 pickup, the country\u2019s best-selling vehicle, and the performance-focused Mustang. Last month, Volvo said that starting in 2019, all of its newly released models would be hybrid or all-electric. This was quickly followed by the news that France and Britain plan to ban the sale of new petroleum-burning vehicles by 2040.But gas- and diesel-powered engines are not done yet. Just as electrified cars \u2014 whether hybrids or pure battery-powered models \u2014 seem headed for market dominance, Mazda announced a breakthrough in gasoline engines that could make them far more efficient. It is the latest plot twist in a century of improvements for internal combustion engines, a power source pronounced dead many times that has persisted nevertheless. Here is some truth-squadding on the latest in auto technology.Mazda said it had made a big advance in a combustion method commonly known as homogeneous charge compression ignition, which would result in gasoline engines that are 20 to 30 percent more efficient than the company\u2019s best existing engines. Researchers around the world have tried to crack this process for years, but it has never really left the laboratory.Mazda, which now markets no hybrid vehicles, calls the engine Skyactiv-X and says it is scheduled for a 2019 introduction. In simplest terms, the big difference with the new engine is that under certain running conditions, the gasoline is ignited without the use of spark plugs. Instead, combustion is set off by the extreme heat in the cylinder that results from the piston inside the engine traveling upward and compressing air trapped inside, the same method diesel engines use. The efficiency gains come with the ability to operate using a very lean mixture \u2014 very little gas for the amount of air \u2014 that a typical spark-ignition engine cannot burn cleanly.Definitely. John Heywood, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicts that in 2050, 60 percent of light-duty vehicles will still have combustion engines, often working with electric motors in hybrid systems and largely equipped with a turbocharger. Vehicles powered purely by batteries, he estimates, will make up 15 percent of sales.The power-boosting advantage of turbochargers is widely deployed today, but in coming years it could be tilted toward the design of smaller engines that still meet customers\u2019 needs. \u201cThe real benefit comes from downsizing,\u201d Dr. Heywood said. \u201cThat reduces friction, which chews up a significant part of the energy input.\u201dDr. Heywood, who has pondered whether he would best serve his students by teaching combustion or electrochemistry, addresses the challenge of gasoline\u2019s future from a somewhat different direction: the practical limitations of battery electric cars. \u201cHolding a gas nozzle, you can transfer 10 megawatts of energy in five minutes,\u201d he said, explaining today\u2019s refueling reality. To recharge a Tesla electric at that rate today, he said, would require \u201ca cable you couldn\u2019t hold.\u201dThe question is how much better gas engines can get. Conventional piston engines have come a long way, and technical refinements like direct fuel injection, variable valve timing and cylinder shutdown systems are now widespread. Along with innovations in lightweight body materials and dual-clutch transmissions, mileage has steadily improved, so naturally, further gains are now harder to come by \u2014 usually in single-digit percentages.Even the plans in Europe to ban the sale of new gas- or diesel-powered cars will take decades to fully kick in. The rules would not take effect for more than 20 years. In addition, the average age of the 270 million light-duty vehicles on the road in the United States today approaches 12 years, so even if sales of new petrol-burning cars stopped immediately, it would take more than a decade for the fleet to switch over.Hybrids like the Prius may continue to save money at each fill-up, but that\u2019s not the whole story. In its test of the 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan, a plug-in model that the government says can drive 33 miles on battery power alone, Car and Driver calculated the payback of the $2,100 hybrid premium to be more than eight years (based on driving 12,000 miles a year and before any tax incentives). So, yes, there are savings if you drive lots of miles or tend to hold on to vehicles for a long time. The calculus shifts if gas gets more expensive. That said, the hybrid is friendlier to the planet in terms of tailpipe emissions and greenhouse gases.By 2050, Dr. Heywood\u2019s studies project, today\u2019s fuel economy could be doubled. \u201cA quarter to a third of that improvement would come from improvements to the vehicle,\u201d he said, in areas like aerodynamics and weight reduction. Other promising areas include variable compression ratios \u2014 a technology Nissan plans to introduce next year \u2014 and making better use of available fuels.That question of whether to teach combustion or electrochemistry? Dr. Heywood still wrestles with it, though he admits that the answer is \u201cboth of the above.\u201d The topic has become the theme of a presentation he has prepared \u2014 and the concept of electrification can be found on most pages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Moral Voice of Corporate America", "Date": "2017-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe nation has split into political tribes. The culture wars are back, waged over transgender rights and immigration. White nationalists are on the march.Amid this turbulence, a surprising group of Americans is testing its moral voice more forcefully than ever: C.E.O.s.After Nazi-saluting white supremacists rioted in Charlottesville, Va., and President Trump dithered in his response, a chorus of business leaders rose up this past week to condemn hate groups and espouse tolerance and inclusion. And as lawmakers in Texas tried to restrict the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms, corporate executives joined activists to kill the bill.These and other actions are part of a broad recasting of the voice of business in the nation\u2019s political and social dialogue, a transformation that has gained momentum in recent years as the country has engaged in fraught debates over everything from climate change to health care.In recent days, after the Charlottesville bloodshed, the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, called on people to \u201ccome together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us \u2014 tolerance, inclusion and diversity.\u201dJamie Dimon of JPMorgan said, \u201cThe equal treatment of all people is one of our nation\u2019s bedrock principles.\u201dWalmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, criticized Mr. Trump by name for his handling of the violence in Charlottesville, and called for healing.The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years \u2014 the swelling confidence of a torch-bearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement \u2014 is \u201ca seminal moment in the history of business in America,\u201d said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at PepsiCo.\u201cIn this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThese C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.\u201dThis transformation didn\u2019t happen overnight. Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within \u2014 from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\u201cNot every business decision is an economic one,\u201d said Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks, who was one of the country\u2019s first company leaders to proactively address social issues. \u201cThe reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.\u201dCompanies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u2019s store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth\u2019s desegregated.Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including General Motors and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. Apple, Disney and Xerox extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\u201cWhen I went to business school, you didn\u2019t see anything like this,\u201d said Marc Benioff, the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u201cNobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.\u201dNow, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected \u2014 to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders \u2014 than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President Mike Pence, then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\u201cC.E.O.s wield economic influence,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cNobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.\u201dThe business community\u2019s triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. Martin Winterkorn, a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company\u2019s emissions scandal.But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, and Robert A. Iger, the chief of Disney, resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week\u2019s revolt.\u201cThe C.E.O.s of big public companies don\u2019t walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,\u201d said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. \u201cBut today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.\u201dLast weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president\u2019s response. Among those watching was Kenneth C. Frazier, the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president\u2019s stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president\u2019s remarks \u2014 in which he blamed the violence on \u201cmany sides\u201d \u2014 were too much to bear.On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump\u2019s manufacturing council. \u201cAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u201d he wrote.The president took to Twitter, lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of Under Armour and Intel had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country\u2019s biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\u201cWhat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u201d the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\u201dAll week, the business world\u2019s actions went beyond the donations to charity and pledges to plant trees that once defined corporate social responsibility.\u201cFor a long time, corporate social responsibility was a buzzword marketing tool, walled off within an organization,\u201d said Alan Fleischmann, president of Laurel Strategies, an executive advisory firm. \u201cNow it has to be central for the C.E.O., part of their everyday responsibility and leadership.\u201dKevin Plank, the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, the athletic apparel maker, built a brand that celebrates diversity, sponsoring athletes like the basketball player Stephen Curry and artists like the ballerina Misty Copeland. Yet when asked to serve on the president\u2019s manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.His star sponsors made their displeasure known. \u201cI strongly disagree with Kevin Plank\u2019s recent comments in support of Trump,\u201d Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of Under Armour.\u201cThe leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,\u201d said Mr. Walker of the Ford Foundation. \u201cBut speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.\u201dBecause companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\u201cThe confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House,\u201d Mr. Carney wrote. \u201cThe battle lines are clear.\u201dThose executives who go out on a limb know the risks. \u201cWe all recognize that with every decision we make, there is a group of people that are not going to agree with us,\u201d Mr. Schultz said. \u201cBut you must define your core purpose for being. We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.\u201dDiversity \u2014 of opinions, ideologies and religions \u2014 is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity \u2014 of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force \u2014 that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. \u201cBusiness leaders aren\u2019t threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cBusiness leaders are bullish on diversity.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations \u2014 it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. \u201cOur employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,\u201d said Mr. Benioff of Salesforce. \u201cBusiness is the greatest platform for affecting change.\u201dIf the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump\u2019s business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.The black chief executive of a $172 billion company \u2014 a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president \u2014 Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\u201cOur country\u2019s strength stems from its diversity,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u201dThe C.E.O.s had found their voice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Reassures Investors as Tesla Ramps Up Model 3 Output", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe electric-car maker Tesla faces challenges in introducing its first mass-market vehicle, but the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk, sought to reassure investors on Wednesday that the company was up to the task.Tesla may experience some fluctuations in production rates, Mr. Musk said, but \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about the company\u2019s ability to increase production of the new offering, the Model 3.Tesla said it lost $401.4 million in the quarter that ended June 30, compared with a loss of $293.2 million in the same period in 2016.At the same time, the company reported overall growth in its operations, which include its automotive business and its solar-panel division.Tesla said total revenue for the quarter was $2.79 billion, more than double the $1.27 billion it recorded in the comparable period last year.Revenue from the company\u2019s auto operations was $2.29 billion, compared with $1.18 billion a year earlier.Despite the wider loss in the quarter, Mr. Musk said the company was on track in many areas \u2014 including batteries, solar panels, and maintaining sales of its existing vehicles, the Model S sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle \u2014 even as it rolls out the Model 3.He added that Tesla was starting to look at locations for battery factories in China and Europe, although he said most of its battery production would probably remain in the United States.Although Tesla posted stronger sales of the Model S and the Model X, the biggest challenge it faces is preparing for the introduction of the Model 3, the company\u2019s first foray into the mass market, with prices starting at $35,000.Tesla has consistently lost money because of heavy spending on research, product development and equipment for its assembly plant in California and its battery factory in Nevada.Mr. Musk has said Tesla is earning good margins on the small number of Model S and Model X vehicles it has sold.Although sales are rising, the per-car profit is not nearly substantial enough to cover the company\u2019s high investment costs.Tesla\u2019s best hope for improving its financial results is to produce a steady flow of Model 3 vehicles for delivery to customers later this year.Interest in the new vehicle has been huge since the company began taking $1,000 deposits on it more than a year ago.Industry analysts have been hesitant to express doubts about Mr. Musk, mostly because Tesla has already defied expectations for a start-up automaker.But investors are scrutinizing how quickly the company can accelerate production to begin delivering a significant number of Model 3s to buyers this year.Mr. Musk\u2019s widely reported comment last week that Tesla faces six months of \u201cmanufacturing hell\u201d has caused some analysts to question whether the company can meet its aggressive targets.\u201cThis of course raises questions about Tesla\u2019s broader ability to scale not just its manufacturing, but the entire supporting infrastructure,\u201d said Clement Thibault, an analyst with the website investing.com.The first Model 3s to be built will primarily be more expensive variations, at $44,000, equipped with longer-range battery packs. Tesla will then add production of the base-price version.The higher-priced, option-laden Model 3s could generate better profit margins.Tesla is also gaining some ground in the marketplace. Sales of the Model S and Model X in the United States totaled 3,100 vehicles in July, according to the research firm Autodata, and overall sales for the first seven months of the year had increased by 35 percent over the same period in 2016.Neal E.

{"Headline": "European Bank Cuts Funds to VW Because of Emissions Fraud", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Volkswagen suffered another blow to its reputation on Tuesday after it was barred from receiving European Union research financing over allegations it misused a previous loan to cheat on emissions.The decision by the publicly owned European Investment Bank at least temporarily deprives Volkswagen of low-cost financing it badly needs for research and development during a period of technological upheaval in the automobile business.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.The hold on new loans came after the European Anti-Fraud Office, known as OLAF, concluded that Volkswagen misled authorities about how it used \u20ac400 million, or $472 million, that was meant to be used to develop engines that would be more fuel efficient and pollute less.Volkswagen used some of the money to develop the EA 189 diesel engine, according to the European Investment Bank. That was the same engine at the heart of the emissions scandal.The investment bank, which provides loans to companies for research and other uses, said Tuesday that it would not issue any new funds to Volkswagen while it examined what further action to take.It also issued an unusually harsh critique of Volkswagen management.\u201cVW is an excellent company,\u201d Werner Hoyer, the president of the European Investment Bank, said in a statement, \u201cbut it has not been served well by its top management since the beginning of this affair. The thousands of wonderful people who work for VW must feel betrayed.\u201dVolkswagen denied wrongdoing. \u201cAll funds received by Volkswagen from the European Union were used for the designated purpose,\u201d the company said in its own statement.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests.

The company has received \u20ac5 billion worldwide since 1990, the bank said. About one-third of the money was designated for technologies to reduce the cars\u2019 environmental impact.The Anti-Fraud Office found that Volkswagen misled the European Investment Bank about its use of so-called defeat devices, software that caused pollution controls in diesel motors to work properly only when the engine computer detected that an official emissions test was underway.The Anti-Fraud Office also referred its findings to prosecutors in Braunschweig, Germany, near Volkswagen headquarters in Wolfsburg. Klaus Ziehe, a spokesman for the state attorney\u2019s office, said authorities were reviewing the findings and had not yet decided how to proceed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tesla Motors Is Fueling Up on Debt", "Date": "2017-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElon Musk is an entrepreneur in a bubble.Forced to choose between issuing a bit more of Tesla\u2019s turbocharged stock or tapping the overheated junk-bond market to finance the Model 3 ramp-up, Mr. Musk, the company\u2019s founder, opted for the latter. It raises execution risk for the $60 billion electric-car maker, but not by enough to persuade the chief executive to loosen his grip on the wheel.Tesla has just over $3 billion in cash, but it is burning through roughly $1 billion a quarter as it embarks on one of the most daunting gambits in automotive history: taking production of its mass-market vehicle from zero to 400,000 or more a year in just 18 months.Fortunately for Mr. Musk, investors can\u2019t seem to shower his ambitions with too much money. Tesla\u2019s stock has risen by 67 percent this year. The company is valued at some 27 times 2020 earnings, implying the kind of growth that even the most bullish of analysts don\u2019t expect, according to Reuters Breakingviews calculations.The textbook financing solution would be to issue more of that high-priced paper. Selling five million shares at a 15 percent discount to market would raise the same $1.5 billion and dilute Mr. Musk\u2019s 20.4 percent stake by only 3 percent, assuming he didn\u2019t pitch in more himself.But he doesn\u2019t have to when the high-yield bond market is on a tear. Investors desperate for income have depressed the yield gap between single-B-rated junk bonds and United States Treasury bonds by nearly 2 percentage points over the past year, to 3.59 points, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Standard & Poor\u2019s Global Ratings affirmed its B-minus rating on Tesla, saying the boost to liquidity should offset the company\u2019s \u201csignificant execution risks.\u201dThe bond sale will raise debt to a lofty 5.5 times forecast 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. But Ebitda is set to more than double next year to $2.2 billion and then almost triple by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Even if Mr. Musk is not as successful as Wall Street estimates, he should sell more than enough cars to make the leverage, and the additional interest bill, easy for bondholders to swallow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Dark Dark,\u2019 Beguiling Tales of Women in Metamorphosis", "Date": "2017-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesHunt\u2019s stories are peopled with women who don\u2019t fully trust or understand their bodies or their minds, or the places where their bodies and minds overlap. One character who is thinking of getting pregnant tells herself that reproduction is \u201csimply a matter of hormones.\u201d Then she thinks: \u201cBut saying it\u2019s hormones is the same as saying witchcraft or sorcery. What\u2019s the difference between hormones and magic potions? Neither of them are believable or explainable.\u201d Another woman, who has children, thinks: \u201cMy body\u2019s coursing with secret genes and hormones and proteins. My body made eyeballs and I have no idea how.\u201dThe physical metamorphoses these women go through range from the literal \u2014 pregnancies abound \u2014 to the figurative: The narrator of \u201cBeast\u201d feels herself becoming a deer late each night, next to her husband in bed. Perhaps that\u2019s not so figurative, though, because in Hunt\u2019s tipsy world, it seems that the transformation is actually happening: \u201cI am very careful, very quiet, planting my hooves on our bed.\u201dWhen they aren\u2019t marveling at the changes in their bodies, they\u2019re tracking the often surreal stratagems of their minds. The narrator of \u201cA Love Story\u201d ponders explanations for why she and her husband haven\u2019t had sex in eight months. \u201cThe first reason, the wildest, craziest reason, is that maybe my husband is just gone,\u201d she thinks. \u201cMaybe one night a while back I kicked him out after a fight and maybe, even if I didn\u2019t mean everything I said, maybe he went away and hasn\u2019t come back yet.\u201d She adds, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just imagining him here still.\u201dHunt is a deceptively experimental writer. Her sentences flow, her people seem real, her plots more or less cohere. But she is nearly always playing with form on a cellular level. \u201cAll Hands,\u201d as it starts, is narrated by a Coast Guard officer who falls off an oil tanker into the water and struggles to find his way out from beneath its enormous hull. It abruptly shifts to being narrated by a woman who is helping counsel 13 pregnant girls, all students at the same high school. Hunt trusts us to figure out the perspective switch without any hand-holding, and to recognize the story\u2019s larger connections as they are patiently disclosed. Other stories contain quiet echoes of one another: Two scenes involve couples whose bedtime rituals include checking each other for ticks.The first and last stories are twinned, and they are the book\u2019s most blatant meta maneuver, though you don\u2019t know it at the start. The opener, \u201cThe Story Of,\u201d is straightforward enough: A woman receives a visit from an unnerving stranger who ends up having a connection to her husband. The collection\u2019s finale, \u201cThe Story of Of,\u201d not only soon diverges from the opener in its details, but it warps into a recursive exercise in which the characters end up reading their own story in a notebook as it tumbles back to its beginning and restarts again and again. It could be optioned by Charlie Kaufman to turn into one of his hall-of-intellectual-mirrors movies.Like any daring writer worth her salt, Hunt now and then launches a dud firecracker. \u201cLove Machine,\u201d about a hyper-realistic robot sent in to flirt with, and apprehend or kill, the Unabomber, feels both goofier and more portentous than it is probably meant to, and it resists the emotional investment Hunt\u2019s other stories easily invite.\u201cCortes the Killer,\u201d arguably the most realistic story in the book, is also arguably the strongest. At just over 20 pages, its tale of a brother and sister dealing with the fallout of their father\u2019s death from lung cancer whispers at the richness of a full-length novel. Its climax is built around an arresting image of an animal in distress, one of Hunt\u2019s many haunting visions. (In another, she imagines millions of young girls walking to the sea, boarding \u201can armada of waiting tankers, barges, ships and tugs,\u201d never to be seen again.)Hunt at her best is a lot like the uncle of one character, who is described as \u201cso good at imagining things\u201d that \u201che makes the imagined things real.\u201d Hunt\u2019s dreamlike images operate in service to earthbound ideas. These stories are deeply imbued with feminist themes. Without being oppressively explicit about it (mostly), Hunt gets at the myriad ways women work to keep their self-possession in the face of social and interpersonal expectations.\u201cYou may ask,\u201d one narrator tells us of the co-op of voices in her head, \u201cAre these women who bombard me at night real or do I imagine them? You may eventually realize that is a stupid question.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Kevin Plank, the founder of Under Armour, announced on Twitter that he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council, saying, among other things, that his company \u201cengages in innovation and sports, not politics.\u201d He did not refer to the president, though.Mr. Plank was followed shortly after by Brian Krzanich, the Intel chief executive, who announced on the company\u2019s website that he would step down from the council as well. \u201cI resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,\u201d he said.A few big-name corporate leaders released innocuous statements over the weekend condemning the violence by white supremacists in Charlottesville. But with the exception of Mr. Frazier, none appear to have directly condemned the president\u2019s choice of words, which have been a lightning rod for Americans from many quarters, even among many Republican lawmakers and Trump supporters.At a news conference on Monday, after a barrage of blistering criticism, the president said that \u201cracism is evil.\u201dAs the day wore on, several executives, including Meg Whitman of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, made statements in support of Mr. Frazier, while others \u2014 including Tim Cook of Apple, and the Business Roundtable, which represents some 200 C.E.O.s \u2014 condemned the racism on display in Charlottesville.But notably, not one executive on any of the president\u2019s various councils said anything directly about the president.The statements from American chief executives that came closest to criticizing Mr. Trump\u2019s language came from Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Mr. Krzanich of Intel.Mr. Blankfein tweeted on Monday morning: \u201cLincoln: \u2018A house divided against itself cannot stand.\u2019 Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.\u201d (Mr. Blankfein is not on any of the president\u2019s councils, which may make it easier for him to be critical.)But how can so many other American business leaders and senior executives remain quiet about the president\u2019s reaction? Where is the moral courage to stand up?After all, most companies these days spend countless hours talking about their culture and values. Just last week, Google publicly fired one of its engineers within days of his writing a memo that questioned whether \u201cpersonality differences\u201d between men and women led to there being fewer female engineers in the technology industry.As Justice Marshall himself famously said, \u201cWhere you see wrong or inequality or injustice, speak out, because this is your country. This is your democracy.\u201dMr. Ogunlesi declined to comment, through a spokesman.What about Indra Nooyi, the Indian-born chief executive of PepsiCo? She is a member of the president\u2019s business council and has long been a vocal advocate for minorities. The company said this year that it \u201cdoes not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form.\u201dWhen I contacted her about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks over the weekend, a spokesman directed me to a tweet that clearly didn\u2019t mention the president: \u201cHeartbroken by the violence in #Charlottesville. Hate and intolerance are a betrayal of what we stand for as Americans.\u201dIn truth, it should not fall to C.E.O.s who are members of minority groups to speak up. They face enough pressure already.Some people who have less at stake are going on the record to support Mr. Frazier\u2019s stance against the president. Tom Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, wrote on Twitter on Monday: \u201cKen has stood up for true American values. I call on all other members of Trump\u2019s image-burnishing committees to do the same.\u201dPrivately, many chief executives say they are fuming, outraged by the president. (This after many of them campaigned to get on Mr. Trump\u2019s committees.) But many are too scared to say anything publicly that could make them or their company a target of Mr. Trump\u2019s wrath.Indeed, Mr. Trump\u2019s vitriol against Mr. Frazier and Merck \u2014 a company that depends on the government as a buyer for many of its drugs \u2014 will perhaps have an even greater chilling effect on other C.E.O.s who may consider speaking out. (The potential for economic retribution against Merck also demonstrates just how brave Mr. Frazier was in taking a stand.)When I asked one chief executive Monday morning why he had remained publicly silent, he told me: \u201cJust look at what he did to Ken. I\u2019m not sticking my head up.\u201d Which, of course, is the reason he said I could not quote him by name.The same trepidation may explain why people like Mr. Ogunlesi don\u2019t say anything. He runs an infrastructure fund that will most likely have to do business with the federal government. And Ms. Nooyi\u2019s PepsiCo, for example, was briefly boycotted by Trump supporters when she made some comments that were construed as critical of him.Other C.E.O.s, like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, have contended that they consider it part of their patriotic duty to remain on the president\u2019s business council, even when they disagree with things Mr. Trump says or does.\u201cIt is very hard if you say, I\u2019m going to go off an advisory group or not do A-B-C, because you disagree on one issue,\u201d Mr. Dimon said in early June after Mr. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement, a move that Mr. Dimon was against. Elon Musk of Tesla and Robert Iger of Disney resigned from the council in protest.\u201cHonestly, no one is going to agree with every president or prime minister on every issue, so I don\u2019t want to overreact to it,\u201d Mr. Dimon said.Lawrence Summers, who has served as Treasury secretary and president of Harvard, said in response to Mr. Dimon\u2019s rationale at the time to Bloomberg News: \u201cAt what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country rather to your president? I\u2019ve always thought of my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country.\u201dOn Monday, Mr. Dimon, who is the chairman of the Business Roundtable, put out his own statement about the violence in Charlottesville, but nothing about the president.C.E.O.s have faced the question of how to address the president when they disagree with him before \u2014 over immigration, say, or the Paris climate accord. Each time, the executives have justified their silence by saying it is more valuable to be at the table than not.That\u2019s a valid argument \u2014 to a point. If the president isn\u2019t following your advice or the values you espouse, when should you get up? Of course, big policy decisions like tax reform remain just around the corner, so many executives are desperate to keep a line open to the president even if it is only one-way.It is a fair critique of the president that he didn\u2019t immediately and directly condemn the bigoted actions over the weekend and call them out for what they were \u2014 remarks that tacitly helped normalize such hate.While C.E.O.s may call out the hate, will they have the fortitude to call out the president?An earlier version of this column misquoted part of President Trump\u2019s statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Va. He blamed \u201cmany sides,\u201d not \u201call sides,\u201d for the violence that left one woman dead.An earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly part of a statement from Merck. The company said \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders must honor our fundamental values,\u201d not \u201cfundamental views.\u201dTwitter: @andrewrsorkinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Driverless-Car Outlook Shifts as Intel Takes Over Mobileye", "Date": "2017-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout three years ago, the chip giant Intel seemed like a bystander in Silicon Valley\u2019s race to develop self-driving cars.Even in microchips, its strength, Intel was scrambling to catch up to its rival Nvidia, whose superfast processors were attracting automakers because of their ability to fuse images from the cameras and radar sensors to detect obstacles.\u201cIntel now has a very big footprint in all parts of the autonomous vehicle, the brains, the sensors, the information side, the mapping,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who tracks the development of self-driving cars. \u201cThe acquisition clearly puts Intel in the conversation. It guarantees they will be a player.\u201dThere are increasing signs that autonomous cars have arrived \u2014 and may be driving on our city streets sooner than we think.Intel announced its intention to acquire Mobileye in March. The two companies have been working with BMW on self-driving cars and are partners with Delphi Automotive, a supplier of advanced automotive electronics and software.Intel and Mobileye aim to demonstrate the strength of their combined capabilities in the next several months by building a fleet of 100 self-driving test vehicles.\u201cThis is our way to put the technology out so it can be demonstrated not only for automakers but for society, for regulators,\u201d Mr. Shashua, who will become a senior vice president of Intel, said in an interview.Despite their multitude of sensors and processors, autonomous cars have a lot of trouble with some everyday aspects of driving.Test cars will be sent first to Arizona and then to Jerusalem, a challenging environment with narrow streets and aggressive drivers. \u201cIf you can successfully drive autonomously in Jerusalem, you can drive almost anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Shashua said.Such a fleet would give Intel something to rival Google\u2019s autonomous driving division, now called Waymo. Over the past year, Waymo has built a sizable test fleet using minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and it is operating them in several cities. Uber is running tests in Pittsburgh, while General Motors, Ford Motor and other traditional automakers are creating their own test fleets.At the same time, the combination of Intel and Mobileye will begin working on a new self-driving system that combines Intel chips and Mobileye\u2019s technology. Mr. Shashua said the new system would be about twice as powerful as Mobileye\u2019s current product based on its EyeQ5 processor.The system will include several key components of a self-driving car \u2014 cameras, image-processing capabilities, microprocessors and mapping technology, as well as software that determines how to react to driving situations, pedestrians and other vehicles, known as \u201cdriving policy.\u201dThe technology will be designed to allow automakers to add their own self-driving software. \u201cCar manufacturers will want to imprint their own characteristics on the system, how they want it to feel and how they want it to drive,\u201d said Brian M. Krzanich, Intel\u2019s chief executive.Still, it will not be easy for Intel to pull automakers away. Nvidia offers chips with more raw processing power, which \u201chave been getting a lot of wins lately,\u201d\u2019 Mr. Ramsey said.Toyota recently chose Nvidia technology for the self-driving cars it is developing.Advertisement"}

Yet in nearly tripling its financial obligations to buy brick-and-mortar Whole Foods Market, Jeff Bezos\u2019s company is starting to look more traditional. The risk is that its stock will, too.Mr. Bezos built his online empire by investing cash flow into the business and eschewing conventional corporate finance tools like debt and dividends. A result is a $472 billion goliath \u2014 the fifth-largest American enterprise by market capitalization \u2014 that has store owners and technology companies quaking over its ambitions.Amazon could have financed the Whole Foods deal by issuing stock with only minimal dilution of his 16.6 percent stake. But as Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk did last week, Mr. Bezos took the cheap money available in the fixed-income market. Investors submitted nearly $47 billion in bids, and the company was able to sell its paper at razor-thin margins, including a premium to comparable United States Treasury bonds of just 1.45 percentage points for $2.25 billion of 40-year bonds. A need for yield and a belief that Amazon will triumph from the retail shakeout that it is provoking created a powerful cocktail.The deal will nearly triple Amazon\u2019s outstanding debt, to slightly more than $23 billion. That is about a billion dollars less than the consensus estimate for its 2018 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or ebitda.Given the company\u2019s cash pile, net debt will be even lower at less than $10 billion. That leaves the underleveraged Amazon with enough financial firepower to consider acquisitions that would make Whole Foods look like an appetizer.Whether that would be good for the company\u2019s stock is less clear. Belief in the Bezos vision has pushed Amazon shares up nearly 31 percent this year, and they are trading at 120 times 2018 estimated earnings as calculated by Thomson Reuters Eikon. Walmart Stores, by contrast, fetches 17.6 times earnings. As Amazon begins to more closely resemble peers in its physical footprint and its balance sheet, that gap will inevitably narrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Flocks to Foiling, Racing Above the Bay\u2019s Waves", "Date": "2017-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 What happens in the San Francisco Bay every Thursday night does not look real or even possible, and it certainly does not look safe. Dozens of people skim across the waters at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, kites far ahead and their boards floating two feet above the chop of the waves. They move so smoothly and quietly that some riders are on their cellphones.They call it hydrofoiling \u2014 or, if you\u2019re hip to it, foiling.And every week, the foilers of San Francisco race.\u201cIt\u2019s like flying,\u201d said Ariel Poler, a 50-year-old start-up investor, standing by the winged doors of his Tesla and pulling on body armor and a helmet. \u201cThe board doesn\u2019t touch the water. It\u2019s like an airplane wing.\u201cIt\u2019s like a powder day,\u201d he added, referring to snow skiing.He walked into the water, strapped his feet onto the small, oddly shaped board and latched his kite onto his harness. Then he leaned back in the water like an overturned turtle. As the kite caught wind, Poler popped up and blasted toward Alcatraz Island.The Silicon Valley elite have long loved extreme water sports (there is an entire tech and kitesurfing conference circuit). Now they have upgraded them. And suddenly, the tech world is participating in a sport most of the country has never seen.In workshops around San Francisco and Hawaii, craftsmen and technologists are hooking hydrofoils \u2014 a lifting surface attached to the bottom of a watercraft \u2014 onto seemingly everything. Versions include a jetfoiler, which looks like a surfboard with a rudder and a tiny hidden motor; the SUP foil, a stand-up paddle board with a foil; and the kitefoil, which is like a kiteboard but has a foil.\u201cNow we all foil,\u201d Poler said.Just as it did for the America\u2019s Cup, foiling adds both speed and danger.\u201cFalling from four feet in the air at 40 miles an hour, the wipeouts are pretty spectacular,\u201d said Joey Pasquale, 34, a tugboat captain and foiler. \u201cI broke two ribs earlier this year.\u201dIt was a typical cold summer night in San Francisco as the racers competed.Stretching against his van was Johnny Heineken, 29, one of the world\u2019s top foilers, and a mechanical engineer for Alphabet Inc.\u2019s experimental technologies lab, X.\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of tactical sailing and a high-performance action sport,\u201d said Heineken, who wore a straw hat and Tevas. \u201cAnd then it just feels great. You fly around the bay.\u201dNico Parlier, 22, a professional foiler visiting from France, said that the French racers had been using the technology for years but that Americans took it more seriously.\u201cThey took it to a different level,\u201d Parlier said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very cheap sport, and people here are very wealthy, so it\u2019s a good combination.\u201d\u201cThey look you up, or they have a friend, and all of a sudden you\u2019re hanging out with Larry and Sergey,\u201d Montague said, referring to Google\u2019s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin.At a massive former naval base in Alameda, Calif., Montague has a staff of 10 working on inflatable foils, jetfoils and giant foil boats. His investors and clients include the Google founders and its former chief executive Eric Schmidt.Montague, with messy brown hair and a surfer\u2019s drawl, had made a name for himself building kitesurfing gear, selling more than 20,000 of those boards (he claims to have named the sport). In 2013, he founded a wind-power company and sold it to Google. But a motorized inflatable jetfoil is more complicated than a simple kiteboard, so he moved from Hawaii to the Bay Area and assembled a staff of mechanical engineers and designers.\u201cI had to come here to build the team,\u201d Montague said. \u201cThis is the foiling spot for America.\u201dMontague is a regular on the private-island and yacht circuit with people like the Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Google\u2019s Page, whose islands are close enough to foil between. There is some competition in the small community. When Google\u2019s Brin surfed with two girls on his board, Montague said, Branson took a photo with three.\u201cIt\u2019s just way better than golfing,\u201d Montague said.Now, once a week, Montague said, he takes Page on a four-hour kitefoiling trip, with a chase boat and a water scooter in tow. Long trips are easier by foil, since the board is not bouncing on every wave.\u201cThere\u2019s less wear on the body because you\u2019re not absorbing the chop,\u201d Montague said.Montague\u2019s jetfoil goes to market this spring, selling for around $5,000. His competition is the Lift eFoil, which costs $12,000 and will ship in September (with a five-month waiting list).Just a few miles north of Montague in El Sobrante, Calif., is the craftsman Mike Zajicek, who foilers say makes the best in the world.\u201cTo get a foil from Zajicek takes a year,\u201d Montague said. \u201cIf he likes you.\u201dFor the past few years, Zajicek has made his hydrofoils by hand, selling them for around $6,000 each. In total, he estimates he has sold 110 foils, and has 50 in construction. This year, the demand skyrocketed. He said hundreds are on a waiting list.\u201cNow the whole world is banging on my door, and I have to attempt to answer emails I have no answers for,\u201d Zajicek said.What kind of questions?\u201cLike, \u2018When am I getting my board?\u2019\u201d he said.Zajicek\u2019s house and workshop in El Sobrante are covered in wisteria. Inside, he has laid out layers of carbon fiber. An intern is in charge of duties such as altering the weld nuts. Nothing was originally built to be a foilboard, so Zajicek came up with his design through trial and error.\u201cIts limitless in the choices you can make,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 100 different pieces go in this thing. I kept fiddling, combining different wings and masts and fuselages.\u201dHe cuts the carbon fiber with scissors, brushes each layer with epoxy resin, then carefully applies the next layer. He puts on \u201csome pretty powerful reading glasses\u201d to aid in his precision. After 20 layers, which usually takes him about three hours, he puts the foil in an oven.He tests each foil, flexing it between his hands for give and tension. He takes most of them on the water himself. Then he sends the board out to the buyer.Back in San Francisco Bay, the foilers were wrapping up. The water was cold and choppy. The foilers made a nearby windsurfer look as if he were standing still. Some foilers fell, their kites sweeping down as the chase boat went to pick them up.Afterward, they shared a beer in the parking lot before heading to the nearby St. Francis Yacht Club for burgers and fish tacos. The club decided to classify the foils as yachts to allow the peculiar new athletes in.They brag to one another about gaming their corporate calendar systems for more foiling time. Stefaans Viljoen, 40, tailgating before joining the rest of the foilers at the club, had not won that night\u2019s race but said he would be back in the water by morning.\u201cI have my C.T.O. book Fridays as busy 11 a.m. onward,\u201d Viljoen said of his chief technology officer.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s also an alarming gap in pay and promotions, which has devastating effects on women\u2019s careers.Instead, women in the industry should collectively consider their legal options. Top among these would be class-action discrimination cases against employers.The tech sector is not the first white-collar \u201cboys\u2019 club\u201d to demand an industrywide correction. In the 1990s, Wall Street firms faced a slew of class-action discrimination lawsuits. Perhaps the most notable was the 1996 \u201cBoom Boom Room\u201d case. A group of 23 women filed a class-action lawsuit against the Smith Barney stock brokerage firm, charging it with rampant harassment and gender discrimination. By the time Smith Barney settled the case for $150 million, nearly 2,000 women had joined the suit and helped expose a culture of sexism to the outside world.As a result of this and other cases that similarly challenged systemic practices at other Wall Street firms, many of these companies now have more extensive human-resource policies addressing sexual harassment and gender discrimination. While pay and promotion discrimination still exists, more women on Wall Street are advancing in their careers to managing directorship and other leadership roles. The lesson of these cases is clear: Class-action lawsuits can force industrywide change, even in the most entrenched, male-dominated industries.Women in tech no doubt have hurdles to bringing class-action lawsuits, including the requisite preponderance of statistical evidence and the prevalence of confidentiality clauses and arbitration agreements, which are, in effect, designed to pre-empt class actions. But this challenge doesn\u2019t mean the suits cannot be brought, or won. This is a route that the women of Silicon Valley should consider, especially if regulation is not an immediate and viable solution.It\u2019s not just the female plaintiffs who would win if they were to be victorious in court. The economic benefits could be remarkable. Advancing women\u2019s equality, which includes minimizing the gender gap in labor force participation, holds the potential to add $12 trillion to global G.D.P. by 2025.The male-dominated leadership of Silicon Valley has proved unwilling or unable to solve systemic gender inequality, and the leaked Google memo should serve as an alert about how deeply and passionately anti-equality attitudes are held. It\u2019s time women in tech consider taking advantage of the law to disrupt the industry once and for all.Anita Hill is of counsel to Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, a national plaintiffs\u2019 law firm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Game You Can Control With Your Mind", "Date": "2017-08-27", "News": "A number of companies are working on ways to control machines simply with a thought. But they are likely to be met with skepticism.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When you pull the headset over your eyes and the game begins, you are transported to a tiny room with white walls. Your task is to break out of the room, but you cannot use your hands. There is no joystick or game pad. You must use your thoughts.You turn toward a ball on the floor, and your brain sends a command to pick it up. With another thought, you send the ball crashing into a mirror, breaking the glass and revealing a few numbers scribbled on a wall. You mentally type those numbers into a large keypad by the door. And you are out.Designed by Neurable, a small start-up founded by Ramses Alcaide, an electrical engineer and neuroscientist, the game offers what you might call a computer mouse for the mind, a way of selecting items in a virtual world with your thoughts.Incorporating a headset with virtual reality goggles and sensors that can read your brain waves, this prototype is a few years from the market. And it is limited in what it can do. You cannot select an object with your mind unless you first look in its general direction, narrowing the number of items you may be considering.But it works. I recently played the game, which has the working title Awakening, when Mr. Alcaide and two Neurable employees passed through San Francisco, and a few hundred others tried it this month at the Siggraph computer graphics conference in Los Angeles.The prototype is among the earliest fruits of a widespread effort to embrace technology that was once science fiction \u2014 and in some ways still is. Driven by recent investments from the United States government and by the herd mentality that so often characterizes the tech world, a number of a start-ups and bigger companies like Facebook are working on ways to mentally control machines. They are also looking for smoother ways to use virtual reality technology.\u201cNeurotechnology has become cool,\u201d said Ed Boyden, a professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at the M.I.T. Media Lab who advises one of those start-ups.\u201cWith the smartphone, we\u2019re starting to reach the limits of what we can do,\u201d said Doug Clinton, the founder of Loup Ventures, a new venture capital firm that has invested in Neurable. \u201cThese companies are the next step.\u201dAt Neurable, which is based in Boston, Mr. Alcaide and the members of his team are pushing the limits of EEG headsets. Although sensors can read electrical brain activity from outside the skull, it is very difficult to separate the signal from the noise. Using computer algorithms based on research that Mr. Alcaide originally published as a doctoral student at the University of Michigan, Neurable works to read activity with a speed and accuracy that is not usually possible.The algorithms learn from your behavior. Before playing the game, you train them to recognize when you are focusing your attention on an object. A pulse of light bounces around the virtual room, and each time it hits a small colored ball in front of you, you think about the ball. At that moment, when you focus on the light and it stimulates your brain, the system reads the electrical spikes of your brain activity.After you do this for a few minutes, the game learns to recognize when you are concentrating on an item. \u201cWe look at specific brain signals,\u201d Mr. Alcaide said, \u201cand once we understand them, we can use them.\u201dWhen you play the game, the same light bounces around the virtual room. When it hits the item you are thinking about, the system can identify the increase in brain activity.The technique works with equipment that already exists. Neurable\u2019s prototype uses virtual reality goggles from HTC, a consumer electronics company, and seven EEG sensors placed at specific spots around your head. But given the physical limits of what these sensors can read, an EEG-based game is unlikely to do more than slowly and simply select digital objects.Some companies are working to move beyond that. Facebook, for example, is exploring methods for optically reading brain activity from outside the skull. Such a system would shine light into the brain to directly read chemical changes.\u201cWhat if you could type directly from your brain?\u201d Regina Dugan of Facebook said this spring as she unveiled the company\u2019s efforts to build this kind of optical interface. \u201cIt sounds impossible, but it\u2019s closer than you may realize.\u201d In a few years, she said, Facebook hopes to have a system that allows people to type with their thoughts five times faster than they now type using a smartphone keyboard.That is well beyond the realm of current research, and a number of neuroscientists question whether it will ever be possible, arguing that such speed will only come with devices planted inside the skull.Several start-ups are now working to do just that. But some, including a Silicon Valley start-up called Paradromics, hope to do this as a way of treating people with medical conditions like blindness, deafness and paralysis.Implanting hardware in the brain is dangerous, but the reward for patients could outweigh the risks. For companies like Paradromics, the goal is to significantly refine and expand the current methods, providing a faster and more complete way for patients to operate machines with their thoughts.Mr. Musk\u2019s Neuralink is moving in a similar direction, but the company\u2019s ambitions appear to stretch much further, to eventually implanting chips in healthy people\u2019s brains.The dangers of brain surgery make this unlikely. But Mr. Boyden said there were some possibilities.\u201cI do find it implausible that an implant would go directly into the brain of someone with zero health problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if companies take the right approach in helping people with the greatest need, then there may be a way for this to spread into people with less severe conditions, and then eventually become a kind of brain augmentation.\u201dCertainly, many of these projects will be met with skepticism. And Silicon Valley\u2019s enthusiasm does not always mesh with the physical limitations of medicine and the human body.\u201cIn the physical sciences, there are physical boundaries,\u201d said Matt Angle, a neuroscientist and the founder of Paradromics. \u201cTo think that you\u2019ll be able to blow through fundamental laws by sheer ambition and enthusiasm is na\u00efve.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the company\u2019s troubles run deeper than Mr. Kalanick\u2019s flubs and scandals, and new leadership alone won\u2019t be able to right this distressed ship.If Mr. Khosrowshahi is to succeed, he\u2019ll have to do what his predecessor refused to do: confront the reality that Uber\u2019s business model simply doesn\u2019t work.These are troubling signs. Every start-up must one day fulfill the market\u2019s demand that it turn a profit, but Uber has never figured out how to do that. While ride sharing in some form will probably survive, it\u2019s more likely that without some drastic changes, Uber won\u2019t be around in three to five years.Mr. Khosrowshahi must avoid the mistakes of his predecessor by accepting that \u201cpivots\u201d (Silicon Valley-speak for the desperate changes troubled companies make to reassure their venture capitalist funders) are not the answer. None of the pivots Mr. Kalanick tried \u2014 like on-demand delivery of food and packages through UberEats and UberRush, packing in more passengers via UberPool, and expansions into China, India and Russia \u2014 improved the bottom line.Why? Because none introduced efficiencies or changed the basic underlying economics of the taxi industry, the way Amazon did with retail by getting rid of brick-and-mortar stores through online sales.Uber\u2019s only chance to survive at this point is to actually make its taxi business work. If he\u2019s to have any chance of doing that, Mr. Khosrowshahi will need to make major changes.First, he should parlay Uber\u2019s popularity among its users into a significant increase in fares.Third, he should find a way to repair Uber\u2019s poor relationship with its drivers, since the company will need them for a good while longer. One study found that only 4 percent of people who sign up to drive for Uber are still driving a year later. Uber burns through drivers as fast as it burns through its investors\u2019 cash.Fifth, he should shut down Uber\u2019s foreign operations everywhere except London, where it has had a degree of success.If Mr. Khosrowshahi follows this blueprint, the company has a chance of surviving. If not, Uber will burn through its remaining estimated $6.6 billion in cash and go out of business in three to five years, and he\u2019ll be its final chief executive.Steven Hill, a technology and economic journalist, is the author of \u201cRaw Deal: How the \u2018Uber Economy\u2019 and Runaway Capitalism Are Screwing American Workers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even Business Leaders Who Abandoned Trump\u2019s Councils May Not Stray Far", "Date": "2017-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWho\u2019s next?That\u2019s the question being not-so-quietly whispered around the business world these days. Will one of the former business leaders in President Trump\u2019s inner circle resign, following the disintegration of the president\u2019s various business councils last week? Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin? Gary Cohn, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser?The answer is, well, nobody is next, at least not yet.And despite all the hand-wringing, that may be the right answer.Last week\u2019s abandonment of President Trump by the leaders of America\u2019s largest corporations was a resounding signal to the country and the world that they won\u2019t tolerate anyone \u2014 even the president \u2014 coming to the defense of those who preach indefensible hate.But it is being misunderstood as the country searches for meaning amid the anguish over the events in Charlottesville, Va., leading to almost existential questions about the role of corporations as a new form of moral authority, filling a vacuum left by our political leaders.The resignation en masse was symbolic. Importantly symbolic. But nothing more.Lest anyone believe that the business world has collectively gotten up from the table and washed its hands of Washington and the Trump administration, think again.Companies will continue to advocate their positions, forcefully, in person and through lobbying groups. The only difference is that they won\u2019t be sitting in meetings described as \u201ccouncils\u201d with cameras and photo opportunities.The people in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have a much harder decision to make.On one hand, some of them have said they are privately disgusted with the president \u2014 not only over how he reacted to Charlottesville, but regarding all manner of items and issues. They could leave in defiance, and some would be applauded for doing so, perhaps even improving their own reputations.But they would be leaving the president, and the country, in a dire position.\u201cI believe that having highly talented men and women in our country surrounding the president in his administration should be reassuring to you and all the American people,\u201d he wrote in a response posted on Twitter.But here\u2019s the practical question: Say what you will about Mr. Mnuchin, but he at least has a legitimate r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of real experience. Given the chaos and infighting that has plagued this White House, do you think that there is a lengthy list of talented individuals with professional experience lining up for his job?Unlike the business \u201ccouncils,\u201d the roles in the administration that people like Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Cohn inhabit are more meaningful, even when they are not successful in swaying the president.In some ways, it was easy for the C.E.O.s to abandon the president \u2014 especially given the safety in numbers \u2014 because so many of them privately say they felt like props that enabled Mr. Trump to look like a businessman to voters who have no idea he was never one of them. On the flip side, Mr. Trump was a prop in the business leaders\u2019 plan to promote changes to regulatory rules and tax laws, and thus make their businesses more profitable.For all the credit that the C.E.O.s were given for their \u201ccourage\u201d in leaving the council, let\u2019s be honest: The one who deserves the most credit is Ken Frazier, the chief executive of Merck, who took the lead. The rest were followers. There are two others who haven\u2019t gotten a whiff of credit but should: Bob Iger, chief executive of Disney, and Elon Musk of Tesla, who left the councils long ago because they could not abide the president\u2019s decision to abandon the Paris climate accord.Still, while those executives and their peers may not be sitting in the Oval Office anytime soon, they won\u2019t be that far away.Ginni Rometty of IBM said so in her memo to employees: \u201cIBM will continue to work with all parts of the government for policies that support job growth, vocational education and global trade, as well as fair and informed policies on immigration and taxation.\u201dAnd the real estate mogul and Trump backer Tom Barrack made this case in a statement he made available to the media: \u201cThe president of the United States, now more than ever, needs to maintain contact with a qualified and diverse group of official and nonofficial advisers and experts on varied and distinct concepts. Business leaders and C.E.O.\u2019s are an essential silo of that group.\u201dHe added: \u201cTo abandon the input of constructive opinions from qualified, nonpolitical, individuals who are fortunate to be called upon by the president for advice is counterproductive to an objective of supplying him with a diverse, realistic and at times contrary pool of expert thought and advice.\u201dThe same case could be made for the people sitting with Mr. Trump in the White House.Perhaps the bigger question is whether Mr. Trump will tolerate so many members of his inner circle \u2014 including family members like his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner \u2014 seemingly portraying their roles as keeping the boss from hurting himself. After all, the president\u2018s favorite phrase \u2014 which he once tried to trademark \u2014 is \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That is where Aina, a modern Hawaiian restaurant whose brunch has spawned a citywide mania, opened last year in April in a small light-flooded corner space.Aina\u2019s chef, a tall 30-year-old man with a broad smile named Jordan Keao, grew up in the rural hinterlands of the Big Island of Hawaii. After a stint at the celebrated Bay Area restaurant La Folie, Mr. Keao labored in Silicon Valley, running the Hangout Cafe at Google for a time. But he missed the heady mash-up of the food on which he was raised and bristled at the ignorance in which his ancient culture was held.\u201cThe only thing anyone knew about Hawaiian culture out here,\u201d he said, \u201cwas pineapple and ham on a pizza.\u201dThus Aina was born. The name comes from a Hawaiian concept that conveys love of the land. Since the 38-seat restaurant is about 2,300 miles from the land he loves, for Mr. Keao that means a lot of air miles.Aina\u2019s menu is both international and uniquely Hawaiian. It courses with the often fractious history of the island. Influences include Portuguese (plump guava-stuffed doughnuts called malasadas), Japanese (bento boxes and furikake rice) and American (artisanal Spam from Stone Valley Farm).But there are plenty of native Hawaiian dishes, like pipikaula, a type of Hawaiian beef jerky here made with shoyu-cured short rib and accessorized with puffed paiai, or taro root. Even better-known dishes like poke are creatively tweaked: Aina\u2019s comes with limu (Hawaiian algae), inamona (a relish made of kukui nuts), fresh hearts of palm, smoked sesame oil, shiso and sea grass. (Mr. Keao is planning a tasting menu for later this summer.)\u201cI\u2019m here to challenge people about what they think they know about Hawaii,\u201d Mr. Keao said, \u201cand teach them about the land I love.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better, Safer Battery Could Be Coming to a Laptop Near You", "Date": "2017-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A start-up company is trying to turbocharge a type of battery that has been a mainstay for simple devices like flashlights and toys, but until now has been ignored as an energy source for computers and electric cars.Executives at Ionic Materials, in Woburn, Mass., plan to announce on Thursday a design breakthrough that could make solid-state alkaline batteries a viable alternative to lithium-ion and other high-energy storage technologies.Alkaline batteries can be made far more cheaply and safely than today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries, but they are not rechargeable. That issue, along with the superior power of lithium-ion batteries, has meant that alkaline batteries are not used in personal computers, smartphones or electric vehicles.Cheaper and more powerful batteries are also considered by many to be the driver needed to make the cost of renewable energy technologies like wind and solar competitive with the coal, gas and nuclear power that support the national energy grid.Ionic said it had developed prototypes of a rechargeable alkaline battery that can be made using continuous manufacturing processes similar to the making of plastic wrap. So far, the company, which is backed by William Joy, a pioneering Silicon Valley computer designer, has demonstrated up to 400 recharge cycles for its prototypes. Ionic executives say they believe they will be able to triple that.The alkaline batteries that Ionic has developed would initially be heavier than today\u2019s lithium-ion batteries, said Mike Zimmerman, a materials scientist who is the founder and chief executive of Ionic. But the new batteries would more than compensate for that handicap with their cost advantage and, in time, their ability to store more energy.There are other advantages besides cost and safety. Lithium-ion batteries rely on cobalt, and using that element comes with a human cost. Cobalt mines in Africa, for example, have been accused of using child labor while leaving behind a toxic mess.Alkaline batteries, on the other hand, use relatively abundant zinc and manganese. \u201cIonic can help us get lithium-ion past cobalt and completely eliminate it with alkaline,\u201d said Mr. Joy, who is a member of Ionic\u2019s board.He also said that the company had made progress toward an alkaline battery design that would replace zinc with more affordable aluminum. In the past, aluminum has not been usable because of issues like corrosion. Alkaline batteries based on aluminum would potentially weigh less than lithium-ion batteries and would be even cheaper to produce than today\u2019s alkaline designs.Ionic will make its announcement in Colorado at a conference for the 35th anniversary of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a sustainable-energy research group founded by the physicist and environmentalist Amory Lovins and Hunter Lovins, his former wife.\u201cThey started with a very sensible set of criteria,\u201d Dr. Lovins said of Ionic. \u201cThey use an unusual electrolyte to come up with a battery that uses common cheap materials and is benign.\u201dBut he added a note of caution: \u201cBatteries are very difficult and I want to see what they have and what can be measured and proven and whether it will get to market.\u201dTechnological progress in battery technology has been glacial compared with the exponential advances in processing speed and data storage capacity that have been staples of Silicon Valley\u2019s growth. In the last 150 years, only a handful of rechargeable battery chemistries have reached mass adoption.Tesla, in partnership with Panasonic, is building a factory in Nevada with the intent of greatly expanding capacity to make lithium-ion batteries and lower production costs. Tesla officials said they wanted to create enough capacity to produce batteries for 1.5 million cars a year.There is growing interest in pursuing such so-called solid-state battery technologies for both consumer and transportation applications. Last fall, the United States Department of Energy\u2019s agency for supporting research in next-generation energy technology announced 16 research awards aimed at accelerating development of solid battery technologies, including a $3 million contract to Ionic Materials. The company said it had signed several licensing deals to produce commercial versions of its design, but it would not identify its partners.The United States Advanced Battery Consortium, an auto industry group, wants to greatly reduce the cost of lithium-ion production. Analysts, however, say they believe the new facilities and technology from auto and battery manufacturers will help bring costs down, but still fall short of industry goals.In contrast, Ionic executives said they had found a way to achieve energy production costs that would be less than a fifth of the auto consortium\u2019s target.Bloomberg New Energy Finance, an energy research group, has forecast that mass-market adoption of electric vehicles will not occur until operating costs fall to match those of internal combustion engines. That is expected to happen in 2025, according to the group.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teaching A.I. Systems to Behave Themselves", "Date": "2017-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySitting inside OpenAI\u2019s San Francisco offices on a recent afternoon, the researcher Dario Amodei showed off an autonomous system that taught itself to play Coast Runners, an old boat-racing video game. The winner is the boat with the most points that also crosses the finish line.The result was surprising: The boat was far too interested in the little green widgets that popped up on the screen. Catching these widgets meant scoring points. Rather than trying to finish the race, the boat went point-crazy. It drove in endless circles, colliding with other vessels, skidding into stone walls and repeatedly catching fire.That\u2019s a concern as these techniques move into online services, security devices and robotics. Now, a small community of A.I. researchers, including Mr. Amodei, is beginning to explore mathematical techniques that aim to keep the worst from happening.At OpenAI, Mr. Amodei and his colleague Paul Christiano are developing algorithms that can not only learn tasks through hours of trial and error, but also receive regular guidance from human teachers along the way.With a few clicks here and there, the researchers now have a way of showing the autonomous system that it needs to win points in Coast Runners while also moving toward the finish line. They believe that these kinds of algorithms \u2014 a blend of human and machine instruction \u2014 can help keep automated systems safe.For years, Mr. Musk, along with other pundits, philosophers and technologists, have warned that machines could spin outside our control and somehow learn malicious behavior their designers didn\u2019t anticipate. At times, these warnings have seemed overblown, given that today\u2019s autonomous car systems can even get tripped up by the most basic tasks, like recognizing a bike lane or a red light.But researchers like Mr. Amodei are trying to get ahead of the risks. In some ways, what these scientists are doing is a bit like a parent teaching a child right from wrong.Many specialists in the A.I. field believe a technique called reinforcement learning \u2014 a way for machines to learn specific tasks through extreme trial and error \u2014 could be a primary path to artificial intelligence. Researchers specify a particular reward the machine should strive for, and as it navigates a task at random, the machine keeps close track of what brings the reward and what doesn\u2019t. When OpenAI trained its bot to play Coast Runners, the reward was more points.This video game training has real-world implications.If a machine can learn to navigate a racing game like Grand Theft Auto, researchers believe, it can learn to drive a real car. If it can learn to use a web browser and other common software apps, it can learn to understand natural language and maybe even carry on a conversation. At places like Google and the University of California, Berkeley, robots have already used the technique to learn simple tasks like picking things up or opening a door.All this is why Mr. Amodei and Mr. Christiano are working to build reinforcement learning algorithms that accept human guidance along the way. This can ensure systems don\u2019t stray from the task at hand.The field is small, but it is growing. As OpenAI and DeepMind build teams dedicated to A.I. safety, so too is Google\u2019s stateside lab, Google Brain. Meanwhile, researchers at universities like the U.C. Berkeley and Stanford University are working on similar problems, often in collaboration with the big corporate labs.In some cases, researchers are working to ensure that systems don\u2019t make mistakes on their own, as the Coast Runners boat did. They\u2019re also working to ensure that hackers and other bad actors can\u2019t exploit hidden holes in these systems. Researchers like Google\u2019s Ian Goodfellow, for example, are exploring ways that hackers could fool A.I. systems into seeing things that aren\u2019t there.That becomes problematic when neural networks are used in security cameras. Simply by making a few marks on your face, the researchers said, you could fool a camera into believing you\u2019re someone else.\u201cIf you train an object-recognition system on a million images labeled by humans, you can still create new images where a human and the machine disagree 100 percent of the time,\u201d Mr. Goodfellow said. \u201cWe need to understand that phenomenon.\u201dAnother big worry is that A.I. systems will learn to prevent humans from turning them off. If the machine is designed to chase a reward, the thinking goes, it may find that it can chase that reward only if it stays on. This oft-described threat is much further off, but researchers are already working to address it.Mr. Hadfield-Menell and others at U.C. Berkeley recently published a paper that takes a mathematical approach to the problem. A machine will seek to preserve its off switch, they showed, if it is specifically designed to be uncertain about its reward function. This gives it an incentive to accept or even seek out human oversight.Much of this work is still theoretical. But given the rapid progress of A.I. techniques and their growing importance across so many industries, researchers believe that starting early is the best policy.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around exactly how rapid progress in A.I. is going to be,\u201d said Shane Legg, who oversees the A.I. safety work at DeepMind. \u201cThe responsible approach is to try to understand different ways in which these technologies can be misused, different ways they can fail and different ways of dealing with these issues.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article identified the three people in the picture in the wrong order.

{"Headline": "Fiat Chrysler Is at a Crossroads. It\u2019s Looking to China for a Solution.", "Date": "2017-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The event scheduled for Thursday at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Illinois assembly plant was supposed to shine a light on what the company does best: build high-margin Jeep sport utility vehicles.Then, for a second time in two months, Fiat Chrysler abruptly called off the official celebration of the plant being retooled to turn out Jeep Cherokees, where the chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, was to have taken center stage.Bigger things are on the horizon for Jeep and Fiat Chrysler, however \u2014 including a possible breakup of the company.For months, according to two company officials, Fiat Chrysler has been in discussions with a number of Chinese companies about potential equity investments or other deals involving its Ram pickup division and the Jeep brand. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks have not been publicly disclosed.As early as last year, Fiat Chrysler sent a team specializing in mergers and acquisitions to China, according to the officials, who added that discussions were continuing with various companies. The officials said an investment or partnership involving a Chinese automaker could be a prelude to a larger agreement.A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman declined on Tuesday to comment on those accounts.One Chinese company, Great Wall Motor, emerged publicly this week as an eager suitor for Jeep, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s fastest-growing and most profitable unit.\u201cThere is nobody saying there\u2019s no way we would sell the Jeep brand,\u201d said Thomas W. LaSorda, the former chief executive at Chrysler who helped engineer its merger with Fiat. \u201cThat sends a message to boardrooms around the world.\u201dThe Great Wall overture sent Fiat Chrysler\u2019s shares up almost 7 percent in New York trading on Monday, to their highest point in more than two years.The Italian-American automaker began to take shape after the bankruptcy and government bailout of the former Chrysler. Mr. Marchionne was showered with credit for blending the companies. But for most of the past two years, Fiat Chrysler has been openly seeking a merger partner to survive as a long-term player in the global auto industry. Several major automakers, including General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen, have disavowed interest.Mr. Marchionne has been unavailable for comment on potential deals. The twice-canceled factory event in Belvidere, Ill., would have been his first public appearance in the United States since the Detroit auto show in January. (Scheduling conflicts were cited for both cancellations.)Known for his outspoken views on hot-button issues like the potential of electric vehicles and the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Marchionne has been uncharacteristically cryptic in his recent comments about the possibility of selling off Fiat Chrysler in pieces.\u201cWe have an obligation to purify that portfolio,\u201d Mr. Marchionne said last month during an earnings call with analysts, referring to whether the company was considering divesting business units.Asked whether the European brands Maserati and Alfa Romeo might be sold, Mr. Marchionne said he would \u201creserve judgment\u201d on that possibility, then cut off further questions.Industry analysts believe Fiat Chrysler is in a weak business position compared with much larger rivals like Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors.The bulk of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s global profits are generated by Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups sold in the American market, and the company has lagged far behind competitors in pursuing advanced technology for autonomous and electrified vehicles.Sales of its passenger cars, like Chrysler and Dodge vehicles in the United States and Fiat models in Europe, have struggled mightily in a market shifting away from traditional sedans.To compensate, Fiat Chrysler is rapidly converting its American production facilities, including the Belvidere plant, from building cars to making Jeeps and pickups. By the end of 2017, all six of its assembly plants in the United States will be devoted to S.U.V.s and trucks. Plants in Mexico and Canada still produce the passenger cars the company sells here.It is almost unprecedented for a large automaker to abandon entire segments like compact cars, and the move has been challenging for dealers who have to adjust to smaller lineups in their showrooms.\u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d said Brett Saslow, who owns a Fiat Chrysler dealership in St. James, N.Y., on Long Island. \u201cCar sales are down but they\u2019re not going away. It\u2019s still a big segment, so it would be nice to at least have some representation there.\u201dThe increased emphasis on trucks and S.U.V.s has only fed speculation that the company is beefing up its most attractive assets for sale.Giuseppe Berta, an economic-history professor at Bocconi University in Milan and a longtime consultant on Fiat\u2019s historical archives, said that Mr. Elkann might be pushing for a larger deal before Mr. Marchionne\u2019s expected retirement next year.\u201cWhat we see now is a strong desire by the ownership to sell F.C.A.,\u201d Mr. Berta said. \u201cI think there is only one chance, and that is to break the company up.\u201dMr. Berta said the uneven performance of business units at the company made it difficult to sell as a whole, and that the initial merger of Fiat and Chrysler was ill equipped to stand the test of time.\u201cSince the beginning, there has been limited capacity to invest in the business,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been no plans for autonomous cars or electric cars, and two years ago Mr. Marchionne said that the car sector in general was consuming too much capital.\u201dIndustry analysts also question whether the company has the financial capacity to compete in the emerging era of self-driving vehicles.Fiat Chrysler said recently that it would join a partnership with the German automaker BMW to develop such technology, but that hardly ensures it will be able to keep up with automakers like G.M. or Silicon Valley competitors like Tesla and Google.One analyst, Kristin Dziczek from the Center for Automotive Research, said the company had significant debt that could hamper its ability to spend money on new technology and models. \u201cThat does not bode well for investing in future product,\u201d she said.The possibility of selling Jeep to a Chinese buyer could be problematic. Any deal would probably be subject to government review in China and in the United States. And Fiat Chrysler would have trouble replacing the profits and market share generated by its prized S.U.V. division.Mr. Marchionne cautioned in the recent earnings call that the company could not simply sell off its choicest parts to the highest bidder.\u201cWe do have to worry about the stump that\u2019s left behind,\u201d he said. Otherwise, he added, Fiat Chrysler will \u201cend up with a suboptimal business that cannot run.\u201dMr. LaSorda thinks the recent expression of interest by Great Wall will ignite enthusiasm among other automakers. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a major company that wouldn\u2019t want Jeep,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, what is the cost to get it?\u201dThe prospect of a breakup or sale comes at a particularly difficult time for Fiat Chrysler.In the United States market, it is suffering from slowing consumer demand and a Jeep lineup stocked with older models. In the first seven months of the year, its sales fell more than 7 percent, and those of the Jeep unit declined more than 12 percent. Worldwide, Fiat Chrysler said, Jeep is still growing, thanks to rising sales in China and elsewhere, although it does not break out global sales by brand.But controversy and crisis have touched the former Chrysler for decades, dating back to the federal government\u2019s loan guarantees to keep the company operating in the late 1970s.Since then Chrysler has been sold three times: first in 1998 to German automaker Daimler-Benz, and later to the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management and then to Fiat.Mr. LaSorda traveled the world in 2007 as Chrysler\u2019s vice chairman looking for a partner to save the automaker from extinction. While the company ultimately joined up with Fiat, one of the sales calls was with Great Wall. \u201cThey always had an interest in getting into the U.S. market,\u201d he said.Bill Vlasic reported from Detroit and Neal E. Boudette from Ann Arbor, Mich.Advertisement"}

But what too few tourists learn is this: The massive dome of Mount Rainier \u2014 arguably the showiest of Washington State\u2019s majestic Cascades \u2014 is best beheld not from Puget Sound but from the high desert east of the mountains. There, from points up and down the Yakima Valley, Rainier and its sister summit, Mount Adams, loom like giant snow cones above swaths of irrigated farmland and sagebrush-covered range.Napa it is not. Loamy soil, prodigious snowmelt and lots of sunshine sustain a richly diverse agriculture whose color and character seem more aligned with parts of the Midwest than the \u201cLeft Coast.\u201d Roughly 75 percent of the nation\u2019s hops are grown here, and the loopy architecture of hop yards \u2014 a giant cat\u2019s cradle of stilts and strings \u2014 is a common sight.

At a lawn party to mark the release of their first merlot, we ate sweet native shrimp that my brother had netted in Puget Sound; tender asparagus from a nearby farm stand (locals will not eat asparagus unless it is picked that day); and little lamb chops, grilled to perfection by a friend whose Spanish ancestors ran sheep in Eastern Washington in the early 1900s. I have been returning as often as I can ever since.Last fall I volunteered to help out with the chardonnay crush and took a couple of afternoons off to visit five wineries of different shapes and sizes. At every stop, tasting-room workers were eager to share what they knew, without pretense; you can learn a lot about wine in these parts without being made to feel like a rube.Heading back down the valley, with late light touching acre upon acre of cropland, I thought of how very Western this particular part of the West was, in its ruggedness and enterprise and prosperity. I wished I had more time to explore the many farm towns and side roads, to play tourist, so to speak. But another block of chardonnay would be picked at dawn and delivered to the winery, where we would work long hours sorting stems and leaves from ripe fruit and hosing down equipment, then eat late and fall into bed, lulled to sleep by the rumble of trucks and trains.Advertisement"}

Sure enough, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Frazier on Twitter less than an hour later.There was a mass exodus of executives from presidential advisory councils as they opposed stances taken by President Trump.\u201cNow that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President\u2019s Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!\u201d he wrote.The president continued to criticize the drugmaker later in the day, writing on Twitter: \u201c.@Merck Pharma is a leader in higher & higher drug prices while at the same time taking jobs out of the U.S. Bring jobs back & LOWER PRICES!\u201dFor most of the day, even as Mr. Trump took aim at Mr. Frazier, dozens of other chief executives who have agreed to advise the president remained silent. None aside from Mr. Frazier criticized the president\u2019s initial response to the ugly episode, in which a woman was killed. And none came to Mr. Frazier\u2019s defense after the president attacked him on Twitter.The muted response was a reminder that although big companies are increasingly willing to take public stands on many contentious social issues, they also covet their access to a business-friendly White House and are being careful not to jeopardize their relationship with the president.\u201cI\u2019m sure that corporate leaders feel some reticence to speak out because they\u2019re afraid of being attacked by the president by name,\u201d said Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.It was only late on Monday that other C.E.O.s followed Mr. Frazier\u2019s lead. Mr. Plank was first. Hours later, Mr. Krzanich issued his statement.\u201cI resigned to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues, including the serious need to address the decline of American manufacturing,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said.Merck did not respond to either of the president\u2019s Twitter posts and declined to make Mr. Frazier available for an interview, but within the company, he appeared to have the support of his board.\u201cAny time someone stands up and does something brave, rather than wimping out, sure, there is a risk,\u201d said Thomas R. Cech, a Merck board member who was among those that Mr. Frazier contacted Sunday night. \u201cYou put your name and your company\u2019s name in the spotlight, and people who don\u2019t like what you did can find ways to try to retaliate.\u201dLeslie A. Brun, another board member, said Mr. Frazier had emailed him on Sunday to seek his input before making his decision. Mr. Brun said he was supportive, and that he felt Mr. Frazier\u2019s background, in some part, informed the action he chose to take.\u201cAs you can imagine, as the only African-American in that position, on that council, you can\u2019t take yourself out of your own personal context,\u201d Mr. Brun said. \u201cAs a consequence, Ken had a very strong reaction to what he saw as a failure of leadership.\u201dAs for Mr. Trump\u2019s reaction, Mr. Brun added, \u201cI thought the pettiness of the president\u2019s response, on a personal level, is indicative of how far we\u2019ve sunk.\u201dOver the course of the day, several top executives made statements denouncing racism and bigotry generally, although few went as far as Mr. Frazier, Mr. Plank or Mr. Krzanich.\u201cBigotry, hatred and extremism are an affront to core American values and have no place in this country,\u201d said Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group and one of the president\u2019s closest advisers in the business community. \u201cI am deeply saddened and troubled by the tragic events in Charlottesville.\u201dDell Technologies said that its chief executive, Michael Dell, would remain on the White House manufacturing advisory council. And General Electric said in a statement that it had \u201cno tolerance for hate, bigotry or racism\u201d while adding that Jeff Immelt, the company\u2019s chairman and recently retired chief executive, would also continue to advise the president.The president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, went further than most, suggesting that Mr. Trump\u2019s initial comments about the violence in Charlottesville were giving him pause.\u201cWe are aware of the decisions by other members of the President\u2019s Manufacturing Council, which has yet to hold any real meeting, and are assessing our role,\u201d Mr. Trumka said in a statement. But he, too, stopped short of stepping down or endorsing the actions of Mr. Frazier.Mr. Frazier, 62, grew up in a poor neighborhood in North Philadelphia, the son of a man who instilled in his children a sense of ambition.Mr. Frazier attended Harvard Law School and then went to work for a Philadelphia law firm. His most rewarding legal victory, he has said, involved the case of James Willie Cochran, a black death row inmate in Alabama who had been convicted of killing a white store manager.Mr. Frazier and his colleagues determined that Mr. Cochran, who was known as Bo, had been convicted on shoddy evidence. After a yearslong legal battle, they secured him a new trial. He was acquitted in 1997.In a 2004 article Mr. Frazier wrote about the case for The University of Toledo Law Review, he said race had clearly played a role in Mr. Cochran\u2019s conviction.P. Roy Vagelos, a former chief executive of Merck, recruited Mr. Frazier to join the company and said he had made the right decision by acting on his conscience.\u201cHe is always smart, always ethical and repeatedly makes the right decisions,\u201d Dr. Vagelos said in a statement provided by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron, where Dr. Vagelos serves as chairman. \u201cI applaud his decision to step down from the council this morning.\u201dMr. Frazier, Mr. Plank and Mr. Krzanich are not the first chief executives to walk away from one of the president\u2019s advisory groups.\u201cI don\u2019t think when corporate leaders sat on councils and commissions in the Bush or Obama administration, that they were in some way worried that their public reputations were affected by that service, one way or the other,\u201d said Mr. Strain of the American Enterprise Institute.But, he added, in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s initial reluctance to condemn the white nationalists in Charlottesville, it was understandable that a top executive like Mr. Frazier might feel the need to distance himself from the president.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me,\u201d Mr. Strain said, \u201cthat we saw a corporate leader say, \u2018I know what happened over the weekend had nothing to do with manufacturing or pharmaceuticals, but I don\u2019t want to be associated with it in any way.\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article rendered incorrectly part of a statement from Merck.

{"Headline": "Dutch Utility Bets Its Future on an Unusual Strategy: Selling Less Power", "Date": "2017-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMSTERDAM \u2014 When Eneco, a major Dutch utility, tested a promising energy monitor in several dozen homes, things could not have gone much worse. The company making the devices failed to deliver enough of them, and some of those provided did not work.But when Eneco sent workers to recover the monitors, something strange happened \u2014 a tenth of customers refused to open their doors. \u201cThey wanted to keep it,\u201d said Tako in \u2019t Veld, a former Eneco executive who now leads the \u201csmart energy\u201d unit at Quby, the company that makes the energy meter. \u201cThey were so happy with the energy insight.\u201d\u201cWe said \u2018we have to create an increasing customer loyalty by doing something different,\u2019\u201d said Hans Valk, chief executive of Quby and formerly the leader of Eneco\u2019s consumer business. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is switch from selling a pure commodity to selling energy as a service.\u201dFor instance, Eneco owns Jedlix, an electric vehicle charging unit, which has partnerships with Tesla and BMW and allows car owners to recharge their vehicles inexpensively when there are large supplies of renewable energy on the grid. Jedlix sometimes even pays them to do so.Eneco is also starting a business called CrowdNett which, unusually, pays customers for some of their power. Eneco looks for people who already have solar panels at home and tries to sell them a large home battery, like a Tesla Powerwall. Surplus power generated by the solar panels is stored in the battery and Eneco taps into a portion of that storage to help balance the electricity grid. Customers will receive 450 euros, or $530, a year for allowing use of their batteries.Eneco\u2019s leaders concede that they are proceeding more by trial and error than following a grand plan. Still, these efforts may, over time, aid the company\u2019s survival and contribute to creating ways to help consumers shift to cleaner energy.\u201cThey are very forward-looking in terms of strategy and mind-set,\u201d said Roberta Bigliani, a vice president at IDC, a market research firm. If Eneco\u2019s experiments flop, though, \u201cthey definitely will not be in operation in the future,\u201d she said.So far, the experiment with its wall-mounted energy monitor, known as Toon, has been among its more successful.When Eneco first considered the test, the utility was locked in a profit-zapping battle with competitors, cutting prices for electric power and natural gas while giving customers gifts for signing up. Seeing the danger signs, Eneco\u2019s management decided that a radical change was necessary.The Toon offered Eneco an opportunity to shift course and, despite early teething problems, Eneco expanded the rollout. The meters allow customers to control their domestic heating settings through a smartphone app, and they have displays that show electricity and natural gas consumption in detail, along with other information like weather forecasts.Much as telephone companies offer discounted devices with longer-term contracts, the Toon typically comes as part of a utility contract; Eneco customers pay \u20ac3.50 a month for the meter. In return, customers say it helps them save energy, offering the dual benefits of saving money and cutting the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for climate change.Quby says it has placed more than 300,000 Toons in Dutch homes and has deals to supply the devices to other utilities, like Engie in Belgium and Viesgo in Spain.In his home north of Amsterdam, Marco Westenbrink has a Toon on his living room wall. \u201cIt is always there like it\u2019s my big brother, and it is always staring at me,\u201d the graphic designer said in an interview in his garden, overlooking a canal. \u201cYou can call it annoying, but it makes you completely aware.\u201dMr. Westenbrink, who lives with his wife in a cozy, century-old house in Krommenie, estimates that the Toon has helped them cut their annual energy bills by nearly a third, to about \u20ac2,000.His wife, Karin Krol, says the Toon is also helping their family battle climate change. \u201cWe believe that small things can change the environment,\u201d she said.Those who sign up for the Toon cut their average annual energy consumption by around a tenth, according to Quby. Lower energy consumption would not necessarily seem to be in Eneco\u2019s interests, but it figures that any loss in revenue will be more than offset by growth in its services business. (The company does not provide details on its services unit in its public filings.)Already, through Toons, Eneco can monitor the performance of natural gas boilers and solar panels and can send repair people when equipment needs servicing. And, as Mr. Valk, the Quby chief, had hoped, the devices have helped reduce the number of customers who leave Eneco for other providers by 60 percent, the company says.Mr. Valk envisions a future where customers pay for various services, rather than kilowatts of energy. Unlike today\u2019s dominant sources of electricity, wind and solar power are essentially free once equipment is installed. So, \u201cyou are going to pay for flexibility, not for the \u2018neutrons,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valk said.Eneco has also invested heavily in wind power, in part so that it can assure environmentally minded customers that their power comes from cleaner sources. That has paid dividends: The company has a 10-year contract to supply Google with clean energy for an electricity-hungry data storage center that opened last year in Eemshaven, in the north of the Netherlands.Much of Eneco\u2019s strategy is in its infancy. CrowdNett, the battery storage service, has only a few dozen clients, but the utility has big ambitions for the initiative. If enough battery owners sign on, Eneco says, it can use software to electronically aggregate and sell the power, like a conventional utility.Daan Berkouwer, who works for a water management company, said the combination of financial incentives and the promise of cutting emissions helped him decide to buy a lozenge-shape Tesla Powerwall battery to use with CrowdNett.\u201cWhen everybody is doing this, then the oil companies can quit with their production,\u201d said the 27-year-old Mr. Berkouwer, who lives with his wife on the outskirts of Gouda, the town famous for its cheese. \u201cWhy take out all the oil and demolish the planet if you can do it with clean energy?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Frazier, the head of Merck Pharmaceuticals and one of the country\u2019s top African-American executives.Mr. Frazier announced Monday morning that he was resigning from the American Manufacturing Council \u2014 the first of three chief executives who quit the advisory panel on Monday \u2014 to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s initial equivocal statements on Charlottesville.Shortly before leaving the capital, Mr. Trump attacked the news media for blowing the episode out of proportion.\u201cMade additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!\u201d he wrote Monday evening.\u201cTrump faced a fork in the road today, and he took it,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the House minority leader. \u201cHe showed cowardice on Saturday by refusing to call out the racists and neo-Nazis, and on Monday he showed how uncomfortable he was in delivering another kind of message.\u201dEven Mr. Trump\u2019s allies worried that his measured remarks, delivered two days after dozens of public figures issued more forceful denunciations of the violence in Virginia, came too late to reverse the self-inflicted damage on his moral standing as president.Even after a wave of disapproval that included a majority of Senate Republicans \u2014 and stronger statements delivered by allies, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump seemed reluctant to tackle the issue head-on when he appeared Monday before the cameras.\u201cTo anyone who acted criminally in this weekend\u2019s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who had just concluded a meeting with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director.Mr. Trump has had a career-long pattern of delaying and muting his criticism of white nationalism. During the 2016 presidential campaign, he refused to immediately denounce David Duke, a former Klansman who supported his candidacy.Some human rights activists, skeptical that Mr. Trump\u2019s latest remarks on the issue represented a change of heart, called on him to fire so-called nationalists \u2014 a group of hard-right populists led by Stephen K. Bannon, the White House chief strategist \u2014 working in the West Wing.\u201cThe president should make sure that no one on his staff has ties to white supremacists,\u201d Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive officer of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a telephone briefing on Monday afternoon. He added, \u201cNor should they be on the payroll of the American people.\u201dHe said that the Justice Department and the Office of Government Ethics should \u201cdo an investigation and make that determination\u201d to see if anyone in the White House has had links to hate groups.Mr. Trump and his staff have consistently denied any connection to such organizations, and the president called for racial harmony in his remarks on Monday.\u201cAs I have said many times before, no matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry and violence.\u201dFar-right leaders, including Richard B. Spencer, who attended the Charlottesville rally, said they did not take the president\u2019s remarks seriously.\u201cThe statement today was more \u2018kumbaya\u2019 nonsense,\u201d Mr. Spencer told reporters on Monday. \u201cHe sounded like a Sunday school teacher.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that Donald Trump is a dumb person, and only a dumb person would take those lines seriously,\u201d Mr. Spencer said.As Mr. Trump was delivering the kind of statement his critics had demanded over the weekend, Fox News reported that the president was considering pardoning Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Ariz., a political ally who has been accused of federal civil rights violations for allegedly mistreating prisoners, many of them black and Hispanic.The timing of the interview was especially striking, given that it came at the height of the controversy over his tepid remarks about Charlottesville.\u201cI am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,\u201d the president said in the interview on Sunday, speaking from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. \u201cHe has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He\u2019s a great American patriot, and I hate to see what has happened to him.\u201dTwo themes \u2014 uniting the country while defending himself \u2014 collided on Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed earlier on Monday.It is not unusual for Mr. Trump to attack, via Twitter, any public figure who ridicules, criticizes or even mildly questions his actions. But his decision to take on Mr. Frazier, a self-made multimillionaire who rose from a modest childhood in Philadelphia to attend Harvard Law School, was extraordinary given the wide-ranging criticism the president faced from both parties for not forcefully denouncing the neo-Nazis and Klan sympathizers who rampaged in Charlottesville.Mr. Frazier\u2019s exit from the business council marks a mini-exodus of business leaders from presidential advisory panels as a result of Mr. Trump\u2019s stances on social issues and the environment. His recent decision to leave the Paris climate accord prompted Elon Musk of Tesla to resign, as did the chief executive of Disney, Bob Iger.Additionally, the chief executives of the athletic clothing line Under Armour and of Intel announced they too would step down from the American Manufacturing Council \u2014 the same panel from which Mr. Frazier resigned.Kevin Plank, the head of Under Armour, said he was resigning to focus on \u201cthe power of sport which promotes unity, diversity and inclusion.\u201dIntel chief executive Brian Krzanich said he would be willing to serve in the government again when \u201cthose who have stood up for equality\u201d are honored. \u201cI resigned because I want to make progress, while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them,\u201d Mr. Krzanich said in a statement.Mr. Trump\u2019s shot at Mr. Frazier, one of the country\u2019s best-known black executives, prompted an immediate outpouring of support for the Merck chief executive from major figures in business, media and politics.Last month, Mr. Frazier appeared next to Mr. Trump at the White House to announce an agreement among drug makers that would create 1,000 jobs.He is only the second African-American executive to lead a major pharmaceutical firm, and rose to prominence as Merck\u2019s general counsel when he successfully defended the company against class-action lawsuits stemming from complications involving the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx.An earlier version of this article misquoted part of President Trump\u2019s statement on the violence in Charlottesville, Va. He blamed \u201cmany sides,\u201d not \u201call sides,\u201d for the violence that left one woman dead.Laurie Goodstein and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toyota to Take 5 Percent Stake in Mazda and Build Joint U.S. Plant", "Date": "2017-08-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Toyota said on Friday that it was taking a 5 percent stake in Mazda, another Japanese automaker, and that the companies would jointly build an assembly plant in the United States and would pool resources on new technologies.The factory\u2019s location has not been decided, but Toyota and Mazda said they hoped the first vehicles would roll off its production lines in 2021. The plant is expected to cost $1.6 billion and to employ about 4,000 workers, they said.Akio Toyoda, chief executive of Toyota, said in January that the carmaker would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years. Although plans for that spending predated the election of President Trump, the timing of the announcement was widely seen as a response to Mr. Trump\u2019s vows to promote American manufacturing, pushing back against countries like Japan that have large trade surpluses with the United States.The announcement by Toyota and Mazda earned a congratulatory tweet from the president early Friday. \u201cToyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!\u201d he wrote. Seven months earlier he had warned Toyota in a tweet that moving operations to Mexico could result in a \u201cbig border tax.\u201dThe alliance between Toyota and Mazda represents a small but significant step in the consolidation of the Japanese car industry, where a half-dozen producers compete for customers and capital. Toyota and Mazda said they planned to pursue joint development of electric vehicles and safety technology.In an era of soaring development costs and unsettling technological shifts \u2014 especially the emergence of battery-powered and self-driving cars \u2014 many smaller producers fear they lack the resources required to keep up. Even Toyota, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of vehicles, with an output of 10 million units a year, has been accused by some critics of falling behind in research and development.\u201cIn the future, mobility won\u2019t belong only to carmakers,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said at a news conference announcing the Mazda stake, noting that Silicon Valley was increasingly turning its gaze to the auto industry, looking to disrupt areas including design, manufacturing and retail distribution.\u201cTotally new players like Google and Amazon are right before our eyes,\u201d Mr. Toyoda said. \u201cWe need to cooperate and compete with them.\u201dJapan\u2019s smaller carmakers have sought partnerships with larger producers before. Ford Motor long had a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki, before the American partners withdrew.Toyota has been extending its reach, as well.Toyota and Mazda have been cooperating since 2010, when Toyota agreed to license its gasoline-electric hybrid-drive system to Mazda. The companies said in 2015 that they were exploring ways to expand their partnership.With the Prius and other hybrids, Toyota has dominated the market for lower-emissions vehicles for years. But as fully battery-powered cars gain favor with regulators and consumers, the company faces new challenges \u2014 both from traditional competitors and new players like Tesla.Mazda is known for making powerful and fuel-efficient internal combustion engines, but it lacks its own electric alternatives. Its sporty image and widely praised designs could appeal to Toyota: Mr. Toyoda has repeatedly spoken of his desire to give his company\u2019s products more flair.Mazda said it planned to issue new shares to Toyota worth 50 billion yen, or about $450 million, which would give Toyota a 5.05 percent ownership stake in Mazda. In return, Toyota plans to transfer some of its shares to Mazda. The stock would be worth an equivalent amount in cash, but because Toyota is much larger than Mazda, Mazda\u2019s stake in Toyota would work out to 0.25 percent.Some of the states where Toyota is currently located would love to be the home of this newest expansion.\u201cAs Toyota embarks on its joint venture with Mazda, we stand ready to grow our existing partnership and strengthen Mississippi\u2019s standing as a global leader in automotive manufacturing,\u201d said Phil Bryant, the governor of Mississippi, where the company employs more than 2,000 workers.Michigan, where Mazda produced cars before exiting in 2012, also boasted of what it could offer. \u201cAny manufacturer looking to locate a plant in the United States will likely be taking a good look at Michigan,\u201d Gov. Rick Snyder said. \u201cWe are a national leader for mobility and automotive R&D, as well as providing an exceptionally skilled manufacturing workforce and an outstanding business environment.\u201dAnd a spokesman for Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said: \u201cToyota Motor Corporation has made significant investments in Texas \u2014 just recently opening their new North American headquarters \u2014 and we are very proud of the work they are doing in the Lone Star State. We will continue to work with Toyota to ensure Texas provides the business environment they need to succeed in the marketplace.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the worth of shares Mazda plans to issue to Toyota. It is about $450 million, not $450 billion.Because of an editing error, an earlier verison of this article misstated the terms of two past partnerships between Japanese and American automakers. Ford owned a minority stake in Mazda, as did General Motors in Suzuki; neither American automaker fully owned its Japanese partner.Jonathan Soble reported from Tokyo, and Patricia Cohen from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teamsters Union Tries to Slow Self-Driving Truck Push", "Date": "2017-08-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe Teamsters are throwing a wrench into the works of the self-driving movement.The union has persuaded United States lawmakers to exempt commercial trucks from a bill allowing more autonomous vehicles on the roads. Granted, 3.5 million jobs are at stake. But as Tesla Motors joins Daimler A.G. and others in the big-rig tech race, it\u2019d be smarter to prepare haulers for a career shift.Congress is expected to tackle the first federal legislation on self-driving vehicles in September after it returns from summer recess. The bipartisan plan raises the cap on permitted vehicles that don\u2019t have common features such as a steering wheel, or meet certain safety requirements, to 100,000 a year from the current limit of 2,500.The Teamsters successfully lobbied to exclude vehicles over 10,000 pounds. Yet the technology is rapidly advancing. Daimler was testing a self-driving rig on Nevada\u2019s roads in 2015. Last year, Otto, a start-up now owned by Uber, made one of the first known deliveries by an autonomous truck \u2014 50,000 cans of beer. This week, Reuters reported that Tesla was developing an electric, driverless semi-truck. Alphabet\u2019s Waymo is making similar moves.The union has opposed other policy pushes, such as states wanting to allow companies to use what is known as platooning technology. This would digitally connect a group of trucks so they drive in a gas-saving formation. It is seen as a precursor to autonomous trucks, and Arkansas, Tennessee and South Carolina are among the states considering such a move.Fast adoption of such technology is in the industry\u2019s and economy\u2019s interest, too. Commercial trucking plays a key role in the American economy, delivering about 70 percent of goods. The industry generates more than $700 billion a year in revenue. Yet the average age of truckers is 49, and a worker shortage is projected to rise to 240,000 drivers by 2022, according to the American Trucking Associations.Perhaps the Teamsters are trying to ensure these older workers can reach retirement age without fear of being dumped by the side of the road. But the advent of masses of autonomous vehicles of any stripe is at least a decade away. Even then, human drivers may still be in demand for short-haul trips. And younger truckers will need retraining before autonomy fully kicks in.Gearing workers up for this inevitability is a better labor strategy than obstructionism.Advertisement"}
