It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.With even a quick peek beyond his bubble, the president could learn much about the legions of government employees and contractors who spent the holiday season agonizing over how to cover their next mortgage payment or electric bill or trip to the grocery store if this political charade drags on much longer.Last Thursday, the Office of Personnel Management tweeted a link to \u201csample letters\u201d that workers could use in negotiating payment plans with creditors. This is not a new practice; similar templates were sent during the 2015 shutdown. The letters nonetheless earned much mockery on social media \u2014 especially the section suggesting that workers ask their landlords about trading \u201cservices to perform maintenance (e.g. painting, carpentry work) in exchange for partial rent payments.\u201d After suffering a Twitter beat-down, O.P.M. removed the offending passage and issued a statement that it was part of a \u201clegacy document\u201d from 2013 that had been posted in error.This is, to put it mildly, not a broadly popular policy point on which the president is holding the nation hostage.After all his bluff and bluster, if the president backed down now, he would incur the wrath and ridicule of hard-right pundits like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, who seem to call the shots in this White House, as well as die-hard supporters who still think a concrete wall \u2014 or at least some \u201cartistically designed steel slats\u201d \u2014 will Make America Great Again. But there is likely to be a limit to how much Mr. Trump can make Americans suffer for an empty political gesture. The realities of a divided government may provide him with an opportunity \u2014 or an excuse \u2014 for a fresh start. The new Democratic House is set to vote Thursday on a spending plan to end the shutdown without more wall money, leading to the kind of intense negotiations that he has not faced in two years of single-party control of Congress.If there\u2019s a minimum of grandstanding on everyone\u2019s part, Mr. Trump might get a lesson in how to make a deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chinese Consumers\u2019 Confidence Sags, Casting a Pall Over the Global Economy", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 For years, no matter what was happening elsewhere, global companies bet billions upon billions of dollars that China\u2019s consumers would keep spending money.\u201cThe economy,\u201d Mr. Zhao said, \u201cis definitely very bad.\u201dA significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China\u2019s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.The sagging confidence could undermine China\u2019s efforts to redirect its economy and spur growth.The spending slowdown in China could be a worrying sign for many of America\u2019s biggest companies, too, at a time when their profits and stock prices are under pressure.Other companies are also feeling the pinch. China\u2019s auto market, the biggest in the world, saw sales fall during the first 11 months of last year. Sales of all smartphones fell by 13 percent in the third quarter of 2018.Chinese consumers continued to spend relatively briskly during other recent slowdowns, and they could still help get the country\u2019s economy back on track. But they have reasons to be reticent now.\u201cChina is at a turning point in its economy,\u201d said Andrew Collier, the founder of research firm Orient Capital Research. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically been on a debt-fueled binge for a decade.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to turn the ship from industry to consumer at a time of rough waters.\u201dFor many people, circumstances have changed.Declining business confidence, rising labor costs and the trade war with the United States also appear to be hurting the job market.China does not disclose reliable unemployment data. But a recent survey by Mr. Collier of job postings, recruitment ads, numbers of applicants on recruitment websites and interviews with corporate managers suggested labor demand had weakened significantly. Hiring demand in import and export industries has been hit especially hard, falling 53 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, the survey found.Against that backdrop, it is not surprising that many consumers are looking for ways to spend less.Wang Xiaochuan, who made about $145,000 a year as a pharmaceutical sales representative in Yantai in 2015, now makes less than a third of that thanks to a tightening of regulations on the drug industry. He has cut back his spending, buying Clarks shoes instead of the more expensive Ecco brand, or Coach goods rather than Louis Vuitton.\u201cI\u2019m hearing a lot more bad news about the economy than good news now,\u201d he said.In a country with an aspirational culture that for decades has encouraged people to get rich, Apple has long held a special place. Having a new iPhone meant its owner had made it. Seven years ago, the release of a new iPhone set off scuffles in front of an Apple store in Beijing.But price increases have put the iPhone beyond the reach of more and more Chinese buyers. An iPhone XR starts at 6,499 yuan, or about $950, just over two and a half months\u2019 worth of disposable income for the average Chinese person.Rumors once circulated about young people selling kidneys to buy an iPhone. Now, the online joke goes, it would cost two kidneys.On the last day of 2018, William Tan, a 30-year-old university teacher in the southern city of Nanning, replaced his iPhone 7 with a phone made by Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. Although the Huawei phone cost more than $700, about a month\u2019s salary for him, it was still more than $200 cheaper than the base iPhone XR. He had used an iPhone 5, 6 and 7. But when his iPhone 7 broke down, he found he could no longer afford the latest iPhone.The Huawei phone, he said, works fairly smoothly and takes better photos than the iPhone.\u201cI won\u2019t choose Apple again at this price range,\u201d he said.Chinese consumers are by no means done with certain discretionary purchases. Spending on movie tickets and services remains strong, economists said.But the consumer slowdown could worsen if Beijing does not address its economic problems.\u201cThe question is whether China can stabilize economic growth when it is facing economic headwinds,\u201d said Wei Li, senior China economist at Standard Chartered.\u201cIf the labor market does worsen in 2019 or if financial conditions don\u2019t improve, if the stock market remains low, all this could weigh on consumer confidence,\u201d Mr. Li said.Given the uncertainty, many Chinese spenders will most likely continue to scrimp.Wu Yan, a tech company worker who was looking at Xiaomi phones on Thursday afternoon, said he had also tried Apple and Huawei phones and had decided they were not much different from one another. What matters, he said, was the apps, and they work the same from phone to phone.But Mr. Wu, 40, also said many middle-class Chinese people like him had reached a stage where their work was stable, their income was secure and they no longer needed to show off their spending power. His computer at home? It\u2019s four or five years old now, but it still works fine.\u201cNow we spend just to fulfill our needs,\u201d he said.Alexandra Stevenson and Li Yuan reported from Hong Kong, and Raymond Zhong from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Powell Says a \u2018Patient\u2019 Fed Is Watching for Signs of Economic Weakness", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Friday that low inflation would allow the Fed to be \u201cpatient\u201d in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates, a message welcomed by jittery investors.\u201cWith the muted inflation readings that we\u2019ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,\u201d Mr. Powell said. The Fed predicted in December that it would raise rates twice in 2019, but Mr. Powell said the central bank was ready to change course \u201csignificantly if necessary.\u201dThe S&P 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire Mr. Powell, want to arrange a meeting between the two men. Mr. Powell, under questioning by Neil Irwin, an economics writer at The New York Times, said that he was open to meeting with Mr. Trump, as Fed chairs have done with past presidents, but that no meeting had been scheduled.He also said the Fed would make policy without regard to Mr. Trump\u2019s views. \u201cI want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture, it\u2019s not a fragile one, it\u2019s not being disrupted,\u201d he said.Asked if he would resign if Mr. Trump asked him to do so, Mr. Powell replied directly: \u201cNo.\u201dMr. Powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association by his immediate predecessors at the Fed, Janet L. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke. Both of them criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.Fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy. \u201cI think we\u2019re actually in a good spot,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control.But critics, including Mr. Trump, have said the economy still needs the Fed\u2019s help. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.Mr. Powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets\u2019 concerns are overstated. He said that 2018 had been \u201ca good year for the United States economy\u201d and that the latest economic data suggested \u201congoing momentum heading into 2019.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s pessimism, he said, is \u201cwell ahead of the data.\u201dBut the Fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the Fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion.Inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent available data. It is likely that inflation remained soft in December, marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent.Job growth has remained strong, and wage growth has increased in recent months, but Mr. Powell said the Fed was on guard against rising prices, not rising wages. He said the strength of the labor market \u201cdoes not raise concerns about too high inflation.\u201dMichael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks convinced him that the Fed would move more slowly in 2019. Mr. Feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019; he said he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, in July and December.\u201cPowell\u2019s message was unmistakable,\u201d Mr. Feroli wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the Fed\u2019s gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. Some analysts have argued that the Fed\u2019s retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets.Mr. Powell said that the Fed disagreed but, returning to his theme for the day, that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind.\u201cIf we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to change it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Should You Do About a Falling Stock Market? Nothing", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. But you do not.Millions of investors will receive year-end statements from their brokerages and retirement plan managers in the coming weeks, and the great majority of them will have unpleasant news: losses.The S&P 500 finished the year down 6.2 percent, with the steepest declines recorded in the fourth quarter. If it all makes you want to flee \u2014 or at least shift your 401(k) into cash \u2014 that\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s also a bad idea.The sensible response to this unnerving series of developments is to do pretty much anything else. Read a book. Go for a walk. Take up knitting. Or just do nothing at all, like take a nap. If you are a long-term investor (and any money you have tied up in the stock market should be intended for the long term to begin with), tumult like that of the last few months isn\u2019t something that should cause panic. Rather, it\u2019s the price you pay for enjoying returns that, over long time horizons, are likely to be substantially higher than those for cash or bonds.That\u2019s true if this episode turns out to be a false alarm for the overall economy, as is a distinct possibility. But it\u2019s also true even if this does turn out to be the start of a prolonged period of economic and market distress \u2014 especially if you are still in the phase of your life of contributing to a retirement plan or otherwise accumulating savings.The recent pessimistic tone in markets is getting way ahead of the evidence. Nothing so far in either the economic data or the market indicators that most reliably predict economic swings suggests there will be anything worse than a modest slowdown in economic growth in 2019.Businesses are still expanding and adding jobs. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds has fallen in the last three months, but it would have fallen a lot more if the bond market \u2014 which tends to be closely tied to the direction of the overall economy \u2014 had been predicting an imminent recession.Moreover, an investor who moved money into cash now would be doing so just as the valuation of stocks was becoming more favorable \u2014 buying high and selling low, not the way great fortunes are made. That\u2019s especially true when you factor in the drop in longer-term interest rates, which makes shares particularly appealing relative to bonds.In early November, investing $100 in stocks would buy you about $4.64 worth of corporate earnings, versus the $3.21 in interest you would could receive by investing in 10-year Treasury bonds. Now, stocks offer $5.25, while bonds offer only $2.61.But most important, even if the economic road ahead really is as bumpy as some in markets seem to fear, you\u2019re probably not going to be successful at timing those swings just right.Of course, if you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. You do not.Even if you turned out to be right about a continuing tumble in 2019, the great risk would be that whenever the rebound began, you would be caught out of position, unable to take advantage.Suppose you were clever enough to recognize at the start of December 2007 that a major recession was about to take place, and you moved your money out of stocks.Yes, you would have saved yourself from steep losses in 2008 and early 2009. But you have to ask yourself: Would I have also had the courage to put money back in while the economy was still in horrendous shape in 2009, with double-digit unemployment and a banking system in tatters?If not then, when would you have moved money back in? People who simply left their savings fully invested in the stock market in December 2007 have now made a 134 percent return on that money. Would you have done better than that, or would you have missed out on a big chunk of those gains out of the same caution that led you to pull money out of stocks to begin with?People who did not panic in the fall of 2008 \u2014 the most panic-worthy time in most of our lifetimes \u2014 and kept putting their retirement funds into stocks did indeed incur steep losses over the ensuing months. But their newly invested funds were being put into stocks at the most favorable valuations in a generation, and thus enjoyed the full benefit of the rebound when it eventually came. This equation changes, of course, if we\u2019re talking about money needed imminently as opposed to longer-term savings, such as for retirement. The economy looks stable now, but that could change \u2014 it\u2019s still possible that markets and C.E.O.s know something about the future that isn\u2019t clear in the data yet.But that\u2019s more of a fundamental argument about how your assets should be allocated. If an 18 percent drop in stocks is enough to cause you to change your entire investment strategy, that money shouldn\u2019t have been in stocks to begin with.The entire point of investing in stocks is that you get greater long-term expected returns in exchange for tolerating bigger ups and downs. Episodes like those of the last few weeks are, in effect, the price you pay for returns that are substantially higher than bonds or cash over longer periods. Just as there are no free lunches, there are no excess returns without some volatility and risk.As individual investors, we cannot control volatility. What we can control is our own mind-set and reaction, and the more level your head, the better your long-term results are likely to be.Advertisement"}

The rover is now programmed to roam across a barren vista toward a distinct crater.Chinese scientists hailed the landing of the Chang\u2019e-4 probe as evidence of the country\u2019s growing stature in space exploration. \u201cIt is human nature to explore the unknown world,\u201d Wu Weiren, chief designer of the lunar mission for the China National Space Administration, said in an interview on the state television network, CCTV. \u201cAnd it is what our generation and the next generation are supposed to do.\u201dCompared with previous missions, however, the reaction to Thursday\u2019s milestones seemed strikingly restrained, both in the country\u2019s state-run news outlets and on social media. On China\u2019s most-watched TV news program early Thursday evening, the landing \u2014 declared a success by officials at mission control \u2014 was not even one of the four top stories.China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 became the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the far side of the moon.The muted reaction was a sign that the novelty of the country\u2019s space missions has faded. But the coverage also appeared to reflect political and economic anxieties at a time when Mr. Xi\u2019s government is trying to negotiate a truce in the trade war with the United States and respond to worrisome cracks in the economy.A woman in a cafe in Beijing, Liu Ying, expressed pride in the space program but said she had not followed the landing closely. She then expressed wonder about the costs. \u201cThe economy is bad,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it really a good thing for the country to spend recklessly?\u201dThe spacecraft was the first to land intact on the side of the moon that perpetually faces away from Earth. A Soviet satellite took the first photographs of the far side in 1959, and the Apollo missions circled above it between 1968 and 1972, but the difficulty of communicating with earthbound scientists had always made the idea of landing there more complex, if not necessarily prohibitive.Dr. Wu, in his televised remarks, said the landing had been a \u201cgreat kickoff\u201d for future lunar missions, including ones intended to land astronauts \u2014 something only the United States has accomplished, sending 12 men to the moon. Under the current schedule, China would send the first astronaut by 2030.\u201cWe are building China into a space giant,\u201d he said.To overcome the challenge of communicating from the moon\u2019s far side, China had previously launched a satellite called Queqiao, or Magpie Bridge. It now orbits beyond the moon to act as a relay for transmissions to and from the mission control center on the northwestern outskirts of Beijing.Yu Guobin, a spokesman for the Chang\u2019e-4 program, said in televised remarks that the detachment of the rover was the \u201cmore important historical moment.\u201dZoe Mou and Claire Fu contributed research.Advertisement"}

And Mr. Brown can be an ornery interview, particularly when asked questions that strike him as obvious or familiar, as we were reminded during the visit to his ranch.Like, for example, when Mr. Brown was asked if he had any regrets about problems not tackled. Probably not the best question to ask.\u201cWouldn\u2019t you say that is a condition of life \u2014 that if you do one thing, you don\u2019t do something else?\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI have a saying that fits that. Commitment is the enemy of opportunity. To do one thing is not to do something else.\u201dFine.Mr. Brown has been famously frugal. The new governor, Gavin Newsom, brings a more liberal view of the world; he\u2019s already moving to spend $1.9 billion in his first budget on preschool programs. The new Legislature will be ruled by a huge Democratic majority.Does that worry Mr. Brown?\u201cThat pressure, it\u2019s always there,\u201d he said. \u201cPent-up demand.\u201cOrganized demand. Environmentalists. Soda companies. Real estate companies. A hundred different interests.\u201dMr. Brown said that the dire economic climate he encountered upon taking office eight years ago \u2014 a $26 billion deficit \u2014 was almost welcome. \u201cI was also able to say no,\u201d he said. But the governor is leaving a $14 billion surplus to his successor, so one big question now is whether Mr. Newsom will be able to (or want to) say no.\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be careful. But the Democratic constituencies want more money and more laws.\u201dAnd if the new governor doesn\u2019t say no, Mr. Brown said, California\u2019s famous boom-and-bust economy might do it for him.\u201cThere\u2019s a certain exuberance,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the business cycle has a limiting influence.

But he took the opportunity to reiterate a demand that South Korea cease all military drills with \u201cother foreign sources.\u201d\u201cThose should be completely stopped,\u201d Mr. Kim said. \u201cThat is our stance.\u201dThere were sparse direct references in the speech to denuclearization. But Mr. Kim said the country would not be willing to take further steps toward removing its nuclear weapons unless the United States reciprocated.\u201cThe statements and agreements after the summit with the United States were that we are going toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and that is my resolute commitment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not make nuclear weapons and we will not proliferate nuclear weapons, and I have said this, and I will say this again now.\u201cIf the United States can show corresponding measures, the relationship between the two countries will, through many processes, accelerate for the better. But if the counterpart continues with its past habits, it won\u2019t be good, but I hope they stop this.\u201dMr. Kim also indicated that the North wanted a peace declaration formally ending the Korean War.In declaring that he would not make nuclear weapons, Mr. Kim was going further than anything he said at his summit meeting with Mr. Trump in Singapore in June. North Korea made no explicit promise to \u201cfreeze\u201d its program, and American intelligence officials have said that they believe North Korea has continued to produce the fuel for nuclear weapons \u2014 and likely the weapons themselves.The distinction is a relatively minor one, because once the fuel is produced, fashioning it into weapons is no longer much of a challenge, as the North has proved through a series of nuclear tests that ended 13 months ago.Mr. Kim\u2019s statement about proliferation addressed one of the major issues for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korea envoy, Stephen E. Biegun. They have expressed concerns about the North\u2019s long record of selling nuclear technology abroad \u2014 most famously to Syria, which built a full nuclear reactor based on a North Korean design and parts. It was destroyed by Israel in 2007.Mr. Kim\u2019s demand that the United States begin to lift sanctions before North Korea takes any steps toward dismantling its nuclear infrastructure is essentially a return to the state of affairs when Mr. Trump took office early in 2017.Mr. Trump entered the White House vowing he would not repeat the mistakes of his predecessors, who lifted some sanctions. Mr. Trump and his aides said the North would have to dismantle everything first and trust that sanctions would be lifted later.Since the Singapore meeting, Mr. Trump has occasionally seemed to waver on the question of lifting some sanctions before the North dismantles its facilities and gives up its weapons and missiles. Now, with Mr. Kim\u2019s demand, he must decide whether to back down \u2014 and take steps similar to those of his predecessors.Analysts noted that Mr. Kim did not specify what exactly he wanted the Trump administration to do but was suggesting that removing some sanctions and moving toward a formal peace declaration to end the Korean War might prod the North to take certain steps toward denuclearization.\u201cPrevious public and private comments from Kim and other North Korean officials suggest they would be willing to decommission the Yongbyon nuclear complex under expert supervision,\u201d said Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, referring to a plutonium reactor, spent fuel reprocessing facility and uranium enrichment plant.North Korea is \u201cvery good at playing hard to get. They are always saying, \u2018We could go back to our old ways,\u2019\u201d said Lee Sung-yoon, a professor of Korean studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.Mr. Lee, who said Mr. Kim had shrewdly tempered his rhetoric, said he did not believe the North Korean leader intended to abandon his nuclear weapons program.\u201cHe came across as more peace-prone, reform-minded and denuclearization-prone, which I think is a ruse,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cA nation doesn\u2019t spend 50 years in building the bomb and just give it up for the empty privilege of shaking hands with the U.S. president. But it\u2019s in his interest to play this game for the time being.\u201dIn his New Year\u2019s speech, Mr. Kim praised the progress toward further cooperation that the two Koreas had made over the previous year. \u201cNorth and South Koreans have to continue resolving our tensions in the skies, waters and land in and surrounding the peninsula, through carrying out practical measures based on already agreed upon inter-Korean agreements,\u201d he said.\u201cWe should all be proud that we are moving together, North and South, as Koreans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should expand our inter-Korean cooperation so that we can actually see changes.\u201dOver the weekend, Mr. Kim sent a rare personal letter to the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in, saying he hoped to visit Seoul in the new year. Analysts expect he may also try to meet China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin.One of the distinguishing factors of this year\u2019s speech was its more casual delivery. By giving the speech live and in what appeared to be his library, Mr. Kim projected a more relaxed demeanor that was largely intended for his domestic audience.Motoko Rich reported from Tokyo, and David E. Sanger from Washington. Su-Hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea.Advertisement"}

People in the street were able to flee and no one was injured.He then drove his silver Mercedes toward the city\u2019s main square, where people were lighting fireworks to celebrate the New Year. There, he struck the four victims, including a woman who remains in life-threatening condition, Mr. Reul said.The man then fled to Essen, a larger city nearby, where he tried to steer into a group of people waiting at a bus stop, officials said. They noticed his erratic driving and were able to flee and alerted the police, who apprehended the suspect shortly afterward.Tensions between Germans and foreigners have increased in Germany since the arrival of more than 1 million people in 2015, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and seeking asylum in Europe\u2019s largest economy.Although the country has successfully absorbed a majority of new arrivals, a series of violent incidents has highlighted the frictions and fueled mistrust on both sides.The newly appointed chief of domestic security, Thomas Haldenwang, said last month he would double the number of agents focused on fighting the far-right extremists.Advertisement"}

Julie Bloom, a deputy editor for national coverage for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.As a deputy editor on the national desk, you oversee a lot of breaking news. What tech tools do you use to help? I primarily oversee California and parts of the West, but also handle a lot of our coverage of major breaking news. With my colleagues on the desk and our boss, Marc Lacey, the national editor, we\u2019ve developed a tool kit of sorts to handle these stories that are fast-moving and intense.I feel like each day is a little like being caught in a batter\u2019s box without knowing when or where the balls are coming from, and that can be both exhilarating and exhausting. Technology certainly helps.My phone is pretty much everything. It\u2019s kind of its own command center, and I can do almost everything on it except edit. For stories, I still need my laptop. Most of the reporters know that if they get a call from me at an odd hour, it usually means they\u2019re on their way to something awful, but the reason we can do what we do is that they are total pros. Nobody ever just hangs up and goes back to sleep.In these cases, our job is to help them produce the best journalism possible in difficult situations and make sure they stay safe, too. I\u2019m in awe of the reporters on National who are relentless and often put themselves in danger while covering tough stories with compassion. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve done enough of them now that we kind of know what to do.In the middle of any given story, reporters and I communicate using text messages, Slack, Signal, Gchat and phone calls. We often spin off a Slack channel just for one event and have an email set up for breaking news that teams of reporters feed to. Those are split up into a bunch of different Google docs that we keep building out simultaneously for, say, a profile or a piece just on weapons or victims. Stories are updated dozens of times. We\u2019re also watching search trends and adjusting headlines to make sure we\u2019re showing up first. On a big, big story we\u2019ll also send out multiple alerts with new developments.Many of your reporters are based on the West Coast, while you are stationed in New York. How do you keep in touch with them and work with them on stories? Even though it\u2019s a different time zone, we\u2019re still covering the news no matter when and where it happens. My reporters are all early risers, or they\u2019re becoming ones. We have regular calls where we brainstorm ideas, but most editing is a constant back and forth over email, Gchat and text, and that seems to work well. We\u2019re fortunate because The Times has bureaus all over the place, so sometimes we hand off to Hong Kong or London and the editors there can help keep stories going.Your contributors sometimes report stories from odd situations, like natural disasters. What tools do they use, and how do they get stories to you expediently? Sometimes good old dictation is the best means of getting scenes and reporting in real time. Reporters are also well versed in filing from their cars, Waffle Houses or the side of the road. We\u2019ve had a few instances in hurricanes when reporters have had to abandon their rental cars because they were flooding and get to safety and they still managed to file.You are a Los Angeles native. In your view, how has tech changed California? I grew up in the Los Angeles area and went to school at Berkeley and keep close ties to both parts of the state, and I go back a lot to see family. California is an endlessly exciting place for The Times to cover: It\u2019s the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, at the forefront of all sorts of change, extremely complex and a hotbed of contradictions. I like to think of it more as its own country. Technology is obviously a big part of all of that, and we\u2019re a long way from when I was a teenager on AOL Messenger.When you\u2019re not at work, what tech product do you use a lot?I\u2019m pretty low-tech in my nonwork life \u2014 or I try to be. When you\u2019re responsible for news, it\u2019s hard to let go. I\u2019ve tried everything from burying my phone under my kitchen sink to deleting certain apps on the weekend, but at a certain point you just relent and accept. I think social media is a mostly necessary evil and try to avoid it when I\u2019m not working, but I still haven\u2019t quit Instagram. Besides friends and family, I follow a lot of dancers and ballet companies \u2014 remnants from a former life \u2014 and museums, chefs and fashion designers. It\u2019s good to be reminded that there are people out there creating beautiful things, too. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Led by Cult Bourbons, Distillers Dream of a \u2018Napa-fication\u2019 of Kentucky", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn September 2014, a bourbon brand called Kentucky Owl began to appear on liquor-store shelves around Louisville. The American whiskey market was booming, and dozens of new bourbons were showing up each year. But Kentucky Owl was different. Released exclusively within the state in tiny quantities and produced by the scion of an old Kentucky whiskey family, it had an undeniable mystique \u2014 and a price tag of $170.To skeptics, Kentucky Owl was proof that the whiskey trend had reached its Tulip Mania moment. At the time, few bourbons commanded even $50 at retail. Plus, the man behind the brand, Dixon Dedman, didn\u2019t even make the whiskey himself; he bought barrels from other distilleries, then blended them. Surely the bubble was about to pop.It didn\u2019t. Within a few weeks, nearly every bottle of Kentucky Owl had sold out. On the secondary market, flippers were asking \u2014 and getting \u2014 five times what they had paid in stores. \u201cBefore you knew it, before anybody had reviewed it, you had people camping out to buy a bottle of Kentucky Owl,\u201d said Fred Minnick, the editor of Bourbon+ magazine and the author of \u201cBourbon: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of an American Whiskey.\u201dSeveral factors gave Kentucky Owl a boost. It had heritage: Mr. Dedman, whose family runs a century-old inn popular with bourbon fans, named it after a long-defunct brand created by his great-great-grandfather. Early hype by retailers, along with rumors about the source of the whiskey, also built early interest.Above all, Kentucky Owl debuted at a moment when whiskey fans, flush with money from a surging heartland economy, were willing to pay extra to get the next hot thing in bourbon. Soon, Kentucky Owl had achieved cult status \u2014 and signaled a fundamental change in the American whiskey market.\u201cPeople have called us the Screaming Eagle of bourbon,\u201d Mr. Dedman said in August, referring to the $3,000-per-bottle cabernet sauvignon whose debut, in 1995, represented a shift toward stratospheric luxury in the Napa Valley wine industry.Not that he\u2019s complaining. In January 2017, less than three years after introducing Kentucky Owl, Mr. Dedman and his business partner sold the brand to SPI Group, the Luxembourg-based company best known for making Stolichnaya vodka, for an undisclosed sum rumored to be in the high seven figures. Six months later, the new owners revealed plans for a $150 million \u201cKentucky Owl Park\u201d in Bardstown, an hour southeast of Louisville, featuring not just a distillery but a convention center, two lakes and, eventually, a luxury hotel. The company broke ground in November 2017, at an event attended by Governor Matt Bevin, and it plans to open the first phase of the site in 2020.The brand\u2019s rapid ascent took Mr. Dedman by surprise. \u201cI never had a vision for how fast this thing would grow,\u201d he said.You could say the same thing about the Kentucky whiskey industry itself. Although the bourbon market has been growing for almost two decades, a transformation has taken place in the last five years, a reshaping of the industry\u2019s potential that most people didn\u2019t see coming and are only now starting to grapple with.Between 2012 and 2017, sales of bourbon whiskey \u2014 95 percent of which is made in Kentucky \u2014 soared by more than 50 percent, to $3.3 billion. To keep up with demand, nearly two dozen new distilleries have opened in Kentucky in the last five years, including three around Bardstown, a town of 13,000 that sits in the center of bourbon country. Established companies like Beam Suntory and Brown-Forman are undertaking hundred-million-dollar capital projects, while scores of new rickhouses \u2014 the enormous warehouses used to age whiskey \u2014 dot the rolling hills around Louisville.But the changes are about more than money and investment. Americans aren\u2019t just buying more whiskey, and paying more for each bottle. They\u2019re buying into an entire \u201cbourbon experience,\u201d from whiskey-themed boutique hotels in downtown Louisville to trendy restaurants with \u201ccurated\u201d whiskey lists to fleets of tour buses carting bachelorette parties and corporate retreats from distillery to distillery.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Trey Zoeller, the founder of Jefferson\u2019s, a bourbon brand based in Louisville that just built a sprawling visitors center and has plans to quintuple the size of its distillery. \u201cTruly, you build it and they will come.\u201dThe most ambitious people in the industry talk about the \u201cNapa-fication\u201d of bourbon, doing for American whiskey what Napa Valley did for American wine: not just make it in huge volumes, but elevate it to a world-class luxury status, built around a region and an image designed to generate billions of dollars in tourism, retail sales and investment. The sort of place where a $170 bottle of Kentucky Owl is actually a pretty good deal, and a far cry from the rural simplicity that bourbon was built on.\u201cThis region has matured with the rise of the bourbon industry the way a stupid underage kid grows up to be a sophisticated adult,\u201d Mr. Dedman said. \u201cI would never in my wildest dreams have imagined that we\u2019d be where we are today.\u201dDixon Dedman is Kentucky royalty. His great-great-grandfather Charles Dedman founded one of the state\u2019s largest distilleries in the late 19th century, and his family has owned the award-winning, 31-room Beaumont Inn in Harrodsburg, Ky., for over a century. Tall, sandy-haired and soft-spoken at 37, Mr. Dedman exudes the image of a down-home goober \u2014 his word \u2014 that barely papers over a sharp, analytical mind.\u201cHe plays dumb really well,\u201d said Mr. Minnick, \u201cbut he\u2019s really smart.\u201d (Disclosure: I\u2019ve written for Mr. Minnick\u2019s magazine.)There was never a question that Mr. Dedman would go into the family business. During college, in the early 2000s, he worked at the Beaumont Inn during the summer, and less than a week after graduation he was back washing dishes. Revenues were down, though, and major improvements were being pushed back for lack of money. The inn shut down for four months every winter for lack of visitors. With Mr. Dedman\u2019s father easing into retirement, it was suddenly up to him to save the family legacy.Part of the problem was location. Even though it is in the middle of bourbon country, just east of Bardstown, Harrodsburg sits in a dry county \u2014 which meant the inn couldn\u2019t cater to thirsty tourists visiting nearby distilleries.\u201cWe\u2019d get people coming through after seeing a distillery, and the strongest thing I could serve them in the restaurant was black coffee,\u201d Mr. Dedman said.That changed in 2003, when the county voted to allow restaurants in Harrodsburg to sell liquor by the glass. Mr. Dedman pounced: He started selling drinks in the Beaumont\u2019s main dining room, and he opened two adjacent taverns, both of which became overnight successes in a town that was dying for a drink. (In 2015, the James Beard Foundation gave the inn an America\u2019s Classics award, which it bestows on distinguished regional restaurants.)The decision to relax Harrodsburg\u2019s dry laws, and Mr. Dedman\u2019s push to sell liquor, came just as the bourbon industry was beginning to recover from a decades-long slump in consumer demand. In 1969 distillers produced 1.9 million barrels of whiskey, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association; in 1999, the industry\u2019s low point, it made just 455,000.But in the mid-2000s, a younger generation of drinkers shifted back toward bourbon, drawn as much by its flavors as by its story as an authentic American craft. Like locally sourced food and artisanal furniture, bourbon appealed to consumers tired of flashy luxury and looking for simple, recognizable products. Between 2000 and 2010, revenues for American whiskey distilleries grew by 46 percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, and tourists began pouring into Kentucky to see where all that whiskey was made.That was especially good news for a place like the Beaumont Inn. Not only were locals flocking to its bars, but a mounting number of whiskey tourists, arriving to visit nearby distilleries like Four Roses and Maker\u2019s Mark, were lining up to stay in its guest rooms. By 2005, it was operating year-round.Mr. Dedman had more on his mind than rescuing the Beaumont Inn. His great-great-grandfather\u2019s distillery, which opened on the banks of the Kentucky River in 1879, had grown rapidly, thanks to the success of its flagship whiskey, Kentucky Owl. Charles Dedman gave it the slogan \u201cthe wise man\u2019s bourbon.\u201dThe C.M. Dedman Distillery was forced to close during Prohibition, though, and it never reopened. Mr. Dedman\u2019s father and grandfather had often talked about restarting the brand, but it was idle chatter. In 2008, with the inn back to financial stability despite the looming recession, Mr. Dedman set out to realize their dream.Instead of opening his own distillery \u2014 a costly and time-intensive project \u2014 Mr. Dedman decided to \u201csource\u201d whiskey distilled elsewhere, then bottle it under his own label. But sourcing decent whiskey presents its own challenges: Acquiring stocks of bourbon is largely a matter of knowing the right people to open the right doors. Fortunately, Mr. Dedman knew people: Generations of traveling whiskey businessmen had stayed at his family\u2019s hotel.Among them was Jim Rutledge, the master distiller at Four Roses. Mr. Rutledge, who recently retired after 49 years with the distillery, is widely regarded as one of the greatest whiskey makers of his generation. Starting in 2010, Mr. Dedman would buy barrels of whiskey, then bring samples to Mr. Rutledge\u2019s home for him to assess.Unfailingly polite but highly opinionated, Mr. Rutledge was not impressed. It turned out that even with access to good barrels, Mr. Dedman had something to learn about picking the right ones. \u201cOne day he had five samples, and we met over breakfast,\u201d Mr. Rutledge recalled. \u201cI tried them and thought, \u2018How do I tell him not to ever put these in a bottle?\u2019 I told him he might have to blend them\u201d \u2014 a laborious process that involves taste-testing endless combinations of barrels.Undeterred, that\u2019s what Mr. Dedman did. After closing up the inn at night, he would set up dozens of barrel samples at a table in the back of the restaurant and methodically mix them, paying close attention to their age, alcohol level, even where they had been sitting in the warehouse (temperature affects how a whiskey ages, and temperatures vary widely in an unheated warehouse).It took nearly four years, but he finally settled on a blend he liked. He combined the barrels, paid someone to bottle and label them, and then took them around to local liquor distributors.Mr. Dedman insists that making a commercially successful whiskey was never his plan. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I thought it out, like I said here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do year one, and then what I\u2019ll do year five,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought, we should do this because bourbon is on the move.\u201d Looking back, he cringes at how amateur the whole operation was \u2014 he didn\u2019t have a sales plan, or a marketing strategy.None of that mattered. By almost all accounts, that first batch of Kentucky Owl was a transcendently beautiful bourbon, reminiscent of whiskey made in the mid-20th century, often considered a golden age of distilling. \u201cWhen you pick up that bottle, Kentucky Owl just feels like Kentucky,\u201d Mr. Minnick said. \u201cAnd when you taste the early releases of Owl, it just tastes like old Kentucky bourbon from the 1950s.\u201dKentucky Owl got an added boost from social media. Rumors, spread through bourbon chat rooms on Reddit and other sites, claimed that Mr. Dedman had worked closely with Julian Van Winkle III, the owner of the legendary Old Rip Van Winkle whiskey company. The information was false, but it supercharged the hype.\u201cPeople just went nuts,\u201d Mr. Minnick said. \u201cKentucky Owl just has that cool factor you cannot teach.\u201dOther whiskey brands have begun asking three-figure prices too: A rye whiskey from Kentucky Peerless, a new distillery in Louisville, goes for an average of $120. Chicken Cock, another sourced and \u201crevived\u201d 19th-century brand, sells for $250. Even once-proletarian brands like Wild Turkey and Four Roses now offer limited-edition expressions at $200 or more.Whiskey fans and writers talk about Kentucky Owl as the next Pappy Van Winkle, Mr. Van Winkle\u2019s flagship brand, bottles of which often fetch $5,000 or more. Others, betting on Mr. Dedman\u2019s blending skills and the global growth of American whiskey, see it going even higher, to sit in the same category as the Macallan single malt or Ch\u00e2teau Latour Bordeaux.\u201cIt has the potential to get up and stay among the world-class, luxury brands \u2014 it has that kind of cachet,\u201d said Jeff Hopmayer, a strategic adviser in Nashville who has worked closely with several bourbon producers, including Kentucky Owl. \u201cWhen I bring a bottle to a party, everyone freaks out.\u201dIn early 2017, Mr. Dedman got a call from the office of Yuri Shefler, a Russian businessman. Mr. Shefler, who lives in London, is the sole owner of SPI Group, a global drinks company best known for Stolichnaya vodka, which Mr. Shefler acquired in 1999, two years after the Russian government sold it off.Moscow, perhaps sensing that it had made a mistake in letting go of such a valuable brand, has sued to win Stolichnaya back. So far SPI Group has defended its most valuable property, but in recent years it has also diversified, buying or starting wineries in Spain and Argentina, a tequila distillery in Mexico and a rum distillery in Louisiana. Now, Mr. Shefler wanted a piece of the bourbon boom.He wasn\u2019t alone. As American whiskey has demonstrated its staying power, it has attracted investors from around the world. In early 2017 R\u00e9my Cointreau, the French drinks company, bought Westland, a craft distillery in Seattle; a few months later LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought the Woodinville Whiskey Company, in Woodinville, Wash. And in September 2018 Edrington, the owner of the Macallan single malt, bought a minority stake in Wyoming Whiskey, based near Jackson Hole.But Mr. Shefler and SPI Group wanted more than just an investment in a bourbon company \u2014 they wanted to control a chunk of the bourbon experience. Kentucky Owl offered a unique opportunity: a prestigious brand with almost no footprint, a blank slate on which SPI Group could write its own bourbon story.Mr. Dedman and his partner, Mark Carter, closed the deal in early 2017, for an undisclosed sum. (Mr. Carter and his wife, Sherri, who own an inn and a winery in California, left the company; last year they introduced their own whiskey brand, Old Carter, at $250 a bottle.)As part of the deal, Mr. Dedman is staying on as a corporate ambassador and blender for Kentucky Owl, which will remain the company\u2019s premier brand. Mr. Dedman\u2019s operation will sit within a much larger project, also called Kentucky Owl, which will generate a range of whiskeys at different prices, all produced at a sprawling facility in Bardstown.That facility, Kentucky Owl Park, represents the full expression of where American whiskey is headed. Built on a 450-acre limestone quarry, the park will be about much more than making whiskey: A visitor might get a distillery tour in the morning, eat a lakeside lunch, see a live-music show in the afternoon and sleep in a boutique hotel room that night, all without leaving the property.\u201cIt\u2019s about creating that overall experience,\u201d said Rudy Costello, the chief executive of Stoli Group USA, which oversees Mr. Shefler\u2019s American holdings. \u201cWe see the tourism in that area already, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even scratched the surface.\u201dRight now, the site of the future Kentucky Owl Park is, literally, a hole in the ground; it takes some imagination to picture it as a nirvana of whiskey. But the plan also fits neatly within the overall trajectory of the Kentucky bourbon industry \u2014 a half-dozen distilleries lie within a few minutes\u2019 drive, and all of them are building amenities like restaurants, visitors centers, parks and hotels to cater to a new class of whiskey tourist.The typical distillery was once a utilitarian industrial plant; now it\u2019s a boozy theme park. The recently opened Castle and Key Distillery outside Frankfort, Ky., which took over a defunct distillery site modeled after a medieval castle, sports a botanical trail and a manicured garden. The centerpiece of the new Bardstown Bourbon Company distillery is Bottle & Bond, a minimalist-chic restaurant run by the former chef at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia. Upping the ante, SPI Group hired Shigeru Ban, a Pritzker Prize-winning architect, to design the main buildings at Kentucky Owl Park.For local business leaders, such changes promise to turn the region into something like a Napa Valley of whiskey, a place that combines high-end retailing, resort hotels, fine dining and, flowing through it all, an unending river of tourist dollars.\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be just an industry; we want it to be a destination,\u201d said Kim Huston, the president of the Bardstown Industrial Development Corporation. Ms. Huston takes the Napa comparison seriously: She travels frequently to Northern California to study how its most famous wine region went from a sleepy agricultural community in the 1980s to being a synonym for high-end living.\u201cWe\u2019re probably where they were 20 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is for Bardstown to play on the world stage of luxury tourism.\u201dNot everyone in the region is on board with these plans. Kentucky is significantly more traditional and rural than a place like Napa, and even deep-pocketed companies like Beam Suntory can\u2019t easily push around social conservatives who bristle at the thought of turning their towns over to tourists, no matter how much money the visitors bring in.But the skeptics might not be able to hold out for long. Bourbon fans are already streaming into the state \u2014 1.2 million people visited its distilleries in 2017, a 20 percent jump from 2016 and almost double the number in 2014, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association.And after years of speculation about a bourbon bubble, distilleries and investors are confident that the expansion is here to stay.\u201cIf you look at the total amount of bourbon sales today, it\u2019s still less than it was in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation,\u201d said Mr. Costello, the Stoli Group USA chief executive. \u201cAnd there is still tremendous opportunity outside the United States, with some big emerging markets starting to tune into American whiskey.\u201dFor Kentucky, the bourbon industry\u2019s rapid change in fortune \u2014 and its transformative effects on the state economy \u2014 is something many still find overwhelming, Mr. Dedman included.For all his business savvy and financial success, he\u2019s still a guy who grew up thinking he\u2019d spend his life running a small hotel in rural Kentucky. \u201cI know what we\u2019re doing is going to have a big footprint and make us a major player,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cBut it\u2019s something I can\u2019t get my head around.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the location of an SPI Group winery.

{"Headline": "This Expert Called the Market Plunge. Here\u2019s What He Sees in 2019.", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseA year ago, in the wake of President Trump\u2019s tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn\u2019t a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.Not everyone was celebrating.Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture \u2014 including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing \u201ca very healthy economy.\u201dGiven Mr. Stack\u2019s track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators \u201chave remained remarkably strong,\u201d he said, he\u2019s still defensive and hasn\u2019t changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn\u2019t over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)\u201cA lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize,\u201d Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, \u201cwe won\u2019t see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months\u201d of 2019. Among the leading indicators he\u2019s watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that \u201cserious cracks\u201d are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.That\u2019s when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn\u2019t the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, \u201cThe stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.\u201dSince World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.Indeed, Mr. Stack\u2019s data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he\u2019s bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn \u2014 or even a significant slowdown \u2014 \u201cthose projected earnings will go out the window.\u201d\u201cI would not call today\u2019s market undervalued,\u201d he added.Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. \u201cI think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December,\u201d he said.Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. \u201cI think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich could stabilize the market, at least for the time being.\u201dBut Mr. Stack\u2019s technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He\u2019s also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to time the market, but we\u2019re very comfortable with our defensive allocation,\u201d he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even \u201ca single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon.\u201d\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d he asked, \u201chow volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the name of a research firm. It is InvesTech Research, not InvestTech. The error was repeated in a picture caption. The column also misstated what has happened since 1928 with regard to the stock market, according to James Stack\u2019s data. There have been four instances when stocks have been two or more years in a row, not four instances when they have been down just two years in a row.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Country Is Playing Leading Role in the Debate Over Climate Change", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareBeijing is a solid supporter of the Paris agreement\u2019s principles.When the United States walked away from the Paris agreement on climate change in 2017, it left China as the most significant player in the debate.The Paris agreement is an accord signed in 2015 within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that sets out a series of goals to deal with global greenhouse gas emissions mitigation and finance, starting in 2020.The goals of the agreement were ambitious, but the text was vague in detail and left some nations wondering if the agreement had any real teeth or whether it favored rich countries.The U.N. Climate Change Conference, which opened in Katowice, Poland, has the task of finalizing the implementation guidelines for the agreement, and China has been a solid supporter of the accord\u2019s principles.Xie Zhenhua, the country\u2019s special representative on climate change affairs, has said it will continue to play a leading role in global efforts.He made the remark on Sept. 14 at a news conference after the three-day Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco in the U.S.During the summit, 10 Chinese philanthropic organizations, foundations and research institutions launched the Global Climate Action Initiative with a view to giving full support to the Chinese government as it acts to honor a series of climate change commitments made by President Xi Jinping.These commitments include making a national contribution to the global effort to curb climate change, promoting South-South cooperation on this, and building a \u201cgreen\u201d Belt and Road Initiative.Chinese society and the international community have been urged to respond actively to climate change and take immediate action to encourage sustainable development in order to achieve a global ecological civilization.Xie said, \u201cChina has overcome enormous difficulties and made enormous contributions (to global climate efforts).\u201dThe country pledged to peak greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030; lower such emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60 to 65 percent from the 2005 level; increase the share of nonfossil energy in total energy consumption to about 20 percent; and increase the forest stock volume by about 4.5 billion cubic meters from 2005 levels.According to Xie, China has invested more than $127 billion to develop renewable energy, ranking it first in the world in this respect for six consecutive years. Its renewable power installed capacity reached 650 million kilowatts in 2017, accounting for 30 percent of the global total, he said.\u201cChina has made remarkable achievements in renewable energy development. Its new technologies and large-scale manufacturing have greatly reduced the cost, allowing renewable energy sources to compete with traditional energy sources,\u201d he added.In July, alerts were issued as a heat wave affected many areas. Scorching temperatures were recorded in Liaoning, Jilin and Hubei provinces, Chongqing and the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions, Xinhua News Agency reported on July 31.The China Meteorological Administration said July was hotter and wetter than usual.Shanghai had an 11-day heat wave that month, the longest recorded in the city in 145 years, Xinhua reported on July 29. A temperature of 40.9 C was recorded in the city on July 21, the highest since local meteorological records began.For countries such as China, climate change has become a major challenge, especially in urban centers where air pollution has reached critical levels.Nicolas Pechet, a partner at Solidiance, an Asia-focused corporate strategy consulting company in Shanghai, said, \u201cChina\u2019s central government leadership is keenly aware that poor environmental conditions can severely affect social stability and migration of the wealthiest citizens.\u201dThe country\u2019s economy has already entered the new normal, featuring more moderate economic growth, a greater focus on the quality of growth, and a move away from heavy manufacturing, Pechet said.Its industrial sector has underpinned modern economic development, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy consumption.The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) specifies a 15 percent reduction in energy consumption intensity and an 18 percent drop in carbon dioxide emissions intensity, while boosting forest coverage to more than 23 percent of the total land area.\u201cIf these targets are met, China will make significant progress toward its commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change to peak carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 or sooner,\u201d Pechet said.He was speaking shortly after the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its direst warning yet on the future of the global climate.In the panel\u2019s report, released on Oct. 8, some of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists warned there are only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 C. Beyond this, even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people around the world, they said.The authors of the landmark report said urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, adding that this is affordable and feasible even though it lies at the more ambitious end of the Paris agreement that pledges to limit the global temperature rise to between 1.5 C and 2 C.The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 C was approved by the panel at its meeting in Incheon, South Korea, in early October and was one of the major scientific papers being presented at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Katowice from Dec. 2 to 14, where most governments are reviewing the Paris agreement.Charles Bedford, regional managing director for Asia-Pacific with global environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, said, \u201cThe report is a wake-up call and a reminder for everyone on what is at stake if we stick to business as usual.\u201dAs a global leader in tackling climate change, the Chinese government has long been proactive and focused on its targets and commitments, with policies that the country has already moved forward on, he said.Bedford added that China has for many years said it will remain focused on working toward its low-carbon development goals regardless of what other countries such as the United States decide to do.The panel\u2019s report followed the release on Oct. 1 of a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences warning that economic losses caused by drought could cost China $47 billion a year \uff0d more than double the current estimate \uff0d if global temperatures rise by 1.5 C above the preindustrial baseline.Jiang Tong, lead author of the Chinese study and a researcher with the National Climate Center at the China Meteorological Administration in Beijing, said, \u201cDrought losses have significantly increased in recent years across the globe.\u201dThe Paris agreement proposes to keep the global mean temperature increase to well below 2 C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 C, to reduce the related risk and impacts.One area the Chinese government has focused on has been the metals and mining sector, including steel mills, aluminum and copper smelters. In July, it published a three-year \u201cblue sky defense\u201d action plan aimed at improving the country\u2019s air quality.Liu Sifang, a senior consultant with global energy group Wood Mackenzie, said, \u201cThe government is attaching increasing importance to environmental protection.\u201dInspection groups have been sent to different regions to ensure industries are meeting the requirements to reduce pollution, he said, adding, \u201cMore important, stricter regulations have been introduced.\u201dLiu said every major city in China has been assigned targets to reduce pollution \uff0d regardless of the source.A group of leading scientists from China and the United Kingdom launched a groundbreaking report in London on Oct. 17 to show potential worst-case risks of climate change and to encourage politicians to increase mitigation efforts.The 150-page report is the first to highlight some \u201cdisturbing scenarios\u201d of the impact of climate change.Ye Qi, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy at Tsinghua University, said the report is particularly significant \u201cin bringing our attention to what kind of impact climate change will have on our cities, our economy, our lives and our society as a whole\u201d so that people globally can better relate to the importance of mitigation work.The scientists started to work on the report after an agreement between the Chinese and U.K. governments was signed during President Xi\u2019s visit to the U.K. in 2015.The report was due to be presented at the Katowice conference.Bedford, from The Nature Conservancy, said China\u2019s economic growth has been remarkable, but with this comes increased carbon dioxide emissions.\u201cRising sea levels and more extreme weather events such as Typhoon Mangkhut also put its heavily populated coast at risk. And there\u2019s public concern on broader environmental issues such as urban air, water quality and soil pollution,\u201d he said.Typhoon Mangkhut was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in Guam, the Philippines and South China in mid-September.Climate change will put pressure on water sources and increase the risk of droughts in China, which in turn will dramatically affect crops such as rice, Bedford said.\u201cBeing the world\u2019s largest rice producer and consumer, the country has already started to safeguard its food security,\u201d he said.Karl WilsonThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

{"Headline": "One of America\u2019s Most Vital Exports, Education, Never Goes Abroad, but It Still Faces Threats", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyIt\u2019s no mere coincidence that Jeffrey R. Brown, the dean of the Gies College of Business, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is also a scholar of risk management. At his first faculty meeting four years ago, Brown fretted that his school had become, like many American universities, overly dependent on a single source of money \u2014 roughly a fifth of tuition revenue came from Chinese students. \u201cI saw our reliance on China as a risk,\u201d says Brown, noting that 800 or so of the university\u2019s nearly 5,800 Chinese students attend the business school. \u201cAt the time, I was concerned that China could pull the plug on students coming to America. But then the U.S. political landscape shifted, and we were vulnerable to changing visa and immigration policies here, too. Both were threats we could not control.\u201dBrown approached the problem as a risk manager, which meant doing what no school has been known to do before: buying insurance to protect against a sudden drop in Chinese enrollment. The three-year policy requires the university to pay $424,000 annually for up to $60 million in coverage. The insurer, Lloyd\u2019s of London, will pay out a claim if a specific incident \u2014 a visa ban because of a government action, for example \u2014 causes the number of Chinese students in the colleges of business and engineering to decline by 18.5 percent over a 12-month period. The political risks have only grown since the policy went into effect. The trade war with China, visa restrictions and the anti-immigrant rhetoric coming from the White House are making it more complicated for international students to come to America. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough environment right now,\u201d Brown says. But the insurance gives him peace of mind. The school continues to invest in China, he says, but now \u201cwith the confidence that we are not doubling down on risk.\u201dOver the past decade, the explosion in the number of international students has turned education, almost by stealth, into one of the most vital American exports. The idea that a student taking classes in Iowa City or Ann Arbor can be counted as an export might seem strange. In economic terms, however, the student\u2019s situation is not so different from, say, a Japanese company buying American soybeans: Foreign money flows into the United States from abroad \u2014 except that in this case, the product doesn\u2019t leave the country.Nearly 1.1 million international students attended American colleges and universities in 2017. They generated $42.4 billion in export revenue, more than double the amount eight years ago, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Because far fewer Americans study abroad, the United States ran a $34.2 billion surplus in education in 2017.) Nafsa, a nonprofit group that supports international education, estimates that students from abroad created or sustained more than 455,000 jobs in the United States, almost nine times the number of American coal miners. The value of education is almost double the revenue from America\u2019s top agricultural export in 2017, soybeans ($21.6 billion). When other student spending is factored in \u2014 food, cars, clothes \u2014 education\u2019s total export value rivals that of pharmaceuticals ($51 billion) and automobiles ($53 billion). \u201cIn the public at large, there\u2019s little awareness that higher education is one of America\u2019s biggest exports,\u201d says Rajika Bhandari, senior adviser for research and strategy at the Institute of International Education. \u201cOr that this export drives American competitiveness.\u201dStill, the \u201cTrump effect\u201d acts as a powerful deterrent. Shortly before the 2016 election, I spoke with Chinese students at the University of Iowa who were so convinced that Trump\u2019s travel ban would extend to Chinese nationals that they canceled trips home out of fear that they would not be let back into the United States. Some of their friends in China opted to study in England to avoid the uncertainty. Their fears seemed unfounded at first. But as the trade war has escalated, along with reports of espionage and intellectual-property theft, Chinese students find themselves squarely in Trump\u2019s cross hairs. In November, according to The Financial Times, the White House even briefly discussed the idea of imposing a total ban on Chinese students \u2014 a radical option that inevitably brings back memories of the Chinese Exclusion Act, which kept out most Chinese for nearly 60 years before the outbreak of World War II.As a practical matter, the tightening of American visa restrictions hits students harder than dark grumblings. Beyond generating more visa denials and delays \u2014 the issuance of F-1 student visas declined 17 percent from 2016 to 2017 \u2014 Washington is targeting foreign students who apply for graduate work or training in technological areas. In June, citing national-security concerns, the government announced that visas for Chinese students in robotics, aviation and high tech could be reduced to just one year from five years. Last month, 65 colleges and universities signed a letter supporting a legal challenge to a new United States government policy that would make it easier to ban international students for overstaying their visas, calling international students \u201cessential to the fabric\u201d of higher education.\u201d Esther Brimmer, executive director and chief executive of Nafsa, laments the hostile turn: \u201cIt could take us years to rebuild the reputation of America as a nation that welcomes all to our campus communities.\u201dToday, again, Illinois is leading a pack of universities trying to \u201creap the largest possible returns\u201d from international students \u2014 and, with its insurance policy, to avoid any sudden losses. The number of Chinese students at Illinois, 5,797, remains one of the highest in the country, but in 2018, for the first time in decades, Chinese enrollment there dropped, by 2.2 percent. (The business school, Brown says, suffered no decline.) Even as national policy tightens, universities are intensifying recruitment efforts beyond China and India and trying to make students feel more welcome. In recent years, Purdue University has begun to reduce its intake of Chinese students in a move that will diversify its student body.It\u2019s shortsighted to think of this issue solely in terms of revenue: International students and scholars also spur American innovation and growth. Today, nearly a quarter of the founders of billion-dollar United States start-up companies first came here as international students, according to the National Foundation for American Policy.

{"Headline": "\u2018Hamilton\u2019 Leads a Record-Breaking Holiday Week on Broadway", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecords are falling like dominoes on Broadway.\u201cHamilton\u201d last week grossed more than $4 million \u2014 the first Broadway show ever to make that much money in a single week.The period between Christmas and New Year\u2019s always brings boffo business to Broadway, but even so, the week ending Dec. 30 was the best-attended (378,910 seats filled) and highest-grossing ($57.8 million) in Broadway history.An astonishing 28 shows grossed over $1 million, including eight that exceeded $2 million. After \u201cHamilton,\u201d the top grossers were \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($3.7 million) and \u201cWicked\u201d ($3.4 million), each of which ran nine performances (one more than usual) during the holiday week; and \u201cThe Illusionists,\u201d which magically made $3 million appear by holding 16 performances in seven days.The $4 million gross by \u201cHamilton\u201d was accomplished thanks to high ticket prices over just eight performances. The average \u201cHamilton\u201d ticket last week sold for $375, and the best seats at the box office were priced at $849. \u201cIt is a phenomenon, no question, and it\u2019s changing the dynamics of Broadway,\u201d Ms. St. Martin said.Multiple factors contributed to the overall boom \u2014 New York\u2019s enormous appeal as a tourist destination; Broadway\u2019s resurgent popularity as a form of entertainment; and the willingness of large numbers of people to pay high prices for the best seats at the hottest shows.The financial health of nonmusical plays is particularly significant because it suggests that producers can still prosper with commercial runs of those shows, which had long been a mainstay of the Broadway economy but have since been largely overshadowed by prebranded musicals.There are 20 productions of plays scheduled to open this season, many of them artistically ambitious and thematically timely, and two of them \u2014 \u201cThe Boys in the Band\u201d and \u201cThe Lifespan of a Fact\u201d \u2014 have already announced that they have recouped their investment costs.\u201cLast year my friends in the press were saying, \u2018The play is dead,\u2019 and now we\u2019re going to have one of the best play years in history,\u201d Ms. St. Martin said. \u201cThe work is resonating.\u201dBroadway grossed $1.8 billion during the calendar year that just ended, with attendance of 14.37 million. Those are both records, although the grosses are not adjusted for inflation; by comparison, in 2016 Broadway grossed $1.4 billion with attendance of 13.25 million.Even a war horse like \u201cChicago,\u201d 22 years into its run, reported its best year ever.The year\u2019s grosses were bolstered by the presence of Bruce Springsteen, whose \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d brought in $113 million over its 14-month run, but Ms. St. Martin said she was confident that overall grosses would remain strong even now that his show has ended.Statistics for the current Broadway season, which began in May, also show the industry\u2019s strength: Grosses are up 18.6 percent and attendance is up 11.2 percent compared with last season at this point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Picking Up Steam Now: The Bath", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a new generation, the tub is a place to rest, heal and get arty.Call her old-fashioned. \u201cI still write with a fountain pen,\u201d said Katy Klassman, who with her mother owns and runs a fashion boutique in Washington, D.C. \u201cI love to go to bed early with a paper book.\u201d Ms. Klassman is as analog driven in her self-care routines, especially her bath. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just born in the wrong century,\u201d she said. She remembers her grandmother bathing with an old-fashioned sponge and fragrant soap. \u201cIt was one of the things that made her for me the most glamorous woman in the world,\u201d she said.Ms. Klassman was talking about the kind of glamour that makes showering seem a dully perfunctory rite. Bathing, by contrast, is a steamy indulgence apt to conjure floods of cinematic imagery: Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra lounging in a lotus flower bath; Julia Roberts covered in suds in \u201cPretty Woman\u201d; and, on the brawnier side, Sean Connery as James Bond, enjoying a loll in an oversize tub.\u201cIn the past two years we have seen bath time taking off,\u201d said Alisha Ramos, the publisher of Girls\u2019 Night In, an online newsletter aimed at 25-to-34-year-olds seeking a respite from overcharged lives. For her followers and a widening circle of contemporaries, the bath is a place to unplug, to indulge in the ultimate luxury: taking time for oneself. \u201cThe rise of social media accelerated bathing\u2019s popularity,\u201d Ms. Ramos said. \u201cIt\u2019s become all about creating a beautiful setting that you want to capture and share.\u201d So much, then, for taking time to unplug.Log on to Instagram, with its flurry of suds-soaked celebrities \u2014 Cara Delevingne, Rihanna and Jordyn Woods among them \u2014 posting selfies from their tubs. Or browse #bathart, a hashtag teeming with images like that of a young woman lounging in a bath of finely sliced oranges and limes; another gaily surrounded by rubber duckies; and still others steeped in the kinds of fizzy, undulating colors produced by bath bombs, those wildly popular varicolored spheres that dissolve into a sea of psychedelia. \u201cPeople want an experience in the tub,\u201d said Brandi Halls, the director of brand communication for Lush, a maker of bath bombs. For many, that calls for a tub full of imagery worthy of a Pink Floyd poster or a frame from \u201cLiquid Sky.\u201d But bathing\u2019s reborn popularity can be as readily chalked up to an intensifying romance with rituals, according to Lucie Greene, a trend forecaster at J. Walter Thompson. Bathing, Ms. Greene said, offers \u201ca meaningfully slow experience that has its own meditative layers.\u201d According to a 2018 study by the Innovation Group, J. Walter Thompson\u2019s trend-forecasting unit, the recent fixation on bathing represents a sea change. \u201cEven five years ago, the bath might have been seen as a form of indulgence,\u201d Ms. Greene said. \u201cNow it\u2019s recognized as a form of therapy, a tool in maintaining a healthy mental outlook.\u201dIt is especially alluring to millennials, she said, many of whom are cutting back on drinking and late-night carousing in favor of alternative ways to relax. For Ed Burstell, the senior vice president for product innovation at Neiman Marcus, \u201ca bath is a form of mental medication.\u201d A self-described restless sleeper and proponent of aromatic balms and potions, Mr. Burstell champions the spalike benefits of a lingering soak, a practice that, like yoga, white-noise immersion and maintaining a sugar-free diet, is an adjunct of so-called self-care. Websites and stores like Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Anthropologie, and even mass merchants like Target, may aim to tease out shoppers\u2019 inner diva, pitching fizzy elixirs and exotic oils, but for bathing\u2019s most ardent devotees, it helps to have deep pockets. Consider the outpouring of pastel-tinted creams, oils and gels like Molton Brown Mesmerising Oudh Accord & Gold Bath and Shower Gel ($35), infused with gold flakes, and its Fiery Pink Pepperpod Body Wash ($32), redolent of a holiday in the Maldives. Or the Prosecco Bubble Bath from Antica Farmacista ($38), housed in a crystalline flacon and, the maker notes, \u201cgenerously enriched with honey, aloe vera, green tea and jojoba oil.\u201d Herbivore, a favorite with vegans and self-proclaimed purists of every stripe, recently introduced Amethyst Exfoliating Body Polish ($44), which, as its name suggests, derives its Instagram-worthy purplish hue from a heaping of crushed amethysts. Himalayan pink salt, sandalwood granules and chia seed oil enrich the Martini Emotional Detox Bath Soak, a potion from Goop purporting to \u201ctake the edge off and support spiritual growth and expanded consciousness.\u201d At $35, the Martini contains just enough product for three baths at $10 to $12.Like Gwyneth Paltrow (the Goop founder), Ellen Carey, who owns Seedgarden, a fashion showroom in New York, is a bathing enthusiast. \u201cDon\u2019t try to get me out of the house on Sunday,\u201d she said, joking. The extravagance of bath time extends to the tub itself. In more affluent households, vessels made of copper and stone can serve as the weighty centerpiece of a bathroom masquerading as a sybaritic temple. In its forthcoming 2018-2019 Industry Outlook Study, the National Kitchen & Bath Association forecasts a jump in bathtub sales from $9.69 billion for 2017 to $10.34 billion in 2018 and $10.86 billion in 2019. According to the study, soaking tubs, some with hand-painted finishes and others of hammered copper, are especially popular in the luxury market. The Global Wellness Institute predicts that the industry will continue to grow, particularly in the United States, where health care costs are on the rise. In such a climate, consumers are increasingly motivated to take charge of their own well-being, the G.W.I reports, noting that the growth of wellness is \u201cinversely correlated with economic and \u2018human well-being\u2019 downturns.\u201d But economy be damned. Bathing buffs are more drawn to a warm-water soak as a physical and emotional palliative. For Tug Rice, an artist, the bath is a seasonal comfort. Recently he posted a whimsical selfie on Instagram, a watercolor sketch that shows his lean frame immersed in bubbles. \u201cPrioritizing self-care in the new year!\u201d he wrote in the caption.Time for good books, tea with lemon and honey and hand sanitizer, he added \u2014 and long baths.

I\u2019m financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it\u2019s not surprising that I hadn\u2019t noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.Republicans, who under President Trump have been gutting the C.F.P.B., have long decried the agency as an overweening bureaucracy. To me it was an astonishingly user-friendly tool that cut through opaque corporate bureaucracy on my behalf. My experience with it shaped my perception of Warren as a brilliant policy innovator.If he runs for president, it will be with a single-minded focus on averting climate calamity, in part through an enormous investment in green jobs and infrastructure. \u201cWe have to have a mobilization of our nation\u2019s energies and intellectual capability and entrepreneurial zeal equivalent to our other great challenges that we have met, including World War II and the Apollo Project,\u201d he said.

Both of these visions are sweeping and progressive, but they seek to channel different energies toward different, if overlapping, goals. One is full of technocratic optimism. The other is populist and pugilistic. You can\u2019t compare them using the frameworks \u2014 insider vs. outsider, head vs. heart \u2014 that usually dominate campaign reporting. Evaluating them will require Democrats to think hard about their highest aspirations, to decide what is most important to them, and most menacing.Of course, there will be other candidates, other platforms, other conceptions of what the country is and could be. As the race goes on, strategic and process questions will come into play: Pundits will ponder whether candidates, particularly women candidates, are sufficiently likable and ask how they might appeal to swing voters while turning out the base. That part already feels exhausting and it hasn\u2019t even begun.But the primary season could also, maybe, be a chance to hash out big, forward-looking ideas. Later on, Democrats will have to debate the path to 270 Electoral College votes. For now, there\u2019s space to debate the path to a livable American future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Gulag for Muslims ", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn modern-day \u201cre-education\u201d prisons, Beijing is forcing ethnic Uighurs to forsake their religion. Why don\u2019t Muslim governments rise up in anger?Contributing Opinion WriterOne of the darkest episodes of the 20th century was the gulag \u2014 the Soviet system of forced labor camps where dissidents were imprisoned in terrible conditions, often to perish. The camps were established by Lenin, expanded by Stalin and finally exposed to the world by the great Russian author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, with his 1973 masterpiece, \u201cThe Gulag Archipelago.\u201d \u201cThin strands of human lives stretch from island to island of Archipelago,\u201d he wrote, and \u201cit is enough if you don\u2019t freeze in the cold, and if thirst and hunger don\u2019t claw at your insides.\u201dChinese authorities say they are alarmed about extremists among the Uighurs \u2014 and, in fact, a handful of terrorists have carried out attacks against government targets over the years. But those extremists arose partly in response to a decades-old policy of subjugation, along with ethnic colonialization, that Beijing has pursued against the Uighurs. That history suggests that Beijing\u2019s current \u201ccounterterrorism\u201d campaign will be only counterproductive \u2014 deepening a vicious cycle that authoritarian minds are often unable to understand, let alone break.That is all very meek given how grim the situation is \u2014 and how it compares to what we would have seen if the same persecution had been carried out by some other country, such as, say, Israel.Why is that? Why are Muslim leaders, especially those who love to be the champions of oppressed Muslims, so lenient toward China?A second reason for Muslim silence is that the Chinese government crackdown on Uighurs is based on a premise that law and order can be restored by eradicating enemies of the government and traitors within a society. This is authoritarian language that most Muslim leaders understand well. It is their own language.For Muslim autocrats and Islamists, a Confucian-Islamic alliance may still be alluring. China can look like a great model, in which the economy grows without Western nuisances like human rights, free speech or limited government. For Muslim societies, however, the Uighur crisis must be a wake-up call. It shows what can happen to Muslims when authoritarian governments embrace Islamophobia as state policy.Islamophobia exists in the liberal democracies of the West, too \u2014 but there it can be criticized by the news media, checked by the courts and constrained by liberal institutions and traditions. Muslims can still practice their religion freely, and can even become lawmakers by being elected to bodies like the United States Congress.For Muslim societies, in other words, a choice between freedom and dictatorship should not be too difficult. In freedom, you can live as a Muslim in safety and dignity. Under dictatorship, as China shows us, you can end up in a re-education camp.Mustafa Akyol is a senior fellow on Islam and modernity at the Cato Institute and the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Islamic Jesus.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Unification Plan From China Finds Few Takers in Taiwan", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Xi Jinping declared on Wednesday that he wants progress on China\u2019s decades-long quest to win control of Taiwan. But his proposal appeared unlikely to win over residents of the self-ruled island, who have seen Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms in rapid retreat under a similar deal.Mr. Xi did not lay down a timetable for absorbing Taiwan, which is something more hawkish voices in Beijing have urged. But as he nears his seventh year as president, he indicated that his patience had limits and that he wanted to bring Taiwan into ever-closer political, economic and cultural orbit around China.\u201cThat the two sides of the strait are still not fully unified is a wound to the Chinese nation left by history,\u201d Mr. Xi said in his direction-setting speech in the Great Hall of the People. The political divisions between China and Taiwan, he added \u201ccannot be passed on from generation to generation.\u201dBut even laced with this sense of urgency, Mr. Xi\u2019s recipe for bringing Taiwan closer to absorption into \u201cone China\u201d appeared unlikely to win over many on the island, even after its president, Tsai Ing-wen \u2014 openly loathed by Beijing \u2014 suffered bruising electoral losses in November.On the one hand, Mr. Xi threatened military force if Taiwanese leaders grasped for independence. On the other hand, Mr. Xi said that if Taiwan were to agree to unification, its rights would be ensured by the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that Beijing used in Hong Kong after it returned from British colonial control in 1997.\u201cXi Jinping\u2019s approach is to use a bigger stick and to make the carrot sweeter,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. But having seen Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and freedoms squeezed by Beijing in recent years, many Taiwanese people were likely to be suspicious of Mr. Xi\u2019s offers, he said.Virtually no section of the electorate in Taiwan would find \u201cone country, two systems\u201d an attractive goal, said Jonathan Sullivan, an associate professor at the University of Nottingham in Britain who studies the island\u2019s politics. \u201cTaiwan is not a colony \u00e0 la Hong Kong, and it has everything to lose and nothing to gain from agreeing to it,\u201d Professor Sullivan said.Even so, Mr. Xi had political motives to show that he was working to absorb Taiwan, Professor Sullivan said. \u201cHaving unification as a national aspiration is incredibly useful for the Chinese Communist Party, which stakes its legitimacy on economic growth and nationalism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe former is becoming more difficult to deliver, and so the latter becomes more important.\u201dFew experts believe that Mr. Xi\u2019s speech augured an eruption of conflict over Taiwan. But tensions could rise, especially as his speech jarred so much with comments from Ms. Tsai.Mr. Xi\u2019s speech marked 40 years since China set out a new approach to unification with Taiwan soon after the United States shifted diplomatic ties from the Republic of China \u2014 the name for the government on the island \u2014 to the communist government in Beijing.On Tuesday, Ms. Tsai promptly rejected \u201cone country, two systems\u201d as a basis for negotiations.\u201cHere I must reiterate that Taiwan will never accept \u2018one country, two systems,\u2019 \u201d she told reporters in Taipei, the capital of the island, in response to Mr. Xi\u2019s speech. \u201cDemocracy is a value and lifestyle cherished by the Taiwanese people.\u201dThe Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also rejected Mr. Xi\u2019s proposal. It said in an emailed comment that the Chinese government had already \u201cgravely wrecked Hong Kong, that window into \u2018one country, two systems.\u2019 \u201dMr. Xi portrayed Taiwanese as generally favoring unification with China. But only 3 percent of Taiwanese respondents in a survey published last August by National Chengchi University said they wanted unification now. An additional 12.5 percent said they preferred the status quo and eventual reunification.But in his speech, Mr. Xi signaled that he would be willing to play a long-term game in an effort to gain acceptance, if not support, in Taiwan for China\u2019s political goals.\u201cCompatriots on both sides of the strait are a family,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the one-China principle as a bedrock, there are no obstacles to any political party or group on Taiwan interacting with us.\u201dThe Chinese government was willing to open discussions with politicians and representatives from Taiwan, so long as they opposed independence for the island and accepted Beijing\u2019s formula for \u201cone China,\u201d Mr. Xi said. He also held out greater access to China\u2019s vast and growing economy. China already accounts for over 30 percent of Taiwan\u2019s trade, and the promised links could appeal to some Taiwanese cities looking to speed growth.Jason Hsu, a Taiwanese legislator who belongs to the Kuomintang, said Taiwanese voters were not likely to be directly influenced by Chinese overtures but were concerned about economic prosperity.\u201cMost Taiwanese voters are in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey care more about prosperity and managing the cross-strait relationship.\u201dAnalysts saw parallels between Mr. Xi\u2019s proposals and the \u201cunited front\u201d tactics that the Chinese Communist Party has evolved to divide, tame and co-opt potential opponents in China, Hong Kong and increasingly abroad.\u201cBehind the speech there is a clear intention, which is to intensify the united front work, to multiply the connections and bonds of dependence upon mainland China,\u201d said Professor Cabestan of Hong Kong Baptist University. \u201cFor someone who lives in Hong Kong, there are a lot of echoes of what\u2019s happened here.\u201dStill, Taiwan\u2019s diverse electorate, economy and politics made it much more difficult for China\u2019s divide-and-control approach to succeed there, he said. Ms. Tsai said she would oppose any Chinese efforts to shape Taiwan\u2019s decisions by recruiting support from local politicians and groups.\u201cThere must not be meddling in the Taiwanese people\u2019s elections through creating divisions and lures,\u201d Ms. Tsai said in response to Mr. Xi\u2019s speech. \u201cIt must be the government, or a public authority authorized by the government, that sits down for any talks.\u201dChris Buckley reported from Beijing, and Chris Horton from Yuli, Taiwan.Chris Buckley reported from Beijing.

{"Headline": "Big Tech May Look Troubled, but It\u2019s Just Getting Started", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled.In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash \u2014 Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank \u2014 to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.That is not the path the companies are taking.\u201cThe tech companies are not flinching,\u201d said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. \u201cNothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They\u2019re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.\u201dTo accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn\u2019t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.In total, Google\u2019s employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook\u2019s work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.\u201cFor all intents and purposes, we\u2019re only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. \u201cThe image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.\u201dThat\u2019s evident in how robust Big Tech\u2019s businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone \u2014 up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.\u201cMuch as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have a good clue,\u201d said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. \u201cThey\u2019re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.\u201dWhich leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech\u2019s favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon\u2019s North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.\u201cThey\u2019re in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,\u201d said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. \u201cThere is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I increasingly hear frustration from business leaders about structural trade issues. The military is concerned about aggressive geopolitical moves by Beijing. And prominent voices in both political parties are striking an increasingly confrontational tone. Legitimate concerns have led to a vicious cycle, with each negative development further poisoning an already shallow well of good will. The cycle has to be reversed. In the United States, the business community, policy analysts and the media should create a climate that encourages elected officials to pursue a constructive relationship. The same is true in China, albeit in a different political system. Leaders in both countries should recognize our imperative self-interest in working together on hugely consequential transnational issues, especially two threats to life on earth as we know it: nuclear weapons and climate change.In a conversation I recently led at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, alluded to this, remarking that \u201chistory will remember those who took the lead in the mist.\u201d The surest way for that to happen is to forge a constructive relationship between our two countries. Absent that, it is imperative that we put our differences aside to tackle these two existential challenges.As the two largest economies, the United States and China can set the tone for a global effort against climate change by investing in clean-energy technology, adopting strict environmental rules and encouraging their trading partners to do the same. (Of course, the current administration does not accept the reality of climate change, but future administrations will hopefully recognize the urgency of action.)Cooperation is also needed to address the spread or possible use of nuclear weapons. North Korea\u2019s continued development of fissile materials and missiles is an apparent contravention of its recent agreement with the United States. And North Korea isn\u2019t the only concern. Pakistan, for example, has a weak government and uncertain controls over its nuclear arsenal.The arc of human history is one of frequent conflict. Unless you believe human nature is likely to change, that suggests a serious risk that nuclear arms will be used at some point by state or nonstate actors. United States-China cooperation to limit nuclear proliferation among states, the diversion of nuclear material to terrorists and other risks would make us all safer.The most promising prospect for tackling these challenges is to put our countries\u2019 economic relationship back on steady footing. The tenor of the relationship gets set at the top, so it\u2019s time for Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping to work out their current trade disputes within a framework that prioritizes cooperation. The administration\u2019s antipathy toward China sometimes seems driven by an irrational anger over trade deficits. Virtually all mainstream economists see the president\u2019s theory that our trade relationship should be evaluated by the bilateral trade deficit as analytically wrong.On the other hand, China has contravened some widely accepted trade and investment norms by, for example, subsidizing exports, restricting imports, protecting national champions, imposing buy-China mandates and, at times, requiring foreign companies to share their intellectual property with Chinese partners.These structural policies present a complex problem. They\u2019re embedded in China\u2019s economic model, and the United States needs to recognize that it can\u2019t simply demand that China change that model. And China needs to recognize that its system creates some unacceptable consequences in the trade arena. From there, the two countries should be able to identify reasonable solutions. Washington\u2019s approach should have been multilateral and quiet, joining with other countries, including our European allies, Brazil, Mexico and Japan to approach Beijing as a united bloc; hopefully it\u2019s not too late to walk this path.We\u2019ve bridged our economic and political differences before. When I served as Treasury secretary in the 1990s, the United States and China worked together to stem the Asian financial crisis. And though the current administration has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, bilateral cooperation was integral to its creation in 2015.We must look beyond the daily headlines about trade to the more consequential problem of ever-greater friction between the United States and China. For the future of humanity, not to mention our immediate economic interests, our two countries must recognize our mutual self-interest in a constructive relationship and act accordingly.Robert E. Rubin, secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999, is co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations.Advertisement"}

On Thursday, the trip that had briefly cost less than $700 appeared on the Cathay Pacific website for about $16,000 for a fully flexible fare.Mr. Burgess said that ticketing errors happen often when airlines deal with bookings to hundreds of destinations and in dozens of currencies.

Here Are 4 Key Factors Affecting Stocks and the Economy", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "Advertisement\nThe S&P 500 in 20183,000Daily closes9/20 PEAK2,930.752,7502,5002,250Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.The S&P 500 in 20183,000Daily closes9/20 PEAK2,930.752,7502,5002,250JFMAMJJASONDThe S&P 500 in 20183,000Daily closes9/20 PEAK2,930.752,7502,5002,250Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.After an unexpectedly bad year for the stock market, investors are looking for clues about what 2019 will bring.The hope on Wall Street is that the underlying economy of the United States is sound, that the recent selling will burn itself out and that stocks will resume their record-setting climb. But the risk is that the plunge, the worst annual decline in a decade, could be the start of something more sinister.The forces that pushed the S&P 500 down 6.2 percent in 2018 are still in place. The economy is still doing well, but it does not appear to be as strong as it once was. President Trump is lashing out at the Federal Reserve and the central bank\u2019s interest-rate increases pose a risk to corporate profits and investors\u2019 appetite for stocks. America\u2019s trade war with China continues, and the technology giants that dominate the stock market face heightened scrutiny about their business practices.As investors try to gauge the seriousness of these risks, stocks could lurch in different directions at each new event. A meeting of the Fed later this month, an earnings report in February or a trade-negotiation deadline in March could all prove to be catalysts for a big rise or fall.But Wall Street\u2019s top stock pickers are still expecting gains this year, even if they\u2019re not quite as boisterous in their predictions as they once were.\u201cIt could get more frightening before it gets better,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the research firm Leuthold Group. \u201cBut I think we survive for another run.\u201dLast year was a reminder of how unpredictable stock markets can be. In January, with corporate tax cuts in place, the outlook for the market in the United States was great. And stocks did hit a record high in September, with Apple and Amazon becoming the first publicly traded American companies to be valued at more than $1 trillion. But 2018 was also turbulent, with markets falling sharply in February and again at the end of the year.The S&P 500 narrowly avoided one grim milestone: a 20 percent drop from its high, a decline that would signal the start of a bear market. The index ended 2018 down 14.5 percent from its high point, and a bear market could yet be in store should stocks experience another decline similar to what they went through in early December. If that happens, the pessimism that has hovered over the stock market could leach into the rest of the economy, as companies grow wary of taking risks, expanding or adding more workers.Here are the factors that will help determine whether that happens this year.Interest rates in 20183.5%10-year Treasury note yield3.02.52.01.51.00.50Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.Interest rates in 20183.5%10-year treasury note yield3.02.52.01.51.00.50JFMAMJJASONDInterest rates in 20183.5%10-year Treasury note yield3.02.52.01.51.00.50Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.Rising interest rates, and expectations about where those rates are headed, may have weighed on stock prices more than anything else in 2018.With the United States\u2019s economy humming, the Fed increased its target rate four times in 2018, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is the basis for debt like home mortgages and corporate loans, climbed to its highest level since 2011 before falling back. When borrowing costs rise too much, they can be restrictive. Companies and consumers pull back, and the economy suffers.In the worst case, a recession could occur.Stocks tumbled as investors became increasingly concerned that the Fed, under a new chairman, Jerome H. Powell, would raise interest rates too far and send a chill through the American economy.Only more data on the state of the economy will ease the concerns about growth. If investors see the economy growing steadily, jitters over the Fed\u2019s intentions and the recession fears that gripped stocks could fade.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see if the market was wildly hysterical about a recession,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.If not, then investors could hang on the Fed\u2019s every move, and monetary policy meeting, in 2019.Heading into 2018, in the days after Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts were enacted, investors were mostly buoyant about his presidency and tolerant of his unpredictable declarations on Twitter.That bullishness persisted even after it became clear that Mr. Trump was serious about imposing restrictions on trading partners as a way of gaining concessions from them. But as the trade war continued, unresolved tensions with China started to become a concern, and Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations started to make investors jumpy.When Mr. Trump referred to himself on Twitter as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d the message helped spur a drop of more than 3 percent in the S&P 500.....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAINIt wasn\u2019t just the tweets about China that began to bother investors. Mr. Trump also roiled the markets with criticism of the Fed, which he blamed for the stock market turmoil.This is a change for the market. When the investment bank RBC Capital Markets surveyed big investors in December about what kept them up at night, Mr. Trump topped the list (interest rates and the trade war ranked second and third).The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch - he can\u2019t putt!When it comes to Mr. Trump, investors have a lot to consider. They will have to weigh whether a partial government shutdown will dampen the economy; what a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats or staff turnover at the White House could mean; and what might happen if the United States and China can\u2019t reach a trade deal by a March 2 deadline.Commodity prices in 2018PRICE OF OILPRICE OF COPPER$100a barrel$4.00per poundBrent crude futures contractsGeneric futures contracts$3.28803.00$66.8760$2.682.00$54.15401.002000JFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJASONDCommodity prices in 2018PRICE OF OIL$100a barrel80$66.8760Brent crudefutures contracts$54.1540JFMAMJJASONDPRICE OF COPPER3.50per pound$$3.283.00$2.682.50Genericfutures contracts2.00JFMAMJJASONDCommodity prices in 2018PRICE OF OILPRICE OF COPPER$100a barrel$4.00per poundBrent crude futures contractsGeneric futures contracts$3.28803.00$66.8760$2.682.00$54.15401.002000JFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJASONDThe trade war\u2019s most evident impact so far has been in large overseas economies, which appear to be taking a turn for the worse.China, Japan and the European Union showed signs of slowing down late in 2018, and reliable indicators of global growth like the price of oil and copper are flashing warnings.The European economy could also be hit hard if Britain crashes out of the European Union without an agreement that keeps trade flowing freely. That could be avoided if Parliament approves a withdrawal deal Prime Minister Theresa May has struck with the union. But that is no sure thing. Mrs. May, lacking the necessary support, was forced to delay a vote originally set for last month until mid-January. She has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to extract changes from European officials in hopes of improving the chances of passage when that vote comes.If Parliament ultimately rejects Mrs. May\u2019s proposal, investors will probably remain nervous. And support may grow among lawmakers for a second referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union. If that happens, stocks \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 may rise on the hope that Britons vote to stay.Technology stocks versus the S&P 500 in 2018+100%Netflix+75Amazon+50Microsoft+25AppleGoogleS&P 5000Facebook\u201325+25%0S&P 500\u201325\u201350Technology stocks versus the S&P 500 in 2018+100%Netflix+75Amazon+50Microsoft+25AppleGoogleS&P 5000Facebook\u201325+25%0S&P 500\u201325\u201350Technology stocks versus theS&P 500 in 2018PERCENT CHANGE FROM+100%Netflix+75Amazon+50Microsoft+25AppleGoogleS&P 5000Facebook\u201325+25%0S&P 500\u201325\u201350The market\u2019s fate also depends on whether investors fall back in love with large technology companies. Last year, companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix helped push key stock benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to records, and then dragged those indexes down when the companies went into free-fall.The tech giants\u2019 shares plunged in part because they were deemed to be too expensive. Put another way, investors went from being optimistic that the companies\u2019 future earnings would be terrific, to worried that they wouldn\u2019t.Some of the large tech firms also face substantial problems in their own operations that could take time to resolve. Apple, for example, counts on China as both a market where it sells iPhones and a manufacturing hub.Facebook is spending large sums of money to try to protect its network from interference. Any sign that its systems have been abused with the goal of swinging an election could subject it to regulation.Facebook is not alone in facing this concern. Some analysts say that large tech companies are now in a position to similar to what big banks confronted after the financial crisis of 2008.\u201cThe tech companies are a heck of a lot better run than the financial companies were in 2007,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, \u201cbut their incentives may not be aligned with the best interests of employees and shareholders.\u201dThe United States economy has to grow at a strong enough pace to deliver the corporate earnings that investors are hoping for. But if the economy grows quickly, investors may return to worrying about higher interest rates.If the Fed can tread a delicate middle ground, the trade war winds down and the economies of Europe and China stabilize, a recovery in stock prices could hold.\u201cI am not sure the upside for the market is higher than where we\u2019ve already been,\u201d Mr. Paulsen, the strategist, said, \u201cbut 2019 could still be a good year.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the deadline for a trade agreement between the United States and China.

{"Headline": "A Trump County Confronts the Administration Amid a Rash of Child Cancers", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt first, families put the illnesses down to misfortune. But as cases mounted, parents started to ask: Could it be something in the air or water?Now, families in a county that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump are making demands of his administration that collide directly with one of his main agendas: the rolling back of health and environmental regulations.But the parents\u2019 demands also reach well beyond immediate concerns about the chemicals under their feet. Twice last year, parents from Johnson County traveled to Washington to urge the administration to stick with stronger controls.The E.P.A. confirmed that the chemicals were present near the Franklin site and said that fewer than 10 of 37 homes it had tested had potential air quality issues. The agency said its testing was continuing and that, if necessary, homes would be fitted with devices to clean the air. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to see so many cancers in a relatively small community,\u201d said Dr. Paolo Boffetta, professor in environmental medicine and public health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Even so, he stressed that there was little research linking childhood cancers to TCE. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean an association doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cBut studies have not been able to confirm it.\u201d Motria Caudill, a scientist at the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which investigates environmental hazards, said at a community meeting in Franklin in November that it was still too early to draw conclusions. Her agency was still working with others, she said, \u201cjust to see what is going on.\u201d  \u201cWhen will this cleanup be done and gone,\u201d asked Sonya Hallett, a local philanthropy consultant and mother of one, \u201cand not hazardous to people who are living around it?\u201dHer daughter Chelsea learned when she was 12 that she had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. After chemotherapy, Chelsea, now 18, is in remission; she dreams of working in the beauty industry.\u201cWhen it comes to public health, we can go against party lines. And I don\u2019t agree with trying to roll back the E.P.A.\u2019s role,\u201d said Steve Barnett, Franklin\u2019s mayor and a Republican. \u201cBack in the day, there weren\u2019t any rules. That\u2019s why there was so much contamination,\u201d he said. Many members of If It Was Your Child in the Franklin area play down the politics, noting that both parties have let the cleanup fall by the wayside. Nevertheless, their demands come at a time when the Trump administration has weakened the very rules that could prevent another Franklin.\u201cWe should not have to fight Republicans or Democrats to save our children. It\u2019s not a political fight for us,\u201d said Stacie Davidson, a Trump voter who co-founded the parents\u2019 group with Mrs. Rhinehart (who didn\u2019t vote for Mr. Trump). Still, she said, she did not regret her vote. \u201cTrump\u2019s a businessman. There are great things he can do for our country. But he\u2019s used to building high rises for money,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not as environmentally savvy. Our hope is that he surrounds himself with people who are more knowledgeable.\u201dDespite the emergence of alternatives to TCE, the Trump administration has stalled action on restricting its use. \u201cThere have been greener alternatives to TCE for years,\u201d said Tom Forsythe, an executive vice president at Kyzen, a Tennessee cleaning-materials company, who joined E.P.A. officials in a conference call in August 2017 to lay out other options.\u201cShe said, \u2018Mommy, something\u2019s not right,\u2019 and I knew we weren\u2019t going to get much more time,\u201d Mrs. Rhinehart said, recalling their final conversation. \u201cI gave her some medication and she drifted off to sleep.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Strong Hiring and Fed Chief\u2019s Reassurance on Rates Delight Investors", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA blockbuster jobs report and reassuring comments from the Federal Reserve chairman reminded investors Friday to relish, at least for now, the economy\u2019s undeniable strengths.Markets reacted buoyantly, after lurching for weeks over a faltering outlook at home and signs of a global slowdown.The Labor Department report showed one of the strongest months of job gains in the last decade, with employers adding 312,000 to payrolls in December. Wages, which had been lagging until recently, showed impressive gains.He also sought to ease concerns about the stability of the central bank. When asked whether he would resign if President Trump asked him to, Mr. Powell simply said, \u201cNo.\u201dWall Street\u2019s enthusiastic response to the jobs numbers was magnified by Mr. Powell\u2019s comments. The S&P 500 index closed up more than 3 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s an unequivocally phenomenal report all the way around,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. \u201cAnyone that finds something negative in this report is simply cherry picking.\u201dEconomists offered raves that could appear on a movie poster or a book jacket \u2014 \u201cExtraordinary!\u201d \u201cBlowout,\u201d \u201cWow!\u201d The figures, they said, offer a resounding response to the question of whether a recession is imminent: \u201cNever mind!\u201d said David Berson, chief economist of Nationwide. \u201cThe fears of the economy tipping into a recession now have clearly been overstated.\u201dMr. Trump welcomed the stellar showing in televised remarks delivered in the White House Rose Garden. \u201c312,000 jobs was a tremendous number and obviously having a big impact on the stock market today,\u201d he said, adding that the pickup in wage growth was \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d\u201cThere are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China,\u201d Mr. Hassett said.The stock market has been in the midst of its worst decline since the financial crisis.\u201cWe\u2019re listening sensitively to the messages markets are sending,\u201d Mr. Powell said Friday. But investors, he said, \u201care way ahead of the data.\u201dIndeed, economists insist that there is more to celebrate than to fret over. In recent months, the unemployment rate has been hovering near a 50-year nadir. (The jobless rate rose last month, to 3.9 percent, but largely because new workers barreled into the labor force, suggesting that companies are luring stragglers back.) Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, indicating confidence in their ability to find jobs.Wages, which for months only inched up, have begun to pick up more quickly. December\u2019s year-over-year increase hit 3.2 percent, tying October for the biggest surge since 2009. The recovery has gone on for so long that it has finally begun to benefit the lowest-paid workers, who have seen the biggest pay gains.The competition for employees has become excruciating for people like Michael Haith, the chief executive of Teriyaki Madness, a fast-casual Japanese food chain. The restaurant needs to staff 50 new locations next year, which means hiring up to 1,000 workers. That\u2019s not an easy feat in \u201ca brutal market\u201d for employers, Mr. Haith said.He vies for workers with big brands like Burger King. Rival businesses have sent recruiters into Teriyaki Madness stores to poach his employees with offers of higher salaries. In Colorado, where the chain is based, he\u2019s also fending off marijuana farmers, who pay trimmers up to $17 an hour.\u201cGood employees can pretty much go wherever they want,\u201d Mr. Haith said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an arms race.\u201d His shops have increased wages by $1 or $2 an hour in the last year, just to keep up. He\u2019s not alone. Food-service workers nationwide got particularly big pay bumps last year, according to the latest federal data.Moves like that are part of what made 2018 \u201ca banner year for the labor market,\u201d said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter. And the 99-month streak of job gains could get even longer. There are still Americans who do not have jobs or are not clocking as many hours as they would like. The share of people who have part-time positions but would prefer to work full time is higher today than it was in 2007.And a far smaller share of the American population is working today than before the recession. That decline is partly because of the aging of the baby boom generation. But even among people in their prime working years, employment is down from before the recession, and far below its peak at the height of the dot-com boom.\u201cWe are not yet at maximum employment,\u201d Ms. Pollak said.Over all, employers added more jobs in 2018 than they did in 2017, at a monthly average of 220,000. But last year was unique, because Congress passed a big corporate tax cut that essentially bathed a sizzling economy in lighter fluid.\u201cPeople got used to these eye-popping job-growth numbers,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, director of research for the job-search site Indeed. Even if hiring slows in the coming months, she said, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that anything\u2019s wrong, it just means we are heading back to normal.\u201dAnd even Friday\u2019s stellar jobs numbers come with caveats. Each month\u2019s figures are revised twice, and provide snapshots of the past, not the future.

{"Headline": "Cars That Are Intelligent and Connected Hold the Keys to the Future ", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareAutomakers, local authorities and tech giants are all racing peers to new tech horizons.The Chinese government said it is paying great attention to the development of intelligent connected vehicles and considers the sector a vital way to ease the burden on transportation, energy consumption and environmental pollution, a top official said.\u201cBy 2020, the market scale of the country\u2019s intelligent connected vehicles sector is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion),\u201d said Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei at the World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference held in Beijing from Oct. 18 to 21.\u201cA new era of the automobile industry is here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe development of intelligent connected vehicles can drive the technological reform and upgrading of the automobile industry.\u201dWith the Chinese government fostering the development of intelligent connected vehicles, several cities have enacted laws and regulations for autonomous driving trials, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province, and Changchun in Jilin province.Chen Jining, mayor of Beijing, said the capital city has regarded the intelligent connected vehicles sector as one of the key development directions for advanced industry since 2017, and has introduced special supportive policies to promote open road tests for self-driving vehicles.Beijing will commit itself to taking the lead in building the fifth-generation internet of vehicles to form a complete technological system of intelligent connected vehicles that meet the requirements of advanced autonomous driving, known as Level 4, said the white paper by the Beijing Commission of Economy and Information Technology, issued on the sidelines of the conference.A 123,552-acre pilot zone will be established and over 1,242 miles of roads will be earmarked in Beijing for testing intelligent connected vehicles.By mid-October in 2018, Beijing had opened 44 road sections with a total length of 76 miles for automakers to test their autonomous driving technology, according to the white paper.Chen said the intelligent connected vehicle industry, as a strategic development direction in the new era, is closely related to a wide range of industries. Therefore, its improvement requires joint efforts from all parties.China\u2019s major internet giants are already embracing the trend and betting big on the promising market.Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc. has taken the lead in China to realize fully automatic driving under the mixed road conditions of urban roads, beltways and expressways, and has achieved mass production of the Apolong, China\u2019s first Level 4 fully self-driving minibus. It plans to ship the buses to Japan early in 2019.Baidu has been engaged in the automobile industry since 2013.\u201cThe Apollo project launched by Baidu in 2017 has become the world\u2019s largest intelligent driving environment,\u201d said Robin Li, chairman and CEO of Baidu.The Apollo intelligent driving system has attracted 129 eco-partners and over 10,000 developers to create products so far. Due to the open platform, many \u201cnew species\u201d of autonomous driving have become involved, such as driverless trucks, unmanned delivery vehicles, unmanned sanitation cars and autonomous wheelchairs.Li said Baidu has pushed forward with a series of initiatives aimed at limiting unintended consequences from artificial intelligence, as the internet giant has taken safety and security as its first principles in the development of autonomous driving.E-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has been developing its own internet-connected vehicle technology. The technology giant collaborated with SAIC Motor Co. and launched the internet-connected model Roewe RX5, sparking a buying frenzy.Alibaba said it believes the development of intelligent connected vehicles should not be limited to the product itself, but expand the vision from the car to the road.\u201cIt\u2019s worth thinking about whether smart cars can effectively use road resources,\u201d said Wang Jian, chairman of the Alibaba Group Technical Committee. \u201cThe internet should be another form of infrastructure for cars, just as roads are.\u201dAlibaba\u2019s plans for automatic driving run alongside its vehicle-road synergetic project, which sees autonomous vehicles driving in an information-based environment and obtaining required road environment information from the intelligent transportation system.Wang said technological progress is closely related to the optimization of urban resources.\u201cOnly when the least physical resources are used to support the development of transportation, the era of intelligent connected vehicles will really begin,\u201d he said.Underpinning that goal is Alibaba\u2019s acceleration into real-world testing of autonomous driving. The company announced in September that its driverless fleet had been granted test license plates by the authorities in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province.Another internet giant, Tencent Holdings Ltd., is not far behind. Currently, Tencent has signed strategic cooperation agreements with FAW, BMW, GAC, Changan and other automakers. Several models powered by Tencent\u2019s internet of vehicles system, AI in Car, are already on the market.Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent, said the company is designing a voice interaction system to help drivers safely send and receive messages, minimizing drivers\u2019 distractions.\u201cCarmakers are the leaders of the intelligent connected vehicle industry, and Tencent\u2019s position is clearly as an \u2018assistant\u2019 to carmakers, which helps the automobile industry achieve transformation and upgrading,\u201d Ma said.\u201cNo automotive enterprise can provide all the resources and capabilities required to produce an intelligent connected vehicle. The future of the automobile industry needs efforts from internet tech giants and traditional carmakers,\u201d he said.His comments were echoed among major Chinese carmakers.\u201cTraditional automobile enterprises and internet technology companies are naturally and strongly complementary,\u201d said Xu Heyi, chairman of Beijing Automotive Group Co., or BAIC Group.BAIC Group unveiled its five-year plan, which aims to equip all of its products with world-leading self-driving or intelligent connected technologies by 2020.\u201cBAIC should strengthen its industrial presence in high-performance sensors, controllers, computing platforms, automatic driving systems and high-precision maps,\u201d Xu said.The group will cooperate with world-leading electronics company Bosch, Chinese tech giant Baidu, Chinese voice technology firm iFlytek Co., and other tech firms to integrate high-quality resources across the globe and to build an open intelligent connected vehicle ecosystem, Xu said.BAIC is not the first carmaker that has decided to build such an open vehicle ecosystem.BYD Co. Ltd. has launched its own car app platform, D++. Using the platform, app developers can gain access to 66 control rights, 341 sensors and extensive vehicle data.\u201cWe are the first car brand to open all sensors and controls,\u201d said Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD. \u201cIt is also the first step in the process of establishing a fully open vehicle ecosystem.\u201dThe platform has already attracted dozens of partners, including Baidu with its self-driving Apollo system, online security company 360 Security Technology Inc., and AI specialist Horizon Robotics Inc.Xu HeThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

And finally, Ashley and the columnists talk about their hopes for 2019, including visions of Stacey Abrams in office, an \u201cArgument\u201d HBO special, and prison sentences for the Trumps.Background Reading: I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \u201creasonable\u201d elites. I\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have three small children, two girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.I\u2019ve been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use \u201cliberal\u201d as an epithet, but that\u2019s basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.I\u2019ve worked at The Times since 1999 and have been an Op-Ed columnist since 2016. I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.My politics are left of center. But I\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \u2014 and they\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.This week\u2019s show is produced by Alex Laughlin for Transmitter Media, with help from Caitlin Pierce.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren Wants to Stop Inequality Before It Starts", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRedistribution is important, but it comes too late. Mr. Vogel is a political scientist who studies how governments and markets interact.As the Democrats take over the House and Democratic presidential hopefuls begin the slog toward the 2020 primaries, their party is also debating its economic policy vision for the future.In contrast, democratic socialists like Senator Bernie Sanders represent the traditional liberal agenda of redistribution through the tax system as well as generous social-welfare spending. Redistributive policies take the market allocation of profits as a given and devise ways to moderate the resulting inequalities after the fact.Let me be clear: We need all of the above to combat the rampant inequality of wealth and power in the United States today. We need progressive taxation to narrow the income gap and to generate revenue for public investment. And we need government support for child care, medical care and other services to support those who cannot work and to empower those who can.But the Democratic Party would be smart to embrace Senator Warren\u2019s approach and a broader pre-distribution agenda as its next big idea because it deals with the root causes of inequality in America and therefore the voter frustration that helped make Donald Trump president.Pre-distribution is less costly than redistribution because it mostly entails regulatory reforms rather than big spending items, like free college or job guarantees. So it would not provoke many Americans\u2019 deep-seated mistrust of big government as much as calls for redistribution would.Conservatives argue that pretax earnings simply reflect the free operation of the market, but they don\u2019t. There is no pristine free market \u2014 just real-world markets thoroughly sullied by imbalances of power and regulations that favor corporations over workers. We should not be shy about revising these regulations to achieve more equitable growth. This would not undermine the capitalist economy; it would enrich it.Last summer, Senator Warren introduced the Accountable Capitalism Act, which tries to tackle the deeper causes of inequality in wealth and power in our country. It would require large corporations to obtain a federal charter of corporate citizenship. Employees would elect at least 40 percent of board members. Executives would have to hold the stock shares they receive as compensation for at least five years. And corporations would have to get approval from 75 percent of their shareholders and 75 percent of their directors to make political campaign donations.Corporations are legal entities with distinct privileges, like limited liability, so it would be perfectly reasonable for the government to require corporate boards to include labor representatives. This would encourage corporations to maximize profits by investing in their workers rather than by cutting labor costs.Beyond corporations, a broader pre-distribution agenda would include labor regulation, financial regulation and antitrust. For example, the government should revise labor regulations to strengthen employees\u2019 bargaining power, which would give them a fairer share of corporate returns. The government should crack down on noncompete clauses, which undermine workers\u2019 ability to sell their labor to the highest bidder. And it should restrict mandatory arbitration clauses in employment contracts, which require workers to give up their right to take their employers to court; such clauses were endorsed by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in May.This pre-distribution approach to labor would likely appeal to swing voters \u2014 in particular, ones who voted for both Barack Obama and Mr. Trump \u2014 more than the job guarantees proposed by Senator Sanders because pre-distribution means fair pay rather than government largess.Likewise, financial regulation is not just about preventing financial institutions from taking excessive risks or protecting small investors from their own folly. It is also about something more fundamental: who gets the returns from financial activity. On antitrust, the government should be warier about corporate mergers, and more aggressive in stopping dominant firms from squashing their competitors. Over the past few decades, weak antitrust enforcement has meant higher profits for companies that dominate their markets, fewer opportunities for challengers, larger salaries for managers, higher prices for consumers and lower wages for workers.Financial regulation and antitrust are central to Ms. Warren\u2019s proposals for leveling the economic playing field. She came to prominence for her strong advocacy of consumer financial protection, and she has pushed for tougher antitrust policies to curtail the economic and political power of large corporations.The pre-distribution agenda, while rooted in the minutiae of government regulation, actually has a simple core message. It is not about rigging the system to benefit the poor and the middle class, but about unrigging it from benefiting the wealthy and the powerful. It is about shaping markets to allocate returns from economic activity more fairly in the first place rather than trying to correct inequities after the fact. In essence, it is about giving consumers more value for their dollar and workers the wages they are due. What could be the problem with that?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Takes Reins of Italian Bank to Prevent Wider Crisis", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank took control of a troubled Italian bank Wednesday, an unprecedented step that spotlighted the risks to the eurozone\u2019s financial system from political chaos in Rome and a sputtering economy.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bank large enough to cause systemic crisis,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at Italy\u2019s treasury who operates LC Macro Advisors, a consultancy in London. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have seen that even small banks can cause huge problems.\u201d\u201cThe current government is not prepared for a full-fledged banking crisis,\u201d Mr. Codogno said.The action by Europe\u2019s central bank on Wednesday reassured investors so far that the vulnerabilities of Banca Carige, the 10th-largest lender in Italy, would not provoke a broader crisis.The central bank\u2019s intervention was absorbed with relative calm by financial markets. The Euro Stoxx Banks index fell about 2 percent on a day when most stocks were down.But the question of who will buy Banca Carige \u2014 and whether shareholders will be responsible for some of its debt \u2014 is likely to heighten tensions between the central bank and Italy\u2019s coalition government.Finding a buyer will be difficult. If the bank\u2019s troubles deepen, the central bank, under European rules, would be obliged to make shareholders and creditors bear some of the losses.That could put the central bank at odds with the government in Rome. The coalition of the far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement has so far tried to defend the interests of shareholders and bondholders, who are often middle-class Italians.Banca Carige could also create political conflict in Brussels. Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament who speaks for the Green faction on financial issues, called for an investigation of whether earlier attempts to rescue Banca Carige violated European Union rules on state aid.Mr. Giegold said in a statement Wednesday that other Italian banks last year were strong-armed into providing Banca Carige with fresh capital, which proved to be inadequate.\u201cThe coordinated rescue now looks like a waste of money by the already weakened Italian banking system,\u201d Mr. Giegold said.The challenges facing the banks \u2014 and Italy\u2019s economy \u2014 have increased since the populist government took power in June.Plans in Rome to reverse cuts in pensions and give cash to poor people undercut investors\u2019 confidence in the government\u2019s ability to repay the national debt. As a result, investors have demanded higher interest rates on Italian government bonds.The instability has been poison for Italian banks because the rates on government bonds act as a benchmark for all types of credit. Banks have had to borrow at far higher rates than banks in other European countries.Banca Carige, which has roots going back to the time of Christopher Columbus, is paying an astronomical 16 percent annual interest on recently issued bonds.The yields on Italian bonds have tempered since last month when the government backed down in a confrontation with the European Commission over its spending plan, which would have broken European Union rules on debt limits. That has eased the pressure on banks.But the Italian economy has never fully recovered from 2008. Businesses went bankrupt then, and many borrowers lost their jobs or are earning far less.For Banca Carige, that meant borrowers were behind in payments or not making payments at all. More than a quarter of Banca Carige\u2019s outstanding loans are considered nonperforming.Confidence about the future was at its lowest in six years, the survey found. \u201cThe outlook for 2019 is not encouraging,\u201d Rosie Colthorpe, an analyst at Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients Wednesday.The central bank\u2019s intervention was prompted by the resignation Wednesday of a majority of Banca Carige\u2019s board of directors. They quit after the bank\u2019s largest shareholders, members of the wealthy Malacalza family, declined last month to support plans to raise more capital.The temporary administrators appointed by the central bank Wednesday include the existing chief executive, Fabio Innocenzi, and the chairman, Pietro Modiano. Both had joined the bank recently. They will have more powers as central bank appointees than they would as regular managers, including the right to set the agenda for shareholders\u2019 meetings.\u201cThe decision to impose temporary administration is an early intervention measure aimed at ensuring continuity and pursuing the objectives of a strategic plan,\u201d the European Central Bank said in a statement.Advertisement"}

So here\u2019s to hope, both economic and political.Opinion ColumnistIn the spirit of a new year, I give you a double dose of optimism this morning. First, some political optimism, via a few of the wiser writers about democracy:I\u2019ll echo the last part of Mounk\u2019s tweet: Let\u2019s fight. Democracy remains more threatened than I ever expected it to be in my lifetime. And there is indeed plenty of bad news, like the inauguration this week of a militaristic potential autocrat in Brazil. But like the writers quoted here, I see more reason for hope than at the start of either of the previous two years.The main reason is that people have started to become more politically engaged and speak up for democracy. I hope it continues.The short answer is no.In truth, he wrote, academic research pointed to a different conclusion: \u201cExpansions don\u2019t die of old age. They die because something specific killed them. It can be a wrong-footed central bank, the popping of a financial bubble or a shock from overseas. But age itself isn\u2019t the problem.\u201dBut don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that a recession is inevitable this year. The best rule about predicting recessions is that virtually no one can reliably do so.To see where the economy is headed, keep an eye on the major indicators \u2014 like stocks, bonds and the job market \u2014 and don\u2019t rely too much on short-term movements. The next data I\u2019ll be watching will be the monthly jobs report that comes out on Friday.And the most important indicator in that report is the number of jobs that the economy created in December. (The unemployment rate, though better known, is based on a much smaller survey and is less meaningful.) Recently, the American economy has been adding roughly 200,000 jobs a month. If that number starts falling over multiple months, it\u2019s a bad sign.Advertisement"}

Now stick with me here, because what\u2019s happening across what are considered fast-forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome. Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from, when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore?Indeed. The last big innovation explosion \u2014 the proliferation of the smartphone \u2014 is clearly ending. There is no question that Apple was the center of that, with its app-centric, photo-forward and feature-laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth. It was the debut of the iPhone in 2007 that spurred what some in tech call a \u201cCambrian explosion,\u201d a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared. There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone (and later the Android version), no Tinder, no Spotify. Now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth. Will it be virtual and augmented reality, or perhaps self-driving cars? Artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency or digital health? We are stumbling in the dark.Apple has dabbled in a lot of these areas, but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them. And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly, my forking over $159 to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phone.That business has surely leveled off, as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before, because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones don\u2019t offer that much more than the old ones. There is no question that Mr. Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation, but it\u2019s apparent that it\u2019s now winding down.This is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech. There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward.

How innovation happens is a much more delicate thing than people imagine, a dance involving money, opportunity, timing, execution and, most important, one great idea behind it all.Where is that next spark that will light us all up?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Auto Sales Put Up a Big Number, but Show Signs of Strain", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs they recorded another year of strong United States sales, automakers said Thursday that they saw little cause for concern in the months ahead. But a closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts.Annual sales reached 17.3 million new cars and light trucks last year, a rise of 0.6 percent from 2017. It was the fourth year in a row that the figure exceeded 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded.But last year\u2019s increase was driven by higher sales to rental, government and corporate fleets. Sales to individual consumers \u2014 considered a more accurate measure of demand \u2014 were flat, according to Edmunds, an auto-retail data provider.At the same time, the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear. Interest-free loans, for example, accounted for just 5.5 percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in December. That was the lowest level for December since 2005, according to Edmunds.Furthermore, sales in 2018 got a one-time lift from the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul, which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars. Automakers won\u2019t have that tailwind again.\u201cThis year is going to be tougher than last year,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm, \u201cand the next year will even tougher than 2019.\u201dEven though total sales rose in 2018, signs of halting demand were clear, Mr. Wakefield said. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly.\u201cOther than that one segment, there isn\u2019t a lot of growth,\u201d he said.In addition, Tesla\u2019s sales more than tripled in 2018, and without that increase, the industry would have reported a decline in sales. G.M., Ford and Toyota reported lower sales for a third year in a row. G.M.\u2019s domestic market share fell to 17 percent \u2014 its lowest level since the company\u2019s infancy a century ago.Most automakers posted gains early in 2018, with sales markedly weakening late in the year. G.M. reported a decline of 1.6 percent for the full year, but its estimated year-over-year decline for December was 3.7 percent. (The company no longer reports monthly sales.) Ford\u2019s sales fell 9 percent in December.Beyond the domestic market, automakers face other potential challenges. The potential tremors from an economic slowdown in China became more palpable this week as Apple slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhone sales there.Lower consumer spending in China could hurt G.M., Ford, Toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth, and some reap considerable profits there. Ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in China and is trying reorganize its operations there.Those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on Thursday.Ford said any worries about a slowdown in China were not likely to be a factor in domestic demand. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we look at, as a global company,\u201d Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford\u2019s chief economist, said of the China outlook. But as far as the United States market, she said, \u201cI think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations.\u201dShe added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence.Likewise, a Toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve \u2014 and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers.\u201cInterest rates are always going to be a concern at some level,\u201d Jack Hollis, a group vice president at Toyota\u2019s North American manufacturing arm, said in a conference call. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t slowed the industry to a point of concern.\u201dOne thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued American preference for larger vehicles. Slumping oil prices \u2014 at about half their level five years ago \u2014 have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy a priority. And unless supplies are constrained, an economic slowdown should keep prices low.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018No Deal\u2019 Brexit Finding Favor With British Conservatives", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 With less than three months until Britain is to leave the European Union, most members of the country\u2019s Conservative Party prefer leaving with no deal compared to the plan negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May, a survey of party members released on Friday shows.Yet Mrs. May will be hard-pressed to build support for the compromise within her own party, judging by the findings of the Party Members Project, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.Given the choice between a no-deal exit, Mrs. May\u2019s deal or remaining in the European Union, 57 percent preferred no agreement, 23 percent preferred Mrs. May\u2019s compromise deal and 15 percent opted to remain in the European Union.\u201cWhat\u2019s really noteworthy is how pro-no-deal they are, and how unconvinced by their own government\u2019s argument that it would be very, very difficult to manage and economically damaging,\u201d said the study\u2019s leader, Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London. \u201cThey seem to believe that actually, it will be a good thing for the economy.\u201dThe results are at odds with public opinion as a whole. When a broad group of voters were asked to choose between the same options, 42 percent opted to remain in the European Union, 25 percent chose no deal and 13 percent backed Mrs. May\u2019s agreement. (The rest said they would not vote, didn\u2019t know or declined to answer.)There is a yawning gulf in perception of the economic impact of leaving the union without an agreement.A government publicity campaign will begin next week, as Parliament prepares to vote on Mrs. May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, warning Britons of what to expect if the country leaves the European Union without a deal.But 76 percent of Conservative party members contacted for the poll dismissed those warnings as \u201cexaggerated or invented,\u201d and 64 percent maintained that a no-deal exit would have a positive rather than a negative effect.\u201cIn some ways, what we see is a kind of repeat of what we saw under David Cameron, which is a leadership unable to convince its own members to back the party line,\u201d said Mr. Bale, referring to the former prime minister.The risks of a no-deal exit, he added, had been played down by right-wing news outlets like the Telegraph and Express tabloids, and by \u201cthe celebrity politicians so many of them admire.\u201d The government itself has walked a fine line on projecting the fallout, trying to simultaneously warn the public of danger and reassure it that the state is prepared.And there are diverging views within the party about what a no-deal exit would look like, with some lawmakers speaking of a \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d that includes a two-year transition period, or a \u201cmitigated no-deal\u201d in which smaller deals are in place to cover key trade areas.The same survey found equally strong but opposing views among members of the Labour Party. In a poll of 1,035 members, 72 percent said they want the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to support a second referendum on European Union membership. Mr. Corbyn himself is a longstanding critic of the European Union, and has seemed reluctant to take that step.Among Labour members, 89 percent said they believed a no-deal Brexit would have a negative impact on the economy in the medium-to-long term. And 82 percent said that warnings of severe short-term disruptions, such as food shortages and price increases, were realistic, as opposed to 35 percent of the electorate as a whole.Advertisement"}

But some progressive Democrats object to one of her initial moves \u2014 and on the economics, and probably the politics, the critics are right.The economics of crude, mechanical rules about budget deficits are clear: They\u2019re a really bad idea.Furthermore, there are things the government should be spending money on even when jobs are plentiful \u2014 things like fixing our deteriorating infrastructure and helping children get education, health care and adequate nutrition. Such spending has big long-run payoffs, even in purely monetary terms.Given this reality, why not put some of those excess savings to work in high-return public investments? Should we really refuse to spend money repairing sewer systems or providing child nutrition if doing so raises the deficit a bit, with only a minor impact on future interest costs?But, you may say, isn\u2019t it politically important for Democrats to present themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility? I\u2019m highly skeptical.Anyway, the truth is that while voters may claim to care about the deficit, hardly any of them really do. For example, does anyone still believe that the Tea Party uprising was a protest against deficits? From the beginning, it was basically about race \u2014 about the government spending money to help Those People. And that\u2019s true of a lot of what pretends to be fiscal conservatism.So am I saying that Democrats should completely ignore budget deficits? No; if and when they\u2019re ready to move on things like some form of Medicare for All, the sums will be so large that asking how they\u2019ll be paid for will be crucial.But while fiscal prudence is always necessary, for Democrats to put spending in a straitjacket \u2014 especially when Republicans have shown themselves completely irresponsible \u2014 looks like a bad move.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Pours $218 Billion Into the Economy as Growth Slows", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With the Chinese economy beginning the new year on a decidedly downbeat note, Beijing\u2019s leaders are injecting more than $200 billion into its financial system to ease lending.Chinese officials pledged last month to step up support of the economy, and they are facing new urgency, said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics, a research firm. Retail and auto sales are down, and China\u2019s latest manufacturing data showed factory activity shrank in December. While monthly data released on Friday showed improvement in China\u2019s services sector, the overall picture has become more concerning.\u201cThe consistently downbeat tone of the data released since then will only have underlined the strains the economy is facing,\u201d Mr. Williams said.The move by the central bank on Friday appeared to be part of a coordinated effort. Earlier in the day, Li Keqiang, the country\u2019s premier, said China would move to shore up the economy through measures that included cutting bank reserve requirement ratios and lowering taxes.The central bank said it would cut its reserve requirement ratio \u2014 a measure of how much cash from deposits that lenders need to keep \u2014 by half a percentage point on Jan. 15 and another half a percentage point by Jan. 25.The move will give banks more leeway to lend money, though analysts noted the net amount of money flowing into the system would be roughly half the $218 billion headline figure, as the central bank shuts off other sources of funds. It also comes roughly a month before China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, when Chinese households sometimes strain the monetary system by spending more and by giving cash as gifts.The cut \u201cwill be good for curbing the economic downturn and solving the financing difficulties of enterprises,\u201d said Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\u201cBut this is just one policy,\u201d Mr. Yu added, saying it risks pouring money into real estate and the stock market, which would do little to solve the economy\u2019s problems. \u201cWe need a lot of other policies to cooperate.\u201dFor several weeks, economists and analysts have speculated that officials could move to push a hefty stimulus package that would give the flagging economy a shot in the arm. But such bold moves have become increasingly difficult for the Chinese government, which is contending with a huge debt load accumulated over the last decade to spur growth.Still, many analysts took the move as a sign that China\u2019s leader would be proactive in heading off any worsening slump.\u201cThe central bank has made it clear that this wasn\u2019t \u2018releasing the floodwaters\u2019 by providing a huge stimulus comparable to that introduced in 2009, but it is clear that they are redoubling efforts to stabilize the economy and the currency,\u201d Geoffrey Yu, the head of the British investment office of the Swiss bank UBS, said in an email.\u201cThis swift action supports our view that there won\u2019t be a sharp deceleration in the Chinese economy this year and that fears of a major global slowdown are overdone,\u201d Mr. Yu added.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of a Chinese city.

{"Headline": "Apple Cuts Revenue Forecast Because of Slow iPhone Sales in China", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday because of poor iPhone sales in China, an unexpected development that underscored the slowing of China\u2019s economy and raised fears of further turmoil in global markets.\u201cApple is a bellwether,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe iPhone is something that everyone knows and buys, and if people aren\u2019t buying it, then that\u2019s a pretty good sign they\u2019re having a hard time.\u201dIt is not clear whether this is a problem particular to Apple or whether China\u2019s slowing economy will affect other American companies, especially the tech giants and Detroit automakers. Either way, investors are bound to grow nervous, especially after the stock market\u2019s recent gyrations. Tech stocks, which drove much of the bull market of the past few years, have become a drag on it.With more than 40 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, few American companies have been as successful as Apple in China \u2014 or have as much to lose. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, with nearly $52 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year, mostly from iPhone sales.The company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a nearly 5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the sales decline in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan would exceed the $4.3 billion overall drop in revenue.\u201cWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a letter to investors. \u201cWe believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.\u201dIts declining share pricehad a ripple effect. Asian markets fell Thursday, and Wall Street opened lower. Apple\u2019s shares dropped by more than 9 percent to start trading Thursday.The iPhone was exempt from the first round of tariffs on products built in China. But Mr. Cook said Wednesday that trade tensions and accompanying volatility in global markets had weighed on Chinese consumers and Apple\u2019s profits.The company\u2019s other revenue sources, including iPad, Mac and software sales, together increased nearly 19 percent in the quarter. In the United States and other developed markets like Germany and South Korea, Apple said, it actually had record revenues. The company recently said it would end a longtime custom and no longer break out unit sales of iPhones, a change that rattled investors.While Apple posted roughly flat global sales growth of the iPhone in the third quarter, Chinese rival Huawei jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. The figures helped Huawei maintain its status as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, which posted a 13 percent fall in sales in the same quarter.Huawei has grown despite the China slowdown, as the company has looked to other markets. In the third quarter, its sales rose 13 percent in China but 60 percent outside the country.Finding signs of nervousness about spending in China is not hard, especially among the high-end consumers who dominate the purchase of Apple\u2019s costly phones and laptops, which are far more expensive than local brands.Many expensive restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai seemed almost empty in early December. Room rates at five-star hotels in both cities, which oscillate continuously in internet pricing these days based on demand, suddenly tumbled in early December, and executive lounges emptied.Car sales fell in September, October and November by record percentages from a year earlier, with each month worse than the last. Car executives say early information shows December was a terrible month for sales as well. Automakers like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen all rely heavily on the Chinese market and have reported nose-dives in their sales in recent months.There are broader signs of economic worry. Government and private surveys that were released in the past week show that purchasing managers in China expect the economy to worsen considerably. New orders are down, and exports are faltering.\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d Mizuho Securities said in a research report on Monday.The Beijing leadership has not tried to fan anti-American sentiment in the trade war with the Trump administration. Indeed, ever since President Xi Jinping of China reached a temporary truce with President Trump on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Chinese state media has gone out of its way to avoid criticizing the United States.But tensions continue to grow. Canada\u2019s recent detention of the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant has led to fears of retaliation against American companies or executives. Ms. Meng is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder.The Trump administration has so far avoided imposing tariffs on smartphones from China. But if that happens, Apple, with its almost complete dependence on factories in mainland China, could find itself at a disadvantage to its global archrival, Samsung, which makes its phones in a wider variety of countries.\u201cIf people aren\u2019t buying iPhones, they\u2019re probably not buying everything else,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt symbolizes how deep China\u2019s economic problems are, and we can connect the dots right back to the trade war.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco, and Keith Bradsher from Washington.

{"Headline": "Now for the Hard Part: Getting Californians to Buy Legal Weed", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A billion dollars of tax revenue, the taming of the black market, the convenience of retail cannabis stores throughout the state \u2014 these were some of the promises made by proponents of marijuana legalization in California.One year after the start of recreational sales, they are still just promises.California\u2019s experiment in legalization is mired by debates over regulation and hamstrung by cities and towns that do not want cannabis businesses on their streets.California was the sixth state to introduce the sale of recreational marijuana \u2014 Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon and Washington paved the way \u2014 but the enormous size of the market led to predictions of soaring legal cannabis sales.Instead, sales fell. Around $2.5 billion of legal cannabis was sold in California in 2018, half a billion dollars less than in 2017 when only medical marijuana was legal, according to GreenEdge, a sales tracking company.The easy part of legalization was persuading people to vote for it, industry analysts say. The hard part, now that it\u2019s legal, is persuading people to stop buying from the black market.In Colorado and Washington licensed sales soared after legalization. One crucial difference with California is its massive surplus \u2014 the state produces far more pot than it can consume.The tons of extra cannabis continue to leach out across the country illegally.\u201cThe bottom line is that there\u2019s always been a robust illicit market in California \u2014 and it\u2019s still there,\u201d said Tom Adams of BDS Analytics, which tracks the cannabis market. \u201cRegulators ignored that and thought they could go straight into an incredibly strict and high-tax environment.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s surplus \u2014 equal to 13 times Colorado\u2019s total annual production \u2014 is smuggled eastward, especially across the Rockies and Mississippi where the wholesale price is as much as three times as high.Cannabis Benchmarks, a company that tracks marijuana prices, reported at the end of December that the average price of regulated cannabis in California was $1,183 a pound, compared with $3,044 in Illinois, $3,072 in Connecticut and $2,846 in Washington, D.C.Supporters of legalization long ago acknowledged the problems of California\u2019s surplus and said it would take years to address.In an interview in 2016, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who takes office as governor next week, estimated that 85 to 90 percent of the cannabis that California produced was exported. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious issue,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s going to create a dynamic where the black market will likely persist in a very stubborn way.\u201dThe distinction between legal cannabis businesses and scofflaws is about to become much sharper. The loosely regulated system of medical cannabis cooperatives that has existed for two decades will be illegal after Jan. 9. This gives law enforcement more clarity.Jonathan Rubin, the head of Cannabis Benchmarks, says market forces \u2014 low prices and extreme competition \u2014 will also force many smaller California marijuana companies out of business.This is straining another promise made by proponents of legalization: that small producers would be protected.\u201cThe icon for cannabis is going to become the Marlboro Man,\u201d Ms. Hopkins, the Sonoma County supervisor, said referring to the symbol of the tobacco industry, to which critics often compare the cannabis business. \u201cIn California we\u2019ve done what we always do \u2014 regulate, regulate, regulate, which ultimately gives significant advantage to large companies with significant economies of scale.\u201dThe popular image of California\u2019s marijuana growers may still be hippies hiding out in the forests of Humboldt County but increasingly the reality is more like the operations of NorCal Cannabis Company in Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco.The company has converted what was a semiconductor factory into a cannabis production operation where employees walking down antiseptic hallways wear latex gloves and supervise an Israeli-style irrigation system and a $1 million air filtration system. Next door is a company that makes coatings for aircraft cockpit gauges.Legalization has been liberating for big players like NorCal Cannabis.\u201cThis is our coming-out party,\u201d said Jigar Patel, the president of the company, who toured the complex in a white lab coat. \u201cIt\u2019s waking up and doing what you love without wondering if the man is behind you.\u201dBut for hundreds of other smaller producers the paperwork alone has been enough to put them out of business. A cannabis producer must submit applications to as many as five state agencies, including obtaining a certificate to ensure they are able to use a scale.Lori Ajax, the head of California\u2019s Bureau of Cannabis Control who is sometimes called the state\u2019s cannabis czar, described 2018 as \u201crough\u201d both for the regulators and the industry.Her office is planning a public information campaign to try to persuade consumers to stop buying illegal pot.\u201cWe have to get more consumers buying from the licensed market,\u201d she said.Legalization was promoted as helping to end the war on drugs. But Ms. Ajax says California has no choice but to \u201cstep up\u201d enforcement of cannabis scofflaws.\u201cAs a state we have to get more aggressive,\u201d she said.With less than two dozen enforcement officers, she will need help from other government agencies.Ms. Ajax said she was encouraged by the \u201csurge\u201d of applications by cannabis businesses at the end of 2018. The Bureau of Cannabis Control has issued 2,500 temporary licenses. Yet this is still a fraction of the tens of thousands of cannabis businesses in the state.Mr. Adams of BDS Analytics says 2018 was a year of \u201cconstantly diminishing forecasts\u201d of cannabis sales. But he and others believe the legal market can only grow, especially after the disputed decision by Ms. Ajax\u2019s office to allow cannabis delivery services to operate across the state \u2014 even in areas where local municipalities have chosen to ban pot businesses.Increased sales could push tax revenue closer to the forecasts on the 2016 ballot, which predicted revenue would reach the \u201chigh hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion annually.\u201dThrough September, Sacramento has collected only $234 million in cannabis taxes. Colorado, with a population half the size of Los Angeles County, collected around the same amount last year.Gov. Jerry Brown, who leaves office Jan. 7, described cannabis revenue as unreliable in a recent interview with The New York Times.\u201cI have not counted on any revenue from marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s counting on the marijuana revenue? People said that to make it more plausible for voters.\u201dStill, in many ways 2018 was a banner year for cannabis legalization. Canada became the first industrialized country to allow sales of recreational cannabis; the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that banning cannabis was unconstitutional, paving the way for legalization; Vermont and Michigan legalized recreational marijuana and Oklahoma became the 30th state to legalize medical marijuana.Ms. Ajax sees a solution to California\u2019s cannabis surplus if and when marijuana becomes legal nationwide.\u201cIt would be wonderful if we could sell to other states,\u201d she said.Thomas Fuller is the San Francisco bureau chief.

Investors are trying to gauge the odds of an economic slowdown in the United States, and how such an event might be affected by rising interest rates, uncertainty in American politics and a trade war with China.The tone on Wednesday was initially set by fresh evidence that the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, is slowing. Factory activity in the country fell last month, according to government and private data released this week, an indication that the trade war is beginning to weigh on Chinese manufacturing.But a spike in crude oil futures helped Wall Street overcome the slump after Bloomberg released data that indicated exports from Saudi Arabia had slowed. The American crude benchmark rose as high as $47.78 a barrel before ending the day at $46.54, up 2.5 percent. In 2018, oil prices experienced their first decline in three years, amid worries about excess supply and softer demand.After falling more than 1.5 percent in early trading, the S & P 500 ended slightly higher for the day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fared better, rising 0.5 percent.Shares in oil companies like Exxon Mobil tracked the gains in crude oil, rising more than 2 percent. Other standouts in Wednesday trading included gaming companies like Wynn Resorts, which rose 5.6 percent after the authorities in Macau reported that gaming revenue there rose more than 16 percent in December. Wynn and other American casino operators have a large presence in the territory, which is a destination for wealthy Chinese gamblers.Shares in Asia were broadly lower after the weaker factory data from China. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.2 percent and the Shenzhen Composite index 0.9 percent.The Taiex index in Taiwan fell 1.8 percent, while the Kospi in South Korea was down 1.5 percent. Japan\u2019s markets were closed for a holiday.Manufacturing data for the eurozone that was released on Wednesday also showed an across-the-board slowdown in December. But stock benchmarks in Europe also ended well off their lowest levels of the day. After dipping more than 1 percent, the Euro Stoxx 50 was down by 0.33 percent.Advertisement"}

Powell, said the central bank\u2019s approach to monetary policy would remain flexible in the face of market turbulence and signs that the global economy is slowing.The S&P 500 rose 3.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite ended up 4.3 percent. Stocks were already higher before Mr. Powell\u2019s comments, rising off Labor Department figures that showed robust gains in hiring, but the rally picked up speed after he spoke Friday morning.The Fed\u2019s plans for future interest rate increases have become a concern for investors as stocks have stumbled in recent months. Markets slumped last month after the central bank raised rates and policymakers suggested it would continue on a course of tightening its monetary policy. Mr. Powell, acknowledging the market\u2019s concerns that rising interest rates would dampen the economy, said the central bank could adjust its plans if conditions warrant.Stock investors have been looking for fresh evidence about the state of the economy, and on Friday they got a sign that it remains in good health. Employers in the United States added 312,000 jobs last month, well above Wall Street\u2019s expectations and the biggest monthly gain since February.The faint prospect that China and the United States were inching toward a resolution of their trade war also helped lift markets. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said on Friday that Jeffrey Gerrish, the deputy United States trade representative, would lead a delegation to Beijing for trade talks next week.One of the biggest concerns for investors is how much the trade dispute between China and the United States will dent global growth. The meeting next week would be the first between the two sides since President Trump and President Xi Jinping called a 90-day truce in December.Reflecting Friday\u2019s optimistic tone, crude oil prices also rose. The American benchmark for oil prices climbed above $48 a barrel.And shares in Europe and parts of Asia were higher. One notable exception among global markets was Japan, where shares fell in the first trading day of the new year.The wealth management units of several global banks began circulating notes encouraging clients not to panic and highlighting \u201csilver linings\u201d and buying opportunities amid a rout that dragged markets around the world into negative territory last year.\u201cThere are plenty of looming concerns for investors, from the U.S. government shutdown and vexed trade talks with China, to the potential impact on consumer and business confidence from the recent market volatility,\u201d analysts at the Swiss bank UBS wrote in a note.\u201cHowever,\u201d the note continued, \u201cwe think markets can rebound and hold an overweight to global stocks.\u201dIn Europe, London\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 2.2 percent.

Now, They Seem Prescient.", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe the markets were not overreacting.With the United States economy posting solid numbers last year, the alarming signals coming out of stock and bond markets seemed out of whack with the real world. President Trump\u2019s bellicose trade actions were a concern, but hiring was strong and corporate earnings were surging.In the coming weeks, scores of companies will report their fourth-quarter results. A senior White House economics official acknowledged that there could be a torrent of bad news from corporate America.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cThere are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\u201dHe seemed to suggest that was not necessarily bad, because it could help the Trump administration achieve its goal of getting China to make trade concessions to the United States.Those comments did little to assuage the fears of investors. The S&P 500 stock index closed down about 2.5 percent, leaving it more than 16 percent below the high it hit in September. But perhaps the most notable move was in the market for government bonds, where investors park their money in times of stress or when they expect the economy to slow. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 2.56 percent, well below the level it reached in early November, when investors were more optimistic about the economy.\u201cOn days like today people say, \u2018Crud, I\u2019ve got to buy tons of bonds,\u2019\u201d said Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s driven by a large change in sentiment.\u201dImportant indicators still show the American economy is growing at a decent clip. A measure of employment in the private sector in December, released Thursday, was higher than expected. And ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report on Friday, analysts estimated that employers added about 180,000 jobs in December.Despite this, companies and consumers are facing challenges that could make them more cautious about spending money. If they pull back, the economy will suffer. Apple\u2019s warning provides strong evidence that the trade tensions with China are taking a toll. And if more indicators show the American economy stumbling, investors will become more convinced that the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate increases are dampening activity.Corporate profits \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 are highly sensitive to global economic weakness. Foreign sales accounted for 45 percent of the revenues of companies in the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.There are signs of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies beginning to weigh on domestic demand, too. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its index of manufacturing activity fell sharply in December, the largest one-month drop since the last recession.The manufacturing index fell to what is still considered a healthy level, consistent with other data generally showing that the economy remains in good shape. But the downward trend contributed to a growing sense of unease on Wall Street about how soon the current expansion might end.\u201cWhen it has seeped into the survey it probably means it\u2019s three to five weeks old,\u201d Mr. Vogel said.Indeed, investors are so convinced trouble is coming that they are betting the Federal Reserve will abandon its plans to raise interest rates in 2019.Fed officials predicted in mid-December that the central bank would raise its benchmark rate twice this year, moving the rate into a \u201cneutral\u201d range that neither stimulates nor discourages economic activity. By the end of trading Thursday, the odds of an interest-rate cut in 2019 had climbed above 50 percent.Robert Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reinforced those expectations, telling Bloomberg Television that the Fed should wait at least a few months before considering any additional increases.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be taking any further action until some of these uncertainties resolve themselves, and I think that could take several months,\u201d he said on Thursday.Mr. Kaplan, however, is not a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee this year. The committee comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and a rotating selection of five of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks.An indication of the Fed\u2019s views could come Friday morning, when the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a public appearance with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.\u201cThere\u2019s a belief he\u2019s willing to back off, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said, referring to Mr. Powell. \u201cIf the Fed hikes rates in March, it\u2019ll be a mess.\u201dAnd on Thursday an ominous event occurred in the government bond market. The yield on the 5-year Treasury note fell below that of the 3-month Treasury bill. Yields are generally higher on longer-term debt. An inversion of that pattern signals a loss of confidence in longer-term economic prospects and has often served as an early warning of a recession.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have raised prices on a wide range of Chinese components used by American manufacturers. Roughly half of the companies in the I.S.M. survey said tariffs were weighing on profits, or raising costs.Linton Crystal Technologies, a firm based in Rochester, makes specialized furnaces used to grow silicon tubes, which are cut into wafers for semiconductors and solar panels that are sold to customers all over the world. The work was once performed entirely in the United States. But even though they are still designed, assembled and customized in the United States, the machines\u2019 components now are built in China.Mr. Trump has said the goal of his trade policies was to convince companies like Linton to bring back jobs from China. Mr. Hassett emphasized on Thursday that the Trump administration expected the domestic economy to remain strong, and that companies focused on the United States would benefit.But Todd Barnum, Linton Crystal\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cost of making furnaces entirely in the United States was prohibitive. And as a result of the tariffs, the company is also moving design work to China \u2014 a move Mr. Barnum said would save hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs by reducing the need for prototypes to be shipped to the United States.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t care if it was manufactured in the United States,\u201d Mr. Barnum said. \u201cThey care about the highest quality at the lowest dollar.\u201dCarlos Tejada, Amie Tsang and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yellow Vest Leader Is Arrested in France Amid Crackdown", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u00c9ric Drouet, a 33-year-old truck driver from the Paris exurbs who was one of the original organizers of the movement, was arrested Wednesday night in Paris for what the authorities said was \u201corganizing an undeclared demonstration.\u201d On Thursday, he was released pending a trial.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to shock public opinion,\u201d Mr. Drouet said in a video on Facebook before going to the Place de le Concorde on Wednesday and placing candles for the movement\u2019s wounded. He called for \u201caction\u201d on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, where several dozen Yellow Vests were waiting for him that evening outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant.Instead, shortly after 9 p.m., Mr. Drouet was hustled into a police van by riot police officers.French law requires the organizers of street demonstrations to inform the local authorities about their plans. Violations can bring six months in jail and a fine of 7,500 euros, about $8,500.After his release on Thursday, Mr. Drouet told reporters that he had been unfairly targeted for \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons and denied that he had called on anyone to demonstrate. He noted that none of those gathered had been wearing yellow vests.\u201cIt was nothing like a demonstration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a rendezvous at the restaurant.\u201dKh\u00e9ops Lara, Mr. Drouet\u2019s lawyer, said in a statement that his client had been \u201carbitrarily arrested\u201d and that the gathering did not qualify as the kind of demonstration that requires prior authorization.The French authorities dismissed Mr. Drouet\u2019s claim that he had merely been meeting a group for a restaurant outing.Prime Minister \u00c9douard Philippe, asked on Thursday by reporters during a trip north of Paris if there were \u201cpolitical police\u201d in France, replied, \u201cIn no way.\u201d He expressed support for the French police and judiciary.The arrest of Mr. Drouet, who had previously been detained and accused of carrying a wooden club at a demonstration on Dec. 22, signaled the new, harsher line taken by a government that has been knocked off balance by several weekends of often violent street demonstrations.Mr. Drouet will be tried in February on charges of \u201corganizing a demonstration without authorization,\u201d both on Wednesday and on Dec. 22, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement on Thursday. He will be tried in June over the club accusation.Mr. Macron was sharply critical in that speech of what he called the \u201chateful mob\u201d aspect of the Yellow Vest movement, and issued a stern summons to respect \u201crepublican order.\u201d That idea was echoed in his government\u2019s defense on Thursday of Mr. Drouet\u2019s arrest.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t respectful of the rule of law,\u201d said the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire.The tough new approach \u2014 and especially the arrest of Mr. Drouet \u2014 risks backfiring amid a popular revolt over economic woes and the answers offered by a government widely seen as distant and insensitive. Although the movement is clearly slowing down, the people taking to the streets remain mostly dissatisfied, despite Mr. Macron\u2019s attempts to placate them.Yellow Vest members interviewed on French television Thursday were sharply critical of the government, as were members of the political opposition. The far right and the far left in France have been engaged in a quiet war to win over the Yellow Vests, and the leaders of both denounced the arrest of Mr. Drouet.The far left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon called it an \u201cabuse of power\u201d and said that politically driven police were \u201ctargeting and harassing the leaders of the Yellow Vests.\u201d On the far right, Marine Le Pen said on Twitter that there was \u201csystematic violation of the political rights\u201d of Mr. Macron\u2019s opponents.In a movement often described as amorphous, Mr. Drouet has stood out, frequently appearing on television and shocking French public opinion by declaring his readiness to \u201cgo inside\u201d the \u00c9lys\u00e9e were he to reach the presidential palace in a demonstration.He created the original Facebook page calling for a national demonstration against a gas tax increase in November, and his calls to protest and his analyses of the movement \u2014 often live-streamed on Facebook from the cab of his truck \u2014 are popular among many Yellow Vests.\u201cI am not a representative of the Yellow Vests,\u201d Mr. Drouet told reporters on Thursday \u2014 a common line from prominent members of the movement, who see themselves not as leaders of the protesters but as mere amplifiers of their demands. \u201cWith our without me, it will continue.\u201dThis week, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon wrote of his \u201cfascination\u201d with Mr. Drouet on his blog, comparing him to a figure of the French Revolution, Jean-Baptiste Drouet, who stopped Louis XVI from fleeing France at the village of Varenne in June 1791.\u201cImagine: I am checked by police, they take me in,\u201d he said during a live stream on Facebook last month. \u201cIt will backfire on them.

{"Headline": "Chinese Companies Flocked to U.S. Markets in 2018. The Trade War May Have Had a Role.", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trade war didn\u2019t seem to discourage Chinese companies from listing their shares on American exchanges last year. In fact, it might have brought more Chinese companies to Wall Street.Tencent Music\u2019s trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in December capped a wave of Chinese companies going public in the United States. In total, 33 Chinese firms raised $9.2 billion through initial public offerings on American exchanges \u2014 up 140 percent from 2017 and the highest level since 2014, according to Dealogic.Of course, 2014 comes with an asterisk of sorts. Alibaba went public in September that year, raising $25 billion. Subtract the value of Alibaba\u2019s offering and Chinese firms raised just $3 billion that year.Last year, however, offerings from Chinese firms dominated the United States market for initial public offerings. The three largest I.P.O.s by market value were Chinese companies. And Chinese firms accounted for four of the 10 largest such offerings in 2018 ranked by amount raised on American exchanges, the most of any country, including the United States, according to Dealogic.Why list in America?American exchanges offer prestige and a broader investor base that Chinese entrepreneurs can find attractive. The United States also offers a quicker route to the public markets. While Chinese regulators have taken steps to reduce the long wait, it still takes 18 months or longer for shares to begin trading from the time a company files to go public. That compares with just 42 days to list in the United States, according to Dealogic.But the trade war may also have been a factor.A slowing Chinese economy and escalating trade tensions dragged down markets in Hong Kong and China before stocks in the United States turned seriously wobbly. At their lows in late October, the Hang Seng stock index and the benchmark stock indexes in Shenzhen and Shanghai were down 15 percent to 35 percent for the year. By comparison, the S & P 500 was still up 2.5 percent at that point, making it far more attractive for offerings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As China Talks Begin, Trump\u2019s Trade Negotiator Tries to Keep President From Wavering", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the middle of his crowded dinner in Buenos Aires with President Xi Jinping of China, President Trump leaned across the table, pointed to Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative whose skepticism of China runs deep, and declared, \u201cThat\u2019s my negotiator!\u201dHe then turned to Peter Navarro, his even more hawkish trade adviser, adding, \u201cAnd that\u2019s my tough guy!\u201d according to aides with knowledge of the exchange.Now, with talks between China and the United States set to begin this week in Beijing, Mr. Lighthizer, aided by Mr. Navarro, faces the assignment of a lifetime: redefining the trade relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies by Mr. Trump\u2019s March 2 deadline to reach an agreement.And he must do it in a way that tilts the balance of power toward the United States. His approach will have significant ramifications for American companies, workers and consumers whose fortunes, whether Mr. Trump likes it or not, are increasingly tied to China.First, however, Mr. Lighthizer will need to keep a mercurial president from wavering in the face of queasy financial markets, which have suffered their steepest annual decline since 2008. Despite his declaration that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win\u201d and his recent boast that he is a \u201cTariff Man,\u201d Mr. Trump is increasingly eager to reach a deal that will help calm the markets, which he views as a political electrocardiogram of his presidency.Mr. Trump has repeatedly told his advisers that Mr. Xi is someone with whom he can cut a big deal, according to people who have spoken with the president. On Saturday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Xi to discuss the status of talks, tweeting afterward that good progress was being made. \u201cDeal is moving along very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cIt\u2019s not some subtle shift; Trump has flipped since September,\u201d said Derek Scissors, who studies China\u2019s economy for the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cHe went from saying how he was going to slap tariffs on everything to all this talk about making the greatest deal ever.\u201dMr. Lighthizer \u2014 whose top deputy will meet with Chinese officials this week ahead of more high-level talks in February \u2014 has played down any differences with Mr. Trump and views his role as ultimately executing the directive of his boss. But the trade representative, who declined to be interviewed, has told friends and associates that he is intent on preventing the president from being talked into accepting \u201cempty promises\u201d like temporary increases in soybean or beef purchases.When Mr. Lighthizer senses that anyone \u2014 even Mr. Trump \u2014 might be going a little soft on China, he opens a paper-clipped manila folder he totes around and brandishes a single-page, easy-reading chart that lists decades of failed trade negotiations with Beijing, according to administration officials.\u201cBob\u2019s attitude toward China is very simple. He wants them to surrender,\u201d said William A. Reinsch, a former federal trade official who met him three decades ago when Mr. Lighthizer was a young aide for former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. \u201cHis negotiating strategy is simple too. He basically gives them a list of things he wants them to do and says, \u2018Fix it now.\u2019\u201dMr. Mnuchin, who attended the G-20 dinner, helped Mr. Trump craft an upbeat assessment declaring the Buenos Aires meeting \u201chighly successful\u201d in the presidential limousine back to the airport, according to a senior administration official.The disparate views among Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade advisers have prompted sparring \u2014 both publicly and behind the scenes.In late 2017, when Mr. Lighthizer grew concerned that Mr. Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, were wading too far into China matters, he enlisted Rob Porter, the president\u2019s staff secretary at the time, to persuade Mr. Trump to draft a document designating Mr. Lighthizer the main trade emissary to China, according to a person who has seen the letter. Mr. Lighthizer has never used the document to defend his position, the person said, but he considers it an insurance policy of sorts.During an Oval Office meeting with the trade team the fall of 2017, Mr. Lighthizer accused Mr. Mnuchin and Gary D. Cohn, the former National Economic Council director, of bad-mouthing him to free-trade Republican senators.The argument grew so heated that the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, quickly pulled the combatants into the nearby Roosevelt Room and away from the president, where the argument raged on for a few more minutes, according to two witnesses.Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, disputed the account.Mr. Lighthizer has since worked to increase his own face time with Mr. Trump. He has joked to colleagues that he has more influence with Mr. Trump during winter months because he is able to hitch a ride on Air Force One during the president\u2019s flights down to Mar-a-Lago, which is several miles from Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s own $2.3 million waterfront condo in Palm Beach, Fla.He used that access to argue to Mr. Trump that the United States has never had more leverage to extract structural reforms on intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from American companies and cybercrime. But while Mr. Trump has jumped at the chance to claim victory in changing China\u2019s ways, experts say that what Mr. Lighthizer is demanding would require significant shifts in how Beijing\u2019s central government and its manufacturing sector coordinate their activities, and that might simply not be possible in the short term.\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Mr. Scissors said.Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s unsparing view of China comes, in part, from his childhood in Ashtabula, Ohio, an industrial and shipping town on the Great Lakes hit by the offshoring of steel and chemical production. For much of his career, Mr. Lighthizer was a lonely protectionist voice in a Republican Party dominated by free traders, alternating between jobs in government and a lucrative private law career representing large American corporations like United States Steel in trade cases against China.The trade adviser is guarded around Mr. Trump, often waiting until the end of meetings to make his points and quietly nudging the president away from actions he views as counterproductive, current and former officials said. That was the case in mid-2017 when he cautioned the president against withdrawing unilaterally from the World Trade Organization, adding for emphasis, \u201cAnd I hate the W.T.O. as much as anybody.\u201dHe does not always get his way. In the wake of a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada this fall, Mr. Lighthizer urged Mr. Trump to consider easing steel and aluminum tariffs on those countries and replacing them with less burdensome quotas. Mr. Trump rejected his plan, according to negotiators from all three countries.A poker-faced Mr. Lighthizer broke the news to his Mexican and Canadian counterparts by declaring the proposal was inoperative, one of the officials said.The president also ignored Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s advice in early December when he announced that he intended to begin the six-month process of withdrawing the United States from Nafta in order to pressure House Democrats into passing the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.That threat undermined months of quiet negotiations between Mr. Lighthizer, labor groups and Democrats like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California to try to win their support for the new trade deal. Mr. Trump has yet to follow through on his threat, and Mr. Lighthizer continues trying to work with Democrats to get the new trade deal approved.\u201cBob is trying to provide stability and focus in a completely chaotic environment,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Bob, but I am certain he is frustrated. How could you not be frustrated as the U.S. trade representative for a president who knows what his gut thinks but hasn\u2019t put much of his brains into trade?\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jair Bolsonaro Sworn In as Brazil\u2019s President, Cementing Rightward Shift", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Just over four months ago, Jair Bolsonaro was fighting for his life after being stabbed in the gut during a presidential campaign rally. On Tuesday, after a quick recovery and an unlikely victory, he was sworn in as Brazil\u2019s president, steering Latin America\u2019s largest nation far to the right in a political shift that was evident even during his inauguration.As he addressed a crowd from the presidential palace amid unusually tight security that underscored his worry about a new assassination attempt, Mr. Bolsonaro waved a Brazilian flag and proclaimed that on that day, Brazilians were \u201cbeing freed from socialism.\u201dThe country\u2019s flag \u201cwould never be red again,\u201d he said, alluding to the rival Workers\u2019 Party as he stood next to his wife and Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, \u201ceven if it takes our blood to keep it green and yellow.\u201dThe Workers\u2019 Party, which had won the last four presidential elections, was crushed in the October vote after the country slipped into recession, violence soared and corruption scandals tarred much of the elite. It boycotted the swearing-in ceremony, reflecting the lingering bitterness of a presidential race that polarized Brazilians like none other in recent history.Longstanding allies like Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua were not invited to the ceremony, in a clear signal of Brazil\u2019s political shift. Instead, conservative governments played prominent roles as guests in the capital, Bras\u00edlia \u2014 or as supporters weighing in on social media.Shortly after Mr. Bolsonaro wrapped up his address to Congress, President Trump hailed his speech in a message on Twitter and pledged: \u201cThe U.S.A. is with you!\u201dThe Brazilian and American presidents have similar views, temperaments and styles, increasing the likelihood of closer relations between two countries that have been uneasy allies in the past.Stronger ties could mean more cooperation on Venezuela, where mismanagement of the economy has created a humanitarian crisis, and could put greater distance between Cuba and Brazil. The United States could also try to lean on Brazil to blunt China\u2019s growing influence in Latin America, though, because China is Brazil\u2019s main trading partner, Mr. Bolsonaro would have little room to maneuver, experts said.United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the ceremony, along with Hungary\u2019s hard-right prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Israel\u2019s conservative leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Mr. Bolsonaro had told him that moving Brazil\u2019s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was a matter of \u201cwhen, not if.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro, a strident populist, rose to power by tapping anger toward the Workers Party and presenting himself as their opposite \u2014 an outsider ready to take a wrecking ball to the political establishment and, through business-friendly policies, put the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy back on track.During his first address to Congress, he promised to chart a bright new chapter for the country.\u201cBuilding a more just and developed nation requires doing away with practices that have been nefarious for all of us,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said, shortly after he was sworn in. \u201cIrresponsibility led us to the worst ethical, moral and economic crisis of our history.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro said it would take \u201carduous work\u201d to make Brazil, still recovering from a brutal recession that began in 2014, into \u201ca strong, striving, confident and bold nation.\u201dWhile supporters in Bras\u00edlia chanted \u201cmito,\u201d or legend, as Mr. Bolsonaro was handed the presidential band, Brazilians who opposed him spoke in apocalyptic terms about the dawning era.\u201cWe are returning to 1964,\u201d said S\u00f4nia Guajajara, an indigenous rights activist who ran as the vice-presidential candidate of the leftist Socialism and Liberty Party, referring to the year in which Brazil\u2019s 21-year military regime began. \u201cThe imminent risk of a dictatorship puts us in a permanent state of alert.\u201dMr. Temer, a center-right politician, led Brazil through a halting economic recovery. But his quest to make systemic reforms \u2014 including an overhaul of Brazil\u2019s bloated pension system \u2014 was derailed after he was charged with corruption and obstruction of justice in 2017.Mr. Bolsonaro takes office with a healthier economy and a significant mandate, said Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist who heads the Latin American Studies program at Johns Hopkins University. But she predicted that his first months in office would be turbulent, as factions within his inner circle, which includes top military figures, free-market economists and evangelical leaders, vie for supremacy.Building support for pension reform, an unpopular measure that economists say is crucial to Brazil\u2019s long-term economic health, will be the key test of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s ability, she said.\u201cOver the next few months we\u2019ll have a better idea of who\u2019s going to be in charge within the confusion that is Bolsonaro\u2019s inner circle,\u201d said Ms. de Bolle, who was a vocal critic of Mr. Bolsonaro during the campaign. \u201cI think there are a lot of question marks regarding what the priorities will be and who will be calling the shots.\u201dAfter his victory, Mr. Bolsonaro assembled a cabinet that signaled his intention to make good on his anticorruption, tough-on-crime promises and to do away with politics as usual.Unlike former presidents, who handed out ministerial positions to members of powerful political parties in exchange for support in the legislature, he packed his government with military leaders, technocrats and ideologues, some with little or no political experience.Mr. Bolsonaro chose several men who passed through the armed forces to form his government \u2014 including his running mate, the retired general Hamilton Mour\u00e3o \u2014 a remarkable about-face for a nation that kept the military largely out of sight after the end of its rule and a transition to democracy in the mid-1980s.Mr. Moro\u2019s nomination illustrated how polarized Brazil has become. Supporters welcomed it as a sign that Mr. Bolsonaro was serious about fighting corruption. But many Brazilians saw the appointment as confirmation that the judge\u2019s conviction of Mr. da Silva in 2017, on money laundering and corruption charges, was motivated by politics.But turning his back on traditional parties may leave Mr. Bolsonaro and his nascent government unable to build dependable coalitions in a fractious legislature split among 30 parties.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spurning Erdogan\u2019s Vision, Turks Leave in Droves, Draining Money and Talent", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA commuter train in Istanbul passed an election poster for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last June. Mr. Erdogan won re-election with greater powers, but the economy has faltered since then.They are leaving the country in droves and taking talent and capital with them in a way that indicates a broad and alarming loss of confidence in Mr. Erdogan\u2019s vision, according to government statistics and analysts.In the last two to three years, not only have students and academics fled the country, but also entrepreneurs, businesspeople, and thousands of wealthy individuals who are selling everything and moving their families and their money abroad.Some 113,000 Turks emigrated in 2018, a sharp increase over the previous year, when more than 69,000 left the country, according to the Turkish Institute of Statistics.Turkey has seen waves of students and teachers leave before, but this exodus looks like a more permanent reordering of the society and threatens to set Turkey back decades, said Ibrahim Sirkeci, director of transnational studies at Regent\u2019s University in London, and other analysts.\u201cThe brain drain is real,\u201d Mr. Sirkeci said.The flight of people, talent and capital is being driven by a powerful combination of factors that have come to define life under Mr. Erdogan and that his opponents increasingly despair is here to stay.The result is that, for the first time since the republic was founded nearly a century ago, many from the old moneyed class, in particular the secular elite who have dominated Turkey\u2019s cultural and business life for decades, are moving away and the new rich close to Mr. Erdogan and his governing party are taking their place.One of those leaving is Merve Bayindir, 38, who is relocating to London after becoming Turkey\u2019s go-to hat designer in the fashionable Nisantasi district of Istanbul.\u201cWe are selling everything,\u201d she said in an interview during a return trip to Istanbul last month to close what was left of her business, MerveBayindir, which she runs with her mother, and to sell their four-story house.Ms. Bayindir was an active participant in the 2013 protests against the government\u2019s attempt to develop Taksim Square in Istanbul. She said she remains traumatized by the violence and fearful in her own city.Mr. Erdogan denounced the protesters as delinquents and after enduring arrests and harassment many have left the country.\u201cThere is so much discrimination, not only cultural but personal, the anger, the violence is impossible to handle,\u201d Ms. Bayindir said. \u201cIf you had something better and you see it dissolving, it\u2019s a hopeless road.\u201dThousands of Turks like her have applied for business visas in Britain or for golden visa programs in Greece, Portugal and Spain, which grant immigrants residency if they buy property at a certain level.Applications for asylum in Europe by Turks have also multiplied in the last three years, according to Mr. Sirkeci, who has studied the migration of Turks to Britain for 25 years.He estimates that 10,000 Turks have made use of a business visa plan to move to Britain in the last few years, with a sharp jump in applications since the beginning of 2016. That is double the number from 2004 to 2015.Applications by Turkish citizens for political asylum also jumped threefold in Britain in the six months after the coup attempt, and sixfold among Turks applying for asylum in Germany, he said, citing figures obtained from the United Nations refugee agency. The number of Turks applying for asylum worldwide jumped by 10,000 in 2017 to more than 33,000.A large proportion of those fleeing have been followers of Fethullah Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based preacher who is charged with instigating the 2016 coup, or people accused of being followers, often on flimsy evidence.Tens of thousands of teachers and academics were purged from their jobs after the coup, including hundreds who had signed a peace petition calling on the government to cease military action in Kurdish cities and return to the peace process. Hundreds have taken up posts abroad.Mr. Erdogan has tried to make Turkey more conservative and religious, with a growing middle class and a tight circle of elites who are especially beholden to him for their economic success.The flight of capital and talent is the result of this conscious effort by Mr. Erdogan to transform the society, said Bekir Agirdir, director of the Konda polling company.With the help of subsidies and favorable contracts, the government has helped new businesses to emerge, and they are rapidly replacing the old ones, he said. \u201cThere is a transfer of capital underway,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is social and political engineering.\u201dIlker Birbil, a mathematician who faces charges for signing the peace petition and left Turkey to take up a position at Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands, warned that the country was losing people permanently.\u201cPeople who are leaving do not want to come back,\u201d Mr. Birbil said, citing the polarized political climate in the country. \u201cThis is alarming for Turkey.\u201d\u201cI have received so many emails from students and friends who are trying to get out of Turkey,\u201d he said.Students are despairing of change partly because they have grown up with Mr. Erdogan in power for 17 years, said Erhan Erkut, a founder of MEF University in Istanbul, which teaches innovation and entrepreneurship.\u201cThis is the only government they have seen, they do not know there is another possibility,\u201d he said.Families are setting up businesses abroad for the next generation to inherit, said Mr. Sirkeci of Regent\u2019s University, adding that many students at his private university fell into that category.At least 12,000 of Turkey\u2019s millionaires \u2014 around 12 percent of the country\u2019s wealthy class \u2014 moved their assets out of the country in 2016 and 2017, according to the Global Wealth Migration Review, an annual report produced by AfrAsia Bank.Most of them moved to Europe or the United Arab Emirates, the report said. Turkey\u2019s largest business center, Istanbul, was listed among the top seven cities worldwide experiencing an exodus of wealthy people.\u201cIf one looks at any major country collapse in history, it is normally preceded by a migration of wealthy people away from that country,\u201d the report said.Mr. Erdogan has reviled as traitors businesspeople who have moved their assets abroad as the Turkish economy began to falter.\u201cPardon us, we do not forgive,\u201d he warned in a speech at the Foreign Economic Relations Board, a business association in Istanbul in April. \u201cThe hands of our nation would be on their collars both in this world and in the afterlife.\u201d\u201cBehavior like this cannot have a valid explanation,\u201d Mr. Erdogan added.His comments came amid reports that some of Turkey\u2019s largest companies were divesting in Turkey. Several such companies have made significant transfers of capital abroad, amid fears they would be targeted in the post-coup crackdown or as the economy began to contract.One is the Turkish food giant Yildiz Holding, which came under fire on social media as being linked to Mr. Gulen\u2019s movement.Soon after, Yildiz rescheduled $7 billion of debt and sold shares of its Turkish biscuit maker, Ulker, to its London-based holding company, essentially transferring the family\u2019s majority holding of Ulker out of reach of Turkish courts.(Yildiz representatives did not immediately respond to requests for an interview, but after publication of this article, they said that its companies were in no way associated with the Gulenist movement, which it called a \u201cterrorist\u201d group, and that the transfer of its debt and shares to its London-based holding company had no impact on its company\u2019s commitment to and operations in Turkey.)\u201cBillions of dollars have fled Turkey in the last couple of years, especially after the coup attempt when people started to feel threatened,\u201d said Mehmet Gun, the owner of a law firm in Istanbul.Ms. Bayindir, the designer, began slowly moving her company to London two years ago. In Turkey she had half a dozen workers and a showroom, but now she designs and makes the hats herself out of a rented atelier in London.\u201cI could have stayed,\u201d in Istanbul, she said. \u201c\u2018I would be better off.\u201dBut life in Turkey had become so tense, she said, that she fears civil strife or even civil war could develop between Erdogan supporters and their opponents.\u201cNow when I come here I don\u2019t see the same Istanbul. She does not have energy anymore. She looks tired,\u201d Ms. Bayindir said. \u201cMe not wanting to come here is a big, big thing, because I am one of those people who is in love with the city itself.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the university in the Netherlands where Ilker Birbil took up a position after leaving Turkey. It is Erasmus University Rotterdam, not Utrecht University.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Turks who had emigrated in 2017. It was 113,126, not a more than a quarter million, which was the number of all people, Turks and foreigners, who had left the country.Advertisement"}
