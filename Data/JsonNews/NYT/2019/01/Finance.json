{"Headline": "Tucker Carlson Versus Conservatism", "Date": "2019-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Fox News host amplifies a debate the right needs to have.Opinion ColumnistBut in expanding on those themes he went somewhere that Fox hosts rarely go \u2014 from culture into economics, from a critique of liberal cosmopolitanism into a critique of libertarianism, from a lament for the decline of the family to an argument that this decline can be laid at the feet of consumer capitalism as well as social liberalism.This is a crucial conservative insight, a caution for policymakers everywhere \u2014 but it can also become a trap, a cul-de-sac, an excuse for doing nothing. And that has happened too often for conservatives in recent decades: They\u2019ve leaped to despair without even trying policy.Let me give three examples. Modern conservatism was forged in the crucible of the 1970s inflation crisis, and in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash many conservatives were convinced that there was nothing the Federal Reserve could do about the vast army of the unemployed without touching off a similar inflationary spiral.But in hindsight this was wrong, the feared inflation never came, and the economic recovery was slowed because of the Republican fixation on tight money. Of course, in the Trump era some Republicans have conveniently become dovish on inflation. But in the preceding eight years, wage-earning Americans suffered unnecessarily because of a wrongheaded right-wing counsel of despair.A second example: While it\u2019s true that family breakdown has deep and tangled roots, it\u2019s also true that in the 1940s and 1950s, a mix of government policy, union strength and conservative gender norms established a \u201cfamily wage\u201d \u2014 an income level that enabled a single breadwinner to support a family.A final example: Historically conservatism has been proudly paternalist, favorable to forms of censorship and prohibition for the sake of protecting precisely the private virtues that Carlson\u2019s critics think government can\u2019t cultivate. But in recent decades, the right\u2019s elites have despaired of censoring pornography, acquiesced to the spread of casino gambling, made peace with the creeping commercialization of marijuana, and accepted the internet\u2019s conquest of childhood and adolescence.Yet none of these trends actually seem entirely beyond the influence of regulation. It\u2019s just that conservatism has given up \u2014 once again, in unwarranted despair \u2014 on earlier assumptions about how public paternalism can encourage private virtue.Advertisement"}

Enter the Eaton DC, in downtown Washington, the flagship hotel of the Eaton Workshop brand, and now the wokest place to wake up in the nation\u2019s capital. Its founder, Katherine Lo, a scion of the Hong Kong family whose vast hotel holdings include the high-end Langham brand, envisioned creating not a mere hotel but \u201ca community with a shared ethos of caring for today\u2019s world.\u201d Beyond its well-appointed guest rooms, the Eaton property encompasses a communal work space (billed as \u201cthe optimal cooperative setting for socially conscious leaders\u201d), a wellness center, a radio station, a coffee house and a full-service restaurant \u2014 all of which, you can be assured, are monitored for the size of their environmental footprints. Data available upon request.K Street is to lobbying what Wall Street is to finance and Rodeo Drive is to luxury shopping: an address synonymous with one of the more avaricious aspects of American capitalism. It\u2019s not the most obvious location for a place like Eaton DC, though it is central and convenient. Many of the city\u2019s attractions like the White House and the museums near the National Mall are within walking distance. The 14th Street corridor, with its bustling restaurant and bar scene, is also a short walk, as is the hotel whose name dare not be mentioned (the Trump International). The regular rooms \u2014 Eaton calls them cabins or studies \u2014 are quite small at only 280 to 380 square feet. We upgraded to a pied-\u00e0-terre junior suite, which was amply sized at about 600 square feet and had a separate living area with an L-shaped couch. It had the feel of a stylish Lake Tahoe getaway, with wide-plank hardwood flooring and dark rum-colored wood furnishings, accented by an occasional splash of red and blue in the rugs and pillows. Some of the highly curated touches included a record player that actually played (and came with albums by Fleetwood Mac and The Byrds); a magazine rack with vintage copies of Rolling Stone; a minibar with craft beer and kombucha. On the nightstand there was a pink Himalayan salt lamp, which some believe has cleansing powers. In the nightstand drawer there was no Gideon Bible or Book of Mormon, though the \u201cInclusivity Menu\u201d on the desk said that copies of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights were available at the front desk. (We called down, and within minutes two copies were delivered.)Ours had three separate chambers: one for the sink, one for the shower and a separate area with a door for the toilet. Blue checkerboard tiling lined the walls and the shower. Bath products by Grown Alchemist included sweet orange, cedarwood and sage hand wash. But you can\u2019t take them home with you. No small disposable bottles here \u2014 just the reusable large communal ones now becoming standard at many environmentally conscious hotels. The Eaton will feel too precious and political for many people. But if you need a break from the corporate, cookie-cutter sterility of Marriott and Hilton, this is your safe space.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala Expels U.N.-Backed Anti-Corruption Panel, Claiming Overreach", "Date": "2019-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 The Guatemalan government said Monday that it would expel a United Nations-backed anticorruption panel, giving its prosecutors a day to leave the country in the most decisive effort yet by President Jimmy Morales to remove the body that has been investigating him and other top politicians.At a news conference in Guatemala City, Mr. Morales, accompanied by members of his cabinet and several people accused in panel investigations or their relatives, defended his expulsion order.\u201cCicig has put public security and governability at risk,\u201d he said, using the acronym for the panel. \u201cCicig has repeatedly violated the human rights of Guatemalans and foreigners in Guatemala through selective and partial justice.\u201dEarlier on Monday, Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel accused the panel of interfering in Guatemala\u2019s internal affairs, and said the government was withdrawing from an agreement with the United Nations that established the panel more than a decade ago.The panel\u2019s international prosecutors had 24 hours to leave the country, Ms. Jovel said at a news conference at the United Nations, after meeting with Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, its secretary general. Mr. Guterres has publicly expressed support for the panel, called the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala.The expulsion of the commission, which works alongside Guatemalan prosecutors to bring corruption cases, was immediately challenged in the country\u2019s Constitutional Court.In a statement, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for Mr. Guterres, said that \u201cthe secretary general strongly rejects\u201d the decision to end the agreement, and that he \u201crecalls the important contribution of Cicig to the fight against impunity in Guatemala.\u201dMr. Guterres expects the government of Guatemala to protect the commission\u2019s personnel and fulfill its obligations under the agreement, Mr. Dujarric said.Mr. Morales was not always so hostile to the corruption panel, which played a large role in his election in 2015.And after he took office, Mr. Morales promised to work closely with the commission, which under the leadership of Ivan Vel\u00e1squez, a Colombian prosecutor, had become increasingly effective at peeling back layers of corruption across much of Guatemala\u2019s political and business elite.Last year Mr. Morales announced that he would not renew Cicig\u2019s two-year mandate when it expires in September, a decision permitted under the agreement with the United Nations.But now, rather than let the mandate simply run out, the government has moved to eject the panel ahead of the presidential election in June. Under Guatemalan law, Mr. Morales is not eligible to run for re-election.There was no immediate comment from the Trump administration, which has cooled the United States\u2019 longstanding support for the commission under intense lobbying from the Morales government.But Representative Norma Torres, a Democrat from California who was born in Guatemala, was quick to condemn the Guatemalan government\u2019s decision.The commission\u2019s \u201cabrupt departure would be a major setback for Guatemala\u2019s fight against corruption,\u201d she said. \u201cComplex cases involving organized crime, drug trafficking, and human smuggling would fall apart. Powerful criminals and corrupt politicians would get away with serious crimes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Woodstock Returns Again on the Festival\u2019s 50th Anniversary", "Date": "2019-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMichael Lang, one of the event\u2019s original producers, will present Woodstock 50 in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with a focus on activism. WOODSTOCK, N.Y. \u2014 When the first Woodstock music festival was held in 1969, bringing around 400,000 people to a muddy field in Bethel, N.Y., it focused the world\u2019s attention on pop music\u2019s power to shape the culture.Half a century later, in a music market already jammed with big-ticket festivals, could another Woodstock muster the same impact?Michael Lang, one of the producers of the original event, is betting that it can. From Aug. 16 to 18 \u2014 almost exactly 50 years after the first Woodstock \u2014 he will present an official anniversary festival, Woodstock 50, in Watkins Glen, N.Y., with ambitions to not only attract a huge multigenerational audience but to rally those fans around a message of social activism.But his vision for Woodstock\u2019s 50th, he said, is clear: a large-scale camping weekend combining music with a program of films, speakers and partnerships with organizations like Head count, which registers young voters. \u201cCoachella\u2019s got its thing, as does Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201cBut I think they\u2019re all missing an opportunity to make a difference in the world. They\u2019re all perfect places for social engagement and for fostering ideas, and I think that\u2019s lost.\u201d\u201cWe want this to be more than just coming to a concert,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd hopefully a lot of the bands will become part of this effort to get people to stand up and make themselves heard, to get and out vote. And if they don\u2019t have a candidate that represents their feelings, to find one \u2014 or to run themselves.\u201dFor Woodstock, three main stages will be supplemented by three smaller \u201cneighborhoods,\u201d as Mr. Lang described them, with their own food and programming. Tickets? Mr. Lang and his team are still working on that. But they envision selling a maximum of around 100,000 three-day passes, with most attendees camping on site.\u201cIt\u2019s not tainted,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201c\u201999 was more like an MTV event than a Woodstock event, really. I take some responsibility for that. It was also kind of an angry time in music.\u201dAnd then there is the corporate consolidation of the concert business, which has grown especially intense over the last few years as two companies, Live Nation and AEG, compete to book major tours. Live Nation is a partner in the Bethel Woods event.\u201cThe industry has completely changed since 1999,\u201d said John Scher, the veteran concert promoter who was a partner with Mr. Lang on Woodstock \u201994 and \u201999. \u201cThe entrepreneurial spirit of 1969 doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201dMr. Lang declined to discuss the budget for Woodstock 50, but festivals of its size typically spend tens of millions on talent alone.\u201cWe paid $135,000 for all of our talent in 1969,\u201d Mr. Lang said. \u201cTimes have changed.\u201dThe festival is being financed by the Dentsu Aegis Network, a unit of the Japanese advertising giant Dentsu; agencies within the Dentsu Aegis Network will be involved in marketing and selling sponsorships. \u201cCannabis has always been in our DNA,\u201d Mr. Lang said with a smile; his first commercial venture, in 1966, was a head shop in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami.Merchandise sales \u2014\u00a0particularly featuring the original Woodstock bird-and-guitar logo \u2014 provide one proxy for gauging the continuing appeal of the Woodstock brand. Dell Furano, the chief executive of Epic Rights, who has handled official Woodstock merchandise for 15 years, said that he is expecting over $100 million in retail sales of Woodstock licensed products in 2019 \u2014\u00a0four or five times that of non-anniversary years.\u201cThere\u2019s every type of tie-dye. Children\u2019s products. Dog products. Speakers, wine, cannabis,\u201d Mr. Furano said in an interview. \u201cThe appeal is multigenerational.\u201dIn 1969, the mud, the tie-dye and the idealism were all catalysts in creating what the original festival had promised: three days of peace and music. Mr. Lang said that the divisiveness of the current political climate called for that once again.\u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s a perfect time,\u201d he said, \u201cfor a Woodstock kind of reminder.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman Sachs\u2019s Tactic in Malaysian Fraud Case: Smear an Ex-Partner", "Date": "2019-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey sound like the ingredients of a pulpy thriller: Bigamy. Secret religious conversions. A doctorate from a mail-order diploma mill. Affairs with powerful women.The sordid list \u2014 a mixture of facts, accusations and insinuations, packaged in a glossy slide show \u2014 represents the crux of a well-orchestrated campaign by Goldman Sachs to discredit one of its former partners and to minimize the Wall Street bank\u2019s role in the looting of a big Malaysian investment fund.In recent presentations to American regulators and law enforcement authorities, according to people familiar with their contents, Goldman executives and their lawyers have depicted Tim Leissner, a former top investment banker, as a master con man, someone so sneaky that even the retired military intelligence officers who work for the bank couldn\u2019t sniff him out.One big reason for concern is that senior Goldman officials, including the bank\u2019s chief executive at the time, helped win Malaysian business. And the relationship became a crucial engine of profits for the bank, generating about $600 million in fees.The bank\u2019s hope is that by casting Mr. Leissner as a rogue employee, Goldman will reduce its legal and reputational liability.On Wednesday, in a sign of how the stakes are rising, Goldman disclosed that in the fourth quarter of 2018 it set aside an additional $516 million to cover potential legal and regulatory penalties, including those related to 1MDB. And executives said Goldman could owe $2 billion on top of what it has already put in its reserves.\u201cFor Leissner\u2019s role in that fraud, we apologize to the Malaysian people,\u201d David M. Solomon, the bank\u2019s chief executive, told analysts Wednesday. \u201cAs you would expect, we have looked back and continue to look back to see if there is anything that we as a firm could have done better.\u201dA Goldman spokesman, Michael DuVally, said that since Mr. Leissner left the bank in 2016, Goldman found new violations of its internal policies \u201cthat we have shared with the Department of Justice and other relevant authorities.\u201dWhile it\u2019s not uncommon for companies to defend themselves by blaming lone employees, Goldman\u2019s ad hominem attacks on Mr. Leissner stand out for their aggressive, charged nature. The bank has not presented authorities with proof to substantiate all of its allegations, and some of them \u2014 including a focus on Mr. Leissner\u2019s supposedly converting to Islam on two occasions \u2014 are, at best, inflammatory.Mr. Leissner, 48, has been criminally charged by American and Malaysian prosecutors with bribery and money laundering in connection with the theft from 1MDB. He pleaded guilty last year to the United States charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in June. His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment for this article.Goldman suspended Mr. Leissner in 2016, and the bank\u2019s executives have publicly faulted him for lying to Goldman and snaring the bank in the fraud.But in private meetings with federal and state officials and employees in recent months, Goldman has intensified its efforts to blame Mr. Leissner, according to five people familiar with the bank\u2019s campaign who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.In November, for example, the bank met with federal prosecutors in Washington and delivered a lengthy PowerPoint presentation that sought to paint Mr. Leissner as a man practiced in the art of deception, according to two people familiar with the presentation.One slide in the presentation said that Mr. Leissner may have been briefly married to two women at the same time.Another slide included a photo of Mr. Leissner praying with other men, as well as images of a government-issued ID card that showed Mr. Leissner describing himself as Muslim. The people familiar with the presentation said Goldman officials used the slide to claim that Mr. Leissner twice converted to Islam in order to impress wealthy Muslim women he was dating.The inch-thick presentation also accused Mr. Leissner of having had a sexual relationship with at least one Goldman client and of having received a mail-order Ph.D. from a now-defunct university, the people said.It isn\u2019t clear what evidence Goldman has of the alleged affair, which bank officials believe took place before Mr. Leissner married the fashion designer and model Kimora Lee Simmons in 2013.In addition to the Justice Department, Goldman delivered similar multi-hour presentations to bank regulators, the people said. As well as the section seeking to discredit Mr. Leissner, the presentation outlined the vetting Goldman performed before agreeing to sell bonds for 1MDB. It also had a section on Mr. Low, including clips from news articles describing him as a promising entrepreneur and investor.In part, Goldman is using the presentation to argue that, given Mr. Leissner\u2019s supposed slipperiness, the bank\u2019s compliance system should not be faulted for failing to detect his scheme. The bank also is hoping to dissuade authorities from relying on any testimony or cooperation that Mr. Leissner might provide and that could put Goldman in a bad light.As part of his guilty plea last year, Mr. Leissner admitted to misappropriating at least $50 million from 1MDB\u2019s bond offerings and to deceiving Goldman about Mr. Low\u2019s role in those deals. But Mr. Leissner also told a federal judge that hiding his actions from Goldman\u2019s compliance department was \u201cvery much in line\u201d with a wider culture at the firm, especially in Asia.Senior executives at Goldman have been spreading the blame-the-rogue-employee message to its partners, according to six people familiar with Goldman\u2019s efforts.In December, Goldman held an annual dinner for retired partners at the Conrad Hotel in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Solomon talked about the 1MDB investigation, explaining that Goldman has muscular compliance programs but would not always be able to protect against ill-intentioned employees, according to five people who were there. They said they were struck by Mr. Solomon\u2019s bitter tone.Goldman\u2019s efforts to defend itself by attacking Mr. Leissner\u2019s behavior could raise more questions for the bank. Some Goldman executives knew about his alleged romantic relationships with clients, but the bank did not object to them until after Mr. Leissner became a target of investigations.Five current and former Goldman bankers said in interviews that they were aware of Mr. Leissner\u2019s hard-partying reputation and romantic overtures to wealthy women, including several who were executives at companies that were bank clients.Joe Ravitch, a former Goldman partner who helped hire Mr. Leissner from Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong in 1999, said it was common knowledge that Mr. Leissner was misbehaving. \u201cA lot of the people that worked for me would tell me the stories about Tim being a wild man,\u201d he said.In one case, Goldman investigated Mr. Leissner\u2019s relationship with a top female executive of a Malaysian media company, but the bank ultimately didn\u2019t take any action against Mr. Leissner, according to a Goldman official.In Malaysia, where Goldman itself has been criminally charged, prosecutors and senior government officials are unlikely to be receptive to the bank\u2019s claim that Mr. Leissner was a lone wolf.Alexandra Stevenson contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Sacramento Is Challenging That Notion", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 In the backyard of California\u2019s Capitol sits Franklin Boulevard, a largely industrial area where many residents earn a living keeping old vehicles on the road. The state, which has been aggressively pushing toward an electric-car future, has made few such inroads in this working-class neighborhood.\u201cElectric vehicles are for the rich. It\u2019s not for us,\u201d said Mike Bokan, who owns an auto-repair shop on Franklin Boulevard, explaining a prevailing attitude. The median income here is $30,000.One solution for making electric vehicles accessible to low-income Californians is coming from an unlikely ally: Volkswagen.Among the first investments are three new all-electric, eight-seat shuttles that will be put into service along Franklin Boulevard \u2014 courtesy of Electrify America. Mr. Bokan, who is also president of the local business association, welcomes the shuttles, due by July. They will be a small relief from the exhaust coming from Highway 99, a diesel-choked trucking route that borders the area.Across town, Sarah Quismondo, a retired nursing staff coordinator, lives in Riverview Plaza, a low-income senior apartment complex. In a neighboring parking lot are two Kia Soul electric cars that are part of a car-share program that began in May 2017. The program provides free access to the cars, and Ms. Quismondo signed up right away.The program, run by the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, served as the blueprint for another Electrify America program in the city, just underway, to put 140 all-electric Volkswagen e-Golfs at 70 low-income apartment complexes for car-sharing.After the scandal fully came to light, the company agreed to pay huge financial penalties worldwide, two Volkswagen executives were sent to prison \u2014 and Mr. Ayala\u2019s city is now teeming with E.V. experiments.Mr. Ayala added that programs to democratize electric vehicles were \u201cthe only thing to keep people like me that were involved in the Volkswagen case going.\u201dHe said that for many years, the state\u2019s goal was to lift sales numbers of electric vehicles regardless of how wealthy the buyers might be. \u201cBut the thinking evolved,\u201d he said. \u201cOur political leaders said that\u2019s not going to cut it anymore.\u201dFor nearly a decade, California has offered consumer rebates, as much as $7,000 per car, to make E.V.s more affordable. Since 2011, 15 residents of the 95824 ZIP code that surrounds Franklin Boulevard used the rebates. In the dense 95814 ZIP code where Ms. Quismondo lives, 71 did.The combined population of 40,000 in those two ZIP codes received $163,900 in state rebates. By contrast, in the affluent 94025 ZIP code, home to a similarly sized population \u2014 near Tesla\u2019s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. \u2014 buyers received $2.4 million in rebates.Persuading people to use the e-Golfs stationed at low-income apartment buildings could be a challenge. They cost 15 cents a minute or $9 an hour to use. Mr. Ayala cited obstacles to adoption in his organization\u2019s car-share program, which is free. He said many residents don\u2019t have driver\u2019s licenses or credit cards, which are needed to activate the service.I paid three visits to the Whispering Pines apartments, which was included in the service by Electrify America on Nov. 1. Each time, I found leaves collecting in the charging ports of the two cars, as if they had not been moved for several days. Envoy Technologies, which operates the program, declined to share usage rates for the cars at Whispering Pines.In yet another Sacramento-based experiment financed by Electrify America, a program called Gig this month started to put the first of 260 all-electric Chevrolet Bolts on city streets in a 13-square-mile zone between downtown and midtown. Seventy percent of residents in this zone are considered low income.Users can locate a Bolt via a mobile app, unlock the door, start it up and drive for $2.50 a mile or $15 an hour. When the ride is completed, members can park the car in any legal spot in the designated zone, lock the door and move on.These activities, which have turned Sacramento into a test bed for equitable access to E.V.s, are being conducted in the first $200 million cycle of the Electrify America investment. The company says these programs have taken about a year to develop and won\u2019t bear fruit until later this year.Even with few of those services fully in operation, Electrify America went back in December to the California Air Resources Board to get approval for the second $200 million cycle. The meeting became contentious when two board members, Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia and the former State Senator Dean Florez, both hailing from rural districts, accused Electrify America of primarily focusing on profits, which it is entitled to earn under the Volkswagen settlement.Electrify America officials say the rural investment in the first two cycles is closer to $50 million, when considering the charging stations positioned at Target and Walmart stores and at other locations along highway routes, as well as urban charging hubs.Encouraging adoption of electric vehicles in rural areas might be the toughest challenge. \u201cElectrify America is not going to want to heavily invest in an area where they think the utilization of the chargers is going to be really low,\u201d said Scott Shepard, a senior research analyst at Navigant Research, which focuses on clean-energy markets. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need extra pushing from regulators.\u201dAfter four hours of testimony from the public and board members, the state approved the second phase of the project. Mr. Florez cast the only vote against moving forward. He cited insufficient investment in rural areas, a lack of data about progress to date and a broken promise to quickly approve a second city to join Sacramento in becoming a test bed.\u201cI have a very serious issue with trust in the company,\u201d Mr. Florez said in an interview. \u201cPeople tend to forget why we got here in the first place,\u201d he added, referring to Volkswagen\u2019s emissions scandal.Giovanni Palazzo, the chief executive of Electrify America, defended the company\u2019s progress and its commitment to equity. He said Electrify America needed to simultaneously serve regions where E.V.s were already popular and \u201cinvest, test and learn where there\u2019s no adoption at all.\u201dElectrify America also faces criticism from competing charging infrastructure companies, like ChargePoint and EVgo. They are unhappy to see a new, well-financed rival \u2014 with the state\u2019s imprimatur and Volkswagen\u2019s funding \u2014 for coveted public charging locations.Mr. Ayala, the former California regulator, is undaunted by the political friction in making electric vehicles accessible to all. \u201cWe know that not all projects are going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this city is now a laboratory where things happen. If we find something that works, we can scale it up to the state level, then the nation and eventually the world.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018We Are in Control\u2019: 5 Takeaways From Governor Cuomo\u2019s State of the State Speech", "Date": "2019-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongestion pricing, sports betting and legalized recreational marijuana. Where are New York and its governor, Andrew Cuomo, headed? On Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, presented his vision for the coming year, a spectacle accompanied by predictable standing ovations and a 353-page briefing book. It was the ninth such address for Mr. Cuomo, and as in every year before, it was chockablock with dozens of ideas, goals and proposals, ranging from making marijuana legal to banning revenge pornography to allowing people to place bets on sporting events in four casinos upstate. Unlike in past years, however, when the divided Statehouse made big chunks of the State of the State address a pipe dream, the newly elected Democratic-controlled State Legislature puts the governor\u2019s agenda much closer to becoming reality. \u201cIt\u2019s just us,\u201d as the governor put it. \u201cWe are in control.\"What, exactly, will that control bring? That depends on whom you ask. Here\u2019s a look at what 2019 in New York may look like, as told by the governor\u2019s speech, his colleagues in the Legislature and history. Less than two years ago, Governor Cuomo was warning that marijuana was \u201ca gateway drug,\u201d a \u201cReefer Madness\u201d-style condemnation that put him out of step with a national trend toward the acceptance of cannabis as both medicine and recreational hobby. On Tuesday, however, it seemed his evolution was complete, as he touted the potential economic benefits of legalization (some $300 million per year in tax revenue by 2024) as well as its ability to support programs in poor communities. Well, Mr. Cuomo was largely a centrist for much of his political career but has undeniably banked left in recent years. And Tuesday\u2019s presentation was a veritable all-you-can-pass progressive buffet, with plans to strengthen rent regulation, extend a tax on high earners, ban single-use plastic shopping bags, reform cash bail, protect the coast from offshore drilling, combat the Trump administration at every last possible \u2026You get the idea. There are a few theories about that liberal tilt: He has always been a secret progressive, thwarted by a Republican Senate (which he was all too willing to work with for eight years); he has been secretly scared to the left by last year\u2019s primary challenge by Cynthia Nixon (whom he handily dispatched in September); he is secretly running for president and knows the Democratic Party may be in the market for a pure-at-heart firebrand who can back up rhetoric with accomplishments (Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly denied wanting the top job in Washington).Regardless, it would be tough to say that Mr. Cuomo isn\u2019t embracing his inner liberal, at least for the moment, particularly with plans to eliminate all fossil fuels and make the state 100 percent carbon free by 2040, as part of an idea known as the \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d It is an idea also trumpeted by none other than Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another New York Democrat. If many of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s proposals sounded familiar, that\u2019s because they are.The governor\u2019s vows to introduce early voting and close a campaign finance loophole were already passed by the State Senate and Assembly on Monday, the first legislative accomplishments of the new year; all that is left is for Mr. Cuomo to sign them. But you wouldn\u2019t have known that from Mr. Cuomo\u2019s speech, as he didn\u2019t mention those milestones at all.Many of these proposals are also old hat for the Assembly, a fact that was not lost on its leader, Carl E. Heastie, who diplomatically noted that \u201ca lot of these ideas have long been introduced by members.\u201d Indeed, even before the governor spoke, legislative leaders had said they would pass a bill to codify Roe v. Wade early next week, a concept that the governor made a central part of his \u201cwomen\u2019s agenda\u201d on Tuesday. Note: Mr. Cuomo also pushed for a \u201cwomen\u2019s agenda\u201d last year. One of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s biggest pushes this year will be to put into effect a congestion pricing plan, which would use a fee on drivers who enter the busiest parts of Manhattan to fund the city\u2019s flailing subway system. That plan could generate $15 billion for the subway system over 10 years.The same idea died last year, when legislators outside of Manhattan rejected it as unfair to their constituents. This time, those legislators have said they need to see details before they make up their minds. For now, they will have to keep waiting. A bill from the governor\u2019s office on Tuesday provided only the plan\u2019s organizational mechanism: The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, an arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would set the tolls, which would apply to certain roads, bridges or tunnels in or entering Manhattan south of 60th Street.Even if the proposal does go through, it will not be enough to meet all of the M.T.A.\u2019s capital needs, which could be as high as $60 billion. Mr. Cuomo has promised to make up the rest by splitting the tab with the city \u2014 a proposal Mayor Bill de Blasio has panned.In other words, the subway system\u2019s problems aren\u2019t going away any time soon.Better pump the brakes. If there was one phrase that was heard again and again in Albany on Tuesday, it was \u201cthe devil\u2019s in the details.\u201d Speeches and promises are nice enough, but real bills that make real laws are usually the result of days, months and sometimes years of negotiations by lawmakers and vetting by lawyers. (Oh yes, and lobbying by lobbyists, who may also face new oversight under a proposal by Mr. Cuomo.) There are also some troubling economic signs \u2014 tax receipts slumped in recent weeks \u2014 and the potential for intraparty conflicts among all those Democrats. Still, for one day at least, Mr. Cuomo seemed sanguine and dismissive of any suggestions that there could be friction between himself and his legislative counterparts.\u201cThe tension is how much can we get done to make the state better,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said before making his speech. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a positive tension.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia\u2019s Old and New Spending Spree?", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter 91___Y\u2019all are rich, as some Americans might say, and profligate \u2014 especially with an election on the way.Just this week, Scott Morrison proudly declared that Australia would spend more than A$12 million ($8.5 million) to mark the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook\u2019s first voyage to Australia. That includes A$6.7 million for having a replica of Captain Cook\u2019s ship, the Endeavour, circumnavigate Australia with stops at 39 locations.And that comes on top of big spending elsewhere.Money to memorialize the past (in glossy romanticized form) is plentiful. You probably heard about the A$500 million gift to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, to upgrade the monument with a bit of recent military history.But that\u2019s on top of another A$100 million set aside for the Sir John Monash Centre in France, along with A$12.7m for official histories of Iraq, Afghanistan and East Timor.The War Memorial windfall is the one drawing the most scrutiny; how the money will be spent is still something of a mystery. Lots of planes and tanks seems to be part of it.The rest? Well, good luck: Secrecy, it seems, is another common theme.This was also the week, for example, when the Great Barrier Reef Foundation announced its first project since it received A$443 million from the government last year. That\u2019s a giant pool of money. It was doled out at record speed, with barely any oversight and no competitive bidding.And the foundation\u2019s first project \u2014 setting aside A$574,000 to finance a survey of remote parts of the Great Barrier Reef \u2014 has done little to douse the flames of outrage. It came on the heels of an audit that found the administration costs associated with the A$443 million grant could be as high as A$86.4 million.But it would be a mistake to look only at the winners.Even a wealthy country still has to make choices so to make sure I wasn\u2019t overly distracted by all that generosity, I looked around a bit for what\u2019s being cut.The first thing I noticed was the value of scrutinizing spending in context.The second and more obvious thing that jumped out at me: cuts to higher education.This was already on my radar \u2014 many of our stories have examined Australia\u2019s dependence on full-fee-paying foreign students \u2014 but the numbers are staggering.In December 2017, the federal government announced it would cut A$2.2bn from universities, mostly through a two-year freeze in grants funding.But when spending outlays and spending cuts are thrown together, you start to wonder: Is it fair to say that Australia\u2019s government is choosing to spend money on a Disneyfied version of British settlement rather than on actual academic research?Perhaps not. The dollar amounts differ and there are all kinds of examples I\u2019ve left out of my cursory analysis.And yet, the old journalistic adage borne of Watergate \u2014 you know the one, \u201cfollow the money\u201d \u2014 still rings true in many ways and many places, including Australia.In Australia too, though, it\u2019s worth looking past the announcements promoting dollar signs and grants. If and when a recession does come, and there are signs that it\u2019s around the corner, there will be a lot of questions to be answered about priorities.Now for a few reads of the week.___The big news for us this week involved China\u2019s detention of Yang Hengjun, a writer and commentator and former Chinese official who\u2019s been an Australian citizen since 2002.He\u2019s the third foreigner to have been detained in China \u2014 without a shred of evidence \u2014 on the ominous charge of \u201cendangering national security\u201d since last month.We covered the charges and Australia\u2019s response.Here are a few other stories worth checking out as well.___Watching the tennis and looking for some context? Here are a few deeper and thoughtful reads.___Lots of interesting tech coverage this week.___I\u2019ve been meaning to dig into the Cooking archives for a while to find something special and relevant \u2014 and so here\u2019s one small example, drawn from NYT Cooking.With 700 events programmed at more than 130 venues, it\u2019s truly enormous (it\u2019s actually the third-largest fringe event in the world).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netherlands May Have Given Nike Illegal Tax Breaks, E.U. Says", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEuropean authorities are investigating whether the Dutch government illegally allowed the American sportswear maker Nike to avoid paying taxes on profits from sales in the region, potentially exposing the company to huge penalties similar to those imposed on Apple and Amazon.The inquiry, announced Thursday, is part of a broader European Commission crackdown on countries like Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands over accusations that they gave questionable tax breaks to multinational companies, many of them based in the United States, as a way of attracting corporate headquarters and white-collar jobs.The Dutch Finance Ministry said Thursday that it was cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe fully support the work of the commission,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.Nike said in its own statement that the investigation was \u201cwithout merit.\u201d\u201cNike is subject to and rigorously ensures that it complies with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands,\u201d the company, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., said in the statement.The Netherlands has long been a magnet for multinational corporations, attracting more foreign investment than Germany or France because of its business-friendly tax laws and its accommodating officials.Big companies have typically worked out arrangements with the Dutch Finance Ministry under which they minimized their tax bills by funneling profits to offshore tax havens with little or no corporate taxes. About \u20ac22 billion a year flows through the Netherlands to low-tax countries, according to the ministry, which did not provide an estimate of how much Nike might have saved.Airbus, Fiat Chrysler, Google, IBM and the Renault-Nissan alliance are among the corporations that have headquarters in the Netherlands. Nike\u2019s European headquarters are in Hilversum, just south of Amsterdam.The Netherlands has come under pressure from the European Commission and Dutch citizens disgruntled about special favors for big companies. Officials in Amsterdam have responded by vowing to tighten rules that allow companies to camouflage profits as \u201croyalties\u201d and protect them from taxes.Dutch officials have also said that they would no longer approve corporate structures that allowed companies to steer profits to low-tax countries and that royalties would be subject to taxation starting in 2021. The Netherlands is also moving to eliminate inconsistencies in international tax laws that corporations can exploit to avoid taxes.First, Nike allocated ownership of its \u201cswoosh\u201d trademark and other intellectual property to a subsidiary in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. The subsidiary in Hilversum then paid royalties for the use of the trademarks to the Bermuda unit. The royalties counted as business expenses and therefore were not taxed in the Netherlands.The company\u2019s strategies also lowered its tax bill in the United States and cut its worldwide tax rate to as low as 13 percent in 2017 from 35 percent in 2006, saving billions of dollars, according to the consortium.The European Commission is investigating whether the Dutch government violated European Union rules by approving the tax avoidance scheme and giving Nike and its Converse unit an unfair advantage over competitors.By paying an inflated price for the royalties, Nike could claim a larger tax deduction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mountain for Rent: $4,500 a Day", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlattekill, tucked between bigger and wealthier Catskills ski resorts, has come up with a new business plan that just might save it. Plattekill Mountain, a family-owned ski resort in Roxbury, N.Y., has 38 runs and two rustic chair lifts.Or, as Troy Kasmarcik, an 18-year-old snowboarder from Norwich, N.Y., put it: \u201cThis mountain is pretty sick.\u201d He tried Plattekill for the first time this winter. \u201cIt has a lot of jumps,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of mountains don\u2019t have them, but this has one right after the other.\u201dBut the real fairy tale here is that Plattekill Mountain has managed to stay open.Operating a ski mountain anywhere is a daunting task. To make money, you must keep the mountain open, no matter the weather.But 25 years later, the scrappy, indie mountain is thriving.In their early years as owners, the Vajtays were obsessed with two things that were not always compatible: making snow and avoiding debt. In the summer, they opened up the mountain for camping, music festivals and mountain biking. They took what they earned and invested it into snow-making equipment.In 2008, they started to do just that, charging $2,500 a day for exclusive use of Plattekill Monday through Thursday. (The price has since increased to $4,500.) Clients have ranged from corporations, like Citigroup, to religious organizations. Every year since 2010, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses congregations from New Jersey and New York have met there once a year.Ms. Brock, the organizer for the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, said that 100 people signed up for the first trip. By 2018, 532 people were skiing the mountain, with another 400 participants socializing in the lodge.So far this season, more than 50 percent of private rental days have been booked, Mr. Vajtay said. The $4,500 covers the lifts, labor, electricity and overhead. Plattekill then makes money on rentals, food and drink, and snow tubing. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to open the doors, staff up, and know that we will not lose any money,\u201d he said. Locals can feel a bit shut out sometimes, when private rentals conflict with Powderdaize. Recently the Vajtays have had to play down the event because of the conflict. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve started marketing mountain rentals people are booking,\u201d Ms. Vajtay said. \u201cSo if we have a snowstorm, and it\u2019s a snowstorm and a powder day, that day is booked. There isn\u2019t anything we can do.\u201d The Vajtays are trying to honor the community that has historically kept the mountain running; they intend to keep the resort as small and as affordable as possible. They are even open to bartering with locals, it seems. When Dennis Slauson, a regular who lives about 15 minutes away, helped them shovel the deck one morning, the Vajtays turned the lift on for him. \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nobody here.\u201d Mr. Slauson probably felt more like a private renter than Bart Lehmann, a Syracuse-based engineer who has rented Plattekill three times, did. The last time his group was there, he recalled that even though skiers could have spread out and seen no one else, they ended up skiing as a flock. \u201cOne trail was packed,\u201d he said, \u201cand every other one was empty.\u201d He remembered children in the group diving off the top wooden deck into snow banks. \u201cThe owners were like, Whatever you want to do, go ahead, go for it,\u201d said Mr. Lehmann. \u201cIt was surreal. We enjoyed the heck out of it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "N.B.A. Midseason Power Rankings: The Warriors Are Not No. 1, for Now", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFour of the six best records in the N.B.A. belonged to Eastern Conference teams through Saturday night\u2019s play.The Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, reached the 41-game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian (for them) 54-win pace.The first half of the regular season, in other words, has defied most preseason prognostications and requires special examination to properly sort out the 1-to-30 landscape. So it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known as the Committee (of One) and share my team-by-team progress report in the form of N.B.A. Power Rankings.The Committee, as it has since the 2002-03 season, determines the order by weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team\u2019s big-picture outlook \u2014 with sprinkles of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in.What used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once-a-season enterprise every January now. Yet the goal, as always, is to provide a more up-to-date and detailed assessment than the standings do.(Records and statistics are current heading into Sunday\u2019s games.)1. Toronto Raptors (32-12)The Raptors were this season\u2019s first 30-win team, which is impressive when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have been in uniform together only three times in Toronto\u2019s last 17 games. The threat of the Los Angeles Clippers signing Leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball-loving Canadian, but the Raptors may still assemble the best possible sales pitch: Win the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference to get to the N.B.A. finals and give Leonard ample reason to stay.2. Milwaukee Bucks (29-12)Giannis Antetokounmpo supplanting James Harden as the league\u2019s Most Valuable Player? Mike Budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win N.B.A. Coach of the Year? Milwaukee clinching the East\u2019s No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs? Any of those would have been fairly wild claims back in September, but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular-season schedule. The challenge now: Milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two months of its schedule.4. Denver Nuggets (28-13)The regular season is just under 90 days old. The plucky Nuggets, despite numerous injuries, have held the top spot in the West \u2014 Golden State\u2019s conference \u2014 for 44 of them. Yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guys get, as N.B.A. know-it-alls wrestle with billing Denver as a full-fledged contender \u2014 or dismissing them as a team that can only do pre-April damage. Book this either way: Nikola Jokic is a lock to snag his first All-Star berth.5. Oklahoma City (26-16)6. Houston Rockets (24-17)7. Indiana Pacers (28-14)8. San Antonio Spurs (25-19)This season\u2019s 11-14 start marked the first time Gregg Popovich has ever sported a sub-.500 record after 25 games and included a four-game stretch in which the Spurs unfathomably suffered three losses in excess of 30 points. The ensuing turnaround, though, has been no less remarkable. San Antonio is 14-5 and ranks No. 1 in offensive efficiency and No. 2 in defensive efficiency in that span, led by the midrange maestros DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge flat-out ignoring the league\u2019s 3-point revolution.9. Boston Celtics (25-17)The numbers continue to say that the Celtics are fine. They have a per-game average point differential (+6.4) that ranks second only to Milwaukee\u2019s (+9.1). Boston is also one of just four teams (along with Milwaukee, Toronto and Denver) to rank in the top 10 in both offensive (ninth) and defensive (fourth) efficiency. The problem: Boston just followed up an impressive rout of Indiana with losses in Miami and Orlando that suggested yet again that things are not fine.10. Philadelphia 76ers (27-16)For all the creative tension that has bubbled around the Sixers since they acquired Jimmy Butler on Nov. 10, they have the fourth-best overall record in that span (19-10) despite well-chronicled concerns about shooting and depth around Philadelphia\u2019s star trio as well as the occasional squawking. Butler\u2019s fit alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons has been less than seamless, as predicted, but stockpiling as much talent as possible and then trying to solve the puzzle is the N.B.A. way.11. Utah Jazz (23-21)The Jazz have risen to a more familiar No. 5 in defensive efficiency and contend that their road-heavy schedule, with 25 of the first 41 games away, has contributed mightily to keeping them out of the West\u2019s top eight for much of the season. But to resemble the team most experts thought it would be, Utah needs Donovan Mitchell\u2019s January resurgence to last, as well as a return to last season\u2019s standards from Joe Ingles.12. Portland Trail Blazers (26-17)One of my faulty predictions from last year asserted that 2018 would be the year that the Trail Blazers finally broke up the Damian Lillard/C.J. McCollum partnership as a means to build a more balanced roster. Portland has instead clung to the hope that Jusuf Nurkic will keep inching closer to becoming the consistent third wheel it has needed for ages. It is a better team than last season\u2019s version but only marginally \u2014 and still vulnerable to athletic opposition.13. Los Angeles Lakers (23-20)Winning without LeBron James is hard. Who knew? The Lakers are 3-6 since James suffered a strained groin in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State. As a result, they have slid from a higher-than-expected No. 4 to an uncomfortable No. 8 in the West \u2014 thus resurrecting all the preseason questions about L.A.\u2019s ability to make the playoffs with, shall we say, such an eclectic roster. James appears likely, at 34, to miss more than the 11 games Stephen Curry lost to a similar injury in November.14. Los Angeles Clippers (24-18)I fear they are at high risk to slip out of the West\u2019s top eight, but the Clippers would certainly slot in right at the top of the play-hard rankings if there were such an industry. The feisty likes of Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley, flanking a better-than-ever Tobias Harris, continue to make the Clippers more bizarrely competitive than anyone imagined heading into a summer in which they appear well positioned to make the loudest free-agent noise in franchise history.15. Sacramento Kings (22-21)A Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer-beater to topple the Lakers on Dec. 27 hiked the fast-paced Kings\u2019 record to 19-16 and seemed to announce the blossoming tandem of De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield as certifiable playoff material after a league-high 12 consecutive seasons of missing out. Sacramento then unraveled, enduring a 1-5 funk which included an embarrassing fall-from-ahead loss at Phoenix when the Suns were without Devin Booker. You cannot afford funks in the West.16. Miami Heat (21-20)Little emanating from South Beach makes sense, whether it is Miami\u2019s ability to play .500 basketball despite missing out on Butler via trade and having Goran Dragic healthy for just 14 games \u2014 or the fact this team is 0-3 against Atlanta. It is unclear how long it will take Miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of Butler\u2019s caliber, but the retiring Dwyane Wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage.17. Brooklyn Nets (21-23)The drop-off from the East\u2019s top five to teams trying to secure the last three playoff stops is as steep as pessimists feared. Not that the Nets intend to apologize after the barren half-decade they endured in the wake of their disastrous 2014 trade with Boston. While the Knicks tank their way to a shot at Zion Williamson, New Yorkers may get postseason games after all, thanks to success stories like Spencer Dinwiddie, D\u2019Angelo Russell, Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen.18. New Orleans Pelicans (20-23)It is a misnomer to say Anthony Davis has no help; Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle are all accomplished players. The Pelicans\u2019 problems have been health (most notably injuries for Mirotic and the point guard Elfrid Payton) and difficulties in playing Davis, Mirotic and Randle together even when they are all available. New Orleans, as a result, is facing the biggest possible issue: Scenarios that force them to trade The Brow grow more plausible by the day.19. Washington Wizards (18-25)Indiana has crashed the East\u2019s upper crust to give the conference its own Fab Five, but we were not exaggerating the drop-off to the chasing pack. Look no further than the nation\u2019s capital for proof, with the Wizards still firmly in the playoff chase despite losing John Wall to season-ending heel surgery. Recent wins over Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and Milwaukee should tell you that the Wiz are not heeding some fans\u2019 calls to tank.20. Dallas Mavericks (20-22)Luka Doncic has a real shot to become the first rookie to achieve All-Star status since Blake Griffin in 2011, which already makes this a more successful season in Dallas than many forecast. But the huge disparity between the Mavericks\u2019 play at home (16-4) and on the road (4-18), Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s health woes in what they hoped would be a heartwarming final season and J.J. Barea\u2019s season-ending Achilles tear, have combined to snuff out some of the joy.22. Charlotte Hornets (19-23)The Michael Jordan-owned Hornets have All-Star Weekend hosting duties in a month to assure the franchise and city a measure of prominence this season. But what they, especially Jordan, really want is a playoff berth that is by no means certain given the limited scoring punch Charlotte can field beyond its do-everything guard Kemba Walker. It also does not help that the Hornets have already racked up a league-high eight costly losses in one-possession games.23. Detroit Pistons (18-23)24. Memphis Grizzlies (19-23)Memphis has nose-dived from a West-leading record of 12-5 on Thanksgiving, losing 18 of 25 games while the former All-Star center Marc Gasol has been submerged in a slump that has shown few signs of relenting. The fade may not only cost the Grizzlies a playoff berth but also threaten to extend Mike Conley\u2019s career-long wait for an All-Star berth, since team success is bound to be factored in to the votes of the media panel and coaches given the glut of worthy guards in the West.25. Orlando Magic (18-24)The Magic reeled off seven wins in a nine-game stretch in November under new coach Steve Clifford to spawn hopes that competing for a spot in the inviting lower reaches of the East\u2019s playoff ladder was feasible. Two months later, apart from the career-best season assembled by the veteran big man Nikola Vucevic, Orlando is back on course for a ninth successive trip to the lottery and remains as desperate as Phoenix for an upgrade at point guard.26. Atlanta Hawks (13-29)If the Hawks finish where they are as the so-called best of the worst, they will have a 10.5 percent shot at the No. 1 overall pick in June in the N.B.A.\u2019s new lottery system, which flattens out the odds to 14 percent each for teams with the three-worst records. In the interim, Trae Young\u2019s development is the overwhelming focus, which makes it difficult not to partake in obsessing over how Young is shooting from the field (.394) and 3-point range (.291).27. Phoenix Suns (11-33)Deandre Ayton\u2019s Rookie of the Year campaign would appear to be the only pleasant diversion for one of the league\u2019s longest-suffering fan bases amid Phoenix\u2019s ninth straight non-playoff season, Booker\u2019s various health woes and the owner Robert Sarver\u2019s struggles to secure public financing for the renovation of the Suns\u2019 downtown arena. Yet I cannot say I love Ayton\u2019s chances after witnessing up close how badly he was outplayed by the R.O.Y. favorite Doncic last week.28. New York Knicks (10-32)Will the Knicks really hold Kristaps Porzingis out for the entire season? Will the Knicks trade Enes Kanter? Will the Knicks get lucky in the June draft? Those three questions have dominated Coach David Fizdale\u2019s first season in New York while this franchise waits for its opportunity in July to see if it can really make the long-awaited splash in free agency that many league observers legitimately expect after two mostly hapless decades.29. Chicago Bulls (10-33)Jim Boylen is still running some long practices, but things have mellowed (at least somewhat) between the Bulls and their feisty new coach after the initial wave of wind sprints, push-ups and disagreements. While Boylen works to secure a return next season, it is all about development for the rest of this season for the few keepers on the roster \u2014 most notably Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine and Wendell Carter Jr. \u2014 and finding new homes for Jabari Parker and Robin Lopez.30. Cleveland Cavaliers (8-35)In the four years between James\u2019s two stints with his home-state franchise, Cleveland somehow won the N.B.A. draft lottery three times: 2011 (Kyrie Irving), 2013 (Anthony Bennett) and 2014 (Andrew Wiggins). Dreams of getting lucky again and earning the right to select Zion Williamson may be the only source of comfort for Cavaliers fans to get through what surely must feel like the longest of winters watching such hopeless basketball.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Carlos Ghosn Leaves Renault as It Tries to Heal Rift With Nissan", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Carlos Ghosn has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Renault, according to France\u2019s finance minister, as the French automaker turns its focus to securing the future of the world\u2019s biggest auto alliance.In an interview with Bloomberg Television on Thursday, Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said Mr. Ghosn had stepped down the night before.\u201cCarlos Ghosn just resigned, last night, and now it is time to define and to put a new governance in place,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said. \u201cBecause what is today the most important thing is to prepare the future of Renault and the future of the alliance.\u201dRenault had stood by Mr. Ghosn since his arrest in Japan two months ago. But the company had also begun making plans to replace its longtime leader as Mr. Ghosn\u2019s legal troubles threatened its alliance with the Japanese automakers Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors.Mr. Le Maire said last week that preserving jobs was a \u201cpriority.\u201dMr. Ghosn had already offered to resign as chief executive and chairman of Renault, and the company is calculating his pension and other compensation, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly.The preference at Renault was for Mr. Ghosn to step down rather than be removed, to eliminate any legal uncertainty over his role. He will remain a member of the board until a meeting of general shareholders in June.Renault\u2019s nomination committee is expected to recommend Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the French tire maker Michelin, as chairman of the board on Thursday, the person said, and Thierry Bollor\u00e9, Renault\u2019s chief operating officer, as chief executive.Renault installed temporary leadership but kept Mr. Ghosn officially at the helm even as Nissan and Mitsubishi fired him as chairman.\u201cWe now must move to a new phase,\u201d Mr. Le Maire said last week.After replacing Mr. Ghosn, Renault plans to intensify efforts to repair the acrimonious rift that opened with Nissan, the dominant partner in the alliance, after his arrest. Since then, each company has viewed the other as trying to seize the opportunity to tip the balance of power in its favor.Mr. Ghosn was the dominant personality who held the alliance together, overseeing the operation and performance of the three companies simultaneously.\u201cThe key issue is not so much the leadership of Renault, but who is going to lead, manage and develop the alliance,\u201d Mr. Lemal said. \u201cAnd for that, you need someone who is going to devote all his time and energy to restore dialogue between the manufacturers.\u201dThe replacement of Mr. Ghosn at Renault will be a turning point in the dramatic saga of one of the most powerful executives in the auto industry. Over two decades, he built one of the world\u2019s most successful groups in the sector by reviving Nissan and Renault, an alliance that later expanded to include Mitsubishi.Shin Kukimoto, the deputy chief of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors\u2019 Office, told reporters on Thursday that Mr. Ghosn\u2019s departure as chairman and chief executive of Renault was irrelevant.\u201cWe will just continue to carry out our investigation,\u201d Mr. Kukimoto said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think Renault will meddle in the investigation anyway.\u201dLast week, Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, dismissed as \u201cabsurd\u201d reports that his company had plotted to oust Mr. Ghosn, and refrained from discussing rebalancing power in the alliance.The deferral of the matter until April fanned concerns in Paris that the Japanese company was maneuvering to prevent Renault from participating in alliance decision-making at a crucial moment.In an unusual move, French officials flew to Tokyo to weigh in. Martin Vial, one of two French government representatives on the Renault board, and Emmanuel Moulin, the chief of staff for Mr. Le Maire, the finance minister, met last week with Japanese officials and Nissan stakeholders.Soon after the visit, Japanese news outlets reported that France was seeking to compel a merger between Nissan and Renault, prompting a heated denial by Mr. Le Maire.\u201cNo shareholding rebalancing or modification of cross shareholdings between Renault and Nissan are on the table,\u201d he said in an interview published on Sunday in the French weekly Le Journal du Dimanche.A spokeswoman for the Finance Ministry added that Mr. Ghosn had an explicit mandate from Renault shareholders to \u201cstrengthen and consolidate the alliance.\u201d\u201cRight now, the priority is ensuring the stable and solid governance of the alliance and managing forthcoming changes,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be a dialogue about other issues. This is a step-by-step process.\u201dRenault has maintained that the No. 1 priority is to smooth strained relations with Mr. Saikawa and Nissan, strengthen the alliance and move past the governance fiasco to focus on the carmakers\u2019 performance at a time when markets worldwide are showing signs of weakness.It is a challenge that Mr. Senard, 66, the longtime leader of Michelin, would take up immediately if confirmed as chairman of the Renault board. The son of a diplomat and a meticulous businessman who steers clear of the limelight, he is a striking contrast to Mr. Ghosn, a prominent executive whose success imbued him with a rock-star image.Mr. Senard was scheduled to step down from Michelin in May to make way for a successor there.Demand for cars is falling in China, the United States and Europe, the three biggest markets, and the partnership that Renault and Nissan founded in 1999 to share buying power and expertise is essential if they, and Mitsubishi, are to stay competitive, analysts say.To succeed, the companies will have to act quickly to put their differences behind them.In a nod to the importance of scale, Ford Motor and Volkswagen announced plans last week to build their own broad alliance, to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars, possibly adding to competition for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi group.Renault still relies on financial contributions from Nissan, the alliance\u2019s dominant performer, and some Renault officials have expressed concern that Nissan\u2019s sales and financial performance are slipping.Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In This Market, It May Be Time to Play Defense", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter months of stock market declines, investment strategists are divided on appropriate responses.There is a range of possible approaches, none as simple as the kind of straightforward investing that can lead to immediate rewards when the market is consistently rising.\u201cWe do advise our investors to hold lower allocations to global equities \u2014 particularly U.S. equities \u2014 than normal,\u201d Mr. Brightman said. He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with \u201cthe exception of M.L.P.s,\u201d all are expensively priced.Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. \u201cThe problem with cash is you don\u2019t make any money,\u201d Mr. Brightman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return.\u201dNick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least \u201cthinking about\u201d tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. \u201cI spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the idea that they\u2019ve become more aware.\u201dMr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix\u2019s $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. \u201cWe are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market,\u201d she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect any major regulatory changes in 2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term.\u201dMr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor\u2019s view of the larger economy. \u201cIf an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies.\u201dBut, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. \u201cThings can change very quickly,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Early Voting and Other Changes to Election Laws Are Coming to New York", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 For years, the ways in which voters in New York have been stymied by the state\u2019s antiquated voting laws have stood in stark contrast to the state\u2019s liberal reputation.But with Democrats now in control of both chambers of the State Capitol and the governor\u2019s office, things are about to change. Legislative leaders said they intend to pass what they described as a voting reform package on Monday to overhaul the state\u2019s voting laws, among the more restrictive in the nation.The proposals are a veritable wish list for those who have blamed New York\u2019s laws for driving down voter turnout. The measures include allowing early voting, preregistration of 16- and 17-year-olds and consolidating state and federal primary elections, which are now held in different months.Lawmakers also plan to pass bills to allow vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration, though those proposals will also require voter referendums \u2014 and passage by the next Legislature, scheduled to be seated in 2021 \u2014 as they change the State Constitution.\u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d said Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, the deputy Democratic leader in the Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s a long list of issues that have been kept on the shelf by Republicans all these years.\u201cAnd the issues we\u2019re handling in the first week are incredibly important, and there will be incredibly important issues in the second week and the third week and the fourth week.\u201dThe changes to the state\u2019s voting laws are long overdue, according to good government groups that have watched as New York has fallen to the bottom of lists tracking voter participation, despite being one of the nation\u2019s bluest states.\u201cNew York is moving from caboose to locomotive,\u201d said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, adding, \u201cNew York has been in the obstacle-creating business, as opposed to the obstacle-smashing business when it comes to voting.\u201dGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has expressed support for such measures in the past, most recently last month, when he vowed to make an election overhaul a priority in the first 100 days of the new year. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said the administration is hopeful that the voting package is the start of a range of reforms lawmakers pass this session.\u201cWe look forward to working with them to go further and enact public campaign financing, make Election Day a state holiday and ban corporate contributions once and for all,\u201d the spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, said.The Democrat-dominated Assembly has voted to close the loophole for years, but the measure went nowhere in the Republican-led Senate.On Monday, however, the new Democratic leadership in the Capitol intends to pass identical bills to cap contributions from L.L.C.s at $5,000, bringing them in line with limits on donations from corporations.L.L.C.s would also be required \u201cto disclose its beneficial ownership\u201d with the State Board of Elections, requiring more transparency of entities that are often purposefully opaque, sometimes identified by little more than an address of the company that established the L.L.C.The push on election reform is expected to be followed in short order on Tuesday by two other progressive agenda items: a ban of treating minors with so-called conversion therapy, which aims to \u201ccure\u201d gay people of being homosexual; and the Gender Non-Discrimination Act (Genda), which prohibits discrimination based on \u201cgender identity or expression\u201d and expands the definition of hate crimes to cover transgender people.The sponsor of both those bills is Senator Brad Hoylman, who said they would be the first gender-oriented legislation to pass since same-sex marriage was legalized in 2011. Mr. Hoylman, who is the only openly gay lawmaker in the upper chamber, said that Republicans had thwarted even minor bills and resolutions that mentioned gay rights or issues.Mr. Hoylman, who represents Lower Manhattan and brought his husband, David, and their 16-month-old daughter, Lucy, to the opening day of session on Wednesday, said he hoped that the bills would find some votes from across the aisle as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see Republican support,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, the interim minority leader of the Senate, Joseph Griffo, said in his introductory speech that the Republicans\u2019 \u201cmission as public servants remains the same: starting with supporting policies that help hard-working, middle-class families succeed and businesses grow and prosper.\u201dFor the time being, Republicans, with only 23 members in a 63-seat house, have little recourse to stop a Democratic agenda, including the major changes to the state\u2019s voting laws that could amplify demographic advantages in an already deep-blue state.Money, however, is a bipartisan need, and the L.L.C. loophole has been used by both parties to support campaigns. Still, many of the new members in the Senate Democratic conference ran for office on a pledge of getting corporate money out of politics, and Monday\u2019s plan of action seems calibrated to make good on those campaign promises.\u201cI didn\u2019t take any L.L.C. money, a number of people coming in didn\u2019t take any L.L.C. money,\u201d said Zellnor Myrie, a newly elected senator from Brooklyn. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re responding to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Is a Hacker a Whistle-Blower? In Football Leaks Case, a Hungarian Judge Will Decide", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past four years, some of the most damning secrets of the professional soccer industry have been exposed by a deluge of leaks that have shined an unflattering light on some of the sport\u2019s most popular clubs, players and coaches.For the moment, though, Pinto\u2019s fate depends on a far narrower matter: whether his team of lawyers can successfully argue that he is a whistle-blower under Hungarian law \u2014 a defendant whose actions to expose malpractice and, potentially, a raft of financial and other crimes in soccer outweigh any offenses he might have committed.In the view of the Portuguese authorities, Pinto is guilty of extortion and violation of secrecy in relation to his contact with the investment fund, Doyen Sports. They and Doyen have accused him of threatening to publish internal company documents \u2014 revealing transfer fees and secret payments \u2014 unless the fund paid him to keep the documents private.Those documents, which offered a window into both Doyen\u2019s business model and its bank accounts, were later published on the website known as Football Leaks. The revelations, along with a number of player contracts posted on the site, exposed a murky world of soccer finance that was at best unsavory and at worst in violation of national and international soccer regulations.Ultimately, Pinto turned over about 70 million documents and 3.4 terabytes of information to a German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, which shared documents with a select group of news media outlets who published reports on their contents.Now that Pinto has been arrested on a Portuguese warrant, his case represents a high-profile test of a Hungarian law passed in 2014 that affords special protection to whistle-blowers. His lawyers plan to argue that the leads his leaked documents provided to a variety of European law enforcement organizations outweigh Pinto\u2019s actions.\u201cBased on the leaks, there have been some extremely important criminal investigations opened with prosecutions in various countries,\u201d said William Bourdon, Pinto\u2019s lawyer, who previously has represented the national-security whistle-blower Edward Snowden. \u201cWithout Pinto, this wouldn\u2019t have been possible.\u201dUnlike in most whistle-blower cases, however, Pinto has no official connection with the soccer industry \u2014 no access to clubs\u2019 books or a players\u2019 contracts \u2014 beyond being a fan of the game.\u201cFor me, it doesn\u2019t make a difference considering what is the basis of whistle-blower protection: the intensity of the contribution to the public interest,\u201d Bourdon said. \u201cThis is the key point.\u201dBourdon said Pinto already had agreed to assist the authorities in Switzerland, and that Germany\u2019s tax agency was seeking access to his information, too. But it is the decision of a Hungarian judge that matters most to him at the moment, since that will determine whether or not he avoids extradition to Portugal.\u201cWe expect the Hungarian judge to be sensitive to the paradoxical situation,\u201d Bourdon said, \u201cthat on one hand he\u2019s being prosecuted in Portugal, while on the other he has been providing assistance to prosecutors in other countries.\u201dSpain\u2019s high court last September rejected an extradition request for Falciani \u2014 once labeled the Edward Snowden of banking \u2014 from Switzerland.In addition to Pinto\u2019s extradition, the Portuguese police have demanded the entirety of the computer equipment seized from him in Hungary. Bourdon called that an overreach because their case is limited to the suspected 2015 extortion attempt.Bourdon acknowledged that Pinto had attempted to make contact with Doyen once he had the company\u2019s documents, but he said the extortion charges were not valid because Pinto ultimately \u201cdidn\u2019t follow through\u201d with an operation to secure a payment.Bourdon described the charges as \u201ca tool to criminalize him, to target him as an offender and not a whistle-blower.\u201dLittle is known about Pinto. A Der Spiegel reporter, Rafael Buschman, is the only journalist known to have contact with an individual connected with Football Leaks. Buschman has written a series of breathless accounts and a book detailing his relationship with a man he referred to as \u201cJohn.\u201d Der Spiegel has not confirmed Pinto is its source.But a September report by the Portuguese magazine Sabado reported Pinto was the \u201ccomputer genius\u201d behind Football Leaks. Shortly after its article was published, a message was posted on Football Leaks\u2019 Facebook page that appeared to taunt Portuguese authorities, signing off with \u201c#catchmeifyoucan.\u201d\u201cJurisprudence and regulations say there is a question of proportionality between the seriousness of the offense and the importance to public interest,\u201d Bourdon said. \u201cYou could violate the law, could be hacking, or stealing, and if the contribution is tremendous then it\u2019s not a crime.\u201cIt will be a historic decision for a Hungarian judge to make.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mueller Statement Disputes Report That Trump Directed Cohen to Lie", "Date": "2019-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election disputed on Friday a report that said President Trump had directed Michael D. Cohen, his longtime lawyer and fixer, to lie to Congress about his role in negotiations to build a skyscraper in Moscow.\u201cBuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the special counsel\u2019s office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony are not accurate,\u201d said the spokesman, Peter Carr.Before Mr. Carr\u2019s statement, the BuzzFeed report led to a flurry of reactions by senior members of Congress who said that the allegations, if true, could be grounds for initiating impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.A proven effort by Mr. Trump to pressure a witness to commit perjury would be one of the most damning revelations so far in the investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to sabotage the 2016 presidential election and could be the cornerstone of a case that the president obstructed justice to keep investigators at bay.Both the White House and lawyers for Mr. Trump vigorously denied the BuzzFeed report even before the special counsel\u2019s office weighed in.\u201cTwo words sum it up better than anything anybody else can say, and that is \u2018categorically false,\u2019\u201d the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, told reporters on Friday.The statement by Mr. Carr, the special counsel\u2019s spokesman, was unusual because it appeared to be the first time he had publicly challenged the facts of a news media account that had generated significant attention for its revelations about the president.The New York Times has not independently confirmed the BuzzFeed report. One person familiar with Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony to the special counsel\u2019s prosecutors said that Mr. Cohen did not state that the president had pressured him to lie to Congress.Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that his panel would investigate the BuzzFeed report and was \u201calready working to secure additional witness testimony and documents related to the Trump Tower Moscow deal and other investigative matters.\u201dIf true, Mr. Schiff said, the allegations \u201cwould constitute both the subornation of perjury as well as obstruction of justice.\u201dSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Friday that the panel expected Mr. Cohen to be back to testify privately in early February.In a December court filing, prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller described how Mr. Cohen had repeatedly lied to Congress both about the length of negotiations over the Trump Tower Moscow deal and about Mr. Trump\u2019s involvement in the project.Mr. Cohen had told lawmakers that the negotiations ended in January 2016 \u2014 before the first presidential primaries \u2014 and were never discussed extensively among executives of the Trump Organization. In fact, according to prosecutors, the discussions continued as late as June 2016, after Mr. Trump was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.They also said Mr. Cohen discussed the progress of the Moscow project with Mr. Trump more frequently than he had told the committee and had briefed members of Mr. Trump\u2019s family about the negotiations.When he appeared in court to plead guilty to lying to Congress, Mr. Cohen said he had concealed his interactions with Russian officials and the fact that he asked Mr. Trump to travel to Russia to promote the deal because he wanted to support Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical messaging.\u201dThat day, Mr. Trump defended his role in the Trump Tower Moscow discussions, brushing aside concerns that he was advancing his business interests at the time he was hoping to become president. \u201cThere was a good chance that I wouldn\u2019t have won, in which case I would have gotten back into the business, and why should I lose lots of opportunities?\u201d he told reporters.Mr. Cohen drafted his statement to Congress in August 2017 along with Steven Ryan, his lawyer at the time, according to people familiar with how the testimony was put together. Mr. Ryan was working with lawyers for the Trump family as part of a joint defense agreement.At least one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers saw Mr. Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony before he delivered it in August and October 2017, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Mr. Cohen initially repeated his false statements about the Moscow tower to prosecutors working for Mr. Mueller after he pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. But he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and proved credible, the special counsel\u2019s office said in a December sentencing memo.Mr. Cohen said he initially lied because he did not want to contradict his congressional testimony, prosecutors said. Subsequently, he took care \u201cnot to overstate his knowledge or the role of others in the conduct under investigation\u201d and provided \u201cuseful information\u201d about his contacts with \u201cpersons connected to the White House\u201d in 2017 and 2018, the special counsel\u2019s filing said.That truthfulness was a departure from Mr. Cohen\u2019s pattern of deception throughout his professional life, according to a separate sentencing memo by federal prosecutors in New York, filed at the same time as Mr. Mueller\u2019s. Driven by greed, they said, he \u201crepeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends.\u201dMr. Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison for lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and financial crimes. He said he took full responsibility for his crimes, but said he acted out of blind loyalty to Mr. Trump, who he said \u201cled me to choose a path of darkness over light.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cUnder an obstruction statute, yes.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Ben Protess from New York.Advertisement"}

Hearings like those \u2014 combined, at some point, with more findings from Robert Mueller \u2014 seem like they would have the best chance of cutting into Trump\u2019s support from Republican voters and ultimately members of Congress.

{"Headline": "Stung by Florida Midterm Losses, Democrats See a Swing State Drifting Away", "Date": "2019-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPEMBROKE PINES, Fla. \u2014 After a painful midterm election for Florida Democrats that showed this crucial swing state drifting away from them, a group of party activists gathered at a Cuban restaurant last month to receive some bitter medicine \u2014 and a sober warning \u2014 to go with their croquettes and plantain chips.Democrats started organizing Latino voters too late, didn\u2019t tailor their message for an increasingly diverse community and ultimately took Latino support for granted, a Florida pollster told about 50 members of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Broward County.With the swearing-in last Tuesday of two newly elected Republican leaders, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Senator Rick Scott, Florida has become a more reliably red political bastion, making the path to Electoral College victory that much tougher for the 2020 Democratic nominee.For Republicans, Florida stands out as the best political news from an otherwise grim year, a show of strength in a state that has voted for every presidential winner since 1992 and seems to be growing more favorable to their party at a moment when demographic changes are lifting Democrats elsewhere. The successful courting of up-for-grabs Hispanics, the surge of transplanted senior voters, the solidifying support in conservative North Florida: All illustrate why this prized battleground state is tilting to the right.As for Democrats, they remain just as shellshocked as they were after Election Day, when it became clear that Bill Nelson, the state\u2019s longtime senator, and Andrew Gillum, the electrifying young mayor of Tallahassee, had lost by exceedingly close margins. As of Tuesday, there was still only one Democrat in statewide office.\u201cWe just live in a red state here,\u201d said Alex Sink, a former Democratic state official who once narrowly lost a bid for governor. \u201cI think it\u2019s just tilted toward the Republicans now, and I hate to say that.\u201dThe question looming over the state going into 2020 is the same one Democrats are wrestling with elsewhere: How can the party narrow its losses with voters who are older \u2014 and in many cases white \u2014 without alienating younger, nonwhite voters?What is so agonizing for Democrats is that 2018 did little to clarify the best path. The party put forward Mr. Gillum, a 39-year-old black progressive, and Mr. Nelson, a 76-year-old white moderate who had been in elected office for nearly half a century. Mr. Nelson lost by about 10,000 votes and Mr. Gillum didn\u2019t fare much worse, losing by about 32,000 votes.In other words, the party pursued two differing approaches in the same state and the same year \u2014 nominating a progressive who could mobilize voters difficult to turn out in midterms as well as a moderate who would appear more amenable to persuadable voters \u2014 and both failed.That has done little to extinguish the intraparty debate, after a banner year for Democrats nationally, when they gained 40 House seats and seven governorships amid a backlash against President Trump.Some moderates, including Ms. Sink, say flatly that Democrats would have won the governorship had they nominated former Representative Gwen Graham, who narrowly lost to Mr. Gillum in the primary. \u201cWhat would they have pinned on her?\u201d asked Ms. Sink, alluding to Mr. Gillum\u2019s left-wing politics and to an F.B.I. investigation into potential corruption in public real estate development in Tallahassee under Mr. Gillum.More broadly, the pragmatic wing of the party argues that the only way to win in such a dead-center state is to promote consensus-oriented candidates who can limit Republican margins in Florida\u2019s rural and exurban areas.Ms. Graham said the results last year made it clear that \u201cyou have to have a candidate who can make a difference in areas where having a D behind your name makes people suspicious.\u201dMr. Nelson, the recently ousted Democratic senator, says he has a preferred 2020 candidate, who he thinks might turn things around: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u201cI would say of the whole crowd, I think Biden would have the best chance in Florida,\u201d Mr. Nelson said of the 2020 field, allowing that he has encouraged his former colleague to run and believes he would be perceived \u201cas moderate enough.\u201dBut these sorts of assessments make progressives want to pull their hair out.Pointing to the near-identical results, they argue that many of the state\u2019s conservative-leaning voters made little distinction between Mr. Gillum and Mr. Nelson. Mr. Gillum\u2019s supporters also note that he improved upon the losses of the last two Democratic nominees for governor, who were both white.\u201cHe got closer than anybody else did,\u201d said State Senator Oscar Braynon II, a Miami-area Democrat, pointing to how African-American turnout spiked from the last race for governor and suggesting no other candidate could have done that.If the Democrats\u2019 challenges in Florida are difficult to resolve, they are easy enough to diagnose.Florida is a microcosm of the country \u2014 and some of what is dogging Democrats in the state reflects the party\u2019s broader challenges.\u201cThis is not a progressive state,\u201d said Philip Levine, the former Miami Beach mayor who also ran unsuccessfully for governor. \u201cAnd that, in my opinion, is representative of the state of our country today. Florida is America.\u201dFlorida\u2019s rural white voters, as elsewhere, have abandoned their ancestral allegiances and become reliable Republicans.At the same time, Fox News-watching seniors from the Northeast and Midwest are flooding the state\u2019s retirement communities. They can be counted on to vote regularly, and they are increasingly supporting Republicans.\u201cYou have a lot of retirees who reminisce about their childhoods every time they hear Donald Trump say \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019\u201d said Representative Darren Soto, an Orlando Democrat. \u201cAnd they vote in a higher percentage than anybody else.\u201dThese transplants descending on Central Florida, the Gulf Coast, the Panhandle and parts of the Atlantic Coast run the socioeconomic gamut but share the same Republican loyalties. For example, two of the three counties with the strongest turnout in November were retiree hubs with notably different profiles.The party\u2019s best-performing county in the state was Sumter, the Central Florida enclave that is home to the Villages retirement community and its thousands of golf cart-driving, middle-class seniors. But turnout was nearly as strong in Collier County, a more well-heeled community on the gulf that includes Naples.Mr. Gillum and Mr. Nelson both received less than 35 percent of the vote in Collier County and less than 30 percent in Sumter County. These voters have little connection to state politics, are largely grounded in national issues and are overwhelmingly supportive of Mr. Trump.Mr. Nelson still sounded in near disbelief weeks after his loss, which he attributed to Mr. Scott\u2019s self-financing and the faulty design of the Broward County ballot, which all but hid the Senate race on a bottom corner of the page.But he seemed particularly anguished as he recounted losing the county where he grew up.\u201cWe only got 43 percent,\u201d he said of Brevard County, contending that many there were not aware of his roots or what he had done for nearby Cape Canaveral.Mr. Nelson recalled setting up a press round table at a local restaurant with a former NASA administrator who was supporting his campaign. When his staff arrived, he said, the manager on duty was so rude they decided to move the event elsewhere.\u201cHe was just a Trump guy,\u201d said Mr. Nelson, lamenting the state and country\u2019s drift toward what he called political \u201ctribalism.\u201dMore unique to Florida is the Republican Party\u2019s success at cutting deeply into the Democrats\u2019 share of the Latino vote.Hispanic voters in Florida are more ideologically diverse than elsewhere in the country, and Democrats have lagged behind Republicans in understanding the nuances of these voters. According to a postelection survey conducted by Mr. Scott\u2019s campaign, which courted the bloc relentlessly, he won 48 percent of the Latino vote.He and Mr. DeSantis both broadened the traditional Republican pitch to Cubans \u2014 that they represent the party of freedom \u2014 to woo more recent Central and South American immigrants who have also fled authoritarian regimes. And Mr. DeSantis used Mr. Gillum\u2019s support from Senator Bernie Sanders to label him a \u201csocialist,\u201d which has a more sinister connotation with these more recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s than with many Americans.Democrats have not won the governor\u2019s mansion since 1994. The only Democrat in statewide office is Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, whose election represented one of the few bright spots for Florida Democrats this year, in addition to a ballot measure restoring voting rights to ex-felons.Ms. Fried\u2019s success offered Democrats a few clues for how to win in the state: She ran on legalizing medical marijuana, gun control and addressing Florida\u2019s toxic algae. And Ms. Fried spent the last 24 hours of her race in a decidedly unusual region for a Democrat: Florida\u2019s deep-red Panhandle.\u201cThere are so many issues that transcend partisan politics, and too many times we all get into our pigeonholes of what we\u2019re supposed to say and what we can get behind,\u201d she said.Last month, the local party leaders hosted Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, during Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the year\u2019s biggest events. Over lunch at Joe\u2019s Stone Crab, Democrats made the case for bringing the party\u2019s 2020 convention to Miami, acknowledging they could use the boost, according to Dan Gelber, the current Miami Beach mayor.\u201cOur toast tends to fall butter side down,\u201d he said.Few Democrats know that better than the veteran Hispanic activists who gathered in Broward County a few days later to listen to Dr. Gamarra, a professor at Florida International University who studies public opinion among Latinos.\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing over and over and over again,\u201d said Maurice A. Ferr\u00e9, who served as Miami\u2019s first Hispanic mayor from 1973 to 1985. The Democratic Party, he said, \u201cfeels that they can turn the switch on just a couple of months before.\u2019\u2019Well, it never worked that way,\u201d he said, \u201cand it never will.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But surveillance capitalism is also many other things: \u201ca parasitic economic logic \u2026 a rogue mutation of capitalism \u2026 a new collective order based on total certainty\u201d and \u201can overthrow of the people\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d All this may sound a little heady, like perhaps an overseasoned stew of po-mo economic jargon, but Zuboff will have you asking for another helping long before the book\u2019s end.Under the regime of surveillance capitalism, it is not enough simply to gather information about what people do. Eventually, you have to influence behavior, beyond the simple suasion practiced by targeted ads. It\u2019s not about showing someone the right ad; you have to show it at the right place and time, with the language and imagery calibrated for precise effect. You have to lead people through the physical world, making them show up at the sponsored pop-up store or vote for the preferred candidate. Armed with a veritable real-time feed of a user\u2019s thoughts and feelings, companies are beginning to practice just this kind of coercion, which is why you might see makeup ads before a Friday evening out or why inducements from a personal injury lawyer might pop up on your phone as you sit in a hospital waiting room. When we want things \u2014 health information, travel schedules, a date \u2014 is also when we are most vulnerable, when intimate data yield themselves for corporate capture. \u201cThe result,\u201d as Zuboff notes, \u201cis a perverse amalgam of empowerment inextricably layered with diminishment.\u201d We seem ever more exposed to and dependent on surveillance capitalists, our benevolent info-lords, but their operations are defined by opacity, corporate secrecy and the scrim of technological authority.In the face of all this, Zuboff sees a disastrous overturning of the traditional capitalist order. We are being pushed \u201ctoward a society in which capitalism does not function as a means to inclusive economic or political institutions.\u201d With statements like these, Zuboff threatens to lose those readers who don\u2019t share her regard for a bygone halcyon era of industrial capitalism that produced what she calls \u201ctraditional reciprocities,\u201d defined by straightforward exchanges of money for goods and services, which in turn bound people together in ostensibly healthy social, economic and political arrangements. Zuboff\u2019s analysis would benefit from more emphasis on the role of deregulation, the declining power of organized labor and the gradual financialization of the economy. With its ability to create boutique investment products that are several degrees removed from any tangible asset, it\u2019s finance that seems like the most obvious ideological forebear of surveillance capitalism, which uses digitalization to render more of life as tradable commodities.We should, after all, avoid a belief in tidy solutions. Works of technology criticism are often expected to provide a few hundred pages of doomsaying before providing a concise final chapter in which the Gordian knot of our problems is neatly and improbably cut. \u201cThe Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\u201d with its near-700-page footprint, is thankfully not that kind of book. Light on prescriptivist notions, Zuboff does propose a \u201cright to sanctuary,\u201d based on universalist, if ever more threatened, humanitarian principles, like the right to asylum. But she\u2019s after something bigger, providing a scaffolding of critical thinking from which to examine the great crises of the digital age. Through her we learn that our friends to the north were indeed correct: Facebook is the problem (along with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, et al.).

{"Headline": "In Business and Governing, Trump Seeks Victory in Chaos", "Date": "2019-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisThree decades ago, Donald J. Trump waged a public battle with the talk show host Merv Griffin to take control of what would become Mr. Trump\u2019s third Atlantic City casino. Executives at Mr. Trump\u2019s company warned that the casino would siphon revenue from the others. Analysts predicted the associated debt would crush him.The naysayers would be proved right, but throughout the turmoil Mr. Trump fixated on just one outcome: declaring himself a winner and Mr. Griffin a loser.As president, Mr. Trump has displayed a similar fixation in his standoff with Congress over leveraging a government shutdown to gain funding for a wall on the Mexican border. As he did during decades in business, Mr. Trump has insulted adversaries, undermined his aides, repeatedly changed course, extolled his primacy as a negotiator and induced chaos.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d said Jack O\u2019Donnell, who ran a casino for Mr. Trump in the 1980s and wrote a book about it. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only people who have been around him through the years who realize that.\u201dMr. Trump briefly seemed to follow a more conventional approach for a president seeking consensus: encouraging his party leaders in Congress to negotiate a deal. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, shepherded a compromise in December that would have kept the government open and put off negotiations over a wall and other border security measures.Mr. Trump was expected to sign off on the deal, but then came the suggestion from conservative critics that he had caved in to Democrats \u2014 that he was a loser. It was a perception Mr. Trump could not bear, and he quickly reversed course.He also reverted to lifelong patterns in business. People who worked with him during those years say they see multiple parallels between Mr. Trump the businessman and Mr. Trump the steward of the country\u2019s longest government shutdown.His lack of public empathy for unpaid federal workers echoes his treatment of some construction workers, contractors and lawyers whom he refused to pay for their work on his real estate projects. The plight of the farmers and small-business owners wilting without the financial support pledged by his administration harks back to the multiple lenders and investors who financed Mr. Trump\u2019s business ventures only to come up shortchanged.\u201cI think he was always a terrible negotiator,\u201d said Tony Schwartz, co-author with Mr. Trump of \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201dThat book, published in 1987, was intended to be an autobiography of Mr. Trump, who was 41 at the time. Mr. Schwartz said that he created the idea of Mr. Trump as a great deal maker as a literary device to give the book a unifying theme. He said he came to regret the contribution as he watched Mr. Trump seize on the label to sell himself as something he was not \u2014 a solver of complicated problems.Rather, Mr. Schwartz said, Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cvirtue\u201d in negotiating was his relentlessness and lack of concern for anything but claiming victory.\u201cIf you don\u2019t care what the collateral damage you create is, then you have a potential advantage,\u201d he said. \u201cHe used a hammer, deceit, relentlessness and an absence of conscience as a formula for getting what he wanted.\u201dIn a brief telephone interview on Sunday, Mr. Trump was not specific in defending his tactics, but he described himself as successful in his chosen fields of real estate, entertainment and finally politics. \u201cI ran for office once and I won,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The president\u2019s supporters say he gets an unfair rap as a poor negotiator, saying that his style and unusual approach \u2014 and unwillingness to accept defeat even in the worst situations \u2014 have often had positive results. And in a Washington that doesn\u2019t like outsiders, he has clearly forced his adversaries out of their comfort zones.\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s success in business has translated into success as president,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said. \u201cHe\u2019s ignited a booming economy with rising wages and historically low unemployment, negotiated better trade deals, persuaded our allies to contribute their fair share to NATO, and secured the release of American hostages around the world.\u201dRepresentative Peter King, Republican of Long Island, said that even as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal popularity had taken a hit during the shutdown, public support for his stated ambition \u2014 the border wall \u2014 had grown.\u201cHaving the bad hand that he dealt himself at the beginning, I think he\u2019s making the best of it, better than anybody else could,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cOnly he would have the stamina, the determination to just keep going.\u201dOne example of that stamina \u2014 seen by others as evidence of unreliability \u2014 recounted in Mr. O\u2019Donnell\u2019s book, \u201cTrumped! The Inside Story of the Real Donald Trump \u2014 His Cunning Rise and Spectacular Fall,\u201d written with James Rutherford, involved the construction of an exclusive lounge at the top of a casino.Mr. Trump liked very high ceilings, according to the account. He screamed and cursed when he was told some ceilings had to be low to allow for pipes. He begrudgingly acquiesced. But he had forgotten by the time he next visited the construction site. He cursed again. Was reminded again. To the bewilderment of his executives, that cycle repeated itself several times.Finally, toward the end of construction, Mr. Trump reamed an executive with vulgarities, leapt up and punched a hole in one of the low ceilings. \u201cAfter that day,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell wrote, \u201cDonald never set foot inside it again if he could help it.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Trump has similarly laced into his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.Mr. Mulvaney pursued a rather standard tactic in ending the impasse over border security and a wall: He tried to find middle ground between the $1.3 billion to which Democrats had once agreed, and the president\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion. But upon learning of Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s efforts, Mr. Trump snarled in front of a crowded room that Mr. Mulvaney had messed \u201cit all up\u201d (using a vulgarity, according to two White House officials familiar with the remark.)During his years in business, Mr. Trump earned a reputation as someone whose word meant very little. When a commitment he made no longer made sense, he walked away, often blaming the other party with a fantastical line of reasoning.To win financing from Deutsche Bank to build a Trump Hotel in Chicago, for example, Mr. Trump personally guaranteed $40 million of the debt. When he could not make his payments during the 2008 financial crisis, Deutsche Bank executives were open to granting him more time to repay the loan, a person briefed on negotiations later recalled.But before a compromise could be reached, Mr. Trump flipped the script. He filed a lawsuit and argued that the bank had helped cause the worldwide financial meltdown that essentially rendered Mr. Trump unable to make his debt payments. At the time, Deutsche Bank called the lawsuit \u201cclassic Trump.\u201dThe bank eventually settled with Mr. Trump, saving him from having to pay the $40 million. Mr. Trump expressed his gratitude to the lawyer who fought on his behalf by not fully paying his bill. \u201cHe left me with some costs,\u201d said the lawyer, Steven Schlesinger.From the time he built his first Manhattan apartment building, Mr. Trump left a string of unpaid tabs for the people who worked for him.Mr. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that \u201cmaybe most\u201d federal workers going without pay are \u201cthe biggest fan\u201d of his use of the shutdown to fund a border wall. In ordering thousands back to work without pay, he has put the pain for the shutdown on them.Mr. Trump has also embraced his business practice of giving the most latitude and trust to family members, no matter their prior experience.He put his first wife, Ivana, a model, in charge of an Atlantic City casino and the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. He put his younger brother, Robert, who had some background in corporate finance, in senior positions at the casinos. Not long after three of his children graduated from college, he vested authority in them over golf courses, hotels and licensing deals.In the White House, Mr. Trump has increasingly leaned on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for guidance on dealing with Congress amid the current stalemate. Mr. Kushner, who like Mr. Trump is the son of a wealthy real estate developer, has not always impressed old hands on Capitol Hill.He began some early conversations by saying that Democrats would need to yield because his father-in-law would not budge, a statement that lawmakers found na\u00efve, according to Democrats familiar with the remarks.With Democrats now in charge of the House of Representatives, Mr. Trump also has a new set of adversaries, and other old habits from his years in business have re-emerged.Through his Twitter feed, he has verbally pummeled Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, and tried to drive a wedge between Mr. Schumer and his fellow Democrat, Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Barbara Res, who said she enjoyed much about working for Mr. Trump as a construction executive in the 1980s and 1990s, sees in Ms. Pelosi a new challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s lifelong tactics. One blind spot she observed was that Mr. Trump \u201cbelieves he\u2019s better than anyone who ever lived\u201d and saw even the most capable of women as easy to run over.\u201cBut there was never a woman with power that he ran up against, until Pelosi,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he doesn\u2019t know what to do with it. He\u2019s totally in a corner.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Trump described Ms. Res, Mr. O\u2019Donnell and Mr. Schwartz as disgruntled workers whom he had shunted aside, who had experience with him for relatively brief periods and who were simply using his name for attention.During his years in business, Mr. Trump rarely displayed an interest in details or expert opinions that might have informed whether his plans would actually work. That pattern has also emerged in the shutdown dispute.Thirty years ago, his claimed defeat of Mr. Griffin turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory.Within months of completing construction on his third casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, he could not pay interest to the bondholders who had financed the project. Having overpaid and overleveraged himself on other deals, banks forced him to turnover or sell almost everything.In describing the border wall, Mr. Trump has expressed unending confidence in its efficacy. Others, including Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose Texas district includes part of the border with Mexico, have described it as a tall speed bump, nearly useless without technology to spot illegal crossings immediately and dispatch border agents to quickly respond.Mr. O\u2019Donnell, the casino manager, said long-term consequences never concerned Mr. Trump. He was always willing to pay too much in order to get a deal signed so he could declare victory, he said.\u201cHe just wants to get the deal,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell said.Ben Protess and Steve Eder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Vasisht is director of financial regulation at the Volcker Alliance.The momentum behind the American economy is strong. In 2018, unemployment hit its lowest rate in 49 years, 3.7 percent. Real wages were (finally) increasing and inflation remained muted. In 2019, growth is projected to slow but still remain above 2 percent.On this front, it is far from certain that banks and their regulators are prepared.Cracks are already forming. In December, borrowing in the high-yield bond market came to a standstill. Deals in the leveraged loan market are also delayed from a lack of interest from mutual funds and collateralized loan obligation managers, the largest buyers of leveraged loans. These events signal trouble ahead for highly indebted companies seeking more financing.In a crisis, these exposures could serve as a channel for contagion in a highly interconnected financial system dominated by large banks.Yet bank stress tests don\u2019t adequately capture this dynamic. Stress tests don\u2019t consider how a firm\u2019s response to a shock can reverberate. They also understate the effect of financial-sector distress on the economy. This helps explain why the tests have allowed bank capital to decline slightly despite elevated asset prices and increasingly stringent scenarios.So far, regulators appear to be doing exactly that \u2014 or worse.To prevent a repeat of 2008, regulators must look beyond the concerns of bank lobbyists. Instead of cutting capital to increase shareholder returns or making it easier to bail out giant financial institutions the next time around, regulators must address threats to the economy. This means requiring thicker capital cushions for the big banks and tighter leveraged loan underwriting standards. These steps would help secure a safer financial system and possibly avoid another crisis.Sheila C.

At stake are a trophy townhouse, works by Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons, and the inner workings of one of the world\u2019s most influential art dealer families. Supported byMs. Mugrabi said she retired around 11:30 p.m. that Friday, after a long night of $800 bottles of wine served by the family\u2019s staff. When she woke around 6 a.m. and came downstairs, she said she found her husband lying on top of an attractive brunette in the television room, beneath a painting from Richard Prince\u2019s \u201cAfter Dark\u201d series.They were asleep and nude, using a towel as a blanket. Discarded clothes by the pool suggested they had been skinny-dipping. \u201cShe was naked on my couch with a towel on top of her, and he was sitting on the floor with his head lying on her breasts,\u201d Ms. Mugrabi said.\u201cUpset and mortified,\u201d she said she left the room quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a scene.\u201d But when the woman was still staying at the house four days later, Ms. Mugrabi confronted her.In a conversation that was surreptitiously recorded by the nanny, the guest blamed her behavior on taking psychedelic mushrooms and ketamine that night, a revelation that did not exactly have the effect of marriage counseling.\u201cYou were naked on my couch,\u201d Ms. Mugrabi said. \u201cHow is that appropriate?\u201dWithin two weeks, the incident had metastasized into one of the most salacious New York society divorces in recent memory.But more than a tabloid story, the divorce also threatens to expose the private dealings of one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the art world. Mr. Mugrabi, 47, is the scion of a powerful art-dealing family that is reportedly worth $5 billion and owns some 1,000 works by Warhol, making it the world\u2019s largest private holding.And now Ms. Mugrabi, 39, who has two children, 9 and 11, with her estranged husband, wants her share. There is no prenuptial agreement.But before she can ask for a number in the divorce settlement, her lawyers say they need to evaluate her husband\u2019s net worth, which involves exposing the Mugrabi family\u2019s sophisticated structure of asset ownership by offshore corporations. Such revelations would offer a rare window into how art-world titans like the Mugrabis shield their finances from public scrutiny.\u201cWe were a team,\u201d Ms. Mugrabi said of her marriage. \u201cWe were partners at home and in business, with kids, everything. So whatever is the right thing, if that\u2019s a little amount or a big amount, that\u2019s what I want.\u201dFive months after that fateful morning in the Hamptons, Ms. Mugrabi came to lunch at the Mark Hotel on the Upper East Side, dressed like a sliver of night sky.And looking good isn\u2019t cheap, either. \u201cI spend more than six figures a year on fashion,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever designer I\u2019m into at the moment, I would say I\u2019m one of their larger customers.\u201d Current favorites include Dior, Tom Ford, the Row and Saint Laurent.She became accustomed to luxury at an early age, having grown up the daughter of a prosperous plastic surgeon named Charles Scher. \u201cWe grew up very wealthy,\u201d said Ms. Mugrabi, noting that they lived \u201cbetween\u201d Oakhurst, N.J., and Palm Beach, Fla. Ms. Mugrabi described her courtship as a relatively modest period, when her future husband lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Trump Tower. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the type of man that wanted to spoil me until after we got married,\u201d she said.In her telling, Mr. Mugrabi casually proposed to her at the apartment in 2004, after his mother was nudging him on the phone about wanting to throw an engagement party. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a ring, but I said, \u2018You don\u2019t need a ring to propose,\u2019\u201d Ms. Mugrabi said. So he popped the question (she said yes) and called his mother right back. \u201cHis mother said, \u2018I\u2019m throwing you a party tomorrow.\u2019\u201dThe five-carat diamond ring would come later.\u201cIt was way over even what I wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew about 30 people at my wedding. It had about 500 or 600.\u201dThe newly wed Ms. Mugrabi quickly learned her role in the family empire.\u201cI just copied his mother, and she told me what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you just do the home part with the entertaining. The way we run our business is mostly through the home, because we don\u2019t have a gallery.\u2019\u201dFor more than a decade, the couple enjoyed the perks of a billionaire lifestyle.\u201cEvery summer we went to Sardinia, to Italy, to Portofino,\u201d Ms. Mugrabi said. \u201cWe went on lots of different yachts. Aspen. Miami. We went to St. Barts three times minimum, a year.\u201dThe couple sometimes flew commercial, other times on her father-in-law\u2019s private jet, a Gulfstream V acquired from the casino magnate Steve Wynn. On the global art-fair circuit \u2014 a blur of FIACs, Friezes and Art Basels \u2014 they favored suites at Claridges in London and the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e in Paris.Ms. Mugrabi recalled one gathering at the Venice Biennale, early in the relationship.Mr. Mugrabi and his lawyers declined several requests for an interview for this article, but the unfolding divorce opens a window into an elite tier of the art market, where multi-million-dollar transactions are done not out of blue-chip galleries or art fairs, but at extravagant dinner parties and stately country houses.Clients include billionaire industrialists and members of Middle Eastern royal families, who prefer to keep details of their acquisitions private.\u201cThe Mugrabis are important to the upper register of the market, and the auction houses,\u201d said Linda Yablonsky, an art reviewer and writer. \u201cThey have these high-flying private clients, but most of it takes place behind closed doors. This corner of the art market is the most opaque thing in the world.\u201dHis first purchase was a Renoir landscape, bought in 1982 for $121,000 on the advice of Jeffrey Deitch, who was then an art consultant for Citibank, before becoming an influential contemporary art dealer.Until now, the machinery behind those dealings has been largely kept out of view. But if Ms. Mugrabi\u2019s divorce lawyers have their way, it will soon be exposed in court.For much of their 13-year marriage, Ms. Mugrabi said, they were \u201cthe perfect couple\u201d and enjoyed their prestige on the social circuit.The couple also had been meticulously renovating the East 82nd Street townhouse they lived in, pouring millions to turn the seven-story home into a private museum to display the Mugrabi collection.Ms. Mugrabi said she began suspecting there might be another woman last summer, when her husband was unreachable for several days in June while she shuttled between vacations in Sardinia and London. \u201cHe definitely was not acting like a married man,\u201d she said.Events came to a head at the fateful dinner party, held at the Mugrabis\u2019 7,000-square-foot mansion, nestled in the woods between Sag Harbor and Water Mill.After the skinny-dipping incident, Ms. Mugrabi said, she offered to walk away from her husband in exchange for $10 million. \u201cBut that was a one-week offer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t forever.\u201dLater that week, when Ms. Mugrabi left the Hamptons house to consult a divorce lawyer, she said that moving trucks arranged by her husband arrived to remove the most valuable art.\u201cHe took a bunch of Basquiats, he took multiple Warhols, he took about a dozen KAWS paintings out of the house. Two huge George Condos,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say he took at least $200 million in art.\u201dMs. Mugrabi believes that her husband was trying to hide the assets from a potentially expensive divorce. Needing money to finance a legal battle, she looked no further than the diamond on her finger.\u201cThe same thing that got me into this marriage is going to get me out,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I sold my ring\u201d \u2014 for $100,000, she said \u2014 \u201cand retained a divorce lawyer.\u201dOn a drizzly afternoon in November, David and Libbie Mugrabi, each with a platoon of lawyers, faced off inside the New York City Civil Court building in Lower Manhattan.Mr. Mugrabi replied: \u201cI was just admiring your tie.\u201dThe hearing was intended to determine how much money Mr. Mugrabi must give his wife each month as the divorce progresses.Mr. McDonough emphasized the Mugrabi family\u2019s wealth, calling them \u201cthe 1 percent of the 1 percent\u201d and saying that Mr. Mugrabi\u2019s \u201cafter-tax cash flow\u201d was $5 million a year. Another $10 million, he said, was deposited each month into a corporate bank account under Mr. Mugrabi\u2019s control.In response, Mr. Mugrabi\u2019s lawyer Lois Liberman burst out laughing. She countered that his income was only $150,000 a month, after paying $200,000 a month in spousal and child support.\u201cOne of the major issues of why the marriage disintegrated was Mrs. Mugrabi\u2019s profligate spending,\u201d Ms. Liberman said, adding that Ms. Mugrabi would drop \u201c$10,000 in the blink of an eye\u201d on daily trips to Valentino, Chanel and other boutiques.\u201cNobody can talk about this woman starving,\u201d Ms. Liberman added.And while Ms. Mugrabi does not likely have a right to the wealth Mr. Mugrabi brought into the relationship, she could have a significant claim on the family\u2019s art business, and potentially the art. \u201cThe goal here is to prove the extent of Ms. Mugrabi\u2019s contributions to the couple\u2019s business and how the money is held,\u201d Mr. Jewell said. \u201cIf you can prove the money exists, then there is a claim. Then the question becomes: Where\u2019s the money?\u201dThe afternoon session would prove equally fruitless, and Ms. Mugrabi expects the case could take up to four years. She seemed resigned to a long fight. \u201cI feel great every time I\u2019m in court,\u201d she said recently. \u201cI love court.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A California Dream for Paid Leave Has an Old Problem: How to Pay for It", "Date": "2019-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNewsom, the incoming governor, is expected to propose the longest state parental leave in the nation: six months. The United States has long been the only industrialized country not to offer paid leave to new parents. Instead of waiting for the federal government, the incoming governor of California intends to change that in a significant way for families in his state. He is expected to introduce a proposal to give families six months of paid leave after the birth of a child.What\u2019s unclear is how California would pay for it. \u201cMy career never recovered and never will,\u201d said Charlotte Brock, 39, a mother in Vienna, Va. When she had her first child eight years ago, she quit her job as a think tank analyst and moved in with her parents because she had no paid leave. Now an analyst at NASA, she is expecting twins, and has pieced together sick leave followed by part-time work. Her husband doesn\u2019t get paid parental leave either. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the recovery for women, even physically, is a lot longer than what\u2019s advertised in our culture,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just in terms of the experience of bonding, the closeness, and breast-feeding is so much easier if you can do it without having to pump.\u201d \u201cBecause we refuse to acknowledge that people have families and care issues, we\u2019re falling behind our economic competitors,\u201d said Heather Boushey, the executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who advised Hillary Clinton on economic issues during her 2016 presidential campaign. But the governor will face questions about whether it would require a tax increase; how the program could stay solvent if there were a recession; and how businesses would cope with employees\u2019 long absences. California\u2019s existing paid leave program is financed by a 1 percent payroll tax. Increasing that tax would require the approval of two-thirds of the Legislature, not assured despite Democratic control. California\u2019s leave program is paid for entirely by employees\u2019 payroll taxes, in a fund that is part of the state\u2019s temporary disability insurance program. New parents receive a percentage of their earnings, up to $1,216 a week. The new plan would allow new parents to divide six months of paid leave as they see fit, or to give it to other family members caring for the baby. Reaching six months of leave could take several years, said the Newsom adviser. First, the administration plans to extend leaves by an unspecified shorter period. It would free up money to do so with a policy change: The trust fund that administers paid leave would be required to hold three months of reserve funds instead of six. Then the administration would start a task force to address questions like how to reach six months of leave, including the biggest issue of all: how to pay for it.

{"Headline": "What Made the TV Show \u2018You\u2019 a Hit?

Even Mr. Berlanti, one of the most successful and prolific producers in television thanks to shows like \u201cRiverdale,\u201d \u201cArrow\u201d and \u201cBlindspot,\u201d conceded in an interview that \u201cbarely anybody watched\u201d it.He made repeated calls to Lifetime executives, asking for patience and making his case for a second season. It wasn\u2019t enough. In early December, Lifetime announced it was finished with \u201cYou.\u201dWhat changed? It began streaming on Netflix.Mr. Berlanti heard from family and friends about how much they were enjoying his new show, ignoring the fact that it had debuted months earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s very often in direct proportion to how young they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe younger they are, the more they discuss the show as though it had never existed before Dec. 26.\u201dLast week, Netflix declared \u201cYou\u201d had drawn the sort of audience to make it a \u201chuge hit.\u201d The streaming service said that \u201cYou\u201d was on track to be watched by 40 million households within its first four weeks on the service.The Netflix viewership disclosure \u2014 one of the few times the service has made those numbers public, seven years after it began airing original series \u2014 set off something of an earthquake in the industry.Could the numbers be believed? Could it be possible that a show that premiered on cable television may as well not have existed until Netflix \u2014 which now has 139 million paying subscribers, including 58.5 million in the United States \u2014 came around to stream it? Netflix is already a television network and a movie studio. Was it one step closer to effectively becoming television itself?And it should be noted that Lifetime is not exactly a ratings wasteland. Its documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly\u201d has been one of the year\u2019s early hits.For the time being, Mr. Berlanti is a believer.\u201cIt went from being one of the least-watched shows I\u2019ve ever worked on and been most proud of \u2014 and I\u2019m choosing to take Netflix at their word on this \u2014 to being the most-watched show I\u2019ve ever worked on in 20-something years of being in the business,\u201d he said.Oh, and Netflix is also making a second season of \u201cYou.\u201d Filming begins next month.Throughout the weekend, rival television executives groused privately that the viewership number Netflix released was virtually meaningless. Netflix explained that each of those 40 million viewers had watched at least 70 percent of one episode. (\u201cYou\u201d has 10 episodes in its first season.)How that 40 million would translate into a traditional viewership figure is unknown. An average of 12.7 million people have watched this season of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d on CBS, but a significantly higher number of people have sampled at least one episode. Few in the television industry would put much stock in such a figure.When reached for comment, Lifetime referred to an earlier statement it released when it cut ties with \u201cYou,\u201d saying, \u201cWe wish the cast and crew the best as the series continues on at Netflix.\u201dMr. Berlanti began developing \u201cYou\u201d almost four years ago with the producer Sera Gamble. Showtime originally planned to make the series, which is based on a novel by Caroline Kepnes, before passing on it. It then went to Lifetime, which over the summer committed to making a second season.What it could not find was an audience on cable. On the days it aired, it had trouble gaining bigger ratings than the 7 a.m. edition of \u201cSportsCenter.\u201dLuckily for Mr. Berlanti, \u201cYou\u201d had a well-financed supporter.Ms. Bajaria was enthusiastic about \u201cYou\u201d from the moment she read the script.\u201cWe really felt this hit a sweet spot for our audience, and we felt that our members would love the show,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping it would be big.\u201dMs. Bajaria\u2019s confidence in the show was well rewarded. She pored over the viewership numbers between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Day and saw Netflix had a hit on its hands immediately after it began streaming.\u201cIt\u2019s actually done well in every region, and that doesn\u2019t always happen,\u201d Ms. Bajaria said, saying she was particularly pleased with its performance in Latin America, France and the Philippines.For Mr. Berlanti, the sudden success of \u201cYou,\u201d after months of despair, was reassuring.\u201cI\u2019ve never had an experience that has been this delayed in television before,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that it was rewarded by people actually watching made us feel we\u2019re not crazy. We actually did make something that was really enjoyable and fun and a real ride for the audience.\u201dMr. Berlanti, beginning to laugh, then compared the series to the obsessive lovelorn character at the heart of \u201cYou.\u201d\u201cIf Joe is a man who is simply just searching for love, well, then, our show finally found the right partner,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Giuliani Says His Moscow Trump Tower Comments Were \u2018Hypothetical\u2019", "Date": "2019-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s personal lawyer on Monday walked back the timeline he had offered a day earlier on when negotiations ended with Russian officials about a proposed Trump Tower project in Moscow, calling his comments \u201chypothetical\u201d and not intended to convey facts.The latest statement from the lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, was described as a clarification of remarks he made to The New York Times in an interview on Sunday, as well as other remarks he made in interviews on Sunday television news shows.Mr. Giuliani originally quoted Mr. Trump as telling him the negotiations over a Moscow skyscraper continued through \u201cthe day I won.\u201d He also said that the president recalled \u201cfleeting conversations\u201d about the deal after the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent to pursue it.The confusion centers on how long Mr. Trump may have known of \u2014 or was apprised of \u2014 discussions about the Moscow tower proposal, which were led by his former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen.The timeline of negotiations for the skyscraper is important because it shows that Mr. Trump\u2019s company was involved in talks with an American adversary for a business deal through the general election, as he was demanding that President Barack Obama lift sanctions against Russia and urging its government to reveal emails from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.Even before the uproar over his comments, Mr. Giuliani told The Times that there were no call logs or annotations about conversations on the Moscow project that would provide accurate dates, and he described the president\u2019s legal team as at Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cmercy.\u201d As a result, he said, there could have been discussions to emerge later that Mr. Trump did not immediately recall.On Sunday, Mr. Giuliani told The Times that Mr. Trump had said the discussions around the proposed tower were \u201cgoing on from the day I announced to the day I won.\u201d In television interviews the same day, he said that discussions about the tower might have continued up until November 2016 \u2014 the month Mr. Trump was elected president.But on Monday, Mr. Giuliani, in a widely issued statement, said that he was making hypothetical remarks.\u201cMy recent statements about discussions during the 2016 campaign between Michael Cohen and then-candidate Donald Trump about a potential Trump Moscow \u2018project\u2019 were hypothetical and not based on conversations I had with the president,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said.\u201cMy comments did not represent the actual timing or circumstances of any such discussions,\u201d he added. \u201cThe point is that the proposal was in the earliest stage and did not advance beyond a free nonbinding letter of intent.\u201dMr. Cohen pleaded guilty late last year to lying to Congress about the duration of the Moscow proposal; he had indicated initially that it stopped in January 2016.It was not the first time Mr. Giuliani has reversed himself in his comments about issues related to the investigation of Russian election interference that is being led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cThere was no collusion by President Trump in any way, shape or form,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said in a statement on Thursday, reiterating the president\u2019s longstanding defense against accusations that his campaign secretly coordinated with Moscow to help swing the election. \u201cLikewise, I have no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign.\u201dHe added, referring to discredited conspiracy theories that the president and his allies have long cited, \u201cThe only knowledge I have in this regard is the collusion of the Clinton campaign with Russia, which has so far been ignored.\u201dA day earlier, Mr. Giuliani stopped short of defending Trump campaign aides, drawing speculation that he might have inside knowledge of possible coordination with Russia.\u201cI never said there was no collusion between the campaign or between people in the campaign,\u201d he told CNN. He added: \u201cI said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you could commit here, conspired with the Russians to hack\u201d the Democratic National Committee.When Mr. Giuliani was hired last April as the public face of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, it was part of a strategy to be more aggressive in fighting back against Mr. Mueller. Some of the president\u2019s closest allies believe that Mr. Giuliani was effective in helping change public opinion about the special counsel investigation \u2014 at least to some extent.Several people close to Mr. Trump have grown exasperated with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s public appearances. They also expressed concern that he is increasing prosecutors\u2019 anger with the president and potentially creating a misimpression about the Trump Tower project in Moscow.The special counsel\u2019s office made the rare move of issuing a public statement about the article after it was published, calling it \u201cinaccurate.\u201dA person familiar with the discussions said that Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sent a letter to the special counsel earlier in the day on Friday asking for a clarification. By then, several Democrats had discussed the prospect of moving ahead with impeachment proceedings if the article was true, creating a heightened degree of pressure on Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.Democrats in Congress are preparing for the possibility of an impeachment case against Mr. Trump once Mr. Mueller completes his work. In the meantime, Mr. Cohen is scheduled to testify before Congress in an open hearing on Feb. 7.Since that date was announced, Mr. Trump has repeatedly urged prosecutors and the media to investigate Mr. Cohen\u2019s family. Lanny Davis, a spokesman for Mr. Cohen, has said his client fears for his safety and the safety of his family amid those threats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Malaysia Blames Goldman Sachs for Stolen Billions", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is an argument that the government of Malaysia, where the fraud was carried out, is not buying.\u201cWe have suffered extremely large losses, and you were the financial adviser,\u201d said Lim Guan Eng, the finance minister of Malaysia, referring to Goldman Sachs.\u201cNow how do you account for that? And don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know where the money went,\u201d Mr. Lim said in an interview in Hong Kong on Monday. \u201cGoldman Sachs needs to come to terms with the facts.\u201dMalaysia is gearing up for a fight with an institution that was once synonymous with power and influence around the world. The government is seeking $7.5 billion in compensation from Goldman Sachs, adding to a mounting pile of penalties against the bank and deepening one of the most serious crises in its 149-year history.The crisis is expected to be the main focus for David M. Solomon, Goldman Sachs\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, when he announces the bank\u2019s fourth-quarter results this week.Goldman has found itself entangled in civil and criminal investigations around the world related to the work it did in helping 1Malaysia Development Berhad \u2014 or 1MDB, which United States prosecutors have alleged was a slush fund for the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and other officials. New York regulators have issued subpoenas to some Goldman bankers, the bank has held talks with prosecutors about possible fines, and most recently, its lawyers in Malaysia reached out to the country\u2019s attorney general.Goldman Sachs has denied the charges and said that \u201ccertain members of the former Malaysian government and 1MDB lied to Goldman Sachs.\u201d It has said it would \u201cvigorously contest\u201d the charges.\u201cUnder the Malaysian legal process, the firm was not afforded an opportunity to be heard prior to the filing of these charges against certain Goldman Sachs entities, which we intend to vigorously contest,\u201d the bank said in an emailed statement.Goldman has since said its dealings with 1MDB could still result in \u201csignificant fines, penalties and other sanctions.\u201dAt the heart of the scandal is the 1MDB fund, which Mr. Najib created in the name of raising money for development projects to benefit Malaysians. Instead, prosecutors have alleged, billions of dollars were siphoned off into the personal accounts of Mr. Najib, other officials and a flamboyant Malaysian financier known as Jho Low.Under Mr. Mahathir, the new government is trying to recover some of the billions that disappeared and subsequently burned a big hole in the government\u2019s finances.\u201cYou look at the agony that Malaysia had to endure \u2014 not just in terms of the figures but the trauma,\u201d Mr. Lim said. \u201cYou must have a heart. Sometimes you ask, does Goldman have a heart?\u201dHe also said Malaysia would be ready to walk away from an ambitious railway project that started under Mr. Najib and was promoted as a showcase deal in China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The initiative, an enormous infrastructure plan financed by China, includes countries across Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Mr. Lim said, adding that a decision would be made in the coming weeks.Last summer, citing the high costs of the deal, Malaysia halted a contract for the China Communications Construction Company to build an East Coast Rail Link, a rail line linking vast swaths of the country.Representatives from the Chinese side have been negotiating with Malaysian counterparts to revive the deal. Under the current terms, officials in Kuala Lumpur estimate that Malaysia would be making annual interest payments of 2 billion ringgit, roughly $488 million, a person with direct knowledge of the government\u2019s estimates said. The rail, once built, is also expected to lose about $122 million a year, that person said.Chinese officials also offered to get the United States and other countries to drop their early investigations into 1MDB in exchange, The Journal reported, citing documents and the minutes of meetings between Chinese and Malaysian officials.The China Communications Construction Company did not respond to an emailed request for comment.Mr. Lim said the Malaysian government was looking into the allegations.\u201cFor us to be able to initiate any investigation, we need the documents,\u201d he said, adding that the government had sought documents from The Journal.The revelations could add to tensions among Malaysia, the United States and China at a time when Malaysia is hoping to raise money through the bond market and strike new deals. The United States has grown increasingly skeptical of China\u2019s One Belt One Road campaign, which it sees as a campaign for political influence overseas.Mr. Lim sought to play down rising tensions.\u201cYou have to look past these instances,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like Goldman Sachs is an outlier and doesn\u2019t reflect the entire financial industry in the United States, it is similar for this case vis a vis China.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With Rift Valley fever, we\u2019re trying to get ahead of the curve.\u201dRift Valley fever primarily occurs in livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, where outbreaks cause 90 to 100 percent of pregnant cows in a herd to miscarry or deliver stillborn calves, often a significant economic loss.But hundreds of cases also occur in humans each year, causing flulike symptoms and severe liver problems. The outbreaks have moved beyond Africa: In late 2000, an outbreak in Saudi Arabia infected more than 100,000 people and led to at least 700 deaths, according to Dr. Hartman. The mosquito that carries the disease is also found in Europe and the Americas.\u201cClimate change can alter how emerging infectious diseases will spread,\u201d Dr. Hartman said. \u201cAs mosquito populations move and change, we have a potential for this to spread far beyond its normal boundaries.\u201d There are no vaccines or treatments for Rift Valley fever. The World Health Organization has called the disease a potential public health emergency.Two cases of infected fetuses have been documented. One infant was born with an enlarged liver and spleen, among other symptoms; the other died within a week. Because the disease can be asymptomatic in pregnant women, many more cases of abnormalities and stillbirths may have been misidentified.Among rats used in the study, 65 percent of the pups born to infected mothers died, compared to 25 percent of pups born from uninfected controls. Each infected mother lost at least one pup, and all of the infected mothers\u2019 offspring contracted the virus.Pregnant rats were also more susceptible to death from Rift Valley fever than nonpregnant rats.Testing on human placental tissue revealed that, unlike the Zika virus, Rift Valley fever virus has a unique ability to infect a specialized layer of cells that supports the region of the placenta where nutrients flow in. Zika must take the \u201cside roads\u201d into the placenta to infect a fetus, while the Rift Valley fever virus can take the \u201cexpressway,\u201d Dr. Hartman said.\u201cThe fetus is protected from hundreds of thousands of dangers that could affect it,\u201d she added. \u201cOnly a few microbes can get past, and this is one of them.\u201d Last week, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations launched a call for proposals to develop human vaccines against Rift Valley fever. About $48 million will finance up to eight projects on Rift Valley fever and Chikungunya viruses, according to an announcement.\u201cWe need more research into the epidemiology \u2014 how it causes disease, and how to prevent it,\u201d Dr. McMillen said. \u201cThis could spread beyond where it is found in the Middle East, so awareness is sorely needed.\u201dFollow Emily Baumgaertner on Twitter: @Emily_BaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Tuition, but You Pay a Percentage of Your Income (if You Find a Job) ", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookIncome Sharing Agreements are gaining the attention of higher education and Wall Street. One early success story is getting a boost from venture capital.What if there were a way to eliminate student debt? No, really. Now, Silicon Valley is backing a novel idea that proposes to rewrite the economics of getting an education.The concept is deceptively simple: Instead of charging students tuition \u2014 which often requires them to take out thousands of dollars in loans \u2014 students go to school for free and are required to pay back a percentage of their income after graduation, but only if they get a job with a good salary.On Tuesday, Lambda will receive $30 million in funding led by one of Peter Thiel\u2019s disciples, Geoff Lewis, the founder of Bedrock, along with additional funds from Google Ventures; GGV Capital; Vy Capital; Y Combinator; and the actor-investor Ashton Kutcher, among others. The new funding round values the school at $150 million.The investments will be used to turn Lambda, which has focused on subjects like coding and data science, into a multidisciplinary school offering half-year programs in professions where there is significant hiring demand, like nursing and cybersecurity. It\u2019s an expansion that could be a precursor to Lambda becoming a full-scale university. Lambda is being closely watched by educators, the student debt complex and even Wall Street. Purdue University has developed a version of an Income Share Agreement. And Tony James, executive vice chairman of Blackstone Group, has started the Education Finance Institute and hired James Runcie, former chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid, to help universities and education systems develop I.S.A. programs.At Lambda, students pay nothing upfront. But they are required to pay 17 percent of their salary to Lambda for two years if they get a job that pays more than $50,000. (Lambda says 83 percent of its students get a job with a median salary of $70,000 within six months of graduating.) If they don\u2019t get a job, or their salary is lower, they pay nothing. Payments are capped at $30,000, so a highly paid student isn\u2019t penalized for success, and if a student loses a job, the payments pause.\u201cThere are no schools that are incentivized to make their students successful anywhere,\u201d said Austen Allred, co-founder and chief executive of Lambda. \u201cThe schools get paid up front, they get paid in cash, whether that\u2019s by the government or whether that\u2019s by an individual doesn\u2019t really matter. At the end of the day, the schools get paid no matter what. \u201cI think in order to create better outcomes the school has to take the hit,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we\u2019re built to do right now is close employment gaps,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you have a field where there is a shortage of employees the obvious place for us to start is by building programs to fill those holes.\u201d Whether this model can \u2014 or should \u2014 be applied to the larger education system remains an open question. It clearly improves the financial incentives for the school and the student. But, if expanded more widely, it could press programs to ignore a traditional liberal arts education, where the earning power is reduced. If a student dreamed of a major in Russian literature, she may struggle to find a school that sees a knowledge of Tolstoy to be particularly marketable.\u201cIs it a bad thing to say that schools are going to be for people who are motivated to succeed in said school?\u201d Mr. Allred asked. \u201cI look at some of the predatory, for-profit educations that just don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a win for anybody, including the students. I think schools should be actively trying to determine who will be successful and that\u2019s part of your job. Harvard does that, right?\u201dCritics of such programs have argued they are a form of indentured servitude. The percentage of income that Lambda takes \u2014 17 percent \u2014 is high, and has even been described as predatory. And Purdue\u2019s program is even more aggressive: It is a loan-like arrangement that could charge high-earning students 250 percent of the cost of their education. But those concerns seem less worrying: Student loan borrowers can already pay enormous amounts of interest, and Lambda\u2019s two years of payments could be far more palatable than the decade or more of monthly bills that are already the norm for most college graduates, who can\u2019t escape them even by filing for bankruptcy.\u201cDepending on how it\u2019s structured I think you could come up with something that\u2019s scalable across four-year universities and schools across the country,\u201d said Mr. Runcie, who was hired to help schools put I.S.A. programs in place.There almost certainly will be obstacles, even with big-money investors capable of providing the kind of cash that makes them easier to surmount. Such programs would have to guard against leaving deserving students behind, and might not work at all outside the high-earning fields of technology and business. But in sticking to the Silicon Valley ethos of breaking the status quo, Lambda may have found a radically new approach to funding education, one that could really work for students, not just for schools and bill collectors. Education Inc. should be taking notes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hospitals Must Now Post Prices. But It May Take a Brain Surgeon to Decipher Them.", "Date": "2019-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vanderbilt University Medical Center, responding to a new Trump administration order to begin posting all hospital prices, listed a charge of $42,569 for a cardiology procedure described as \u201cHC PTC CLOS PAT DUCT ART.\u201dBaptist Health in Miami helpfully told consumers that an \u201cEmbolza Protect 5.5\u201d would cost them $9,818 while a \u201cVisceral selective angio rad\u201d runs a mere $5,538.On Jan. 1, hospitals began complying with a Trump administration order to post list prices for all their services, theoretically offering consumers transparency and choice and forcing health care providers into price competition.It\u2019s turning into a fiasco.\u201cThis policy is a tiny step forward, but falls far short of what\u2019s needed,\u201d said Jeanne Pinder, the founder and chief executive of Clear Health Costs, a consumer health research organization. \u201cThe posted prices are fanciful, inflated, difficult to decode and inconsistent, so it\u2019s hard to see how an average person would find them useful.\u201dThe data, posted online in spreadsheets for thousands of procedures, is incomprehensible and unusable by patients \u2014 a hodgepodge of numbers and technical medical terms, displayed in formats that vary from hospital to hospital. It is nearly impossible for consumers to compare prices for the same service at different hospitals because no two hospitals seem to describe services in the same way. Nor can consumers divine how much they will have to pay out of pocket.\u201cTo 99 percent of the consuming public, these data will be of limited utility \u2014 meaningless,\u201d said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association.The list price for a hospital service is like the sticker price for a car. But as it is playing out, it is as if the car dealers were disclosing the price for each auto part, without revealing the charge for the vehicle as a whole.The result has baffled consumers.\u201cThis is gibberish, totally meaningless, a foreign language to me,\u201d said Sara Stovall, 41, of Charlottesville, Va., after looking at price lists for hospitals in her area.She reviewed the price lists for Sentara Martha Jefferson Hospital and for University Hospital, each of which has more than 16,000 items.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how I would go about making this useful,\u201d Ms. Stovall said on Sunday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know how to find my procedure. I wouldn\u2019t know what services might be rolled up with my procedure. And I would not know the price to me after health insurance.\u201dBy most accounts, the Trump administration is pursuing a worthy goal, but the execution of its plans leaves much to be desired.After the administration proposed the price-disclosure requirement in April 2018, many hospitals warned of the shortcomings that are now evident.But federal health officials, accustomed to debating issues inside the Washington policy bubble, have still been surprised at the reaction around the country as consumers and local news media try to decipher the data. The administration says it is open to suggestions for 2020 and beyond.The price-disclosure requirement, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, grows out of one sentence in the Affordable Care Act, which says, \u201cEach hospital operating within the United States shall for each year establish (and update) and make public (in accordance with guidelines developed by the secretary) a list of the hospital\u2019s standard charges for items and services provided by the hospital.\u201dThe idea languished for eight years. Under prior guidance from the government, hospitals could meet their obligations by providing charges to patients on request. But the Trump administration wanted to go further.\u201cWe\u2019ve updated our guidelines to specifically require hospitals to post price information on the internet in a machine-readable format,\u201d Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said last week. \u201cThis is a historic change from what\u2019s been required in the past.\u201d\u201cThis is about empowering patients,\u201d Ms. Verma said.It has not worked out that way, at least so far. Martin Gaynor, a professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, described list prices as \u201csomewhat fictitious.\u201d\u201cIf this is an initial step leading to real transparency with actionable, usable information, that would be fantastic,\u201d Mr. Gaynor said.But in its current form, he added, the price information is \u201cnot very useful and could even be misleading\u201d because a hospital with high list prices could be the cheaper alternative for some consumers, depending on their insurance.\u201cFor patients to know up front how much their care will cost, that\u2019s incredibly valuable,\u201d said Brenda L. Reetz, the chief executive of Greene County General Hospital in rural southwest Indiana. \u201cWe\u2019ve posted our prices, as required. But I really don\u2019t think the information is what the consumer is actually wanting to see.\u201dSpending on hospital care last year totaled $1.1 trillion, or nearly one-third of all health spending, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. So even small improvements in the market could yield big savings.The Trump administration adopted the new requirement as part of its agenda to promote \u201ctransparency\u201d in health care, in the belief that health markets would work better if consumers had more information. In another example, federal officials want to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of prescription drugs in television advertisements.\u201cProviders and insurers have to become more transparent about their pricing,\u201d Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said last year. \u201cThere is no more powerful force than an informed consumer.\u201dThe Trump administration told hospitals that they had to post their standard charges for all services and items, including drugs, by Jan. 1, but did not define \u201cstandard charges.\u201d In later guidance, it said the format was \u201cthe hospital\u2019s choice.\u201d\u201cWithout a standard definition, patients cannot make accurate comparisons between hospitals,\u201d said Herb B. Kuhn, the president of the Missouri Hospital Association.No hospitals operating in the United States are exempt from the new requirement, but the Trump administration has not said how it plans to enforce it. Federal officials have asked the public to suggest \u201cenforcement mechanisms.\u201dEach hospital has a list \u2014 known as a \u201cchargemaster\u201d \u2014 of prices for thousands of goods and services, including medical procedures, laboratory tests, supplies and medications. But the price information is often difficult and sometimes impossible to find on hospital websites.List prices may be relevant for some consumers. People with high-deductible plans may have to pay some or all of the list price until they meet the deductible, and people with insurance who go outside their health plan\u2019s network may also have to pay a substantial share of the list price.But to others, the prices listed on the \u201cchargemaster\u201d may have no bearing on the cost of their care. Health plans and insurance companies usually negotiate much lower prices, and uninsured patients often qualify for substantial discounts.\u201cMany hospitals still see the chargemaster price as an important way to enhance revenue,\u201d said Ge Bai, an expert on health care finance and accounting at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cHaving a high list price means they have more leverage in negotiating prices for people covered by private insurance.\u201dEven while complying with the new requirement, many hospitals have posted disclaimers warning consumers not to rely on the data.The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, for example, says that it \u201cdoes not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness\u201d of the charges listed on its website.If hospitals have complaints about the new requirements, Ms. Verma said, they should voluntarily provide patients with more useful information.\u201cHospitals don\u2019t have to wait for us to go further in helping their patients understand what care will cost,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

In many cases, immigrants \u2014 legal or illegal \u2014 are seeking jobs that American citizens do not want to do.Kevin Hassett, the White House\u2019s top economist, argued before joining the Trump administration that immigration spurs economic growth and that the United States should double its intake of immigrants.Fentanyl is a narcotic that is used to treat severe pain and is a key contributor the opioid crisis. It is also sometimes mixed with heroin. Most fentanyl enters the United States from packages mailed directly from China through traditional ports of entry, according to the report, and through Canada from China. A lower-potency, lower-cost grade of fentanyl is also smuggled across the southwest border from Mexico. The fentanyl directly from China is far more lucrative for sellers because of its higher purity. The fentanyl sent through conventional mail packages has proved difficult for law enforcement to detect. Fentanyl coming from Mexico is often hidden in automobile compartments, much like conventional drug smuggling.\u2014 Michael TackettBut it should be noted that these criminal convictions covered a range of offenses, including many that were nonviolent. The most common charges were for traffic violations, possessing or selling drugs and immigration offenses like illegal entry.\u2014 Linda QiuFirst, the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, has yet to pass in Congress. Any economic benefits from the agreement, if it passes, will most likely come in the form of lower tariffs for American companies or higher wages for American workers.This is different from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign promise that Mexico would finance the wall.\u2014 Alan RappeportThe president has claimed that the annual cost of illegal drugs in the United States is $500 billion. But a 2015 report by the surgeon general estimated that the annual economic impact of illicit drug use is $193 billion.Stopping the flow of drugs across the southwest border would not entirely stem the flow of drugs across the United States. Moreover, it is not clear how reducing the cost of drug addiction would finance the wall.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader:An estimated 800,000 federal workers are furloughed or working without pay because of the shutdown. While millions of Americans are not being directly harmed, there is a multiplier effect when considering family members of those whose jobs are affected. This also spills into the broader economy, harming business owners whose customers must cut back, tourism and travel.\u2014 Alan RappeportSenator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity that he had never seen Mr. Trump behave in such a presidential manner. And he issued a dire warning to Mr. Trump\u2019s base.\u201cIf we undercut the president, that\u2019s the end of his presidency and the end of our party,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\u201cAs the president clearly laid out tonight, we have a growing humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border,\u201d Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement.\u201cI stand ready and willing to work with the White House and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the House and Senate to find a legislative solution to border security and reopen the government.\u201dEven before the speech began, Democrats were preparing their rebuttals.\u201cPresident Trump is going to use the public airwaves to spread fear and misinformation tonight,\u201d tweeted Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the head of the Democrats\u2019 messaging arm. \u201cI\u2019m going to correct the record.\u201dIn a more lighthearted jab, Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, joked that he unsuccessfully tried to get Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, to \u201clivestream a Trump\u2019s Not Telling The Truth drinking game tonight.\u201d\u201cMe and him, shot of beer every time Trump says something made up,\u201d Mr. Murphy wrote on Twitter. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bite.\u201d (Mr. Schatz, live-tweeting the speech, noted instead: \u201cThis is dark.\u201d)And during the speech, Democrats flooded the internet with their own commentary, frequently reflecting Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric back at his administration.\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s presidency is a national emergency!\u201d wrote Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota.But it was perhaps Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 5 House Democrat, who most succinctly summed up his party\u2019s response: \u201cWe are not paying a $5 billion ransom note for your medieval border wall,\u201d he tweeted, with a castle emoji. \u201cAnd nothing you just said will change that cold, hard reality.\u201d\u2014 Emily Cochrane and Catie EdmondsonSpeaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, spoke from the Capitol after Mr. Trump finished his remarks from the Oval Office. The dueling speeches from opposite sides of Pennsylvania Avenue unfolded at the close of Day 18 of a government shutdown over Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall that Democrats have steadfastly opposed.The Democratic leaders\u2019 decision to select themselves as the message-bearers to counter the president underscores how a partisan power struggle in a new era of divided government is undergirding the discussions over resolving the shutdown, even as the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal workers and benefits for millions of Americans hang in the balance.Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, also made a public response to Mr. Trump, which was streamed live on social media platforms after Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer concluded their remarks. The move was reminiscent of how a fractious Republican Party responded to State of the Union addresses when Barack Obama was president: Republican leaders designated a formal response and Tea Party-aligned conservatives chose their own messengers to deliver a different rebuttal.\u2014 Julie Hirschfeld DavisA dozen Senate Democrats took the floor this evening for a talkathon-style protest calling on Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans to end the government shutdown. Led by Senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, it was yet another effort to raise the pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to allow a vote on legislation that would reopen the government. \u2014 Catie EdmondsonWhat is normally an easy decision for network executives \u2014 granting airtime to a sitting president to address the nation \u2014 led to hours of hand-wringing by journalists and producers wary of giving a platform to a president whose public remarks, particularly on immigration, have been marked by untruths and misleading claims. Liberals wondered why news outlets would defer to a president who, hours earlier, had used Twitter to label journalists \u201cthe Enemy of the People,\u201d \u201cthe real Opposition Party\u201d and \u201ccrazed lunatics.\u201d\u2014 Michael M.

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s Former Lawyer, Agrees to Testify to Congress", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer who implicated him in a scheme to pay hush money to two women claiming to have had affairs with him, said on Thursday that he had agreed to testify before a House committee next month and give \u201ca full and credible account\u201d of his work for Mr. Trump.He could soon share many of them on national television under oath. But potential constraints emerged almost immediately on Thursday when the committee\u2019s chairman warned that Mr. Cohen most likely would be barred by Mr. Mueller from discussing matters related to Russia.\u201cIn furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in a statement, \u201cI have accepted the invitation by Chairman Elijah Cummings to appear publicly on Feb. 7. I look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.\u201dThat cooperation has earned him the ire of Mr. Trump, who has called Mr. Cohen a \u201cweak person.\u201d The president said he did nothing wrong regarding the campaign finance charge, and he accused his former lawyer of lying to prosecutors to try to get a reduced sentence. In court filings, prosecutors have not named Mr. Trump, referring to a \u201ccandidate for federal office\u201d and \u201cIndividual-1.\u201dThe subjects and level of detail that Mr. Cohen will be able to go into in public remain to be seen. Mr. Cummings said he was consulting Mr. Mueller\u2019s office to ensure that he did not hinder its efforts, and that the special counsel\u2019s team had indicated some areas \u2014 including interactions with Russia \u2014 that would most likely be off limits.If Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds evidence that Mr. Trump broke the law, he will have decisions to make about how to proceed. We explain them.\u201cI want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations,\u201d Mr. Cummings said.Mr. Cummings said in a brief interview on Thursday that he had known Mr. Cohen would testify for some time and had spoken with him when arranging the hearing.\u201cHe\u2019ll have a chance to tell his side of the story, and we\u2019ll have a chance to question him,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people deserve that.\u201d\u201cThis is a watershed moment,\u201d Mr. Cummings said, invoking Mr. Dean, who he said \u201cchanged the course of America\u201d with his testimony.It was unclear whether Mr. Cohen\u2019s agreement to testify before the Oversight Committee would preclude appearances, in public or private, before other House panels.The newly installed chairmen of at least two other panels have said they want to speak with Mr. Cohen about his work on behalf of Mr. Trump. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, said in an interview last week that he was in touch with Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer about a possible appearance.In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Schiff said he was glad to see Mr. Cohen would appear in public, but would press ahead in trying to secure a private appearance before his own committee \u201cin the near future\u201d to discuss matters related to Russia. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he too had an outstanding request for Mr. Cohen to come before his investigators.Democrats won back the House last year promising to hold Mr. Trump and his administration to account and have begun laying the groundwork for a long run of investigations targeting his administration\u2019s policies and ethics lapses, Mr. Trump\u2019s businesses and his campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia. Mr. Cohen\u2019s appearance in public, before national television cameras, will begin to fulfill that promise, but is likely to be only the first in a string of public testimony that could prove damaging to the president.Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, was not pleased with the announcement. Democrats, he said, had wasted no time in using the committee for \u201cpolitical theater rather than legitimate oversight.\u201d He also pointed out that Mr. Cohen had already \u201cadmitted to providing intentionally false and misleading testimony to Congress\u201d once before.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s no accident.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Here\u2019s an underrated perk of being Chadwick Boseman. One day, you\u2019re out on a date at a jazz concert with your lady. It\u2019s at one of those pastoral Californian sites: summertime, dragonflies. The sun is setting, pink and orange and spectacular, rivaled in charm only by the swell of the music, which is as shimmering and soulful as the surface of a lake.It\u2019s a near perfect moment. Perfect, that is, except for the view. A couple of yards ahead, partly obstructing your sightline, you notice a man with far-too-low jeans and AWOL underwear. A man whose fleshy hind-cleavage is putting on an impromptu show of its own.If you were anyone else, you might crack a joke (ahem), avert your gaze and hope for the best. A funny footnote on an otherwise scrapbook evening.This really happened, mostly.\u201cSomeone had to tell him!\u201d Boseman said in an interview recently, not quite defending himself.He was laughing and pounding the table in a Western-chic restaurant with adobe brick, exposed beams and soaring skylights. It was the laugh of a benevolent conqueror, or of a man who landed the Robinson role within two years of moving to Los Angeles \u2014 both rows of teeth, steady eye contact.\u201cHe had no idea who I was,\u201d Boseman said, noting that the encounter had been a couple of years ago, before he\u2019d personified this year\u2019s most in-demand new Halloween costume. Then, somehow, he capped his story with an observation that was both sophisticated and gracious.\u201cThat\u2019s a gift that the characters give you,\u201d he said. \u201cA dimension of yourself that you never had before.\u201dMost people would recognize any dimension of Boseman now. After years of surfing the biopic industrial complex as one national idol after another, his role as Black Panther in the \u201cAvengers\u201d films and this year\u2019s eponymous blockbuster, the ninth-highest-grossing movie of all time, has established him as the rare breed of actor with both widely recognized chops and old-school star power \u2014 the kind any producer in post-Netflix Hollywood would trade a good kidney to clone in a lab.Next up are starring roles in the New York police action drama \u201c17 Bridges\u201d (of which he is also a producer), the international thriller \u201cExpatriate\u201d (he\u2019s producing and co-writing that one) and, barring an alien-invasion-level catastrophe, a wildly anticipated \u201cBlack Panther\u201d sequel.Remarkably, Boseman has come this far despite a relatively late start (he led a studio film for the first time at 35) and while remaining noticeably untouched by the tabloid drama, or whiff of overexposure, that can engulf even seasoned celebrities. In a pop taxonomy of black male nobility, he is cut squarely from the mold of Barack Obama \u2014 generally cool-blooded, affable, devoted to unglamorous fundamentals \u2014 a figure whom he is doubtlessly on a shortlist to portray in an inevitable epic.Boseman told me his method of humanizing superhumans begins with searching their pasts. He\u2019s looking for gestational wounds, personal failures, private fears \u2014 fissures where the molten ore of experience might harden into steel.For the role of T\u2019Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther, that meant conceiving of a childhood squeezed by the weight of an ancient unbroken dynasty. When it came to becoming Jackie Robinson, he focused on formative years as a Negro League firebrand that crystallized the baseball pioneer\u2019s polished exterior. James Brown: a meditation on irrepressible self-confidence, long starved by years of deprivation and insult in Jim Crow South Carolina.\u201cYou have to hold it all in your mind, scene by scene,\u201d Boseman said, a scraped plate of brussels sprouts with something called yuzu and celery-seed crema before him. He was dressed like an athlete turned agitator: LeBron James sneakers, black jeans, sleeveless black hoodie imprinted with the face of one hero he\u2019d still love to play: Muhammad Ali.\u201cYou\u2019re a strong black man in a world that conflicts with that strength, that really doesn\u2019t want you to be great,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo what makes you the one who\u2019s going to stand tall?\u201dHis closest role models were his two brothers: Derrick, the eldest, now a preacher in Tennessee; and Kevin in the middle, a dancer who has performed with the Martha Graham and Alvin Ailey troupes and toured with the stage adaptation of \u201cThe Lion King.\u201dBoth brothers, each five years apart from the next, were allies and rivals (\u201cI always wanted to dress better than my middle brother, and I wanted to beat the older one in sports\u201d), but it was Kevin who foreshadowed Chadwick\u2019s life in the arts.But Kevin persisted and, ultimately, excelled. In time, the folks came around, helping him get into the Governor\u2019s School for the Arts and Humanities in nearby Greenville.\u201cHe had the resolve to be like, \u2018No \u2014 I have something; I\u2019m going to do it anyway, right or wrong,\u2019\u201d Boseman said. \u201cAnd he was right.\u201dSome days, Boseman\u2019s mother would take him to pick up Kevin from school theater or dance rehearsals. Boseman would watch the action onstage, mesmerized by verbal directions he strained to comprehend, and by the lights, and by the grace-filled bodies in wordless dialogue.In high school, he was a serious basketball player but made a final turn toward storytelling after a friend and teammate was tragically shot and killed. Boseman processed his thoughts and emotions by writing what he eventually realized was a play. When it was time to consider colleges, he chose an arts program at Howard University, with a dream of becoming a director.\u201cThere\u2019s no way in the world I would have thought, \u2018O.K. let me write this play\u2019 if it wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d Boseman said, of his brother Kevin. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m here because of what he did.\u201dAt Howard, he\u2019d taken an acting class with the Tony Award-winning actress and director Phylicia Rashad. (One summer, she helped him and some classmates get into an elite theater program at the University of Oxford, an adventure he later learned had been financed by a friend of hers: Denzel Washington.) To earn money, Boseman taught acting to students at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem.The show filmed in Los Angeles and afforded Boseman his first real taste of Hollywood, which he liked more than he\u2019d expected.\u201cBefore that, I had just wanted to be an artist in New York,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that coming to L.A. and trying to be a film actor was a completely different thing.\u201dBut he was a quick study. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got New York hustle? In L.A.?\u201d he said, making an incredulous face.Then he laughed his triumphant laugh.Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Boseman\u2019s co-star and love interest in \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d described his career choices as those of a socially conscious history buff. She recalled a working session with the film\u2019s director, Ryan Coogler, and Boseman that he turned into a mini lecture on the ancient Egyptian iconography and spiritual customs that had informed the original comic book.\u201cHe\u2019s very keen to put human experiences in historical context,\u201d she said. \u201cEven with a world that was make-believe, he wanted to connect it to the world that we know and could try to understand.\u201dOne wonders if, as a result of his travels in the shoes of moral giants, Boseman has evolved an occupational shorthand \u2014 a secret posture, gaze or pattern of speech \u2014 that can invest any character with ineffable dignity.Asked the question at the restaurant, he seemed to turn it over in his mind, as if he wanted to give it a fair shake.\u201cThey can put the clothes on you,\u201d he allowed, finally, after a long pause. A wry smile fanned across his face \u2014 both rows of teeth, steady eye contact. \u201cBut then you\u2019ve gotta wear \u2019em.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Proposals Could Increase Health Costs for Consumers", "Date": "2019-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Consumers who use expensive brand-name prescription drugs when cheaper alternatives are available could face higher costs under a new policy being proposed by the Trump administration.The proposal, to be published this week in the Federal Register, would apply to health insurance plans sold under the Affordable Care Act.Health plans have annual limits on consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. Under the proposal, insurers would not have to count the full amount of a consumer\u2019s co-payment for a brand-name drug toward the annual limit on cost-sharing. Insurers would have to count only the smaller amount that would be charged for a generic version of the drug.For example, if a consumer filled a doctor\u2019s prescription for a brand-name drug with a $25 co-payment, rather than using a generic medicine with a $5 co-payment, the consumer might get credit for only $5 in out-of-pocket spending. Consumers would have to spend more of their own money before reaching the annual limit on out-of-pocket costs.In addition, insurers would not have to count the value of coupons and other financial assistance provided to consumers by drug manufacturers if generic alternatives were available. This change could significantly increase consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for some of the more expensive prescription drugs and has prompted protests from groups representing patients.President Trump has repeatedly vowed to reduce drug prices and to lower out-of-pocket drug costs. But for some consumers, the latest proposal could have the opposite effect.The proposal highlights a potential conflict between patients with a particular disease, who may benefit from the use of coupons, and other consumers more generally. Economists say that coupons can raise health care costs by encouraging people to use more expensive drugs.\u201cThe availability of a coupon may cause physicians and beneficiaries to choose an expensive brand-name drug when a less expensive and equally effective generic or other alternative is available,\u201d the Trump administration said in explaining its proposal. \u201cWhen consumers are relieved of co-payment obligations, manufacturers are relieved of a market constraint on drug prices.\u201dMoreover, it said, \u201ccoupons can add significant long-term costs to the health care system that may outweigh the short-term benefits.\u201dBut Bari Talente, an executive vice president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said, \u201cMany people with M.S. rely on co-pay assistance, even for generic medications.\u201dIn the last few years, she said, generic versions of the drug Copaxone have become available, but even they have high prices. One of the generic medicines costs $60,000 to $65,000 a year, she said.Carl E. Schmid II, the deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, a public policy and advocacy organization, said the administration\u2019s proposal could sharply increase out-of-pocket costs, so that a consumer who now pays virtually nothing might have to pay $3,500 a year or more for a drug to treat H.I.V.\u201cThat increases the likelihood that people won\u2019t pick up their drugs, won\u2019t take their drugs,\u201d Mr. Schmid said.Leyla Mansour-Cole, the policy director of the Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition, a nonprofit group, said the Trump administration proposal \u201ccaused trepidation\u201d for some patients.\u201cIn theory, co-pay coupons could encourage people to take higher-priced drugs,\u201d Ms. Mansour-Cole said. \u201cIn reality, people use them to get the medicines that their doctors prescribe, despite astronomically high deductibles.\u201dThe administration is proposing several other changes that could increase costs for consumers.Under the proposal, fewer people would qualify for federal subsidies, and those who qualify could be required to spend a larger share of their income on insurance premiums.In addition, the proposal could lead to a small increase in out-of-pocket costs, which include co-payments and deductibles for doctors\u2019 services and hospital care.The changes would result from a new method of calculating inflation in health insurance prices \u2014 a factor used in computing the amount of premium subsidies and the annual limit on consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs.The Trump administration estimated that the changes would save the government $900 million annually in subsidies in 2020 and 2021 and $1 billion a year in 2022 and 2023. In addition, it predicted that 100,000 fewer people would have coverage through the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.The administration said that some of the 100,000 people might buy short-term insurance policies, which do not have to cover pre-existing conditions or provide all the benefits required by the health law. But, it said, most are \u201clikely to become uninsured.\u201dEither way, the administration said, \u201cthese individuals will be bearing a larger share of the costs of their own health care consumption.\u201dThe proposed rule may reduce federal spending and the need to collect taxes in the future, the administration said. \u201cHowever,\u201d it added, \u201cthe increased number of uninsured may increase federal and state uncompensated care costs.\u201dThe administration estimated that premiums \u2014 after subsidies, in the form of tax credits \u2014 would be 1 percent higher as a result of its proposal.The limit on out-of-pocket costs is already high; a consumer can be required to spend as much as $7,900 a year. Under the formula now in use, the limit would rise to $8,000 next year. Under the Trump administration proposal, it would increase to $8,200.Administration officials said their proposal would more accurately measure insurance price inflation. But Democrats refused to accept that explanation, noting that Mr. Trump had tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act during his entire first year in office.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, described the new proposed rule as \u201cTrump\u2019s latest attempt to sabotage health care.\u201dThe Trump administration is also proposing a new requirement to increase the number of health insurance plans that omit coverage of abortion services.Under the proposal, insurers that provide coverage of abortions would also have to offer at least one plan providing the same benefits but excluding coverage of abortions.The administration said it was concerned that some people who wanted to buy insurance under the Affordable Care act refrained from doing so because they had religious or moral objections to abortion coverage. The administration acknowledged that some states like California, New York and Oregon generally required insurers to offer abortion coverage on the exchange, and it appears that the proposed federal requirement would not override such state laws.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Real Estate Funds Have Been a Balm in a Stinging Market", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of being overshadowed by the likes of Apple and Alphabet, real estate funds have lately edged ahead of the overall stock market by betting mainly on old-fashioned assets like office buildings, malls and warehouses.In the fourth quarter, when the stock market really started to jitter and slide, the S&P 500 sank 13.52 percent, including dividends, but the FTSE Nareit All Equity R.E.I.T.s Index, a leading index composed of publicly traded real estate investment trusts, lost only 6.1 percent. For all of 2018, as the S&P 500 lost 4.4 percent, including dividends, the FTSE Nareit index lost only 4 percent.So it goes for this stalwart, if stodgy, sector: Real estate can often chug along when other sectors start to sputter. For that reason, a real estate mutual fund or exchange-traded fund may help buffer an otherwise diversified portfolio from some of the stock market\u2019s swings. In addition, it\u2019s an entree to investing in commercial real estate for someone who can\u2019t afford the Empire State Building (which is owned by a R.E.I.T. named Empire State Realty Trust).A share in a real-estate mutual fund or E.T.F. is \u201ceffectively a hybrid of debt and equity,\u201d said Michael J. Acton, managing director and head of research for AEW Capital Management in Boston. \u201cThe debt feature is lease payments you get from the underlying properties, and the equity feature is the right to re-lease or sell those properties.\u201d The lease payments can provide predictability like bonds, while the property values offer upside potential like stocks.Morningstar, the investment-analysis company, found that from 1972 through 2018, R.E.I.T.s provided a compound average annual return of 11.5 percent, compared to 10.2 percent for United States stocks. Morningstar has also found that real-estate stocks are slightly more volatile, on average, than other stocks. During the global financial crisis, real estate crashed with other stock market sectors, with the FTSE Nareit index falling 37.7 percent.Still, real estate funds and E.T.F.s often can provide additional diversification to an investment portfolio because commercial property markets don\u2019t usually move in lock step with stocks, Mr. Acton said. \u201cThere are leases in place, and the cash flows from those leases are already locked in.\u201dHow much of a fund investor\u2019s overall portfolio should be allocated to real estate is a question, like so many in the investment world, that\u2019s a matter of philosophical dispute.Matthew C. Brancato, a principal and head of the portfolio review department at Vanguard, said investors who own well-diversified index funds, like those built upon the S&P 500, may already have all the real estate they need. The S&P index includes 32 R.E.I.T.s, and together they account for about 3 percent of the index\u2019s market capitalization.Layering a dedicated real estate fund or E.T.F. atop a broad-based core holding would imply that an investor wanted to \u201cexpress a view about real estate\u201d \u2014 either believing that it will outperform the rest of the market or just liking the sector, Mr. Brancato said.But portfolio managers of real estate funds say reasons beyond a fascination with bricks and blueprints might persuade investors to nudge their real estate allocations above that of broad-based index funds.\u201cCommercial real estate is a very large market,\u201d he said.Conventional wisdom says rising rates hurt real estate. The logic behind this is simple, said Jennifer Cookke, a lecturer in the Center for Real Estate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou typically have debt on a property,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when interest rates rise, costs are higher, and that reduces profit.\u201dThe managers of the Neuberger Berman Real Estate Fund delved into whether rates really do damp R.E.I.T.s and learned that the effect was often temporary, said Brian Jones, who manages the fund with Mr. Shigekawa. \u201cWhat we found is, in periods where interest rates were spiking, the performance of R.E.I.T.s suffered,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cBut if you go six and 12 months beyond a rate spike, R.E.I.T.s shares typically recover and do very well.\u201dE-commerce\u2019s effects won\u2019t be sloughed off so easily. They can be summarized in a single name: Amazon. The online giant (and other e-commerce companies) is changing how people shop and raising questions about the need for physical storefronts.This country has 1,200 shopping malls alone, Mr. Buller said. \u201cThere are 400 class-A malls, and I think those will survive. The other 800? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mr. Buller has allocated about 20 percent of his fund to retail holdings, and the Simon Property Group, the country\u2019s largest mall R.E.I.T., is among his top stakes.An investor who wants to bet on real estate must make the usual choice between actively managed funds, like those offered by Neuberger Berman, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, and passively managed indexed offerings.A misconception of some investors is that they\u2019ve already diversified their portfolio with real estate because they own a house and perhaps a vacation rental, said Mr. Jones, of the Neuberger Berman fund. That sort of ownership is a narrow bet on one or two markets, comparable to owning one or two stocks instead of, say, an S&P 500 index fund. \u201cYou don\u2019t derive the same diversification benefit that you can get from a R.E.I.T. fund,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Fires Ravaged California, Utilities Lobbied Lawmakers for Protection", "Date": "2019-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 As California\u2019s deadliest wildfire was consuming the town of Paradise in November, some of the state\u2019s top power company officials and a dozen legislators were at an annual retreat at the Fairmont Kea Lani resort on Maui. In the course of four days, they discussed wildfires \u2014 and how much responsibility the utilities deserve for the devastation, if any.It is an issue of increasing urgency as more fires are traced to equipment owned by California\u2019s investor-owned utilities. The largest, Pacific Gas and Electric, could ultimately have to pay homeowners and others an estimated $30 billion for causing fires over the last two years. The most devastating of those, the Camp Fire, destroyed thousands of homes in Paradise and killed at least 86 people.The utility companies acknowledge that they may bear some responsibility but say not all of it, because climate change and development in remote areas have made wildfires more destructive. In addition, they argue that electricity rates would go up regardless of whether the state protected them because investors and banks could grow wary of lending to California\u2019s energy sector.But public interest groups say the utilities are effectively seeking a bailout for mistakes made by well-compensated executives. The utilities have been frequently criticized, for example, for not trimming trees along power lines. Some policy experts and lawmakers say it might be better to break up PG&E, replace its board and management or convert it into a publicly owned utility.People on both sides fear that the state, which prides itself on being a leader in the fight against climate change, could be on the cusp of an energy crisis \u2014 its second in less than two decades. In 2000 and 2001, California was roiled by blackouts, soaring electricity rates and the bankruptcy of PG&E after the state made missteps in deregulating the power industry.\u201cThere clearly is a great deal of disruption that would occur,\u201d said Assemblyman Chris Holden, chairman of the Utilities and Energy Committee. He was referring to the possibility of a second bankruptcy of PG&E, which serves 16 million people in central and Northern California.The companies waged a multimillion-dollar campaign to secure that protection. In the first nine months of 2018, the three investor-owned utilities collectively gave $5 million to the campaigns of state lawmakers, as much as $1 million more than they had in any full year since 2011, according to Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy organization in California.PG&E stepped up its lobbying effort, too \u2014 spending $8.4 million in just the first nine months of 2018, compared with $1.6 million in all of 2017 and $1.1 million in 2016. The company\u2019s spending in the first three quarters exceeded 2017\u2019s top spender, Chevron, which spent $8.2 million that year, according to Consumer Watchdog.\u201cMoney talks in Sacramento, and big money talks loud enough to buy a big bailout,\u201d said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. \u201cThere is no legislator of either party, even those who don\u2019t take money from the utilities, who doesn\u2019t worry about bucking the utilities.\u201dEvents like the Maui conference have provided fodder for the industry\u2019s critics.The annual event is organized by the California Independent Voter Project, a nonprofit in San Diego that was co-founded by a former state senator and says it informs the public about policy issues. The event brings together legislators and executives from several industries, who pay $8,000 a head to attend. Legislators sometimes pay their own way or receive compensation if they speak.PG&E canceled its presence at the event as fires began raging in Northern California but did not seek a refund of its sponsorship, which the company said covered the entry fees for its officials. Executives of the two other investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, still attended.Also at the event were 10 members of the State Assembly and two state senators who sit on committees dealing with the state budget, appropriations, energy, public safety and insurance. The dozen lawmakers are among the biggest beneficiaries of campaign contributions from the three utilities, receiving more than $600,000 since 2011, according to Consumer Watchdog.Discussions at the conference covered many topics, including the wildfires, said Dylan Gray, chief of staff for Assemblyman Heath Flora, a Republican from the Central Valley who attended.Dan Howle, executive director and chairman of the Voter Project, said that no lobbying was permitted and that no specific legislation had been discussed.\u201cWhat would be wrong with elected officials and business discussing issues?\u201d he said. \u201cIf the public wants to go, the public can pay a fee.\u201dBut critics describe the event as part of a broader effort by businesses, particularly the utilities, to influence lawmakers. Consumer Watchdog, for example, found that PG&E and the other two utilities had contributed to the campaigns of between 80 percent and 90 percent of state legislators over the last two years.Lynsey Paulo, a PG&E spokeswoman, said the company used shareholder money for political activities like campaign contributions and lobbying, as well as tracking and analyzing bills before the Legislature. The company declined to discuss its role in the wildfires.Mr. Court called the recent political spending by the companies \u201cthe biggest lobbying orgy by the utilities\u201d since the last energy crisis in 2000 and 2001, when California gave its blessing to a rate increase.Now the spotlight is back on Sacramento and whether lawmakers will vote to protect utilities from the tab for the 2018 fires. PG&E\u2019s financial outlook, and perhaps its survival, depends on what happens.PG&E could also be prosecuted. The state attorney general, Xavier Becerra, said in a legal filing at the end of December that he could bring criminal charges against the company for its role in the fires if his office uncovered \u201creckless\u201d conduct by the utility. That filing was in an unrelated case.Some lawmakers have said the state has no choice but to prevent another utility bankruptcy. They argue that while punishing the companies for fires that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes might seem justified, the state would end up hurting itself by signaling to bond investors and banks that they should avoid California\u2019s electricity business or lend to it only at much higher interest rates.Mr. Holden, the head of the Assembly\u2019s energy committee, has taken the lead in drafting the legislation. He is also among the recipients of the utilities\u2019 largess, with at least $71,750 in campaign contributions from the three companies since 2011. Mr. Holden declined to discuss the donations.But other lawmakers say they are done bailing out utilities. Critics of the companies would like to break up PG&E, potentially into separate gas and electric companies or by geographic areas. Protesters disrupted a meeting of the state\u2019s utility commission in November with chants and signs reading, \u201cNo PG&E bailout!\u201dState Senator Jerry Hill, a Democrat, said he was working on a bill that would break up PG&E. His district, south of San Francisco, includes San Bruno, the location of a 2010 PG&E pipeline explosion that killed eight people and destroyed dozens of homes. The state fined PG&E $1.6 billion for failing to maintain its lines and is investigating whether the company falsified pipeline reports.\u201cThe common thread seems to be negligence on the part of PG&E,\u201d Mr. Hill said. \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion that the investor-owned utility model that they have and use is not providing the priority of safety as it should. Their priority is to shareholders and maximizing profit and not safety.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Pledges $500 Million for Affordable Housing in Seattle Area", "Date": "2019-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 The Seattle area, home to both Microsoft and Amazon, is a potent symbol of the affordable housing crisis that has followed the explosive growth of tech hubs. Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem.Microsoft\u2019s money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the company\u2019s own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.Microsoft\u2019s move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax.The debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing.Microsoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead.\u201cWe believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,\u201d said Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer.Others plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards.\u201cThis is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies.Microsoft began researching the region\u2019s housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The area\u2019s home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that \u201cthe region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.\u201dThat squeeze hits a range of workers. \u201cOf course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,\u201d Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the company\u2019s headquarters. \u201cIt is a supply problem, a market failure.\u201dMicrosoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing.The company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattle\u2019s suburbs.The loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects.The initial reaction to the company\u2019s announcement was positive.\u201cThere is almost no level of housing that isn\u2019t direly needed,\u201d said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force.\u201cThe idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesn\u2019t work anymore,\u201d said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle.Amazon declined to comment.Microsoft has begun a major overhaul of its main campus in Redmond, committing billions of dollars in renovations and connecting it to a light rail station under construction. The company helped finance a successful campaign for voters to approve more property taxes to pay for transportation. This new investment in housing takes its commitments a step further.\u201cThis is where Microsoft is going to be, and the region needs to work,\u201d Ms. Balducci said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is wholly altruism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now the old recipes for success don\u2019t work, and he must reinvent himself again.Shao Chunyou exemplifies the Chinese dream. Over three decades, he rose from an assembly line worker to an electronics business owner, following China\u2019s rise from an economic backwater to the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. He now owns two factories and employs over 2,000 workers.Now, as China changes, Mr. Shao must reinvent himself again.Fast growth is fading. Competition has intensified. And in a country sometimes called the world\u2019s factory floor, it sometimes seems as if nobody wants to work in a factory anymore.\u201cThere were more workers and fewer factories then,\u201d Mr. Shao said, referring to the old days. \u201cNow we have to beg workers.\u201dThe country must now embrace high-value manufacturing, automation and innovation if it hopes to keep growing at a steady clip. Success depends on the ability of people like Mr. Shao to pivot away from their traditional business methods.Mr. Shao\u2019s pivot won\u2019t be easy or cheap. He is replacing people with robots. He is making more sophisticated gadgets that could flummox copycats but could also be disastrously expensive if they fail. And in a shift for a businessman who prides himself on doing it alone, he is for the first time accepting direct government help. \u201cDoing business is like releasing the arrow from a bow,\u201d said Yu Youfu, Mr. Shao\u2019s wife. \u201cOnce it\u2019s in motion, there\u2019s no way to turn it back.\u201dEverybody calls Mr. Shao \u201cboss,\u201d even his wife. A portly man with a poof of hair that invites comparison to the American president\u2019s, Mr. Shao owns an electronics company called Quankang. Ms. Yu, a slender, intense woman, oversees factory operations, finance and administration. Their 27-year-old son, Shao Qiang, heads Quankang\u2019s new research and development department. The company traditionally made parts for smartphones and other gadgets, though it is now setting its sights higher. The family is defined by its factories. For years, the couple slept in their office next to the factory, and Ms. Yu still crashes there from time to time even though their spacious apartment is a 15-minute drive away.\u201cI sleep better with the noise of the machines,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they\u2019re noisy, it means they\u2019re functioning.\u201dMr. Shao was born in Jiujiang, a medium-size city in China\u2019s interior. At 16, he became an apprentice carpenter, making roughly 60 cents a day, barely enough to feed himself.In 1989, the same year the authorities gunned down protesters in Tiananmen Square, Mr. Shao, then 20, went south. Deng Xiaoping, then China\u2019s paramount leader, had opened special economic zones \u2014 essentially areas where entrepreneurs could start businesses and court foreign investors \u2014 in southern cities like Shenzhen and Zhuhai. The newly built factories there were hiring.Mr. Shao left home with about $5 in his pocket. Highways and high-speed trains didn\u2019t crisscross China as they do now. He had to take a one-hour bus ride to the provincial capital, then a 15-hour train ride.\u201cThe trains were always packed, like the ones shipping pigs,\u201d he said.It wasn\u2019t easy to find a job, without which Mr. Shao couldn\u2019t get permission to live in Shenzhen. Whenever the authorities raided dormitories looking for trespassers, he and others would hide overnight in a nearby cemetery.He finally found a job as an apprentice, making much less than $1 a day. Working overtime earned him a few cents more per hour. Within three years, he was promoted to supervisor and was making roughly $375 a month. Ms. Yu, also from Jiujiang, joined him in Shenzhen with Shao Qiang, then 2 months old. \u201cI would work from 8 a.m. till 11 p.m. or even midnight.\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cWe all wanted to earn the overtime pay. Nobody complained.\u201dIn 2004, Mr. Shao started a small metal-molding company while working at his day job. Ms. Yu dealt with clients and managed the books. They called the company Quankang, which can mean \u201call healthy\u201d or \u201call good.\u201d They sent their son back home to be raised by his grandparents, as many migrant workers in China had done. Two years later, they moved from Shenzhen to neighboring Dongguan, a city of cheap factory buildings.Government and state-owned banks typically didn\u2019t help small business owners like Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu, and they struggled at first. They once turned away a big customer because they didn\u2019t have the cash to buy the materials. To win over another customer, they rented a huge metalworking machine and moved it into their factory overnight to show the client who visited in the morning that they could do the work. They got the order.They started by making metal parts for MP3 players, then cellphone casings. They spent $13,000 of their savings on a polishing machine, a fortune for most Chinese at the time.\u201cMy heart was filled with trepidation,\u201d Mr. Shao said. \u201cIf we failed, we would lose everything.\u201dThey didn\u2019t fail. Helped by China\u2019s surging growth, they became part of a vast web of suppliers that has helped China dominate the business of manufacturing electronics. But as China began to mature, business got tougher. Competitors emerged. Pricing became brutal. Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu found they had to evolve or die.In 2015, the couple started working with Chinese manufacturers like Xiaomi and Huawei to make key metal parts for their headsets as smartphone sales took off. They took out millions of dollars in bank loans and invested in 120 tooling machines. The bet paid off until the competition became too fierce that they began considering harder-to-replicate products, such as appliances.\u201cIn China, once you have a product that sells well, many companies will rush in to make the same thing,\u201d Mr. Shao said.The biggest problem the couple and many other Chinese manufacturers face is the growing cost of labor and increasingly scarce workers.Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu paid their workers about 1,000 renminbi a month in 2004, or about $150 at current exchange rates. Now pay is at least five times that, and can go as high as eight times that.Like most factories Quankang also provides housing and meals. It used to pay four types of social benefits. Now it pays six. The couple know they are lucky to have survived. After the financial crisis, many multinational manufacturers in Dongguan moved their factories to lower-cost countries like Vietnam. Many of the couple\u2019s friends and competitors closed their factories.Over lunch recently, Ms. Yu shook her head as she told her husband that a nearby electronic component factory that hired 7,000 workers at its peak had just filed for bankruptcy. In 2017, they came up with an ambitious survival plan: Move, climb the value chain and automate.Quankang is working with Xiaomi to design and make smart home appliances such as space heaters and electric fans. Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu plan to build three fully automated assembly lines. The first is expected to be running by March. And for the first time, Quankang is accepting direct government support. Mr. Shao\u2019s modernization campaign will happen on more than 30 acres far away from Dongguan, in neighboring Hunan Province. The local government there is giving Quankang the land almost free of charge. The local government of Yanling County is more interested in tax revenue and job creation than revenue from land sales, Mr. Shao said. So far, he has spent nearly $12 million on the Hunan plant.China\u2019s boom started when the Communist Party unleashed the country\u2019s entrepreneurs and largely left them alone. This next stage of growth may not be so easy. To help it along, the central government is spending vast amounts to upgrade manufacturing. Local officials in less developed provinces are trying to lure companies to replicate southern China\u2019s economic miracle. It proves appealing to entrepreneurs like Mr. Shao and Ms. Yu, who are desperate to find a new niche to survive and thrive. \u201cThe business of our factories isn\u2019t as good as before,\u201d Ms. Yu said. \u201cBut since we\u2019ve been doing this, we\u2019ll keep charging ahead because behind us it\u2019s a precipice. We\u2019ll fall if we step back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Things John Bogle Taught Us: Humility, Ethics and Simplicity", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "Personal finance luminaries and everyday investors share lessons from the late Vanguard founder. Supported bySo many people have John Bogle stories.For some, it is a chance encounter at a conference and a whispered word of advice. For others, it is a formal meeting. In one case, it was an airplane day trip and train ride just to meet the man. These are the stories of those who learned from Mr. Bogle, a man so many knew simply as Jack \u2014 no last name required.We may never know how many people were able to leave the full-time work force early after following Mr. Bogle\u2019s instructions, but Christopher DeMers was one of them.Having worked in technology as that industry\u2019s stocks climbed skyward in the 1990s, Mr. DeMers could have easily talked himself into the delusion that he had some special insight. But he resisted the urge, as Mr. Bogle counseled investors who thought they could outsmart Wall Street. \u201cIf I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Mr. DeMers, 63, said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to beat the market in the long run.\u201dThen Mr. Rogers hit Mr. Bogle with his opening line: He really wanted Ms. Hobson to meet a legend like Mr. Bogle because she was going to be president of Ariel by the time she was 30. She was taken aback \u2014 it was the first she\u2019d heard such a forecast. (It actually took her until she was 31.) As they chugged through New Jersey, Ms. Hobson came face to face with a financial legend \u2014 if nominal competitor \u2014 who didn\u2019t care about his own bottom line. That philosophy leads to interesting conversations.\u201cOccasionally, an investor will say, \u2018I need X percent return to meet my goals,\u2019\u201d Mr. Evensky said. \u201cWhile that may be a true statement, market returns will be what they are, not what an investor may believe they need. Jack always reminded us that we needed to be realistic in our expectations.\u201dMr. Evensky, who met Mr. Bogle several times over the years, spoke to us via email because he was on a cruise ship between Los Angeles and Honolulu. He could afford the trip, he said, in part because of the long-term planning that Mr. Bogle helped inspire.Jonathan Clements, who spent two decades at The Wall Street Journal preaching the virtues of low-cost investing, said that it was easy to forget Vanguard\u2019s innovation came in two parts.\u201cIt was a competitive advantage that nobody else could match,\u201d said Mr. Clements, who met Mr. Bogle perhaps 20 times over the years.And those low fees added up to bigger gains. True Confidence \u201cThere has been thinly veiled resentment toward Bogle from other mutual fund leaders over the years because of his focus on reducing costs, which was a direct threat to their bottom line,\u201d said Ms. Roper, who met him once, when she was seated next to him at a dinner. \u201cHe always cared more about that vision \u2014 how the industry should be run \u2014 than making friends in the industry. Of course, he was rewarded with a following that was cultlike in its devotion.\u201d\u201cHis consistent belief that all investors deserve a fair shake was a core principle that I incorporated into my work and shaped my career path,\u201d she said. \u201cYou listen to Jack Bogle and you think, \u2018I want to be on this guy\u2019s team.\u2019 Whatever he is talking about, this is the right thing to do for people.\u201dSo strong was Mr. Bogle\u2019s belief, she said, that it remained firmly instilled in Vanguard long after he had given up control. And once investors convert to his ethos of simplicity and thrift, it\u2019s for life. \u201cInvestors come around to Vanguard, and then they never leave,\u201d she said.Mr. Bogle was on campus to promote a book, and Mr. Stein stood in line for 20 minutes to have his copy signed. Mr. Stein seized the chance to share his best pitch for Betterment, which, in his eyes, would augment Mr. Bogle\u2019s favored index investments with low-cost, automated portfolio advice.Mr. Bogle listened and told Mr. Stein he would help a lot of people. Inside the book, Mr. Bogle wrote, \u201cStay the course!\u201d\u201cHe could have written that in everyone\u2019s book,\u201d said Mr. Stein, chief executive of Betterment, which opened to customers in 2010. \u201cBut when he wrote it to me, it meant that we were onto something.\u201dThey met again years later at Mr. Bogle\u2019s invitation. Mr. Stein arrived at what looked like a professorial grandparent\u2019s study, and was shocked at how much Mr. Bogle had prepared for their meeting, marking up a stack of materials about Betterment.\u201cWe are standing on the shoulders of Jack,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cWe would not be here, Betterment would not exist, without his example with the business he started.\u201dWhen Ramit Sethi won a pile of scholarship money for college, he invested some of it in the stock market. He lost big, so he began to learn.\u201cGoing through Wall Street is like playing a video game on the hardest level,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone is out to get you, and you don\u2019t even understand it.\u201dHe soon stumbled on the writings and speeches of Mr. Bogle. \u201cHe spoke in a very plain way,\u201d Mr. Sethi said. \u201cAnd it was heresy what he was saying, while having the courage to go up against a multibillion-dollar industry.\u201d\u201cI came out swinging,\u201d he said. It was a New York Times best-seller. And on his book tour, Mr. Bogle received him in his office.Making something simple sounds easy. Turns out it\u2019s not.You consider your options. Listen to counterarguments. Push some edges.She called indexing the financial manifestation of the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s the notion that accepting your fair share of the market\u2019s return over the long run will do you just fine,\u201d she said.But \u201cenough\u201d was also the mark of man who worked for the benefit of others, rather than himself. \u201cWhat is often missed when speaking about Jack\u2019s legacy,\u201d she said, \u201cis the way in which this concept of \u2018enough\u2019 also shaped his outlook on the way to live a life of meaning, rooted in character.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Long Before Alabama, the South Had Sewanee", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe template for Nick Saban\u2019s dominating Crimson Tide teams is easy to see \u2014 if you look back nearly 120 years.Long before Alabama \u2014 and now Clemson \u2014 rose as proud football powers, the 1899 University of the South football team, familiarly known as the Sewanee Tigers, provided a blueprint for Southern college football domination. Alabama and Clemson would surely crush the Tigers, but the copyright for how to dominate an era of college football would probably belong to Sewanee, not Alabama or its opponent in Monday night\u2019s national championship game, Clemson.The Crimson Tide can capture their sixth national title in 10 years with a win over Clemson on Monday in Santa Clara, Calif. Clemson beat Alabama two years ago, and this is the third time the two teams have met for the championship in four years.But Sewanee, Tenn., a small town on the Cumberland Plateau, created the template for the flush, modern, Southern football powerhouse, and it has been used time and again in the past 60 years, reaching its apotheosis at Alabama under Coach Nick Saban. Sewanee was led by one of the first forward thinkers of Southern football, Luke Lea (pronounced LEE), its 22-year-old team manager. The equivalent of an athletic director today, Lea put together a five-game, six-day, 2,300-mile trip by train through the South because he needed money to finance the 1899 team, and barnstorming was the only way to get it.While most college teams were playing four or five games a season, Sewanee played 12. Lea scheduled moneymaking games against the University of Texas and Texas A&M at the front end of the trip and games with Tulane, Louisiana State and the University of Mississippi on the back end.\u201cLuke Lea\u2019s canniness and caginess is what made that program possible,\u201d said Woody Register, a history professor at the University of the South who has researched the 1899 team. \u201cIt connects him to generations of program designers.\u201dLea, who became a United States senator at age 32, is considered the first to come up with the idea of having trainers on road trips to take care of the players and massage their weary legs back into playing shape. He created a team that was a merciless bully: The Tigers were 12-0 and outscored opponents, 322-10. Nonetheless, Norman Jetmundsen Jr., a Birmingham lawyer who is putting together a documentary on the Sewanee team, is certain today\u2019s elite teams would be impressed with the Tigers.\u201cThey played 35 consecutive minutes a half on both sides of the ball with no substitution, and they played with serious injuries,\u201d Jetmundsen said. \u201cThey played five games in six days on that train trip and won them all by shutout. Who wouldn\u2019t be impressed by that?\u201dIn a chapter of a book on the history of Sewanee, Register wrote that the 1899 team \u201cformed part of the university\u2019s heritage.\u201d The professor said that Benjamin Lawton Wiggins, the university\u2019s vice chancellor at the time, in particular, rallied students around the notion that football should be a part of the Southern male\u2019s identity. At the time, the South was desperate for cheer, and Sewanee\u2019s success was seen as a response to the aristocratic Northerners of the day, who thought they owned the game. Football was something Southerners could excel at, especially in the aftermath of defeat in the Civil War and economic depression, said George Rable, an American historian.\u201cThe 1890s were a rough time for the nation economically, but especially for the South,\u201d Rable said. \u201cFootball provided some comfort and sense of achievement.\u201d The Tigers lived by the notion that football players required a roughneck quality and a deep resolve. Jetmundsen said halfback Henry Seibels, who was known as Diddy, suffered a gash on his head in the game with Texas, but continued playing when the wound was covered with quick-setting plaster. Lineman Wild Bill Claiborne played with an eye patch, ostensibly to protect an injury. He would look across at his opponent, gesture to the patch, and declare: \u201cThis is what happened in the last game. Let\u2019s see what happens today.\u201dFullback Ormond Simkins wore heavy knee braces as he battered into the line. His legs were eventually amputated below the knee because of football injuries.When the Southeastern Conference was created in 1932, Sewanee was a charter member, even though its days of being a powerhouse were long over. Inclusion was a tribute to the 1899 Tigers, a team for which Alabama\u2019s Saban is a worthy descendant. Saban was the first coach in the SEC to consistently adopt a season-opening game in a neutral, big city for money and exposure when Alabama played Clemson in Atlanta in 2008. Now, marquee matchups at the start of the season are a regular occurrence across college football. Saban is also the primary fund-raiser for football facilities on campus, which are among the best nationally. He knows what Lea did \u2014 success requires money. \u201cThere is a connection between then and now because there is a significant money element at the center of the sport, and money is an unavoidable element of the game of college football,\u201d Register said. \u201cTo have a mighty program, and be the champions of the South, which was their real aspiration, that required money.\u201dSaban has been a catalyst for football programs, Clemson among them, to add layers and layers of support staff, more than a century after Sewanee added trainers. And the Crimson Tide (13-0) are as merciless as they come. They outscored opponents by 33.1 points a game this season, the biggest margin in the country. Clemson was second at 30.6. The ghosts of the Sewanee Tigers, nicknamed the Ironmen, would surely approve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kamala Harris Is Hard to Define Politically. Maybe That\u2019s the Point.", "Date": "2019-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeaking Friday night at the 92nd Street Y on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, Ms. Harris covered many bases: her origin story from Oakland to Capitol Hill, what drew her into public life and the importance of voters \u201cseeing themselves\u201d reflected in the nation\u2019s array of leaders. She cited her work to reform the juvenile criminal justice system in California as one of her biggest policy accomplishments. She talked about the necessity for Democrats to work in a bipartisan fashion while standing strong against a White House that many of their voters view as corrupt.\u201cAnything worth fighting for is a fight worth having,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThere is a democracy in place, and if we fight \u2014 maybe we won\u2019t win all the time \u2014 but it will matter.\u201dBut as some audience members noted after her remarks, and voters nationwide may learn soon, almost everything about Ms. Harris is more complex than it appears.Even her race and her life story \u2014 she is often described as one of two African-American women to have served in the Senate \u2014 are more textured in context: She has a Tamil Indian mother and a Jamaican father and spent some of her teenage years in Montreal.Ava Leegant, a surgeon from San Francisco who came to the event skeptical of Ms. Harris\u2019s presidential chances, said she left bullish about her appeal.\u201cI didn\u2019t think someone from California could speak to all parts of the country,\u201d Ms. Leegant said, \u201cbut I was impressed.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my first choice to be my first choice,\u201d said Betsy Kagen, a 33-year-old film editor who attended the talk.Longtime strategists and admirers of Ms. Harris believe she is well positioned to create electoral coalitions among Democrats desperate to beat Mr. Trump, partly because she is not tethered to any one of the divergent and sometimes warring factions of the party. On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Friday morning, Ms. Harris was asked, \u201cWhy would you want to be president?\u201d and responded by citing the need for leaders who have a \u201cvision of our country in which everyone can see themselves.\u201d\u201cHer message of unity, that\u2019s the key,\u201d said Valoree Celona, a 50-year-old insurance executive who came to the 92nd Street Y with friends. \u201cIf she can get people to have that hope again, that\u2019s what\u2019s important. That\u2019s what President Obama did.\u201dBut Ms. Harris would also need to grapple with Democratic rivals who are more ideologically liberal and may try to move the debate to the left in ways that could force difficult choices for her.\u201cWe need change,\u201d Ms. Warren said at multiple stops during her Iowa trip. \u201cAnd not just one statute here or one law there. We need big structural change.\u201dRebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant based in New York who is not working for a 2020 candidate, said she believes that women and nonwhite candidates are scrutinized more than white male politicians, yet hopes that Ms. Harris will embrace bold ideas and tell more of her personal story even if it seems risky. Mo Elleithee, the former spokesman of the Democratic National Committee who now leads Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said that much of the country is still unaware of Ms. Harris, and that she has time to refine a national narrative that resonates with many groups of Democrats.In the memoir, which was released simultaneously with a children\u2019s book by Ms. Harris called \u201cSuperheroes Are Everywhere,\u201d she repeatedly writes that she does not believe in \u201cfalse choices.\u201d This can mean both meaningful workers\u2019 rights and a strong economy, she writes at one point, but she also applies the concept to police accountability and public safety.\u201cI know how hard it is for the officers\u2019 families, who have to wonder if the person they love will be coming home at the end of each shift,\u201d Ms. Harris writes. \u201cI also know this: It is a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability. I am for both. Most people I know are for both. Let\u2019s speak some truth about that, too.\u201dSean Clegg, a longtime political adviser who is expected to play a senior role in any presidential campaign from Ms. Harris, said that if she ran she would discuss issues like income inequality, but that the message would be coupled with a call for partisan healing.Paul Berkman, a 72-year-old New Yorker who attended the book talk, said he wished Ms. Harris talked about more policy ideas during her conversation, which was moderated by the poet Cleo Wade. Mr. Berkman said he left not knowing her answer to the \u201cwhy-are-you-running-for-president\u201d question every candidate faces.\u201cShe seems like a likable person, but there\u2019s so many candidates \u2014 I want someone to verbalize why it should be them,\u201d he said.Sarah Weiss, a 33-year-old book editor, said she was disappointed by Ms. Harris\u2019s talk, especially after the heavy policy focus of Ms. Warren\u2019s trip to Iowa.\u201cMy concern is that she\u2019s not liberal enough, and she talks in clich\u00e9s that are kind of meaningless,\u201d Ms. Weiss said of Ms. Harris. \u201cShe keeps saying there\u2019s more that connects us than divides us, but at this time in politics, it seems like that\u2019s not enough.\u201dAt that point her friend Rachel Steinberg chimed in: \u201cShe is not running for president yet! She doesn\u2019t need a platform.\u201dThey agreed to disagree.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Poland Arrests 2, Including Huawei Employee, Accused of Spying for China", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The Polish authorities arrested two people, including a Chinese employee of the telecommunications giant Huawei, and charged them with spying for Beijing, officials said on Friday, as the United States and its allies move to restrict the use of Chinese technology because of concerns that it is being used for espionage.The arrest of the Huawei employee is almost certain to escalate tensions between Western countries and China over the company, which the authorities in the United States have accused of acting as an arm of the Chinese government and making equipment designed for spying.Other countries face the same dilemma. In December, Japan barred Huawei from obtaining government contracts, and Australia and New Zealand have taken steps to block the company from being involved in the building of 5G networks in those countries. And the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency recently restated its long-standing warnings about Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese telecommunications company.\u201cPicking sides may be unavoidable,\u201d said Lukasz Olejnik, a research associate at the Center for Technology and Global Affairs at Oxford University, which studies the impact of technology on international relations. \u201cThis is a difficult policy conundrum.\u201dHuawei has long denied spying for the Chinese government. On Friday, a spokesman for the company said it had no comment on the arrest in Poland and insisted that it \u201ccomplies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries where it operates.\u201dThe second person arrested is an employee of the French telecommunications company Orange, which confirmed that its office had been raided and that the man\u2019s belongings had been seized.\u201cWe are ready to cooperate with the Internal Security Agency and make any information it needs available,\u201d the Orange spokesman, Wojciech Jabczynski, said.Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of Global Times, a state-run, nationalist newspaper in China, took a swipe at Poland on Twitter on Friday, writing: \u201cAnything in Poland that is worthy of stealing for Huawei? Polish national security department flatters itself.\u201dIn another message, he said he had met up with a friend who works at Huawei. \u201cHe said Huawei is facing great difficulties communicating with Western public opinion,\u201d Mr. Hu wrote. \u201cI said Huawei has been trying to distance itself from politics, but it has grown too big that politics is coming to its door. Huawei is innocent.\u201dThe arrested Huawei employee was identified by the authorities only as Weijing W. He was involved in the company\u2019s sales operations in the country, officials said. According to Polish television, Weijing W. graduated from Beijing Foreign Studies University with a degree in Polish studies and once worked at the Chinese Consulate in Gdansk, Poland. He began working for Huawei in 2011.The Orange employee was identified as Piotr D., a Polish citizen and former agent of Poland\u2019s internal security service.Polish law enforcement officers raided the homes and offices of the two men on Tuesday, officials said. The authorities then had to wait two days to obtain arrest warrants, typical for Poland. Officials did not offer details on the alleged crimes, but said the men would be held for three months while the investigation continued. Both have pleaded not guilty and have refused to answer questions, the Polish state television broadcaster, TVP, reported.The senior Western diplomat briefed on the investigation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, would not describe the level of cooperation between Poland and the United States. The official also declined to discuss specifics of the case or evidence that may have been shared with the Polish government.But the official said the threat posed by Huawei was a high priority for American officials throughout Europe.Huawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former People\u2019s Liberation Army engineer. The company\u2019s equipment is the backbone of mobile networks around the world, and its smartphones are popular in Europe and China. Huawei has grown into China\u2019s largest maker of telecom equipment, generating more than $90 billion in revenue in 2017.The company has been a leading contender to design 5G networks in Europe and other parts of the world, but the security concerns of Western countries have repeatedly hampered its expansion plans.For many years, the United States, where large mobile carriers such as AT&T have avoided using Huawei equipment in their networks, has presented the biggest obstacles to the company.Telecommunication companies in Europe have strong relationships with Huawei. Deutsche Telekom said in December that it had begun testing a 5G network in Poland using Huawei equipment. Mr. Jabczynski, the Orange spokesman, said Huawei was the only company in Poland ready to provide equipment that met criteria set by state regulations.Huawei also has around a quarter of the market for smartphones in Poland, according to the technology research firm Canalys. That makes it the country\u2019s second-largest phone seller after Samsung.But the challenges facing Huawei in Europe are mounting.In Poland, at least one of the country\u2019s main mobile carriers has been edging away from the company. The carrier, Play, has long relied on the company as an equipment supplier. And China Development Bank, a state-backed lender, has helped finance Play\u2019s buying of Huawei equipment, according to the website of Lasanoz Finance, an advisory firm that says it worked on the deal. When Play listed its shares on the Warsaw stock exchange in 2017, it said Huawei had provided a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of the equipment on its network.The arrests in Poland promised to generate more concerns about the company, said David Balson, a former official in the British intelligence agency GCHQ who is now the director of intelligence at Ripjar, a threat detection company in London.\u201cThere is no good outcome whether it\u2019s true or not true,\u201d Mr. Balson said. \u201cThere is no good way of spinning it.\u201d\u201cThis will definitely increase tension in Europe,\u201d said Christian Schmidkonz, a professor of Asian-Pacific business studies at the Munich Business School.An earlier version of this article misstated David Balson\u2019s title at Ripjar. He is the company\u2019s director of intelligence, not its chief executive.Adam Satariano reported from London, and Joanna Berendt from Warsaw.

{"Headline": "Los Angeles Teachers\u2019 Strike to End as Deal Is Reached", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deal showed the clout the teachers\u2019 union has with Democrats in power in this city and this state. But union leaders said that what was perhaps more important to them was that the strike had provided an alternate narrative to the school choice movement that grew up around the idea that traditional public schools were factories of failure that needed to be broken up and rethought.The deal includes caps on class sizes, and hiring full-time nurses for every school, as well as a librarian for every middle and high school in the district by the fall of 2020. The union also won a significant concession from the district on standardized tests: Next year a committee will develop a plan to reduce the number of assessments by half. The pro-charter school board agreed to vote on a resolution calling on the state to cap the number of charter schools. Teachers also won a 6 percent pay raise, but that was the same increase proposed by the district before the strike.The contract was ratified by an \u201coverwhelming supermajority\u201d of the roughly 30,000 members of the union, officials said Tuesday evening. Teachers are expected to be back in their classrooms Wednesday morning.\u201cToday is a day full of good news,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti said during a news conference on Tuesday morning at City Hall, as he stood alongside Austin Beutner, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, and Alex Caputo-Pearl, the president of United Teachers Los Angeles. \u201cThis is a good agreement, it is a historic agreement, it gets to lower class sizes, it gets to proper support staff.\u201d\u201cThe strike is painful and had a cost,\u201d the mayor added. \u201cBut there is no question to get here, the strike helped.\u201dThe Los Angeles strike was the eighth major teacher walkout over the past year. A movement that calls itself Red For Ed spread like wildfire from West Virginia to Oklahoma, Arizona and beyond. But the strike in Los Angeles was a union-led one against Democratic leaders who are usually on their side. It also was one of the first to highlight one of the most controversial questions in education: whether charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately managed, hurt traditional schools by competing with them for students and funding. Most charter schools are not unionized.The agreement includes a pledge that the elected school board for the district will vote on a resolution asking the state to \u201cestablish a charter school cap\u201d and create a governor\u2019s committee on charter schools, according to a summary statement released by the union.Mr. Beutner and his allies on the Los Angeles school board have been vocal supporters of charter schools, which they say offer parents more choices. Charter schools have also been championed by prominent business leaders and philanthropists in Los Angeles, including Eli Broad, who backed Mr. Beutner\u2019s selection as superintendent last year.Some of the moves bolster traditional public schools after a long period that put heavy emphasis on creating alternatives to them, and on using students\u2019 standardized test scores to hold schools and teachers accountable.\u201cI see this as a paradigm shift,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who traveled to picket with Los Angeles teachers twice during the strike. \u201cThe elite types who use charters as a force for competition will see this as a big blow. We\u2019re now seeing a mainstream shift toward neighborhood public schools with the goal being: let\u2019s make them work for all kids.\u201dSupporters of charter schools pushed back on the idea of a cap on Tuesday. \u201cPlacing a cap on the growth of charter schools puts the agenda of the education bureaucracy before the needs of public school students, and we cannot stand for that,\u201d said Nina Rees, president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools.Mr. Caputo-Pearl said on Tuesday that the last week had showed an \u201cabsolute groundswell\u201d of support for Los Angeles\u2019s public schools.\u201cWe have seen over the last week something amazing happened,\u201d Mr. Caputo-Pearl said. \u201cWe took on the idea of bargaining for the common good. Public education desperately needs attention.\u201dThe strike drew attention to how California, one of the wealthiest and most liberal states in the country, spends relatively little on its public schools. As they announced the outlines of the deal, Mr. Garcetti, Mr. Beutner and Mr. Caputo-Pearl declined to give specific details on how the district would pay for the changes, but school officials said that they would need more money from local voters and the state.\u201cWe\u2019re spending every nickel we have,\u201d Mr. Beutner said. \u201cIt\u2019s all in for schools. This is the start, not the end.\u201dMany of the changes \u2014 including class-size caps and full-time nurses at every school \u2014 would be phased in over time, officials said. Because those changes would occur over the next three years, the deal essentially punted on the question of how the district would come up with the $403 million needed to pay for the additional staff members. District officials said Tuesday that they expect to propose a local parcel tax in 2020, which would require the approval of two-thirds of voters in the sprawling school district. Mr. Beutner also made it clear that he expected the attention to now turn to Sacramento for increased funding.The state\u2019s chronically constrained school spending is largely attributed to its property tax laws, and especially to Proposition 13, a ballot initiative passed in 1978 that drastically limits tax rates and makes increases difficult to enact. Affluent, fast-growing suburban communities have suffered less under the law than large urban systems like the Los Angeles Unified School District, where declining enrollment and rising costs for pensions and health care have created budget problems year after year.While many educators and local leaders have called the strike a watershed moment for California public schools, it is far from clear whether there is a political willingness to change the statewide property tax laws. The union and district officials are both backing a ballot measure that would increase taxes on commercial, though not residential, properties in 2020.The strike settlement is also a significant achievement for the Mr. Garcetti, who has no formal authority over the school system. Though he publicly supported the teachers, he acted as a mediator of sorts and helped broker the deal during days of negotiations at City Hall. Before the strike, Mr. Garcetti had largely shied away from involvement with the public schools, but with the national spotlight on the strike and the mayor considering a presidential bid in 2020, he appeared eager to get involved during the past week.With fewer than half the district\u2019s students attending school during the Los Angeles strike, officials said the walkout had cost the district roughly $125 million in state financing that is distributed based on attendance.Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Dana Goldstein from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Gets Red Carpet Treatment in Serbia, a Fulcrum Once More", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 The water in Belgrade\u2019s central fountain was lit Russian red, ceremonial artillery blasts thundered at the palace, and tens of thousands of Serbs were bused in from around the country to welcome President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday.If the tableau seemed more fitting for the days of kings than a typical state visit, these are no ordinary times for Serbia, which once again finds itself tugged between East and West in ways hauntingly reminiscent of the Cold War.Then, Yugoslavia, with its capital in Belgrade, managed to stay out of the Soviet bloc, though it was nominally aligned with it. Now, amid resurgent competition for political and economic influence in Europe, especially in the Balkans, that strategy seems suddenly relevant.With Serbia seeking to join the European Union without damaging its ties with Moscow, this country on the eastern flank of Europe is in play all over again.And the fulcrum of its balancing act is the president, Aleksandar Vucic, an increasingly authoritarian leader regarded as a chip off Mr. Putin\u2019s block.\u201cIt is extremely unusual, especially in democracies, to have a government organize a massive rally to welcome a foreign dignitary,\u201d said Vuk Jeremic, the leader of the opposition People\u2019s Party, former foreign minister and former president of the United Nations General Assembly.Mr. Vucic, he said, was betting that Western leaders would watch the throngs of people cheering as he embraced the Russian leader in a European capital and \u201cbecome even more tolerant toward his autocratic behavior, in the hope that he doesn\u2019t drop Serbia\u2019s formal commitment to join the E.U.\u201dThat has opened an opportunity for Russia, which sees Serbia as a potentially fruitful investment target, especially to supply natural gas.Mr. Putin has placed heavy public emphasis on new economic agreements, while analysts said he would privately express dismay at Belgrade\u2019s eagerness to join the European Union.At a brief news conference, Mr. Putin committed $1.4 billion to bring additional Russian gas to Serbia, before he paid tribute to the long history of Russian-Serbian relations.\u201cThey have strong, stable and deep roots \u2014 the Russian and Serbian people have always been spiritually close,\u201d Mr. Putin said. Paraphrasing a Serbian expression, he said, \u201cIf we are together, then victory awaits.\u201dFor Moscow, Serbia presents a kindred cultural space anchored in their shared Slavic roots and Eastern Orthodox Christian faith, where it can assert itself at a moment when the European Union is perceived as weak, while keeping NATO at bay.\u201cThe world is becoming more black and white,\u201d said Bosko Jaksic, a political columnist in Belgrade. \u201cAnd I fear when it comes to Serbia, Putin is using Kosovo and gas to export a political model.\u201dIndeed, any future Serbian accession to the European Union, which remains a long way off, will require Serbia to compromise on Kosovo, which Mr. Putin accused of ratcheting up regional tensions.Kosovo, a mostly ethnic Albanian and Muslim territory, broke from Serbia in the 1990s under the wing of a NATO bombing campaign. Russia has never recognized an independent Kosovo, and remains one of Serbia\u2019s staunchest backers.In Serbia, warm feelings for Russia and admiration for Mr. Putin run deep and seem to be growing well beyond the long tradition of strong ties between the military and intelligence services.Mr. Putin was at the top of a list of most-trusted foreign politicians, with the support of 58 percent of respondents, according to a survey conducted by the newspaper Politika in March.Even before he arrived, Mr. Putin seemed to be everywhere. Billboards on the highway welcomed Serbia\u2019s \u201cdear friend.\u201d His face was plastered on T-shirts, mugs, pins and even underwear. As he toured historic sites with Mr. Vucic by his side, the Russian national anthem rang out time and again.In recent years, more than 100 pro-Russian media outlets and nongovernmental organizations have taken root in Serbia, according to the Center for Euro-Atlantic Studies, a Belgrade-based think tank.Jelena Milic, the head of the think tank, termed Moscow\u2019s varied efforts to exert influence \u201cPutin\u2019s orchestra.\u201d\u201cThere is more and more evidence that some members of \u2018Putin\u2019s orchestra\u2019 are financed directly from Moscow,\u201d she wrote.Serbia is a crucial transit point in Russia\u2019s plans to extend its TurkStream pipeline to supply natural gas across southern Europe, a project that has provoked misgivings in the European Union.To highlight the cultural ties, Mr. Putin visited Belgrade\u2019s newly restored Church of St. Sava, one of the world\u2019s largest Orthodox Christian churches, where Russian businessmen underwrote the cost of the gilded mosaic lining the dome.Outside the church, a crowd of 100,000 had been assembled to cheer the leaders. But many had been offered incentives to attend, including five liters of milk. Some reported being threatened by bosses that they would lose their jobs if they did not go.At the news conference, Mr. Putin was asked what he thought about the outpouring and what he would say to the people there.\u201cMy participating in demonstrations is not part of the plans for the visit,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Putin said, smiling. But he added, \u2018\u2018I can say that we have very warm feelings about such manifestations of friendship.\u201dHis killers have never been brought to justice, and the death has become a rallying point for those who accuse Mr. Vucic of creating a climate of fear that fuels political violence.For more than a month, through bitter cold and snow, tens of thousands of Serbs have taken to the streets in protest.\u201cIn our country, we are confronted every day with so many lies and threats,\u201d said one of the organizers, Jelena Anasonovic, 24. \u201cI think democracy, true democracy, is something you need to fight for every day.\u201dBy assembling a sprawling crowd of his own, Mr. Vucic, who has been dismissive of the protests, sought to demonstrate his support at home.For the international audience, Mr. Vucic had a different goal.Mr. Jaksic, the political columnist, said Kosovo is at the heart of the balancing act Mr. Vucic is trying to pull off.Even if Mr. Vucic managed to achieve lasting peace with Kosovo, Mr. Jaksic said, it might be at the expense of Serbia\u2019s democracy.\u201cI am against Mr. Vucic because of his authoritarian model,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is always talking about my big friend Putin, my big friend Orban, my big friend Erdogan. You can judge him by his friends.\u201dBut to go forward, Mr. Vucic would surely need at least the tacit approval of Mr. Putin.If Russia were to sign off on the still-undefined plan, observers say it would likely come at a price. For instance, Russia could use it as a pretext to argue for recognition of Crimea as a Russian province.But the vast majority of Serbs, some 70 percent according to recent polls, reject any compromise over Kosovo.Dejan Garic, 43, was doing a brisk business selling Putin-themed items at his kiosk near Kalemegdan, the ancient fortress situated on a hill overlooking the point where the Sava and Danube rivers meet.\u201cPutin does not recognize Kosovo, and that is very import for us,\u201d he said. A former soldier who fought in the war, Mr. Garic recalled that \u201cRussians were the only ones helping us.\u201dHe is from southern Kosovo and believed that one day his hometown would be made a part of Serbia again.One shirt he sold seemed to sum up the popular feeling. Mr. Putin was pictured wearing aviator sunglasses, with a message written in both Serbian and Russian.\u201cKosovo is Serbia,\u201d it said. \u201cCrimea is Russia.\u201dMarc Santora reported from Belgrade, and Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow.Advertisement"}

Seyoum, the manager of the Esprinto Caf\u00e9, marched over to the cash register and printed out the morning\u2019s sales.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said, holding up a drooping receipt.He had done $52.71 of business in five hours, miserable even for January.\u201cNot even enough to pay her,\u201d Mr. Seyoum said, motioning to the cashier, a young woman leaning on the counter and playing gin rummy on her phone.He added: \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost city \u2014 totally dead.\u201dAs the country nears the end of its third week of a government shutdown, the consequences of Washington\u2019s political dysfunction are landing right on the city\u2019s doorstep. The Washington metro area is home to the largest number of federal workers in the country, and as their paychecks begin to stop, the negative effects threaten to spread across the region.This is an unusual problem for a region that boasts one of the country\u2019s richest, strongest economies, powered by government spending and a large, stable federal work force.It is a place that lives on the legions of lobbyists and lawyers who knock on the doors of government. At the core is a federal work force divided between those at the upper echelons of the Civil Service making six-figure salaries, and those making less pay in lower-ranking jobs. The Washington area\u2019s African-American population has traditionally been one of the chief beneficiaries of the government\u2019s large pool of middle-class jobs.And those who are the most affected are people at the lower end of the income ladder with no savings and no way to make up the loss.The metro area has about 360,000 federal workers, representing 11.5 percent of the region\u2019s full-time work force, according to Stephen Fuller, an economist at George Mason University who focuses on the Washington area. Of that group, about 145,000 have been furloughed, he said. This does not account for the many federal contractors whose pay is dependent on the government and who, unlike those in the Civil Service, do not expect any back pay.Mr. Fuller said that as long as the shutdown ended before February, the economic effect on the overall region would be minimal \u2014 about 2.8 percent of the region\u2019s economic daily output. Still, the longer the shutdown went on, the higher chance it would cause more lasting damage, he said.When other parts of the country suffered during the Great Recession, the area around the nation\u2019s capital boomed. Over the last decade, a wave of new restaurants, bars and retailers have opened, catering to young professionals. But some of the small businesses that have sprung up in recent years are now feeling the brunt of the shutdown.As lawmakers in Washington continue their debate over the shutdown, their constituents across the country are feeling the effects.Abu Ahamed, a Bangladeshi-American food truck owner parked near the National Portrait Gallery, said that his sales had plummeted and that he had taken the emergency step of offering passers-by free samples.\u201cSample?\u201d he shouted, holding a piece of lamb kebab on a toothpick toward a woman walking by, who smiled but did not stop.He said he had made about $50 on Saturday and $172 on Sunday, tiny fractions of what he usually earned, and was worried he would not be able to pay his rent if the shutdown kept going. He applied for a job with his old employer, CVS, and was told he would hear back in two weeks.\u201cI said, \u2018I need the job right now!\u2019\u201d he said, his head poking out the window of his green truck.At home, when he explained the family\u2019s situation to his 10-year-old daughter, he could tell she was troubled.\u201cI said, \u2018Do you have enough for the lunch?\u2019 and she told me, \u2018But Daddy, you don\u2019t have any money!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think she feels hunger but she doesn\u2019t tell us. As a father, this is very painful.\u201dThe shutdown is already beginning to test the operations of the city of Washington itself, which has historically never had full autonomy from Congress and depends on the federal government for basic functions like its local court system. Large sections of the city\u2019s public spaces \u2014 from the National Mall to the 1,700-acre Rock Creek Park \u2014 are on federal land.\u201cIt seems pretty ridiculous,\u201d said Mayor Muriel Bowser of the closing. She noted in a telephone interview that the city was spending around $70,000 a week to pick up federal trash and had added overtime hours for the department that processes unemployment claims, but was powerless against the bigger problem.\u201cWe can do nothing about people\u2019s anxiety,\u201d she said, noting that for many federal workers, Friday would be the first day without a paycheck.With federal workers at home, and the closing of the Smithsonian museums resulting in fewer tourists, the streets had the lonely feel of a public holiday. Lunch places had no lines. The area\u2019s Metro transit system had plenty of seats.For Dick Lehimdjian, who owns a salon on F Street NW whose sales had not dipped, the empty city meant one thing: His 45-minute commute from Virginia was now just 15 minutes.\u201cIt is wonderful to come to work,\u201d he said, smiling.But Trang Mai, who was setting up her ice cream and hot dog truck across from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday morning, had seen a plunge in her sales. Ms. Mai said she was so distracted that she initially forgot her son\u2019s 10th birthday.\u201cI\u2019m tired, really I\u2019m tired,\u201d she said. She tried to sell her truck online, but so far has had no bidders. She said she told her husband to sell their house in Annandale, Va., because they could no longer afford the payments.\u201cYou want it?\u201d she asked, hopefully.The area\u2019s counties, including Loudoun, Fairfax and Arlington in Virginia, rank among the country\u2019s wealthiest by median income. In Arlington County, where 21 percent of the residents are federal workers, Ari Valdez, general manager of The Liberty Tavern, said that when the shutdown first began, there was a spike in sales.\u201cPeople were happy they didn\u2019t have to go back to work for a while,\u201d he said.But since then, sales have slowed, with one exception: Happy hour. People are coming in earlier and staying longer, but often not having dinner.The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected.\u201cIt\u2019s increasing happy hour and decreasing dinner,\u201d he said.He said he had moved happy hour earlier to 3 p.m. from 4 p.m. for anyone showing government identification, and that people were coming in as early as 2 p.m.On Tuesday, one of those was Nina Prasad, a federal contractor who was sitting with her laptop at the bar, a manhattan cocktail to her right and an octopus salad to her left. She said she was still working and being paid, but that many of her calls had been canceled and her office was closed.\u201cIt puts a stop on things,\u201d said Ms. Prasad, 38, adding, \u201cI\u2019m starting to lose track of the days. Time is passing so slowly.\u201dMany federal workers said they had savings and could manage, at least for now. Ken Kero-Mentz, a Foreign Service officer with the State Department who has been posted in Iraq, Germany, Brazil and Sri Lanka, said his first day without pay would be next Wednesday.\u201cThat\u2019s when it will really be like, \u2018Whoa,\u2019\u201d he said.Mr. Kero-Mentz, 48, said he had been taking care of tasks he never had time for. He posted pictures of furniture in his attic he has long wanted to get rid of, and now has a bit of extra cash from selling two end tables. Tomorrow, someone is coming to look at a desk.He wasn\u2019t worried about his finances, yet.\u201cI\u2019m fortunate \u2014 I\u2019ve been able to save some money,\u201d Mr. Kero-Mentz said. \u201cI\u2019m not suffering.

Also in the meeting were Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. and the country\u2019s economic managers.\u201cThe Philippine Navy suggested that, why not the Philippines take over so that we\u2019ll have a naval base there?\u201d he told foreign correspondents on Thursday, recounting his conversation with the president. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have shipbuilding capabilities.\u201dThe government owns the site and leases it out, and the defense secretary said that American, Australian, Japanese and South Korean companies had also expressed interest.

Carpio of the Philippine Supreme Court, an outspoken critic of Mr. Duterte\u2019s China-friendly stance, is among the officials who have publicly warned against a Chinese presence in Subic Bay.\u201cWhy would we allow the Chinese to get a foothold in Subic when they are trying to seize the West Philippine Sea just across?\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dMr. Lorenzana, the defense secretary, said the shipyard could be used to help the country build up its naval forces. The Philippine Navy hopes to buy 20 ships in the next decade, he said, and the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries have pending orders for vessels.\u201cSo I think there is enough jobs for this shipyard for the Philippines,\u201d Mr. Lorenzana said, who is seen as among the officials in Mr. Duterte\u2019s cabinet who have been wary of the Chinese military buildup in the region.The government could take over the yard completely, he said, or lease a majority stake to someone else while keeping a minority share.\u201cThat way we can also have control,\u201d Mr. Lorenzana said, adding that the government\u2019s finance department was still studying his ideas.The South China Sea has emerged as the \u201cmost critical\u201d security challenge for the Philippines, Mr. Lorenzana said.\u201cChina, our big next door neighbor, has occupied and militarized some features close to our shores,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to emphasize that the Philippines continues to view the arbitral tribunal ruling as valid and legitimate.

In response, the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions and the prominent civil society leader Pastor Evan Mawarire called for a three-day strike starting Monday against the increasing fuel price and worsening economic conditions.Zimbabweans, particularly the urban poor, who have been most affected by the state violence following the strike, are very angry with Mr. Mnangagwa\u2019s management of the economy. After 37 years of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s rule, the new Zimbabwean president did inherit an economy debilitated by huge government debts, a serious currency shortage, widespread unemployment and broken infrastructure. Mr. Ncube also proposed reducing the number of civil servants and privatization of loss-making parastatals, which reminded many Zimbabweans of the disastrous economic structural adjustment program of the 1990s. It led to a 25 percent reduction in the Civil Service, withdrawal of subsidies, commercialization and privatization of several state-owned companies, and introduction of user-fees in the health and education sectors, among other measures.Over the past few months it has been increasingly common to hear people comment that \u201cMugabe was better.\u201d That debatable statement is a reflection of the intense discontent and disappointment among a people who were desperate for change. At their most cynical, some Zimbabweans might have hoped that military-backed Mr. Mnangagwa would be the kind of \u201cdecisive benevolent dictator\u201d that the economist Dambisa Moyo has argued African countries need. But even the false hope that Mr. Mnangagwa might improve the economy while he takes away democratic freedoms has been shattered. His military regime has not only closed Zimbabwe for business but also violently shut down any chance for meaningful civic engagement.Panashe Chigumadzi is the author of \u201cThese Bones Will Rise Again,\u201d a book about the coup that deposed Robert Mugabe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Reform Path Led to China\u2019s Entry Into the World Trade Organization", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementSharePascal Lamy sees challenges ahead but believes world can avoid descent into protectionism.Pascal Lamy, former director-general of the World Trade Organization, said he believes China\u2019s reform and opening-up was a major turning point in world history.The 71-year-old also said there is an increasing understanding of the initiative that was launched by Deng Xiaoping 40 years ago at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing.\u201cThe West regards this as a major shift, and we know that in Chinese history we\u2019ve had periods of opening and periods of closing, and I think that was a real shift,\u201d he said.Lamy, who helped negotiate China\u2019s entry into the WTO in 2001 \uff0d a landmark event in the country\u2019s opening-up journey \uff0d was speaking at the China Europe International Business School, or CEIBS, in Shanghai, where he was recently made a distinguished professor.He said the events in 1978 did not completely register at the time, as he was in his early 30s and not working in international affairs.\u201cI was a young French civil servant, not connected at all with global and commercial issues,\u201d he said.Eight years later, Lamy was brought right into the China development story when he made his first visit to the country as chief of staff for Jacques Delors, then president of the European Commission.On that visit, he met with Deng in Beijing\u2019s Great Hall of the People.\u201cIt created quite an impression for a young guy like myself. He was smoking a lot and very witty,\u201d he said. \u201cHe (Delors) was meeting Deng, and I was attending the meeting. It was then I started to take a broader look at the world.\u201dLamy, who in the late 1990s and early 2000s served as trade commissioner for the European Commission in Brussels, was to be an important player in the talks that led to China joining the WTO.He negotiated directly with the country\u2019s premier, Zhu Rongji, and its trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, to set terms for China\u2019s entry.\u201cIt was a very lengthy process because, like with all trade negotiations, they are very complex,\u201d Lamy said, adding that Zhu \u201chad to create a very careful balance\u201d between those whose arms he needed to twist to open up more and those who resisted.Lamy said there were two key issues to resolve during the lengthy negotiations.\u201cThe biggest questions were market access \uff0d China had to open its markets on goods, agriculture, industry and, to some extent, services. Although there was a bit less emphasis on the latter,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then there was the issue of China abiding by WTO rules on intellectual property. Market access and IP protection were the two big wins for China\u2019s trade partners.\u201dAlthough China\u2019s economic progress after 1978 was already impressive by the time of the negotiations, Lamy said there was no sense that the momentum would continue for the country to become the world\u2019s second-largest economy within a decade of entry.\u201cThose who had the long view knew that China was developing fast; the growth performance was already impressive. Probably few thought it was sustainable, but it has proved to be so,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the major achievement of the Chinese system. China growing at 6 to 6.5 percent now (given the size of the economy), means much more than it growing at double-digit rates at the time (of entry).\u201dIn addition to taking part in the negotiations for China\u2019s entry into the WTO, Lamy served as the organization\u2019s director-general from 2005 to 2013.The WTO and China now face a number of challenges, with United States President Donald Trump bypassing the organization\u2019s rules-based framework by imposing tariffs on China and other countries.\u201cWe all know that his tariffs are not WTO compliant,\u201d Lamy said. \u201cThere is uncertainty on whether Trump is after improving the trade regime or whether he is about getting rid of the trade regime. If he\u2019s about getting rid of the WTO and about removing multilateralism and moving to bilateralism, then I am quite convinced the European Union, Japan and China will not play his game.\u201dLamy is a fervent believer in preserving the rules-based order for all.\u201cThis is why plan A is to keep everyone within the tent because there is a common interest in subscribing to this collective insurance policy against protectionism,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the U.S. believe they can do without a collective insurance policy, then the others will have to move to plan B, which is to look at how a system without the U.S. could work.\u201dHe said it is not inconceivable that the WTO could operate without the world\u2019s largest economy.\u201cFor the moment, it is the big economy in the system, but it depends on whether you believe at the end of the day that having a collective system, a multilateral cooperation system is the right way to go. I think the EU, Japan, India, China and Africa believe this is so,\u201d he said.Lamy also said that the U.S. side\u2019s claims that its trade deficit with China is depriving American workers of jobs does not hold water.\u201cIf it is a question of bringing back jobs to the U.S., it is already near full employment, so it must not be that relevant. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The U.S. have had a trade deficit for a very long time, and I think most economies on this planet would agree that this has nothing to do with trade,\u201d he said.\u201cThe U.S. have a trade deficit because U.S. consumers consume more and save less than the rest of the planet. And as long as the U.S. benefit from this formidable privilege of having the dollar, they don\u2019t have a problem financing the deficit. If they had a problem financing the deficit, it might be an issue. It is not an issue.\u201dLamy insisted that if the U.S. tried to somehow remove China from its global supply chain, so as to reduce its trade deficit with the country, it would just create new deficits with other countries.\u201c(All this) is not a question of a U.S.-China trade deficit. Assuming Trump reduces the U.S.-China trade deficit, but increases the U.S.-Vietnam or the U.S.-Thailand deficit, that will not change anything seriously,\u201d he said.The G20 summit which concluded in December 2018 in Buenos Aires, however, called for reform of the multilateral system because it was \u201cfalling short of its objectives\u201d.Lamy has consistently called for WTO reform, even while head of the organization, but he argues that the central issues are complex.\u201cAgreeing on WTO reform is one thing, but agreeing on what you should put in that box called reform is another,\u201d he said. \u201cChina has to compromise in some areas, the U.S. will have to compromise on others. What the EU and, to some extent, Japan are trying to do for the moment is talk to the U.S., talk to China, so at the end of the day everybody is around the same table.\u201dDespite the current trade turbulence, Lamy said he does not believe the world will descend into 1930s style protectionism.\u201cWe have reached the stage of globalization which makes deglobalization extremely unlikely. Globalization exists because it is efficient. Deglobalization would be inefficient. Part of the Western population believes globalization hasn\u2019t worked for them. Does this mean that deglobalization is the way? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.Lamy, who makes three or four trips to China each year, said he was delighted to take up his role as distinguished professor at CEIBS, where he will work on projects fostering greater understanding between China and Europe during his three-year tenure. Other holders of the title include former French prime ministers Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Dominique de Villepin, and renowned economist Wu Jinglian.\u201cThis was one of the reasons I accepted the role,\u201d Lamy said. \u201cI am also not too arrogant to think that as well as teaching young students and the faculty I can still learn something every day. Teaching is a good way to learn and interact with these Chinese people. So it is a good trade-off for me.\u201dAs for reform and opening-up, Lamy said he believes China still faces challenges, particularly in the opening of its financial sector, which was particularly problematic for other Asian countries during the financial crisis of the late \u201990s.\u201cA financial system is very fragile and something which needs a lot of care. You have only got to look back to the global financial crisis in the U.S., which contaminated the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cChina can\u2019t manipulate its financial system like it was socks or soy. There are some fragilities in the system that need a cautious approach.\u201dAfter 40 years of change, Lamy sometimes finds it hard to reconcile the China he first visited in 1986 with the one today.\u201cIt\u2019s more than a contrast. It is a totally different country. Each time I come here, I find it\u2019s a different country. There is no doubt the main asset of the Chinese success is to do with growth. No other country on this planet has been successful in growing its economy at such speed for such a long time. This is something that is atypical to China.\u201dLamy acknowledged that there remains ongoing debate as to what particular aspects of reform and opening-up have delivered success.\u201cWhether it is because China borrowed Western recipes, as some say, or whether it is because China has remained China with its Chinese characteristics, is an extremely interesting but very open question,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in China.\u201dAndrew MoodyThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}
{"Headline": "116th Congress Updates: House Approves Plan to Reopen Government, but It\u2019s Not Likely to Pass Senate", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 The 116th Congress, with the House in Democratic control, has come to order.\u2022 The House approved legislation to reopen the government.\u2022 The House has begun changing its rules to reflect the Democrats\u2019 new priorities.The House, with its new Democratic majority, passed two bills on Thursday night to reopen the government \u2014 one major spending bill to fund most shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30 and a stop-gap measure to restart the Department of Homeland Security for a few weeks \u2014 without funding for a border wall.But the White House formally notified Congress of the president\u2019s intent to veto the legislation, and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has said he will not put them to a vote without Mr. Trump\u2019s support.The bills both have bipartisan stamps on them. The measure that would fund most of the government was assembled from six spending bills that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with broad support. It passed easily, 241-190, with seven Republicans voting yes. The stopgap measure, which passed 239-192 with a handful of Republicans crossing party lines, is similar to one that passed the Senate in December without dissent.\u2014 Emily CochraneThe House on Thursday night approved the first part of a package of rules changes designed to improve order in the House chamber, ease introduction of bipartisan legislation and recognize the growing diversity among lawmakers. The other two parts are expected to be considered Friday and next week.The measure faced some opposition from the House\u2019s most liberal members, particularly Representatives Ro Khanna of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who objected to the inclusion of so-called pay-as-you-go provision, which requires all new spending to be offset by equal cuts or tax increases. Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio and a prominent critic of Ms. Pelosi, argued that Republicans had not abided by such strictures of fiscal discipline, so Democrats shouldn\u2019t impose a straitjacket on their ambitions. In the end, Mr. Ryan voted yes.\u201cI just don\u2019t think this is the time for us to tie our hands behind our back,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a big issue for me after watching the Republicans erode a lot of these essential investments that we need to make.\u201dBut the inclusion of other provisions, including a rule that would force House lawmakers to be financially liable for discrimination settlements as well as sexual harassment settlements, made it difficult to vote no. The rules changes will also make it easier to raise the government\u2019s statutory borrowing limit by making a boost to the debt ceiling automatic with the passage of an annual budget.The package includes of priorities for Democratic lawmakers and members of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus that helped Ms. Pelosi secure the votes for speaker.It gives lawmakers 72 hours to read any bill before a vote. And it creates a select committee on climate change, a priority for several newly elected representatives. The package also changes traditional rules of decorum on the House floor to allow for religious head gear, a nod to Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, the newly elected Democratic representative who wears a head scarf.\u2014 Emily CochraneRight on schedule, the House gaveled in for the 116th Congress, with Democrats now in control. The name plate wasn\u2019t on the door of the Capitol\u2019s sumptuous speaker\u2019s suite yet, but Ms. Pelosi strode out of the speaker\u2019s office toward the chamber, grandchildren in tow.Lawmakers and their children and grandchildren waved from the well of the House to family members seated in the galleries above. The press section was packed standing-room-only with journalists, and visitors clogged the hallways waiting their turn to go through full-body security scanners and take seats in the balcony overlooking the floor.Tony Bennett, who sang \u201cI left my heart in San Francisco\u201d at a dinner honoring Ms. Pelosi at the Italian embassy Wednesday night, was spotted in the visitors gallery, as was Mickey Hart, former drummer of the Grateful Dead.Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Ms. Pelosi to be speaker, prompting a standing ovation from most of the Democratic side of the House and much of the spectators in the gallery.While some Republicans clapped, few if any stood during the multiple ovations during his glowing introduction of Ms. Pelosi.\u201cHouse Democrats are down with N.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said, using Ms. Pelosi\u2019s initials.Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, received a standing ovation from her colleagues when she nominated Representative Kevin McCarthy to be speaker.Ms. Cheney referenced Mr. McCarthy\u2019s efforts in working to secure border-wall funding \u2014 \u201cyes, Madam Clerk, build the wall\u201d \u2014 in a nod to the ongoing government shutdown, which is at an impasse over the demand to fund the wall at the southwestern border. While Republicans stood, no Democrats acknowledged the remark.Just before 1 p.m., the House began its roll-call vote to elect a new speaker, with each member calling out the name of his or her preferred candidate. Most Democrats were voting for Ms. Pelosi, while most Republicans voted for Mr. McCarthy, but there were defectors on each side.A handful of freshmen Democrats voted for others. Representative Anthony Brindisi voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, while Jason Crow voted for Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, bouncing his baby boy as he spoke, voted for Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois. Representative Jim Cooper, a longtime detractor of Ms. Pelosi, voted \u201cpresent.\u201dRepresentative Ben McAdams of Utah voted for Representative Stephanie Murphy of Florida. Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania voted for Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III. Representative Kathleen Rice of New York, one of the leading anti-Pelosi rebels, voted for Stacey Abrams, the failed Democratic candidate for governor in Georgia.Three freshmen with national security backgrounds, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, voted against her as well. Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey simply voted present.Republicans had their own defectors. Representative Justin Amash voted for Representative Tom Massie of Kentucky.Technically, photos and videos are prohibited on the floor of the house chamber. But that didn\u2019t stop a number of members from documenting the historic vote.Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, posted a video on Twitter of her vote. And Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, could be seen taking a selfie with Ms. Pelosi and a handful of other women members on the Democratic side of the chamber.Ms. Pelosi suffered more than a dozen defections, mainly from freshmen who won their Republican districts in part by pledging to oppose her as speaker.Freshmen who did not vote for Ms. Pelosi: Anthony Brindisi of New York, Jason Crow of Colorado, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Ben McAdams of Utah, Max Rose of New York, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jared Golden of Maine.Defector serving his first full term: Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania.Opponents with more experience in the House: Jim Cooper of Tennessee, Ron Kind of Wisconsin, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Kathleen Rice of New York.The final tally: Ms. Pelosi \u2014 220; Mr. McCarthy \u2014 192; Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio \u2014 5, Representative Cheri Bustos, Democrat of Illinois \u2014 4; Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois \u2014 2; Stacey Abrams of Georgia \u2014 1; Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 1; Representative Marcia Fudge, Democrat of Ohio \u2014 1; Representative Joseph p. Kennedy III, Democrat of Massachusetts \u2014 1; Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia \u2014 1; Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky \u2014 1; Representative Stephanie Murphy, Democrat of Florida \u2014 1; Present \u2014 3.Republicans and their well-financed political arms have for years campaigned against Ms. Pelosi as an out-of-touch, elitist San Francisco liberal, tying every sort of Democratic candidate to her. In 2018, it didn\u2019t work.But with her second election as speaker, the biggest Republican super PAC \u2014 and the one that arguably tried hardest to tie Democratic candidates to Ms. Pelosi \u2014 practically celebrated. The Congressional Leadership Fund put Democrats on notice:\u201cDemocratic candidates spent the last two years promising voters that they\u2019d be different \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t stand for the same old leadership and the same old way of doing business in Washington. Yet with the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them. CLF will make sure voters know that their member of Congress already broke their word, all to support an out-of-touch San Francisco liberal who is desperate to hold on to power.\u201dThe National Republican Congressional Committee blitzed out text messages to voters in 15 districts that flipped from Republican to Democrat, announcing the new Democratic member had voted for Ms. Pelosi after saying he or she wouldn\u2019t. \u201cFight back NOW!\u201dRepublicans appear determined to keep Ms. Pelosi\u2019s speakership \u2014 and the Democratic House \u2014 limited to two years.On the other side of the Capitol, the scene was more subdued as Vice President Mike Pence administered the oath of office to more than 30 new senators, who raised their right hands and signed their names one by one into the public record.\u201cDo you solemnly swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter, so help you God?\u201d Mr. Pence asked each senator.The freshly elected and re-elected senators were young \u2014 the youngest, Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, is 39 \u2014 and old \u2014 the oldest, Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is 85. Several are former members of the House. One, Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, was the Republicans\u2019 presidential nominee in 2012 and has already earned Mr. Trump\u2019s ire for his independent streak.In total, the new class gives Republicans a slightly more durable majority, 53 to 47, in the upper chamber.\u2014 Nicholas FandosEven before she was elected speaker, Ms. Pelosi on Thursday morning started a historic day with a left hook, suggesting that a sitting president could be indicted. She made the comments in an interview with the \u201cToday\u201d show on NBC, when the host, Savannah Guthrie, asked if she agreed that the Justice Department guidelines against indicting a sitting president should be honored by the special counsel, who is investigating whether President Trump\u2019s campaign colluded with Russians seeking to put him in the White House.\u201cI do not think that that is conclusive,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, I do not. I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\u201dFor good measure, she warned her left flank that the House would not move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump, but she did not take impeachment off the table.\u201cWe have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn\u2019t avoid impeachment for a political reason. So we\u2019ll just have to see how it comes.\u201d\u2014 Maggie HabermanMr. Trump claimed on Thursday that the government shutdown, now in its 13th day with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay, was \u201conly because of the 2020 presidential election.\u201dThe House will vote this evening on two bills to reopen the government, one to fund the Department of Homeland Security into February \u2014 but without funding for a border wall, which Mr. Trump demands \u2014 and another to fund the rest of the shuttered departments and agencies through Sept. 30.But with House action coming, Mr. Trump is keeping up blame game.\u2014 Emily CochraneSwearing-in day is a time for lawmakers to make statements about themselves. Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, Ms. Omar, and Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico, did so with their attire.Ms. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress (the other is Ms. Omar), wore her mother\u2019s thobe \u2014 a traditional Palestinian dress \u2014 on the House floor. Her decision attracted attention on Twitter, with a hashtag #TweetYourThobe, encouraging Palestinian women around the country to tweet photos of themselves wearing thobes.Ms. Haaland, who is one of two of the first Native American women to join the House, wore traditional Pueblo dress \u2014 including silver and turquoise jewelry and moccasins.\u2014 Sheryl Gay StolbergShowing her trademark confidence, Ms. Pelosi has already released excerpts from the speech she plans to give when she wins the speaker\u2019s gavel \u2014 assuming she will win an election against the Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. (The Democrats have 235 members to Republicans\u2019 199.)On an incoming freshman class that is historically female and remarkably diverse:\u201cWhen our new Members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed, and our Democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative Freshman Class. Working together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.\u201dOn growing income disparity, as the rich grow richer and the rest struggle to keep afloat:\u201cWe must end that injustice and restore the public\u2019s faith in a better future for themselves and their children. We must be champions of the middle class, and all those who aspire to it \u2014 because the middle class is the backbone of democracy.\u201dOn climate change, an issue that she failed to legislate on the last time she was speaker \u2014 with disastrous political results:\u201cWe must also face the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis \u2014 a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions. The entire Congress must work to put an end to the inaction and denial of science that threaten the planet and the future. This is a public health decision for clean air and clean water; an economic decision for America\u2019s global pre-eminence in green technology; a security decision to keep us safe; and a moral decision to be good stewards of God\u2019s creation.\u201dRepresentative Jim Langevin of Rhode Island, a veteran Democrat and the first quadriplegic elected to Congress, will have the honor of presiding over the first session of the 116th Congress \u2014 and the opening debate over how to reopen the government.In a new House that includes the first two Muslim women, the first two Native American women and a slew of other diversity firsts, Ms. Pelosi turned to the 54-year-old New Englander, who has been in the House since 2001.\u201cAs Speaker, when America marked the 20th anniversary of the landmark, bipartisan Americans with Disabilities Act, it was my honor to implement changes to our institution to make it possible for our colleagues with disabilities to preside over the House,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, announcing her decision. \u201cNow, it is my great honor and joy to build on that progress by selecting Congressman Jim Langevin to serve as the first Speaker Pro Tempore of the new Congress. Together, we are proudly reaffirming a fundamental truth: that in our nation, we respect people for what they can do, not judge them for what they cannot do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Property Brothers Offer Renovation Tips ", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight at HomeDrew and Jonathan Scott, the identical twin stars of the \u201cProperty Brothers\u201d franchise, have built a small empire convincing people to buy fixer uppers.Watch the HGTV show \u201cProperty Brothers\u201d long enough and you can be lulled into believing that with a sledgehammer and enough wide-plank wood flooring, any ugly duckling house could become a dream home in an hour or less.But if you\u2019ve actually lived in a house that needs a face-lift, you probably know that even the simplest project costs far more than you expect, takes forever to finish and is invariably fraught with complications. Jonathan and Drew Scott, the 40-year-old Canadian identical twin stars of \u201cProperty Brothers,\u201d have built a small empire trying to prove to the rest of us that if you take out just the right wall, joy will be yours.I spoke with the Scott brothers by phone to find out what advice they could offer to those of us with aspirations for our homes, but without the good fortune of a TV-ready duo to guide us.To better understand the philosophy of the Scott brothers, consider their flagship show, where each episode follows a standard refrain. The brothers take a happy, but hapless couple to see their dream home, a gorgeous turnkey that checks all the boxes, only to dash their hopes by telling them the obvious: They can\u2019t afford it.And so begins the quest to find a less attractive house, usually one with shag carpeting and wood paneling. With fancy graphics, the brothers show the couple the home\u2019s potential, once contractors take the walls down and install a new kitchen. Their first piece of wisdom for would-be renovators: Not all dated homes make good fixer uppers.\u201cFind a home where the bones work and you\u2019re merely changing things on the inside,\u201d said Jonathan Scott, a contractor and the brother who\u2019s often seen wearing a tool belt and ripping out a gross toilet without ruffling his carefully coifed black hair.But unlike other home improvement TV stars, the Scott brothers are not fans of D.I.Y., even though they began their careers buying and renovating properties while they were still in college. Some projects, like installing a backsplash, are manageable after watching enough YouTube videos, they say. But plans can quickly go awry. \u201cDon\u2019t even take it on unless you know you\u2019re willing to finish it,\u201d Jonathan Scott warned. A contractor will likely get the job done faster and better. \u201cMost people, they don\u2019t value their own time,\u201d said Drew Scott, a real estate broker and the brother who\u2019s usually in a dapper suit walking buyers through the offer process. A failed D.I.Y. project can make a homeowner resent the house \u201cbecause it\u2019s not turning out the way that they wanted,\u201d he said. He recommended starting small, with a project that can be done in a day and that isn\u2019t too disruptive. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an old side table or chair you can refinish,\u201d he said. Well, sure, but that hardly feels like an accomplishment, unless you think of the fuchsia end table as a conversation piece. \u201cIf friends come into your space and they say, \u2018I absolutely love that side table, it\u2019s so unique, where did you get it?\u2019\u201d Jonathan Scott said, you can respond with something like: \u201cOh funny story, I didn\u2019t just buy it at the store.\u201d And then, take it from there.For bigger projects, the Scott brothers wholeheartedly endorse hiring professionals. \u201cCash out refinances were a very popular product in 2018,\u201d said Amy Bonitatibus, the chief marketing and communications officer for Chase Home Lending.Homeowners should choose their projects wisely. And in the Scott brothers\u2019 vision, that often means ripping out some walls. \u201cI can\u2019t stand it when I go into a house that\u2019s listed and they say it\u2019s been renovated, but all they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve ripped out a kitchen and put in brand-new cabinets into the exact same bad layout, then all you have is a cramped, dated layout with your new kitchen,\u201d Jonathan Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth spending the money on opening things professionally so you have a new footprint.\u201dWhile they insist that professionals should lay the floors, they do not hold the same reverence for design experts. Jonathan Scott is usually the one accompanying anxious homeowners to the furniture store, offering advice on sofas and throw pillows. \u201cAll the fancy design terms that you see out there, none of it means anything,\u201d he said. \u201cDesigning is a lot easier than people think. There\u2019s not some secret sauce.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russian Lawyer at Trump Tower Meeting Is Indicted in Another Case. But Why?", "Date": "2019-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe charges stem from a civil asset forfeiture case filed two years ago. Ms. Veselnitskaya is accused of making false statements in that case to thwart a money laundering investigation involving her clients, Prevezon Holdings and its owner, Denis P. Katsyv, an influential Russian businessman. According to the Justice Department, the defendants financed real estate purchases in New York to hide funds as part of a tax evasion scheme.That may sound like a protestation of innocence, but by refusing to come to the United States, she can avoid having to defend herself in court because there is little prospect the Russian government would extradite her.The Justice Department\u2019s decision to indict Ms. Veselnitskaya may be an effort to send a message that the civil asset forfeiture case was tainted by her actions. The United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan has been smarting ever since it hastily settled the case in 2017 for $6 million.During the Prevezon investigation, United States prosecutors had asked the Russian government for help under a mutual legal assistance treaty. The Russian government refused and instead produced a document that purported to exonerate Russian officials and Prevezon, according to the indictment.In a submission to the federal court, Ms. Veselnitskaya stated that information in the document came only from the Russian government.But according to the indictment, Ms. Veselnitskaya secretly worked with a senior Russian prosecutor to draft the document, receiving multiple drafts and helping to write it herself.The document was part of an effort to resist the Justice Department\u2019s request to have the judge enter what is called a summary judgment, which would have established that the money was the proceeds of criminal conduct. The court denied the request of prosecutors, helping her clients prolong the case.Even though the indictment is unlikely to be tried, the obstruction charge is an interesting piece of a much larger puzzle as part of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.Charging her with obstruction of justice could be a step toward raising additional questions about the meeting she had in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman at the time, and serve to undermine her statements about the meeting. By charging her, she would effectively be unavailable as a witness if prosecutors want to pursue other participants in the meeting.But it also raises questions about whether more will come out about her role in the 2016 election, and whether she provided other assistance on behalf of the Russian government. The obstruction of justice indictment may be just the first step in a much broader effort to show the role Russia played in the election and its possible collusion with the Trump campaign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The African Currency at the Center of a European Dispute", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLuigi Di Maio, an Italian deputy prime minister, took aim at President Emmanuel Macron of France this week, laying the blame for migration, a deeply divisive issue in Italy, on Mr. Macron.Citing a French-backed currency known as the C.F.A. franc that is used by 14 nations in western and central Africa, Mr. Di Maio accused France of using the currency to exploit former colonies.But the currency, its history and the issues around it have had little to do with the debate over African migration to Europe until now. So what is the C.F.A. franc and how did it come to be at the center of diplomatic discord?The C.F.A. franc was created in 1945 by France and was pegged to the French currency of the time, the franc.There are now two different versions of the currency: the C.F.A. franc of the West African Economic and Monetary Union, which has eight member countries, and one for the Central African Monetary and Economic Community, which has six. C.F.A. originally stood for \u201cfranc of the French Colonies of Africa.\u201d Later, the two financial systems each renamed the currency to reflect their newfound independence.Both versions of the C.F.A. franc are now pegged to the euro. In return for guaranteeing the currency, France holds 50 percent of the foreign exchange reserves of the C.F.A. franc countries in its treasury.The 14 nations in the monetary unions participate voluntarily, with each country having decided to continue the currency after becoming independent.The use of the C.F.A. franc has been applauded by some people as a stabilizing force, and criticized by others as a tool of neocolonialism that has left countries without control of their own currency.President Idriss D\u00e9by of Chad called for a restructuring of the C.F.A. franc during a 2017 celebration of the country\u2019s independence, and others have echoed his sentiment.\u201cThe C.F.A. franc is the last colonial currency in activity,\u201d Mr. Sylla said, noting that it is a direct holdover of a colonial currency system.France has a great deal of control over the currency \u2014 including a decision to devalue it in 1994 \u2014 and French officials sit on the boards of both the C.F.A. franc unions.Mr. Sylla also pointed out that the foreign exchange reserves held by the French Treasury are being held at a lower interest rate \u2014 0.75 percent \u2014 than France\u2019s own inflation rate, which stands at around 1.6 percent.\u201cIt is as if these African nations are paying French banks to hold their money,\u201d Mr. Sylla said.But supporters of the currency say that the C.F.A. franc has provided stability to fledgling economies, keeping inflation lower than that of other countries in the region and allowing for economic growth.The economies of the C.F.A. franc countries have grown since reforms were implemented in 1994, according to the International Monetary Fund, particularly agricultural sectors in Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Mali.Mr. Di Maio points specifically to the French involvement in the C.F.A. franc zone in Africa as exploiting the continent and driving migration, saying \u201cFrance is one of those countries that by printing money for 14 states prevents development and contributes to the departure of refugees.\u201dBut even among critics of the C.F.A. franc, who say that French involvement in the economy of several African nations potentially restricts growth, there is a consensus that the currency is not a prime cause of mass migration from Africa to Europe.\u201cI would say that there is a small grain of truth in this,\u201d Mr. Sylla, the Senegalese economist, said. \u201cBut at the same time it\u2019s a damaging statement because migration issues involve many other parameters.\u201dMr. Sylla said Italy should also take some responsibility for Europe\u2019s economic relationship with the African nation\u2019s currency. Since the C.F.A. franc has been pegged to the euro since 1999, France is required to consult the European Union on major changes in the arrangement.\u201cNow the C.F.A. franc is under the tutelage of France and the entire European Union, including Italy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Aiming at Trump, Democrats Lay Out Agenda for a Post-Shutdown Congress", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats unveiled on Friday the details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box, tighten ethics and lobbying restrictions and, in a swipe at President Trump, require presidents and candidates for the nation\u2019s highest offices to release their tax returns.Singling out Mr. Trump and his administration, Democrats said that they were making good on promises to voters across the country who vaulted them into the majority with demands to clean up corruption and influence-peddling in Republican-controlled Washington.\u201cOver the last two years, President Trump set the tone from the top of this administration that behaving ethically and complying with the law is optional,\u201d said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have stopped by here to simply say we are better than that.\u201dLittle if any of the bill, named H.R. 1 to underscore its primacy, is likely to become law; in its sprawl and ambition, the measure is less a legislative vehicle than a political platform for the Democrats heading into the 2020 presidential cycle.\u201cThe American people will know that this is an option that the House has given the Senate of the United States and president of the United States to take action in support of the American people,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a news conference detailing the anti-corruption bill.But crosswinds surrounding the rollout showed how hard it will be for Democrats to get traction in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington. The event was at least partially overshadowed by the impasse over the president\u2019s demand for $5 billion to fund a wall along the southwestern border. And the stalemate served as an ominous sign for any hope that the newly empowered Democrats, the Republican-controlled Senate and Mr. Trump can find areas of compromise in the next two years.Democratic leaders view the voting and ethics measure \u2014 named the For the People Act \u2014 as the opening salvo in a two-year campaign to either make law or drive a wedge between Mr. Trump and the voters who supported him.Some of those wedge issues will be driven by different vehicles \u2014 key House committees are expected to soon draft legislation pumping tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and to lower prescription drug prices. They are also already planning quick action on more liberal policy priorities, including legislation mandating universal background checks for gun purchases and a bill stalled in the Senate designed to provide job protections to Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Mr. Trump and his campaign.But the For the People Act, or H.R. 1, remains a centerpiece. At almost 600 pages, the bill is a compendium of liberal proposals to marginalize the influence of money in politics, protect American elections from foreign threats, reduce political partisanship in the elections process and expand voter participation.Leaning on constitutional authority to determine the parameters of House elections, the bill would effectively outlaw the gerrymandering of congressional districts, a practice employed by both Republicans and Democrats to maximize one-party control of individual states by sorting voters into districts according to their politics. Instead, states would be required to form independent commissions to draw districts based on apolitical metrics \u2014 a change that Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, said would give voters \u201ca fair chance to elect the Congress of their choice.\u201d State legislative districts would be unaffected.Seeking to reverse Republicans\u2019 state-level efforts to tighten access to polling places, the legislation mandates that state election officials automatically register eligible citizens to vote and outlaws certain tactics meant to remove voters from the rolls \u2014 provisions that would most likely protect minority voters.\u201cAs the foundation of our system, it must be strengthened and preserved,\u201d said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil-rights leader. \u201cThere are forces trying to make it harder and more difficult for people to participate and we must drown out these forces.\u201dThough it would take a constitutional amendment to limit the amount of money being spent to influence elections, the legislation would ban contributions by corporations substantially owned or controlled by foreigners, and would require nonprofit organizations \u2014 like unions and organizations registered under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code that participate in political activity \u2014 to disclose the identity of donors who contribute more than $10,000. It would also require large digital companies to make public who is purchasing political ads, provisions included in the Honest Ads Act during the last Congress.The legislation would also prohibit coordination between campaigns and outside groups and expand the public financing system for House and presidential candidates. And it would require presidential inaugural committees, which are subject to very little oversight, to publicly account for their expenditures.Directly targeting Mr. Trump, who has broken with decades of precedent by refusing to release his tax returns, the legislation would require presidents, vice presidents and candidates for those offices to make public 10 years of those files.And to clamp down on ethics violations, it would provide funds to beef up Justice Department enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, tighten federal lobbying rules and strengthen the authority of the Office of Government Ethics.House Democrats said they planned to simultaneously pursue legislation intended to restore key enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which the Supreme Court struck down in 2013.Democrats formally introduced the legislation on Thursday, the first day of the new Congress. But it will most likely take more than a month for lawmakers to move the bill to the House floor. One House official said Democrats hoped to have the bill passed by mid-February, if the government can be fully funded.The legislation unites veteran Democratic lawmakers with many of the party\u2019s newest elected members who captured Republican seats by promising to clean up the influence of big-money donors and lobbyists in Congress and the White House. It quickly won praise from advocacy groups focused on limiting money and influence-peddling in politics.But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, called much of it \u201cprobably\u201d unconstitutional. He has been one of the Senate\u2019s fiercest opponents of tightening campaign finance laws and forcing donor disclosures, and has generally opposed federal intervention in elections. After the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the enforcement provisions within the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Mr. McConnell said it was not necessary to offer an alternative.At a Wall Street Journal event in early December, he predicted that the House bill was \u201cnot going to go anywhere in the Senate.\u201dConceding the majority leader\u2019s view could be a death knell for now, Representative John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, who oversaw the drafting of the legislation, predicted that Republicans would lose in the court of public opinion.\u201cIf he wants to ultimately stand with his arms folded between the American people and their democracy, then he should go right ahead,\u201d Mr. Sarbanes said. \u201cBut I think he is going to get knocked over by the sentiment of the country right now.\u201dEmily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

To protect the forest\u2019s birds and wildlife, no pets are allowed in the community, said Anni Eisele, a licensed agent with Seeff Properties, which has the listing. Gardening is strictly indigenous; homeowners choose from 600 approved plants for landscaping.A path from a brick-paved circular driveway leads to the U-shaped house, with the entry hall at one corner. Through sliding glass walls and Mediterranean stack-back shutters, the layout embraces a center lawn, wood decks, a swimming pool and a hot tub. An eight-car garage and a generator are on the lower level.To one side of the entry hall, a dining room, family room and kitchen are artfully divided by partial walls resembling a series of oversized picture frames. The ceiling is vaulted with exposed wood beams and louvered transom windows. Flooring is an oyster-hued tile.\u201cIt is a big, beautiful, open entertainment area,\u201d Ms. Eisele said.Down another wing is a powder room, a guest bedroom with an en suite bath and a playroom opening to a side deck with a built-in trampoline.The main living room has a cocktail bar, a fireplace and a circular staircase leading down to the wine cellar. The living room also steps down to a covered outdoor lounge with multiple skylights and a dining terrace with a barbecue, a pizza oven and a large seating area. The kitchen has wood-grain finish cabinets with white Caesarstone counters. Stainless-steel appliances include a range hood, a Smeg microwave, a warming drawer, eye-level and under-counter ovens, and a five-burner gas cooktop. Glass sliders open to an outdoor breakfast terrace.Beyond the kitchen is a separate scullery for washing dishes, a walk-in pantry and a laundry room. Staff quarters, with a separate entrance into the house, include two bedrooms, a bath and a kitchen/lounge.Three family bedrooms and the master suite, each with laminate wood-paneled floors and an en suite bath, are clustered in a wing at the far end of the house. Each has access to the yard, an AstroTurf soccer practice area, a children\u2019s den, a library, a gym and an atrium. The master suite, opening on two sides to the pool deck, includes a separate office and a dressing room. The master bath has a double-size shower, a free-standing whirlpool tub and a vanity with two sinks.The property is about a 15-minute drive up the coastline from Durban, South Africa\u2019s third-largest city, which is known for its busy ports and extensive beaches. King Shaka International Airport is another 10 miles north.Durban and the north coast is \u201cone of South Africa\u2019s hot spots,\u201d Ms. Eisele said. The market has had \u201ccontinual positive growth\u201d since just before 2000, with \u201can average growth over the past five years of around 8 percent.\u201dIn recent years, the local housing market has remained resilient despite political and economic challenges, Ms. Eisele said, noting that \u201cpeople are flocking to buy over here.\u201d \u201cWe have a fantastic infrastructure, a magnificent climate and a majestic coastline,\u201d Ms. Eisele said.

A three-bedroom beachfront apartment in a well-managed condominium goes for about 4.4 million rand ($305,000), Mr. Testa said.With national elections scheduled in May, Mr. Testa anticipates a busy January for six-month rentals, but expects it \u201cto be quiet\u201d for buyers. \u201cAnother party could become the ruling party,\u201d Mr. Testa said. \u201cPeople are holding off to see what happens.\u201dBeachfront three-bedroom, two-bath apartments with two garage spaces rent for between 25,000 and 40,000 rand ($1,700 to $2,800) a month, depending on condition, Mr. Testa said. Farther from the beach, average rentals are about 20,000 rand ($1,400) monthly.Carol Reynolds, the North Durban area principal of Pam Golding Properties, said buyers are also drawn to Durban and the north coast by \u201cexcellent schools, very little traffic congestion\u201d and proximity to the beach.

{"Headline": "Country Is Playing Leading Role in the Debate Over Climate Change", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareBeijing is a solid supporter of the Paris agreement\u2019s principles.When the United States walked away from the Paris agreement on climate change in 2017, it left China as the most significant player in the debate.The Paris agreement is an accord signed in 2015 within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that sets out a series of goals to deal with global greenhouse gas emissions mitigation and finance, starting in 2020.The goals of the agreement were ambitious, but the text was vague in detail and left some nations wondering if the agreement had any real teeth or whether it favored rich countries.The U.N. Climate Change Conference, which opened in Katowice, Poland, has the task of finalizing the implementation guidelines for the agreement, and China has been a solid supporter of the accord\u2019s principles.Xie Zhenhua, the country\u2019s special representative on climate change affairs, has said it will continue to play a leading role in global efforts.He made the remark on Sept. 14 at a news conference after the three-day Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco in the U.S.During the summit, 10 Chinese philanthropic organizations, foundations and research institutions launched the Global Climate Action Initiative with a view to giving full support to the Chinese government as it acts to honor a series of climate change commitments made by President Xi Jinping.These commitments include making a national contribution to the global effort to curb climate change, promoting South-South cooperation on this, and building a \u201cgreen\u201d Belt and Road Initiative.Chinese society and the international community have been urged to respond actively to climate change and take immediate action to encourage sustainable development in order to achieve a global ecological civilization.Xie said, \u201cChina has overcome enormous difficulties and made enormous contributions (to global climate efforts).\u201dThe country pledged to peak greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030; lower such emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 60 to 65 percent from the 2005 level; increase the share of nonfossil energy in total energy consumption to about 20 percent; and increase the forest stock volume by about 4.5 billion cubic meters from 2005 levels.According to Xie, China has invested more than $127 billion to develop renewable energy, ranking it first in the world in this respect for six consecutive years. Its renewable power installed capacity reached 650 million kilowatts in 2017, accounting for 30 percent of the global total, he said.\u201cChina has made remarkable achievements in renewable energy development. Its new technologies and large-scale manufacturing have greatly reduced the cost, allowing renewable energy sources to compete with traditional energy sources,\u201d he added.In July, alerts were issued as a heat wave affected many areas. Scorching temperatures were recorded in Liaoning, Jilin and Hubei provinces, Chongqing and the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions, Xinhua News Agency reported on July 31.The China Meteorological Administration said July was hotter and wetter than usual.Shanghai had an 11-day heat wave that month, the longest recorded in the city in 145 years, Xinhua reported on July 29. A temperature of 40.9 C was recorded in the city on July 21, the highest since local meteorological records began.For countries such as China, climate change has become a major challenge, especially in urban centers where air pollution has reached critical levels.Nicolas Pechet, a partner at Solidiance, an Asia-focused corporate strategy consulting company in Shanghai, said, \u201cChina\u2019s central government leadership is keenly aware that poor environmental conditions can severely affect social stability and migration of the wealthiest citizens.\u201dThe country\u2019s economy has already entered the new normal, featuring more moderate economic growth, a greater focus on the quality of growth, and a move away from heavy manufacturing, Pechet said.Its industrial sector has underpinned modern economic development, which accounts for more than 70 percent of the country\u2019s energy consumption.The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20) specifies a 15 percent reduction in energy consumption intensity and an 18 percent drop in carbon dioxide emissions intensity, while boosting forest coverage to more than 23 percent of the total land area.\u201cIf these targets are met, China will make significant progress toward its commitments under the Paris agreement on climate change to peak carbon dioxide emissions in 2030 or sooner,\u201d Pechet said.He was speaking shortly after the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivered its direst warning yet on the future of the global climate.In the panel\u2019s report, released on Oct. 8, some of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists warned there are only 12 years for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 C. Beyond this, even half a degree will significantly worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people around the world, they said.The authors of the landmark report said urgent and unprecedented changes are needed to reach the target, adding that this is affordable and feasible even though it lies at the more ambitious end of the Paris agreement that pledges to limit the global temperature rise to between 1.5 C and 2 C.The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 C was approved by the panel at its meeting in Incheon, South Korea, in early October and was one of the major scientific papers being presented at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Katowice from Dec. 2 to 14, where most governments are reviewing the Paris agreement.Charles Bedford, regional managing director for Asia-Pacific with global environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, said, \u201cThe report is a wake-up call and a reminder for everyone on what is at stake if we stick to business as usual.\u201dAs a global leader in tackling climate change, the Chinese government has long been proactive and focused on its targets and commitments, with policies that the country has already moved forward on, he said.Bedford added that China has for many years said it will remain focused on working toward its low-carbon development goals regardless of what other countries such as the United States decide to do.The panel\u2019s report followed the release on Oct. 1 of a study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences warning that economic losses caused by drought could cost China $47 billion a year \uff0d more than double the current estimate \uff0d if global temperatures rise by 1.5 C above the preindustrial baseline.Jiang Tong, lead author of the Chinese study and a researcher with the National Climate Center at the China Meteorological Administration in Beijing, said, \u201cDrought losses have significantly increased in recent years across the globe.\u201dThe Paris agreement proposes to keep the global mean temperature increase to well below 2 C above preindustrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 C, to reduce the related risk and impacts.One area the Chinese government has focused on has been the metals and mining sector, including steel mills, aluminum and copper smelters. In July, it published a three-year \u201cblue sky defense\u201d action plan aimed at improving the country\u2019s air quality.Liu Sifang, a senior consultant with global energy group Wood Mackenzie, said, \u201cThe government is attaching increasing importance to environmental protection.\u201dInspection groups have been sent to different regions to ensure industries are meeting the requirements to reduce pollution, he said, adding, \u201cMore important, stricter regulations have been introduced.\u201dLiu said every major city in China has been assigned targets to reduce pollution \uff0d regardless of the source.A group of leading scientists from China and the United Kingdom launched a groundbreaking report in London on Oct. 17 to show potential worst-case risks of climate change and to encourage politicians to increase mitigation efforts.The 150-page report is the first to highlight some \u201cdisturbing scenarios\u201d of the impact of climate change.Ye Qi, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy at Tsinghua University, said the report is particularly significant \u201cin bringing our attention to what kind of impact climate change will have on our cities, our economy, our lives and our society as a whole\u201d so that people globally can better relate to the importance of mitigation work.The scientists started to work on the report after an agreement between the Chinese and U.K. governments was signed during President Xi\u2019s visit to the U.K. in 2015.The report was due to be presented at the Katowice conference.Bedford, from The Nature Conservancy, said China\u2019s economic growth has been remarkable, but with this comes increased carbon dioxide emissions.\u201cRising sea levels and more extreme weather events such as Typhoon Mangkhut also put its heavily populated coast at risk. And there\u2019s public concern on broader environmental issues such as urban air, water quality and soil pollution,\u201d he said.Typhoon Mangkhut was an extremely powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage in Guam, the Philippines and South China in mid-September.Climate change will put pressure on water sources and increase the risk of droughts in China, which in turn will dramatically affect crops such as rice, Bedford said.\u201cBeing the world\u2019s largest rice producer and consumer, the country has already started to safeguard its food security,\u201d he said.Karl WilsonThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

And it\u2019s how he succeeded in humbling, at least for the now, Qassim Suleimani, the wily commander of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force, which has spearheaded Tehran\u2019s ambitions to make itself a regional hegemon.\u201cWe operated under a certain threshold until two-and-a-half years ago,\u201d Eisenkot explains, referring to Israel\u2019s initial policy of mainly striking weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon. \u201cAnd then we noticed a significant change in Iran\u2019s strategy. Their vision was to have significant influence in Syria by building a force of up to 100,000 Shiite fighters from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq. They built intelligence bases and an air force base within each Syrian air base. And they brought civilians in order to indoctrinate them.\u201dBy 2016, Eisenkot estimates, Suleimani had deployed 3,000 of his men in Syria, along with 8,000 Hezbollah fighters and another 11,000 foreign Shiite troops. The Iranian funds flowing toward the effort amounted to $16 billion over seven years. Israel had long said it would not tolerate an Iranian presence on its border, but at that point Syria had become a place in which other countries\u2019 declaratory red lines seemed easily erased.In January 2017 Eisenkot obtained the government\u2019s unanimous consent for a change in the rules of the game. Israeli attacks became near-daily events. In 2018 alone, the air force dropped a staggering 2,000 bombs. That May, Suleimani attempted to retaliate by launching \u201cmore than 30 rockets toward Israel\u201d (at least 10 more than what has been previously reported). None reached its target. Israeli responded with a furious assault that hit 80 separate Iranian military and Assad regime targets in Syria.Why did Suleimani \u2014 the subtle, determined architect of Iran\u2019s largely successful efforts to entrench itself in Iraq, Yemen, Gaza and Lebanon \u2014 miscalculate? Eisenkot suggests a combination of overconfidence, based on Iran\u2019s success in rescuing Assad\u2019s regime from collapse, and underestimation of Israel\u2019s determination to stop him, based on the West\u2019s history of shrinking in the face of Tehran\u2019s provocations.\u201cHis error was choosing a playground where he is relatively weak,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have complete intelligence superiority in this area. We enjoy complete aerial superiority. We have strong deterrence and we have the justification to act.\u201d\u201cThe force we faced over the last two years was a determined force,\u201d he adds a little scornfully, \u201cbut not very impressive in its capabilities.\u201dEisenkot seems to feel similarly about Hezbollah and its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The group had devised a three-pronged strategy to invade and conquer (even if briefly) at least a part of Israel\u2019s northern Galilee: building factories in Lebanon that could produce precision-guided missiles, excavating attack tunnels under the Israeli border and setting up a second front on the Syrian side of the Golan Heights.So far, the plan has failed. The factories were publicly exposed and the tunnels destroyed. Israel continues to attack Hezbollah positions on the Golan, most recently last month against an intelligence position in the village of Tel el Qudne (also previously unreported).\u201cI can say with confidence that as we speak Hezbollah does not possess accurate [missile] capabilities except for small and negligible ones,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were hoping to have hundreds of missiles in the mid- and long-range.\u201dThat means Hezbollah is unlikely to soon start another war with Israel. Suleimani has pulled his forces back from the border with Israel and withdrawn some altogether. The resumption of U.S. sanctions has also put a squeeze on Iran\u2019s ability to finance its regional adventures. Israel also thought it had won a reprieve of sorts when John Bolton indicated the U.S. would not quickly withdraw from Syria, thereby obstructing Iran\u2019s efforts to build a land bridge to Damascus, though that reversal seems to have been reversed yet again.Iran may now turn elsewhere. \u201cAs we push them in Syria,\u201d Eisenkot says, \u201cthey transfer their efforts to Iraq,\u201d where the U.S. still has thousands of troops. Thanks to Gadi Eisenkot, at least we know the Iranians aren\u2019t invincible.Advertisement"}

The contest is nonpartisan, so there will be no party primaries, and candidates must run under their own party lines \u2014 often hinting at a candidate\u2019s priorities.The field for the Feb. 26 contest is extraordinarily deep.Ms. Mark-Viverito is running on the Fix the M.T.A. line; Michael Blake, a Bronx assemblyman who will appear second on the ballot, is running on the For the People line.Here is the rest of the field, in the preliminary ballot order (although court challenges could change things):3.

Anthony Herbert, Residents First: community activist17. Helal A. Sheikh, Friends Of Helal: a one-time City Council candidateThis is the first election with the new $8 to $1 public financing option approved by voters. Under the new rules, donations from city residents are capped at $1,000 but the city will match the first $250 on an $8 to $1 basis. Candidates can also choose the previous $6 to $1 match on the first $175 with a higher donation limit of $2,550.In order to qualify for matching funds, candidates must raise a minimum of $62,500 in contributions from city residents. A handful of candidates met that threshold in the first filing period, giving them an early leg up.Mr. Blake, 36, the Bronx assemblyman and a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, topped all fund-raisers with close to $302,000 raised. He has $212,000 in cash on hand, according to filings from the Campaign Finance Board. With the $8 to $1 match, Mr. Blake\u2019s campaign said they expect to have raised close to $1 million.Mr. Williams came in second in fund-raising with more than $204,000 in contributions and now has more than $113,000 on hand.Ms. Smalls, 41, a first-time candidate, raised close to $179,000 and has nearly $104,000 on hand. She said she expects to have raised close to $800,000 once matching funds are calculated, placing her third in fund-raising.Mr. Espinal, a city councilman who represents Brooklyn, was the only other candidate to meet the matching funds threshold so far.Mr. Espinal, 34, raised close to $125,000 and has $94,000 in cash. Almost $69,000 in donations were eligible for the match.Ms. Mark-Viverito, 49, has not yet met that threshold; she has just over $50,000 in donations that are eligible to be matched. Political experts said that failing to meet the matching fund-raising threshold for the first filing puts Ms. Mark-Viverito at a slight disadvantage.\u201cThe likelihood is that she will get the match, but the quicker you get there, the quicker the funds are dispersed,\u201d said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant. \u201cThis is not a September primary.\u201dHe added that the petition and fund-raising filings could signal a shift in the race.\u201cThere were two tests: Where you landed on the ballot in a crowded field and how much money you raised,\u201d Mr. Gyory said. \u201cBlake and Smalls did well on both tests and there are now four top tier candidates.\u201dMr. O\u2019Donnell, 57, the Manhattan assemblyman, came close with over $60,000 in donations that count toward the match. He raised almost $90,000 and has almost $65,000 in cash.Mayor Bill de Blasio called the Feb. 26 election earlier this month after former public advocate Letitia James was elected as state attorney general in November. The winner will hold office for only a few months.A primary will then be held in September followed by a general election in November. The winner of that contest will fill the remainder of Ms. James\u2019s term, which runs until the end of 2021.The ballot positions, number of candidates and matching fund totals could shift if candidates challenge the accuracy of one another\u2019s petitions and once the campaign finance board audits donations.Candidates are already focusing on everything from buses and subways to public housing, privacy rights, increasing the minimum wage and improving the quality of life in the city.\u201cI truly believe this election will be won by the candidate that reaches the most people, lets them know there is an election on Feb. 26 and gives them a candidate to vote for,\u201d Ms. Smalls said. \u201cYou have to give people a reason to show up to the polls on a cold February day.\u201dIn a field this deep, some of the lesser-known candidates may have difficulty breaking through, which could lead to some unorthodox campaign moments.He was intercepted and briefly detained by police officers, who perhaps correctly sensed Mr. Chino\u2019s air of unpredictability.\u201cThis is not your regular election,\u201d Mr. Chino said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u201dWith Mr. Chino\u2019s disqualification, his words proved prophetic.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Knows What You Buy. And It\u2019s Building a Big Ad Business From It.", "Date": "2019-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 When a chain of physical therapy centers wanted new patients, it aimed online ads at people near its offices who had bought knee braces recently on Amazon.When a financial services provider wanted to promote its retirement advisory business, it directed ads to people in their 40s and 50s who had recently ordered a personal finance book from Amazon.And when a major credit card company wanted new customers, it targeted people who used cards from other banks on the retail site.The advertisers found those people by using Amazon\u2019s advertising services, which leverage what the company knows better than anyone: consumers\u2019 online buying habits.\u201cAmazon has really straightforward database \u2014 they know what I buy,\u201d said Daniel Knijnik, co-founder of Quartile Digital, an Amazon-focused ad agency that oversaw the ads for the clinics and retirement services. \u201cFor an advertiser, that\u2019s a dream.\u201dAds sold by Amazon, once a limited offering at the company, can now be considered a third major pillar of its business, along with e-commerce and cloud computing. Amazon\u2019s advertising business is worth about $125 billion, more than Nike or IBM, Morgan Stanley estimates. At its core are ads placed on Amazon.com by makers of toilet paper or soap that want to appear near product search results on the site.In addition to knowing what people buy, Amazon also knows where people live, because they provide delivery addresses, and which credit cards they use. It knows how old their children are from their baby registries, and who has a cold, right now, from cough syrup ordered for two-hour delivery. And the company has been expanding a self-service option for ad agencies and brands to take advantage of its data on shoppers.\u201cThat is where the insane scale can happen for the business,\u201d said John Denny, a vice president at CAVU Venture Partners, which invests in consumer brands like Bulletproof coffee and Hippeas chickpea puffs.Many of Amazon\u2019s features are similar to those of Google or Facebook, like offering ways to target users based on their interests, searches and demographics. But Amazon\u2019s ad system can also remove a lot of the guesswork by showing ads to people who have bought the shirts on Amazon.com.Advertisers have long run some targeted campaigns through Amazon\u2019s ad network. Many have done that by working directly with Amazon\u2019s staff, who would place their orders on their behalf. That option has historically been focused on larger brands because it requires a minimum advertising commitment. Over time, Amazon has given more advertisers and their agencies access to the self-service system to run their own targeting campaigns on and off Amazon\u2019s websites, and at a variety of spending levels.Users of the self-service system can choose from hundreds of automated audience segments. Some of Amazon\u2019s targeting capabilities are dependent on shopping behaviors, such as \u201cInternational Market Grocery Shopper\u201d and people who have bought \u201cAcne Treatments\u201d in the past month, or household demographics, such as \u201cPresence of children aged 4-6.\u201d Others are based on the media people consume on Amazon, such as \u201cDenzel Washington Fans\u201d or people who have recently streamed fitness and exercise videos on Amazon. The company declined to comment.Just the Cheese, a brand run by Specialty Cheese Company in Reeseville, Wis., makes crunchy dried cheese bars that have taken off as a low-carb snack. By using algorithms to analyze how Just the Cheese\u2019s search ads performed on Amazon\u2019s site, the ad agency Quartile Digital noticed that people who searched for keto snacks and cauliflower pizza crust, both low-carb diet trends, also bought a lot of cheese bars. So Quartile ran display ads across the web targeting Amazon customers who had bought those two specific product categories. Over three months, Amazon showed the ads on websites more than six million times, which resulted in almost 22,000 clicks and more than 4,000 orders.That 20 percent conversion rate \u2014 a sale to one out of five people who clicked on the ads \u2014 was \u201camazing,\u201d Mr. Knijnik said. \u201cThat is the kind of powerful granularity for building the target audiences that just Amazon can give you.\u201dLike other ad networks, Amazon uses cookies and other technical tools to track customers from its site onto other websites. They let the company know that a person who recently bought a diet book is now reading news on CNN and could be targeted on that site with an ad for a protein bar. Amazon does not tell the advertisers who that user is, but it does serve her ads on the brand\u2019s behalf.\u201cThey want more branding dollars, those TV dollars; that is really part of the reason they launched that advertising attribution data,\u201d said Melissa Burdick, who worked on Amazon\u2019s ad teams before leaving to found Pacvue, which provides tools for brands to optimize Amazon ads.Amazon has slowly been developing ways for brands to target their own customers and shoppers, like other ad networks have offered for a while. Advertisers can upload their own customer lists, which Amazon matches with its database, and then show ads to those customers, or other people Amazon\u2019s algorithms determine are similar.Mr. Denny of CAVU Venture Partners pointed to one of his firm\u2019s investments, One Brands, which sells protein bars on Amazon. The company can retarget customers who looked at the product page for its birthday cake-flavored bars, as well as so-called look-alike audiences that lets One Brands find consumers whose shopping behavior Amazon has determined is similar to people who have bought the bars before.\u201cEarly tests are showing this is insanely powerful,\u201d Mr. Denny said. \u201cThey can do this and nobody else can come close.\u201dSapna Maheshwari contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nathan Glazer, Urban Sociologist and Outspoken Intellectual, Dies at 95", "Date": "2019-01-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNathan Glazer, one of the country\u2019s foremost urban sociologists, who became most closely identified with the circle of disillusioned liberals known as the neoconservatives, died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 95.His daughter, Sarah Glazer Khedouri, confirmed his death.Over more than a half-century, Mr. Glazer threw himself into the middle of heated debates over such contentious issues as race, ethnicity, immigration and education, contributing to a range of professional journals and popular magazines, and writing or editing more than a dozen books. He once said that he held positions often no different from those of many others\u2019, but that he was the one who would go to meetings and speak up.He was also an editor at the magazines Commentary and The Public Interest, and Doubleday Anchor Books. He served on presidential task forces on urban affairs and education, and held teaching positions at Bennington College, Smith College and the University of California, Berkeley. At his death, he was a professor emeritus of sociology and education at Harvard University.A child of Jewish immigrants from Warsaw, Nathan Glazer was born on Feb. 25, 1923, in New York City and spent his early years in East Harlem. His father, Louis, was a garment worker, and his mother, Tilly, was a homemaker. Nathan was the youngest of seven children, and when he was 10, the family, which was crammed into a four-room apartment, moved to the wider spaces of the East Bronx.Mr. Glazer\u2019s interest in urban affairs stemmed directly from personal experience, and his upbringing had an impact on his later ideas. His East Harlem tenement block, dominated by the iron structures of elevated trains, had no trees or green strips. It was, Mr. Glazer once said, a \u201cbad place to live.\u201dOnly a few blocks away was Central Park, where a boy could lose himself in the meadows and woodlands, enjoying a respite from the city\u2019s noise and grime. For Mr. Glazer, the park was a \u201cwonder\u201d of childhood, and in years to come, when some urban planners challenged Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision of a pastoral retreat within a crowded city, he spoke out in Olmsted\u2019s defense.Mr. Glazer arrived at City College in 1940, near the end of the Great Depression and at a time when the all-male, predominantly Jewish student body was largely divided into antagonistic leftist factions \u2014 Stalinist, Trotskyist, Socialist. Having inherited a Socialist, anti-Communist perspective from his trade-unionist father, Mr. Glazer lined up against the Stalinists, joined a radical Zionist organization and edited its newspaper.After graduation, in 1944, he got a job at The Contemporary Jewish Record, soon to become Commentary. Mr. Glazer, who had come out of a \u201cvery narrow world,\u201d as he put it, described his life in the late 1940s and early \u203250s as leaving \u201cthe womb.\u201dIn the presidential election of 1948, he voted for the Socialist Norman Thomas, not the Democrat Harry S. Truman.Two groups of thinkers that have had a lasting impact on American culture had a lasting impact on Mr. Glazer as well. The first was the New York Intellectuals, the collection of writers, gathered around Partisan Review and later The New York Review of Books, who combined leftist politics with modernist aesthetics. The Partisan Review writers Dwight Macdonald and Hannah Arendt were early influences; another contributor to the magazine, the art critic Clement Greenberg, helped get him his first job.\u201cThere was an awful lot of talk,\u201d Mr. Glazer said, but he had always felt that he was something of an outsider, a \u201cjunior member\u201d at these get-togethers, \u201cmore like a hanger-on\u201d than a full participant.He had taken a teaching post at Berkeley in 1963, just as the student rebellions of the 1960s were erupting. Opposed to the growing American military involvement in Vietnam and supportive of social policies designed to help the poor, he initially sympathized with the student protesters. But as they grew more extreme \u2014 \u201cnihilistic\u201d was Mr. Glazer\u2019s word \u2014 he turned away from them and his own leftist past as well. He moved toward what he saw as a hard-won pragmatism but what others saw as a reactive conservatism.It became the most intellectually formidable of the neoconservative publications in the last decades of the 20th century, and one that Mr. Glazer edited with Mr. Kristol from 1973 until its demise in 2005.Mr. Glazer was never an entirely reliable neoconservative. He wasn\u2019t comfortable with the label, and on foreign policy he continued to describe himself as \u201csomewhat left.\u201d If he opposed policies like affirmative action, it was not, as with more traditional conservatives, out of antipathy to government itself, but out of a skepticism about what public programs could accomplish.\u201cOn most areas of public policy,\u201d he said, \u201cI consider myself pragmatic, rather than a man of the left or a man of the right.\u201dAs a social scientist, Mr. Glazer valued hard facts over good intentions. At the same time, he was modest about what the facts could show. A reader of his work was always coming upon phrases like \u201cI am not sure\u201d and \u201cWe do not have the knowledge\u201d and \u201cI do not know.\u201dThis meant that the nonideological Mr. Glazer could change his mind. In his writings on architecture and city planning, for example, he went from early enthusiasm for modernism to a \u201cgrowing disenchantment.\u201d\u201cIn the end,\u201d he said, \u201cthe defense of a radical modernism became the work of an elite that the ordinary person could not understand.\u201dDuring the 1990s Mr. Glazer decided that he had been wrong about the course of integration as set out in \u201cAffirmative Discrimination\u201d \u2014 that he had been complacent about racial progress in America.And once he had concluded that some kind of multiculturalism was necessary for public education, he bowed to what he saw as the inevitable: \u201cEven the most balanced and professional effort to define a curriculum for students in American schools today will place a heavy emphasis on multiplicity and diversity, race and ethnicity.\u201dIn Mr. Glazer\u2019s case, it seemed, a multiculturalist was a neoconservative who had been mugged by reality.Former allies were not pleased. One historian of neoconservatism, writing in 2005, spoke of Mr. Glazer\u2019s \u201cdefection\u201d from the movement.Yet there was an underlying consistency to Mr. Glazer\u2019s political and policy shifts. He had become a pessimist about the effectiveness of government programs and therefore a critic of much social policy. \u201cI know what I\u2019m against,\u201d he said.But he said this more with sorrow than satisfaction. For if his skepticism compelled him to leave most of his radical past behind, he never fully abandoned his youthful concerns about social justice.Late in life he described himself as a \u201cmeliorist,\u201d and in a statement that can stand as his political testament, he declared: \u201cI think you must keep on trying, even if you haven\u2019t had great success. I think everything helps a little.\u201dJulia Jacobs contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consider Firing Your Male Broker", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYears of research show female investors outperform men. But only about 1 in 5 brokers are women.Ms. duQuesnay is an investment adviser.When people picture a financial adviser, they typically think of a gray-haired guy who looks like Bernie Madoff, or perhaps a younger man like Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d The imagined portrait rarely resembles someone like me, a woman. And that underlying perception is fairly accurate.Roughly less than 20 percent of financial advisers are women, a number that has barely budged for the past two decades despite rising gender equity in other fields. But what has this overwhelmingly male work force accomplished?Clare Francis, a director at Barclays Smart Investor, agreed with the researchers, who attributed the difference in performance to women\u2019s judiciousness. \u201cThe stock market is often portrayed as a high-energy, risky environment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this analysis shows that taking a more long-term view about what to invest in, rather than picking eye-catching and potentially more volatile shares, is actually likely to provide a better return on your money.\u201dAs a result, finance in general, and the financial advice field in particular, continues to be viewed as an industry plagued with slick con artists. And it\u2019s a shame because as much as we may trust our best friends and close relatives, we rarely disclose to them that most private and sensitive aspect of our personal information: the state of our money. That discretion is instead placed with your financial adviser, who ideally is one of the good guys (or gals) in your life.He listens first. You can calculate to the penny how much you paid for his services last year. His company adheres to the fiduciary standard of putting clients\u2019 interests first. Your financial plan does not conveniently lean on products that happen to pay him a hefty sales commission. Usually, you\u2019re the one calling back, because he\u2019s anticipating your needs before they arise.While gendering any ability or trait can make people uncomfortable in these forward-thinking times, which sex seems better equipped to help families nurture and protect their nest egg?The gender gap in finance looks increasingly like not only an ethical quandary but also a financial blow to millions of households. And its persistence stems from both explicit historical exclusion and a self-selecting process, in which the crowd most attracted to finance\u2019s clubby reputation pushes hardest to get in, then feels most at ease once there, perpetuating the reality.Two generations ago, when newspapers still ran gender-segregated ads, there were virtually no women on Wall Street aside from the secretaries. But once women were grudgingly welcomed to the business world, Wall Street was not their first choice. Male brokers largely worked for commissions alone \u2014 an \u201ceat what you kill\u201d mentality that did not appeal to women. Instead, professional women gravitated to stable sources of income in fields like law, education or medicine.The public doesn\u2019t perceive brokers as loyal stewards of their clients and neither do enough young women considering career options. First, they\u2019ll need to see it to believe it.Informal mentorship is great, but women need institutional advocacy, not just someone who is willing to grab a cup of coffee and chat.

But Does It Have Ethical Origins?", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut when it comes to a diamond \u2014 quite likely one of the most expensive and emotional purchases a jewelry buyer will ever make \u2014 most know next to nothing about the source of the stone.Tiffany & Company, which sold more than $500 million worth of diamond engagement rings in 2017, is hoping to change that. Beginning Wednesday, it will start a program that will identify for customers the country where their diamond was mined, and, eventually, information on where it was cut, polished and set.The move is part of an effort among jewelers to attract younger shoppers, who may look upon established, venerable stores as stuffy and uncool. They also tend to eschew the hefty baubles their parents preferred for a much more spare style.The issue of sourcing is especially acute with diamonds, which change hands many times from mine to showroom. More buyers are asking for specific evidence that their gems were not produced using child labor or to finance wars or terrorist activity \u2014 the concerns over so-called blood diamonds. So jewelers are starting to work provenance into their marketing, with some even exploring blockchain technology as a way to provide more information about a gem\u2019s origins.But true clarity \u2014 a feature also prized in the gems themselves \u2014 remains elusive. And Tiffany acknowledges that it cannot provide customers with the precise location where a diamond was mined.\u201cA lot of diamond companies are still very opaque about their operations,\u201d said Thomai Serdari, who teaches luxury marketing at New York University. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any particular strict guidelines to ensure that a diamond is truly coming from the area a dealer is claiming it\u2019s coming from.\u201dBut the retailer has fought to attract younger shoppers. Disappointing sales led its chief executive to resign abruptly in 2017, and a new leader, Alessandro Bogliolo, took the role 15 months ago.The company has had several strong quarters since his arrival, but in its most recent earnings report, a critical sales growth measure was less than half what Wall Street had expected. The company\u2019s stock has tumbled 17 percent since the miss in late November; Mr. Bogliolo largely blamed weak spending by Chinese tourists, who have scaled back amid a trade war with the United States and a slowing economy at home.Tiffany hopes to perk up interest in the brand with its program on sourcing. Initially, it will tell customers the country where the diamond came from. In 2020, it will share information about where each diamond was cut, polished and set. Mr. Bogliolo said he hoped to someday be able to provide the name of the mine where it was found, the artisan who shaped its contours and the jeweler who secured it in its setting.\u201cIt\u2019s relevant nowadays for customers,\u201d he said, surrounded by archival sketches and vintage Tiffany jewelry at the company\u2019s headquarters in Manhattan. \u201cCustomers are very educated, mature and demanding.\u201dAlthough the company hopes its information-sharing campaign endears it to younger buyers, the initiative has its limits.Tiffany controls most of the process that readies its diamonds for display cases \u2014 from rough stones that are mapped out on a 3-D scanner by specialists in Belgium, to polishing at in-house workshops in Africa and Asia, to grading and setting at facilities in the United States, where they are marked with an imperceptible serial number.But the company buys its rough diamonds from suppliers with various mines. The country-of-origin information comes from those companies and does not link diamonds to specific mines.Mr. Bogliolo acknowledged that the information it was offering did not tell a diamond\u2019s full story, but said it was not \u201cfair to burden\u201d customers with an excess of detail because they \u201ccannot be specialists of supply chains of all the products they buy.\u201d\u201cThis is just a sign that is meaningful to the consumer, and behind that sign is all the work that is the responsibility of the brand,\u201d he said.The industry is pushing ahead with other efforts to track its supply chain, including blockchain, which could provide a permanent, tamper-proof digital record of a gem\u2019s journey.And in recent years, the Gemological Institute of America has been experimenting with a process that can confirm that a polished diamond was cut from a certain rough stone \u2014 a means of tracing a gem to its country of origin.Tom Moses, the executive vice president of the institute, said it had worked with major retailers and top mining companies to verify the origins of specific gems.Customers, he said, \u201cwant to know it was sourced in an ethical way, so they can feel better about it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Knowing what you are getting into will affect how you live for years to come.The calculator also gives you the option to make voluntary additional loan repayments. If you could save $1,500 over the term of the loan by paying a mere $50 extra per month, would you consider it? Would you pay an additional $150 per month if that meant paying off the loan in 10 years instead of 30? These decisions have a significant effect on the total cost of your loan and how long it will take you to repay it. This is the kind of sensitivity analysis (see Stat Nugget below) you can do with the loan calculator.Maybe because students were trying so many loan structures in the loan calculator, we did not receive many headlines. We\u2019ll be looking for headlines in the responses in the coming days. Use your creativity to create a catchy headline that will draw attention to the effectiveness of the loan calculator.You may want to think critically about these additional questions:\u25a0 Conduct your own sensitivity analysis. There are four inputs that you can vary: loan amount, interest rate, term and voluntary monthly payments. (See Stat Nuggets for explanations.) For federal loans, the interest rate until July 1, 2019 is 5.05% and the term is 10 years. Vary the loan amount or the additional payments to see how the payments are affected.\u25a0 Make a table with the 5.05% interest rate, 10-year term and no additional payments, but vary the loan amount. Include columns for the resulting monthly payments, total loan payments and recommended needed income. Which loan amount seems best for you? Explain your answer.\u25a0 You can make additional voluntary monthly payments to pay off the loan more quickly and thereby pay less interest. Make another table with the loan amount, interest rate and term held constant. Vary the additional payments, possibly an additional $10, $50 and $100 per month. See how the monthly payments, total loan payments and the recommended needed income change. Which additional payment amount seems best for you? Explain your answer.\u25a0 Combine these two analyses. What college loan structure is best for you?\u25a0 Given what you have learned about the costs of college loans, what advice would you give to students taking out college loans?Thank you for participating in \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d, which engages you to think critically about graphs and the underlying data. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Data visualizations, like these graphs, are an important part of statistics. They help us to understand and learn from data.Keep noticing and wondering and college loans. We continue to welcome your responses.________Stat Nuggets for \u201cCollege Loan Calculator?\u201dSENSITIVITY ANALYSISThe purpose of a sensitivity analysis for a mathematical model is to determine which set of input values results in the best or optimal output. Typically, we vary the value for one of the input variables at a time and observe the result. This allows us to determine how sensitive the output is to specific changes in input values. For example, after doing this several times, we can compare the output results. Then we can select the input values of the scenario with the best output, as determined by the analyst.In the college loan calculator, a sensitivity analysis will allow you to compare different college loan structures. You can vary the input variables of loan amount, interest rate, term and additional monthly payment amounts. The output is the total payment, the payoff period and the income needed so that no more than 20 percent of discretionary income is used for loan repayment.LOAN AMOUNT, LOAN PRINCIPAL, and DEBTThe loan amount, also called loan principal or debt, is how much is borrowed. The loan amount of $28,650 is the national average for undergraduate students at public and nonprofit colleges who graduated in 2017 with debt.TERM and PAYOFF PERIODThe term is the number of years the borrower has to repay the loan. The typical term for direct subsidized and unsubsidized loans is 10 years, though the term may be as long as 30 years.Payoff period is the same as the term unless additional, voluntary loan payments are made, in which case the payoff period will be less than the term. For example, if the borrower pays an additional $50 each month on the average $28, 650, 5.05%, 10-year loan, the payoff period will only be 8 years, 3 months.MONTHLY & TOTAL PAYMENTMonthly payments are usually a fixed amount paid monthly to the lender. Total payment is the sum of all monthly payments over the loan\u2019s term. The payments have two components: interest and loan principal. The college loan calculator lists the monthly payment, total (payment), (total) interest, and (total) loan principal. The graph shows the remaining loan amount (original loan principal minus all monthly loan principal payments) and the remaining interest. Notice that as the remaining loan amount decreases with each monthly payment, the interest payments decrease as well because there is less debt upon which interest must be paid.ANNUAL INCOMEAnnual income is earnings from all sources before taxes.DISCRETIONARY INCOMEDiscretionary income is income after taxes and basic expenses including housing, food and transportation. For federal college loans, it is defined as the amount exceeding 150 percent of the federal poverty level for a single person. For the average $28,650, 5.05%, 10-year loan, the borrower should have an annual income in excess of $36,025._________The graphs for \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

It also left a lot of unanswered questions, not least of which was: Why did it feel so anticlimactic?Any lingering questions of your own? Still waiting for that plot-saving twist? Let us know in the comments.For the bulk of the picture, our three key characters \u2014 the superhero David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and the super villains Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) and Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) \u2014 are held at a psychiatric research hospital for observation and testing by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson). She tries to convince them that they\u2019re merely mentally ill, but even so, they\u2019re all dangerous men responsible for assaults and deaths \u2026 so why, as far as we can tell, are all three left in the care of a single orderly for hours at a time? Has the hospital been abandoned? (Staple keeps saying she has only \u201ca few days,\u201d though she never indicates why.) If it has, why, suddenly, are other patients and employees there to herd around during the film\u2019s climax?\u201cUnbreakable\u201d took great pains to establish Dunn\u2019s Kryptonite: He is rendered powerless by water, the result of a near-drowning as a child. (Shyamalan has weakness for water himself; it also kills the aliens in \u201cSigns,\u201d and it incites the action of \u201cLady in the Water.\u201d) So when he finds himself fighting in a swimming pool at the end of \u201cUnbreakable,\u201d or battling the Beast in a giant tank at the end of \u201cGlass,\u201d the stakes are high and the danger is real.Does it not seem a little anticlimactic, then, that he is apparently snuffed out for good when a thug holds his face in a puddle? It\u2019s not even a deep puddle! He\u2019s very strong! Stronger than the guys holding him down!It is especially troubling, then, that \u201cGlass\u201d makes her into a sympathetic shoulder for a man who literally almost ate her \u2014 the good woman who will bring out the best in poor Kevin just as long as he can \u201cstay in the Light.\u201d Casey\u2019s journey was part of what made \u201cSplit\u201d more than just another monster movie. Her regression in \u201cGlass\u201d is an outright betrayal.Although our three marquee stars are wiped out by the end of \u201cGlass,\u201d its concluding scene assures us that their legacy will live on thanks to Mr. Glass, who ingeniously preserved the security camera feed of the events at Raven Hill. And thus, the world will see Kevin (as the Beast) galloping and transforming; they\u2019ll see David bending steel; and they\u2019ll see those evil agents drowning him to death. And those images will change the world!But would they? The videos look like the kinds of manipulated content that pops up on Facebook feeds every day.

{"Headline": "\u2018Black Monday\u2019 Mines \u201980s Excess for Comedy and Commentary", "Date": "2019-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI need my coke, sorry,\u201d Regina Hall said, an oversight that brought an elaborate wedding scene to a halt. Clad in a sequined denim bridesmaid dress and an enormous pink hair bow, Hall chatted with her co-star Don Cheadle as extras milled about and someone ran to fetch her nose candy (actually a mix of comparatively benign powders like B-vitamins and starch). At a cluster of monitors, the showrunners Jordan Cahan and David Caspe pondered whether key bumps were wedding-appropriate, even in the baroquely dissipated world of 1980s Wall Street.\u201cMaybe just a cigarette?\u201d Cahan said, and soon a production assistant was handing Hall a fake cigarette instead of a vial of fake cocaine.These are the sorts of behind-the-scenes decisions that arise on \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d an outrageous new comedy that began Sunday on Showtime, about a ragtag bunch of traders running a long con on the street\u2019s blue-blood establishment. (Think \u201cBad News Bears\u201d meets \u201cTrading Places,\u201d with lifestyle cues borrowed from \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d)Cheadle is Maurice \u201cMo\u201d Monroe, a stock market schemer overseeing the Jammer Group, an underdog firm that includes Hall\u2019s Dawn Towner, the head trader, and Blair Pfaff (Andrew Rannells), a wide-eyed Wharton grad getting a quick and very dirty education in the ethics of high-level finance. (Lesson 1: There aren\u2019t any.)The degenerate staff is rounded out by Horatio Sanz, Yassir Lester and Paul Scheer, whose puffed-up schlub of a trader manifests multiple flavors of self-hatred.The multicultural makeup is the most obvious early sign that \u201cBlack Monday,\u201d which is executive produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (\u201cSuperbad\u201d \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d), is up to more than just filthy jokes. (Though those are definitely core to the enterprise.)In positioning a firm whose racial diversity \u201cwould not have been allowed at that time,\u201d Cheadle said, against cartoonish Wall Street Brahmins \u2014 Ken Marino plays a pair of vapid twins who are supposed to be the Lehman Brothers \u2014 the show aims to satirize the monotone culture of high finance and, by extension, American halls of power.And while the show\u2019s dialogue, especially, is defined by broad vulgarity, beneath that surface is an experiment in skewering a benighted milieu without indulging in the very things that made it appalling.\u201cIt\u2019s a full package that I\u2019ve never quite seen, where there\u2019s that many facets that can all be used together,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cBut it\u2019s extremely funny.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of dramedies,\u201d said Gary Levine, a Showtime president of entertainment. \u201cWe were anxious to have that harder comedy.\u201dCheadle said: \u201cThese guys are joke whores \u2014 they\u2019re always trying to get in as many as they can.\u201d\u201cMy dad told me about leaving work and passing this wave of prostitutes on their way in as he was walking out,\u201d Caspe said. \u201cGuys betting $10,000 on which person across the office is going to go to the bathroom first \u2014 just crazy, crazy [expletive].\u201dShowtime passed on the first version of the show he developed with Cahan (\u201cChampaign ILL\u201d), a friend from childhood. (\u201cThe timing was wrong,\u201d Levine said, noting that \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d had just come out and Showtime had recently debuted the pulpy hedge fund drama \u201cBillions.\u201d)So Caspe submitted \u201cBlack Monday\u201d as a writing sample for another job, where it caught Goldberg\u2019s eye. \u201cI said [expletive] that, let\u2019s make this,\u201d Goldberg recalled.Backed by the powerhouse producers Rogen and Goldberg, the project was revived at Showtime and pitched to Cheadle, who, won over by the story and mash-up of genres, signed on as star and executive producer.\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous and satirical and at times poignant \u2014 we\u2019re walking a line, clearly, and that\u2019s always risky,\u201d he said during a break from shooting. \u201cBut, ultimately, if you\u2019re going to try to do something, let\u2019s try to do it in a new way.\u201dMost of the poignancy, at least in the early episodes, comes from Hall\u2019s character\u2019s struggle to be taken seriously both at her job, where she\u2019s surrounded by misogynists, and at home, where her husband (Kadeem Hardison) and parents want her to stop working and start having babies.\u201cEverything I\u2019m doing, I remember seeing my mom do in the \u201980s,\u201d she said on the set, bow flapping as she emphasized her points. \u201cThey put on pantyhose every day and they did the damn thing.\u201dShe caught her reflection in a nearby mirror. \u201cI forget I have this [expletive] bow on,\u201d she sighed. \u201cThis is not one of Dawn\u2019s best outfits, this bridesmaid debacle.\u201dOther examples include the aforementioned Limbo, the obligatory brick-size cellphones and ample interior design indulgences, like Dawn\u2019s mauve and black lacquer dream of an apartment.Indeed, the guiding philosophy seems to be when in doubt, add more cocaine, even down to the cinematography. Rogen and Goldberg directed the pilot episode, establishing a frenetic visual grammar designed to \u201cfeel like you\u2019re in a room with a lot of people on cocaine, and trying to keep up with what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d Rogen said.\u201cIt\u2019s a thrilling dynamic when the marketing people are blowing your mind instead of making you want to kill yourself,\u201d Goldberg said.Others parallels were trickier, reflecting that whatever the object of its satire, \u201cBlack Monday\u201d will be judged by more modern sensitivities.The series is most interesting when it deals with the day-to-day marginalization of its outsiders: Mo as an African-American CEO; Dawn as an underestimated woman; other characters as closeted gays in a time of shameless homophobia. But as seen in other depictions of the time, like the relentlessly hard-R \u201cWolf of Wall Street,\u201d in practice the difference between parodying a world and indulging in its abuses can be slim to the point of meaninglessness.\u201cIt was a really difficult line to draw, because you want the era to feel authentic, but the last thing you want to do is offend the people the show is about,\u201d Cahan said.So while the pervy traders of \u201cBlack Monday\u201d obsess over strip bars, no actual female nudity appears in the series. A gay slur is uttered early in the season, but it\u2019s used to identify a villain and also spark a character\u2019s growing acceptance of his sexuality.\u201cI won\u2019t know if we walked the line correctly until we see some response to the show,\u201d Caspe said. \u201cWhich is terrifying.\u201d\u201cWhat was nice about \u201980s Wall Street is the world itself is so broad,\u201d he added, \u201cthat we get to do pretty big comedy while still being totally within reality.\u201dAn earlier version of this story described in error the car owned by Don Cheadle\u2019s character in \u201cBlack Monday.\u201d It is known as a \u201cLimbo,\u201d not a \u201cLambo.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sheets separate families from strangers, gentlemen from the ladies.Women cook over an open fire fueled by freshly cut wood because the kitchen in this modest three-bedroom ranch home in the Costa Rican countryside cannot possibly accommodate food preparations for 50 hungry fugitives.This is a secret safe house for Nicaraguan protesters who are trying to avoid capture by the country\u2019s authorities. It was not designed for crowd comfort.Even though the ranch is across an international border, those living here take turns on nightly guard duty, concerned about agents from Nicaragua infiltrating their haven.The woman who runs the refuge, who goes by the pseudonym \u201cthe Godmother,\u201d looked around while a compatriot slammed a machete against a tree stump to cut more firewood.\u201cWe consider our stay here to be temporary,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are tired already. We want to go home.\u201dThe Godmother\u2019s real name is Lisseth Valdivia. She used to own three clothing stores in Matagalpa, a city north of Nicaragua\u2019s capital, Managua. A 39-year-old mother of two, she liked working out at the gym. She rode a new scooter. She was earning a decent living.Many Nicaraguans long viewed Mr. Ortega, in office since 2007, as increasingly dictatorial. But what finally drew masses of demonstrators to the streets were wildly unpopular social security cutbacks.The police and pro-government mobs responded with deadly force, even against unarmed protesters, according to human-rights observers, shooting and killing people across the nation.Ms. Valdivia said she wondered why nobody helped them. First one fell in her neighborhood, then a second. After the third was shot, she hopped on her new moped and came to their assistance herself.Ms. Valdivia spent two months running what she considered a humanitarian command post, administering first aid and providing lunch to protesters who were snarling traffic with improvised road blocks. She learned how to use homemade mortars, she said, although she mostly left the weaponry to the men.Then a relative phoned with a warning: \u201cDon\u2019t even think of coming here. There are about 25 police officers in your house, and they are destroying it.\u201dShe fled and never looked back, leaving behind three shuttered businesses, a house, a car, the scooter \u2014 and, for his own safety, her 7-year-old son, put in the care of his father, who has sided with the government and sometimes sends Ms. Valdivia angry text messages about her allegiances.\u201cFor now, I have to be with my people,\u201d she said, referring to her fellow fugitives. \u201cIn the future, when Nicaragua is free, my son is going to enjoy all of that.\u201dMs. Valdivia now lives with her teenage daughter and dozens of people she only recently met, including a radio announcer accused of setting fire to a government station, eight minors and several college students.She is in charge of vetting newcomers to the ranch, turning away anyone who has been in jail, because she fears they could have been released on the condition they become informers.Still, those who fled try to remain optimistic.\u201cWe did not surrender,\u201d said Samuel A. Guti\u00e9rrez, 13, who arrived at the ranch in Costa Rica by bus and on foot after he fled Nicaragua with his parents. Samuel, who survived a government attack on a church that killed two people, is missing his freshman year of high school as he hides out at the ranch.\u201cWe are all going back,\u201d Samuel\u2019s father, Orlando Guti\u00e9rrez, 50, said as a group of fugitives roasted marshmallows. \u201cAll of us.\u201dOf the 322 people killed since the uprising began, 22 were police officers and about 50 were affiliated with the government\u2019s leftist Sandinista Front party, according to a Nicaraguan human rights organization that the government has now banned. Protesters believe many of those people died from friendly fire, or in cynical attempts to cast blame on a citizenry that had been armed mostly with rocks and slingshots.By the summer, the government regained the upper hand. In July, the Nicaraguan police, with assault rifles blazing, demolished more than 100 roadblocks. Friends turned out to be infiltrators, the police intelligence better than anyone imagined, and activists were arrested at their homes and underground hiding spots around the nation.At least 565 people are still jailed, some of them on murder charges and others for what the government calls terrorism. Another 23,000 people, like the Godmother, retreated to neighboring Costa Rica.Ms. Valdivia, hiding at first in Nicaragua\u2019s mountains, escaped across the border in August after a surprise phone call. \u201cI\u2019m going to help you get out,\u201d the voice on the other end said.The caller was a Nicaraguan businessman, Jorge Estrada, who had fled to Costa Rica three years earlier after the government confiscated a housing development he was building.Mr. Estrada now runs something of an underground railroad. He has arranged for the hasty departure of about 600 people, he said, and pays the rent for three safe houses including this one in Costa Rica.The fugitives call him \u201cComando.\u201d\u201cYou know what happens when they are caught: torture and murder,\u201d Mr. Estrada said. \u201cHow do you turn your back on something like that?\u201dEveryone huddled around Mr. Estrada, eager for any news they had not already gleaned from Facebook and WhatsApp, where fake news about the crisis circulates.President Trump had just signed the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act, or NICA, which promises to squeeze Nicaragua with tough sanctions until the rule of law is restored.\u201cIf all of this that the United States is doing, all this pressure, does not work for this man Ortega to react and leave, then one of the bloodiest wars Nicaragua has ever seen is coming,\u201d Mr. Estrada said. That is, the war would come, if only the opposition had guns.\u201cThere are no weapons,\u201d Mr. Estrada lamented. \u201cThe United States are the only ones who can help us with that, and they still haven\u2019t given the green light, so to speak.\u201dLike Mr. Estrada, Ms. Valdivia holds out a wistful hope that Mr. Trump will intervene, that the Republican leader will rescue Nicaragua from the socialist Mr. Ortega.\u201cWe believe in him,\u201d Ms. Valdivia said. \u201cThe United States, upon seeing us getting killed, will come.\u201dBut if international help does not materialize, Nicaraguans are not interested in political asylum in Costa Rica, she said.\u201cAlmost everyone is going back,\u201d she said, \u201ceven if it\u2019s only with rocks.\u201dAlfonso Flores Berm\u00fadez contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Democrats\u2019 Alabama Move Hints at Ugly 2020", "Date": "2019-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorThe Russian media was having way too much fun last week.They were downright gleeful over new reports that a group of Democrats had used online disinformation in the campaign against Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama in 2017.\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d went the general line in the Russian media, \u201clook what we have here.\u201dTheir reaction was understandable, given the news that American political operatives had tried the same kind of troll operations that United States intelligence officials believe the Russian government used in an attempt to swing the 2016 presidential election to Donald J. Trump.In addition to giving Russia new ammunition in its defense against election-meddling allegations, the progressives\u2019 political caper in Alabama sent a chilling message to the rest of us: Reality-warping attacks are now coming from inside the house.If the trend intensifies, the 2020 presidential campaign will make the media shenanigans of 2016 seem genteel.One of the people behind that effort, Jonathon Morgan, of the cyber security firm New Knowledge, minimized the effort by saying it was only an experiment to observe how such Russian-style tactics work in real time (though an internal report said the project was seeking to depress turnout for Mr. Moore).Mr. Jones, the politician who benefited from the operation, angrily denounced it and called for a federal investigation. So maybe there was reason to think it was all just a blip.The phony teetotaling campaign was the work of another group of liberal activists with different financiers, whose identities remain unknown. And it came with an implicit warning: Get used to it.As one of the organizers, the progressive activist Matt Osborne, told The Times, \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re fighting with one hand tied behind your back.\u201d Given the way some of Mr. Trump\u2019s backers \u2014 here and in Russia \u2014 have engaged in such tactics, he said, there was \u201ca moral imperative to do this.\u201dResearchers who have been studying the Russian disinformation tactics have been girding for just such a development.\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve been talking about in the last year is how the real threat\u2019s going to be when it\u2019s not just Russia or Iran \u2014 nation-states with budgets \u2014 but when every single person with an issue starts engaging in this type of manipulative behavior,\u201d said Bret Schafer, an analyst at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a research project at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely awful for democracy.\u201dNone of this bodes well for the 2020 campaign, which has entered its first stage at a time when analysts in and out of government are still trying to determine the full effect disinformation had in the last presidential election.Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, has concluded that the Russian activity probably affected the outcome. In \u201cCyber War,\u201d her just-published book about the 2016 campaign, she reports that Russia \u201ctried to mobilize, demobilize, and shift the sorts of voters that Trump needed to win.\u201dIf the results of the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III confirm her conclusion, some people may be deterred from employing such tactics. On the other hand, nothing spawns copycats like victory.Big questions remain about how to keep American political campaigns from descending into disinformation, barring still-elusive legal or technical remedies, as Ms. Jamieson told me in an interview. \u201cHow do you make sure it\u2019s marked off as inappropriate?\u201d she said. \u201cThe real question for 2020 is, what is out of bounds? Is there anything?\u201dAs a start, I reached out to various expected 2020 players to see if they would eschew such tactics.I was heartened to receive this statement from Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey: \u201cThere is no place in our politics for deceptive tactics that undermine trust in \u2014 and the credibility of \u2014 our democratic process and stand in contrast to our values.\u201dThe Republican Party chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel \u2014 sounding as if she might be relishing the Democrats\u2019 turn under the microscope \u2014 said, \u201cThese tactics are shameful.\u201dThen there were those whose offices I never heard back from \u2014 Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the Democratic Party itself and Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election team.The real surprise was former Vice President Joe Biden.\u201cNot going to have any comment on that for you,\u201d a spokesman said.Maybe Mr. Biden wants to keep his options open.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Trump\u2019s Inauguration, $10,000 for Makeup and Lots of Room Service", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Private donors put up $107 million to usher Donald J. Trump into office in style two years ago, and it is now clear just how enthusiastically his inaugural committee went to town with it.There was $10,000 for makeup for 20 aides at an evening inaugural event. There was another $30,000 in per diem payments to dozens of contract staff members, in addition to their fully covered hotel rooms, room service orders, plane tickets and taxi rides, including some to drop off laundry.The bill from the Trump International Hotel was more than $1.5 million. And there was a documentary, overseen by a close friend of Melania Trump\u2019s, that was ultimately abandoned.The details of the expenditures, gleaned from interviews and from documents reviewed by The New York Times and not previously made public, show that the committee spent heavily on nearly every aspect of the events surrounding the inauguration.In 72 days, it laid out about $100 million, roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Barack Obama or George W. Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations.The expansive spending reflected Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to make a grand entrance, with roughly 20 events around Washington, people familiar with the events said. It also had the hallmarks of previous Trump efforts, such as the campaign, with some Trump-family friends circumventing existing chains of command.Disclosure of the spending details comes at a time when the inaugural committee is facing legal scrutiny over the donations that funded it.People involved with the committee have said that they vetted all donors, but that they could do only so much to prove someone\u2019s money was their own. False statements to the Federal Election Commission can be a crime.The investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan was prompted at least partly by a recording that Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, made of a conversation he had with a central figure in the inaugural planning, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, shortly after Mrs. Trump ended Ms. Winston Wolkoff\u2019s role as an unpaid adviser to the first lady. Ms. Winston Wolkoff was dismissed after initial reports about the amount of money taken in by the entity she formed to help produce the inaugural.There is no indication of any investigation into the inaugural committee\u2019s spending. For the most part, inaugural committees are free to spend the money they raise from private donations as they wish.The bulk of the money for the inaugural committee came from big corporations, like AT&T, Bank of America and Pfizer, and wealthy Republicans donors, like Sheldon G. Adelson and Andrew Beal.Given the short time frame between Election Day and Inauguration Day, inaugural committees cannot always seek out the lowest bidder. In the case of Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural, some staff members and major vendors were veterans of previous inaugurations.Much of the spending, while outsize, was mundane. Documents reviewed by The Times accounted for the entire $107 million raised for the inaugural, with most of the money going to payroll expenses and roughly 40 entities, the bulk of which were hotel chains and other vendors.Roughly $5 million went to charity, which organizers have noted is the most ever for an inaugural committee.But millions were written off in lost revenue. That included $6.4 million for blocks of hotel rooms booked for guests who ended up arranging their own accommodations. The Republican National Committee booked the excess hotel rooms before the inaugural staff was even formed, but the committee had to pony up when only half as many rooms were used as the party organization had expected.Another $1.2 million in revenue that the committee expected to recoup for a media center never materialized.Other arrangements by the inaugural committee also proved unusual.Ms. Winston Wolkoff, then a close friend of Mrs. Trump\u2019s, was initially signed to a $1.6 million contract. Along with a friend, Jonathan Reynaga, she formed WIS Media Partners, a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials.The idea was to sell the rights to a major distributor. The project was later abandoned, although the interview footage still exists, as do copies, according to three people familiar with the effort.WIS Media Partners became the inaugural committee\u2019s top vendor, acting as a kind of general contractor and overseeing a series of events. It received nearly $26 million, much of which was paid out to other vendors.Steve Kerrigan, who was chief of staff for Mr. Obama\u2019s first inaugural committee, said that the firm\u2019s $1.6 million \u201csupervisory fee\u201d was the equivalent of \u201croughly one-fourth of what we paid our entire 450-person staff\u201d in 2009. Even if Ms. Winston Wolkoff shared the fee among more than a dozen other top managers, as she and others say she did, the charge itself, Mr. Kerrigan said, was \u201coutrageous.\u201dGreg Jenkins, the executive director of Mr. Bush\u2019s second inaugural, said, \u201cI have never heard anybody getting that kind of fee associated with any inaugural, ever.\u201dMs. Winston Wolkoff often fought with other top aides, according to people with direct knowledge of events. She was known to threaten to have senior officials fired, at times brandishing a cellphone and saying she would text Mrs. Trump or Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s elder daughter, conveying a sense of authority that people later came to realize she did not have, three people with direct knowledge of the events said.A lawyer for Ms. Winston Wolkoff declined to comment.A spokesman for WIS Media Partners said all of the firm\u2019s charges \u201cwere vetted, authorized and signed off on\u201d by the committee\u2019s top officials, including Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the committee\u2019s chairman; Rick Gates, the deputy chairman; and Sara Armstrong, the chief executive.He said the firm\u2019s fees were \u201csignificantly below\u201d the customary charges \u201cfor equivalent productions,\u201d and that officials provided the inaugural committee with \u201call its audited records and receipts.\u201d He said the company could not reveal more because it is legally barred by the inaugural committee from discussing its work on the inaugural events.In a statement, Mr. Barrack said he continues \u201cto be proud of the incredible work of all those that were part of the committee\u201d and that it \u201ccomplied with all laws and regulations, and its finances were fully audited internally and independently. The donors were fully vetted and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as required.\u201dAnother $2.7 million was spent on flying in a performance group working with Steve Wynn, the casino magnate and friend of Mr. Trump.The Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million for services including the use of a ballroom, an \u201cannex\u201d and a space called the townhouse, according to records and people familiar with the payments.While two other hotels, the Willard and the Fairmont, collected as much or more, Mr. Trump\u2019s hotel was also favored by vendors who billed their expenses directly to the committee.Over all, the Trump team\u2019s spending appears \u201castronomical,\u201d said Emmett S. Beliveau, who was chief executive of Mr. Obama\u2019s first inaugural committee.Mr. Jenkins, who handled the Bush inaugural, said the scale of the Trump team\u2019s spending \u201cblows me away.\u201dMs. Winston Wolkoff and Mr. Reynaga brought in nearly three dozen staff members, some of whom flew in from Los Angeles or other cities and remained on the East Coast for weeks. WIS also helped bring in a New York-based party planner named David Monn, who refused to sign a contract, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Monn charged the committee a total of $3.7 million, from which he paid subcontractors.Among other tasks, Ms. Winston Wolkoff and colleagues managed the 500-person black-tie dinner hosted by Mr. Barrack at the neo-Classical Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and a 1,500-person \u201ccandlelight\u201d dinner at Union Station. They decided the decorations were not elegant enough and needed to be enhanced.Mr. Monn spent $924,000 on seven-foot-high wreaths, moss-covered obelisks, flowers and other decorations to dress up Union Station. Makeup was provided for 20 staff members at a cost of $500 per person. For the dinner at the auditorium, table menus, table numbers and place cards, including an on-site calligrapher to correct last-minute mistakes, amounted to $91 per guest. Mr. Monn did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Monday.The handling of expenses for contractors like WIS Media Partners was also unusual. Mr. Kerrigan, who also served as chief executive of Mr. Obama\u2019s second inaugural committee, said officials negotiated fixed-price contracts that limited how much vendors could charge for expenses.If a vendor\u2019s staff member ran up a big room service bill, \u201cthat was on them,\u201d said David Cusack, who was the executive director of the second committee. \u201cThey had a per diem, and they were supposed to eat on that.\u201dFor Mr. Bush\u2019s second inaugural, too, vendors were required to build their expenses into their contracts, Mr. Jenkins said. He said his committee did not even hire vendors from outside the Washington area because \u201cthere was no need to.\u201dThe Trump inaugural committee covered not only a fixed per diem for the people brought in by WIS Media, but picked up expenses including room service, cab rides for assistants who dropped off laundry and an order of McDonald\u2019s. All told, those expenses came to $227,511.In less than two months, WIS billed $31,000 for hotel rooms described as Mr. Reynaga\u2019s, including nearly $18,000 for rooms at the Trump International Hotel, according to detailed expense documents reviewed by The Times. He also billed thousands of dollars for meals, room service and travel. On one day, he charged a $560 Amtrak train ticket from New York to Washington, plus a $251 first-class upgrade to meet with Mr. Barrack. That was followed by a $100 Uber ride the next day to \u201cget to Tom\u2019s plane,\u201d the records show.The spokesman for WIS said WIS expenses were paid through business cards tied to a few senior officials of the firm, including Mr. Reynaga, meaning that Mr. Reynaga could have been paying for other employees\u2019 costs.He also said staff members stayed at the Trump International Hotel \u201cat the explicit direction\u201d of inaugural committee officials. A former official of the inaugural committee denied that the WIS employees were required to stay at the Trump hotel.Maggie Haberman and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Ben Protess from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change\u2019s Giant Impact on the Economy: 4 Key Issues", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of the big economic questions in coming decades will come down to just how extreme the weather will be, and how to value the future versus the present. By now, it\u2019s clear that climate change poses environmental risks beyond anything seen in the modern age. But we\u2019re only starting to come to grips with the potential economic effects.Using increasingly sophisticated modeling, researchers are calculating how each tenth of a degree of global warming is likely to play out in economic terms. Their projections carry large bands of uncertainty, because of the vagaries of human behavior and the remaining questions about how quickly the planet will respond to the buildup of greenhouse gases.The Trump administration has long rejected prescriptions like a carbon tax. But policy debates aside, many of the central economic questions of the decades ahead are, at their core, going to be climate questions. These are some of the big ones.Consider three possible ways that climate change could exact an economic cost: A once-fertile agricultural area experiences hotter weather and drought, causing its crop yields to decrease. A road destroyed by flooding because of rising seas and more frequent hurricanes must be rebuilt. An electrical utility spends hundreds of millions of dollars to build a more efficient power grid because the old one could not withstand extreme weather.The farmland\u2019s yield decline is a permanent loss of the economy\u2019s productive capacity \u2014 society is that much poorer, for the indefinite future. It\u2019s worse than what happens in a typical economic downturn. Usually when factories sit idle during a recession, there is a reasonable expectation that they will start cranking again once the economy returns to health.The road rebuilding might be expensive, but at least that money is going to pay people and businesses to do their work. The cost for society over all is that the resources that go to rebuilding the road are not available for something else that might be more valuable. That\u2019s a setback, but it\u2019s not a permanent reduction in economic potential like the less fertile farmland. And in a recession, it might even be a net positive, under the same logic that fiscal stimulus can be beneficial in a downturn.By contrast, new investment in the power grid could yield long-term benefits in energy efficiency and greater reliability. There\u2019s some parallel with military spending. In the 1950s and \u201960s, during the Cold War, the United States spent more than 10 percent of G.D.P. on national defense (it\u2019s now below 4 percent).Most of that spending crowded out other forms of economic activity; many houses and cars and washing machines weren\u2019t made because of the resources that instead went to making tanks, bombs and fighter jets. But some of that spending also created long-term benefits for society, like the innovations that led to the internet and to reliable commercial jet aircraft travel.Certain types of efforts to reduce carbon emissions or adapt to climate impacts are likely to generate similar benefits, says Nicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t provide sea defenses at large scale without very heavy investment, but it\u2019s not investment of the kind that you get from the things that breed technological progress,\u201d Mr. Stern said. \u201cThe defensive adaptations don\u2019t carry anything like the dynamism that comes from different ways of doing things.\u201dThere is more fertile ground in areas like transportation and infrastructure, he said. Electric cars, instead of those with internal combustion engines, would mean less air pollution in cities, for example. Seeking a baseline to devise environmental regulations, the Obama administration set out to calculate a \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d the amount of harm each new ton of carbon emissions will cause in decades ahead.At the core of the project were sophisticated efforts to model how a hotter earth will affect thousands of different places. That\u2019s necessary because a low-lying region that already has many hot days a year is likely to face bigger problems, sooner, than a higher-altitude location that currently has a temperate climate.\u201cWe\u2019ve divided the world into 25,000 regions and married that with very precise geographic predictions on how the local climate will change,\u201d Mr. Greenstone said. \u201cJust having the raw computing power to be able to analyze this at a more disaggregated level is a big part of it.\u201dBut even once you have an estimate of the cost of a hotter climate in future decades, some seemingly small assumptions can drastically alter the social cost of carbon today.Finance uses something called the discount rate to compare future value with present value. What would the promise of a $1,000 payment 10 years from now be worth to you today? Certainly something less than $1,000 \u2014 but how much less would depend on what rate you use.Likewise, the cost of carbon emissions varies greatly depending on how you value the well-being of people in future decades \u2014 many not born yet, and who may benefit from technologies and wealth we cannot imagine \u2014 versus our well-being today.The magic of compounding means that the exact rate matters a great deal when looking at things far in the future. It\u2019s essentially the inverse of observing that a $1,000 investment that compounds at 3 percent a year will be worth about $4,400 in 50 years, whereas one that grows 7 percent per year will be worth more than $29,000.In the Obama administration\u2019s analysis, using a 5 percent discount rate \u2014 which would put comparatively little weight on the well-being of future generations \u2014 would imply a social cost of $12 (in 2007 dollars) for emitting one metric ton of carbon dioxide. A metric ton is about what would be released as a car burns 113 gallons of gasoline. A 2.5 percent rate would imply a cost of $62, which adds up to hundreds of billions of dollars a year in society-wide costs at recent rates of emissions.The Obama administration settled on a 3 percent discount rate that put the social cost of carbon at $42 per metric ton. The Trump administration has subsequently revised that estimate to between one dollar and seven dollars.That sharp decrease was achieved in part by measuring only the future economic costs to the United States, not factoring in the rest of the world. And the Trump administration analyzed a discount rate of up to 7 percent \u2014 a rate at which even costs far into the future become trivial.Mr. Greenstone favors substantially lower discount rates, based on evidence that financial markets also place high value on investments that protect against risk. Understood this way, spending today to reduce carbon emissions tomorrow is like insurance against some of the most costly effects of a hotter planet \u2014 and part of the debate is over how much that insurance is really worth, given that the biggest benefits are far in the future. In reality there is likely to be enormous variance in the economic impact, depending on where people live and what kind of jobs they have.Low-lying, flood-prone areas are at particularly high risk of becoming unlivable \u2014 or at least uninsurable. Certain industries in certain places will be dealt a huge blow, or cease to exist; many ski slopes will turn out to be too warm for regular snow, and the map of global agriculture will shift.Adaptation will probably be easier for the affluent than for the poor. Those who can afford to move to an area with more favorable impacts from a warmer climate presumably will.So the economic implications of climate change include huge shifts in geography, demographics and technology, with each affecting the other.\u201cTo look at things in terms of G.D.P. doesn\u2019t really capture what this means to people\u2019s lives,\u201d said William Nordhaus, a Yale economist who pioneered the models on which modern climate economics is based and who won a Nobel for that work. \u201cIf you just look at an average of all the things we experience, some in the marketplace and some not in the marketplace, it\u2019s insufficient. The impact is going to be highly diverse.\u201dDespite all these risks, it\u2019s important to remember that humanity tends to be remarkably adaptable. A century ago, most people lived without an automobile, a refrigerator, or the possibility of traveling by airplane. A couple of decades before that, almost no one had indoor plumbing.Changes in how people live, and the technology they use, could both mitigate the impact of climate change and ensure that the costs are less about a pure economic loss and more about rewiring the way civilization works.Most capital investments last only a decade or two to begin with; people are constantly rebuilding roads, buildings and other infrastructure. And a warmer climate could, if it plays out slowly enough, merely shift where that reinvestment happens.But a big risk is that the change happens too quickly. Adaptation that might be manageable over a generation could be impossible \u2014 and cause mass suffering or death \u2014 if it happens over a few years.Imagine major staple food crops being wiped out for a few consecutive years by drought or other extreme weather. Or a large coastal city wiped out in a single extreme storm.It\u2019s clear that climate change and its ripple effects are likely to be a defining challenge of the 21st-century economy. But there are wide ranges of possible results that vary based on countless assumptions. We should also recognize that the economic backdrop of society is always changing. Projecting what that will mean for ordinary people is not simply a matter of dollars.\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 20 years trying to communicate it and it\u2019s not easy to process,\u201d Joseph Aldy, who teaches at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School for Public Policy, said of the connection between climate change and the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to convey something that is long term and gradual until it\u2019s not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The People vs. Donald J. Trump", "Date": "2019-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe is demonstrably unfit for office. What are we waiting for?Opinion ColumnistThe presidential oath of office contains 35 words and one core promise: to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Since virtually the moment Donald J. Trump took that oath two years ago, he has been violating it.The unrelenting chaos that Trump creates can sometimes obscure the big picture. But the big picture is simple: The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it\u2019s becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it?The easy answer is to wait \u2014 to allow the various investigations of Trump to run their course and ask voters to deliver a verdict in 2020. That answer has one great advantage. It would avoid the national trauma of overturning an election result. Ultimately, however, waiting is too dangerous. The cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain.He has already shown, repeatedly, that he will hurt the country in order to help himself. He will damage American interests around the world and damage vital parts of our constitutional system at home. The risks that he will cause much more harm are growing.The biggest risk may be that an external emergency \u2014 a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster \u2014 will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.For the country\u2019s sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.Achieving this outcome won\u2019t be easy. It will require honorable people who have served in the Trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (At this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) It will require congressional Republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. It will require Democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help Trump remain in office.Regardless of party, Trump\u2019s predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities. They released their tax returns, so that any potential conflicts would be public. They placed their assets in a blind trust, to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments.If this pattern were merely petty corruption, without damage to the national interest, it might not warrant removal from office. But Trump\u2019s focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy. Most worrisome, foreign officials and others have realized they can curry favor with the president by spending money at one of his properties. The Constitution that Trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances. It depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch. He is a citizen to whom, like all other citizens, the country\u2019s laws apply. Trump rejects this principle. He has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests.No other president since Nixon has engaged in behavior remotely like Trump\u2019s. To accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it. Unpleasant though it is to remove a president, the costs and the risks of a continued Trump presidency are worse.The current political dynamics have some similarities. Whether the House of Representatives, under Democratic control, impeaches Trump is not the big question. The question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of Republicans.I know that many of Trump\u2019s critics have given up hoping that he ever will. They assume that Republican senators will go on occasionally criticizing him without confronting him. But it is a mistake to give up. The stakes are too large \u2014 and the chances of success are too real.They know. They know he is unfit for office. They do not need to be persuaded of the truth. They need to be persuaded to act on it.Democrats won\u2019t persuade them by impeaching Trump. Doing so would probably rally the president\u2019s supporters. It would shift the focus from Trump\u2019s behavior toward a group of Democratic leaders whom Republicans are never going to like. A smarter approach is a series of sober-minded hearings to highlight Trump\u2019s misconduct. Democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother Trump\u2019s supporters, like corruption.It\u2019s not only that Trump is unfit to be president and that Republicans know it. It also may be the case that they will soon have a political self-interest in abandoning him. If they did, the end could come swiftly. The House could then impeach Trump, knowing the Senate might act to convict. Or negotiations could begin over whether Trump deserves to trade resignation for some version of immunity.Finally, there is the hope \u2014 na\u00efve though it may seem \u2014 that some Republicans will choose to act on principle. There now exists a small club of former Trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom Trump has sullied, to greater or lesser degrees. It includes Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. Imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about Trump. Doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need. It would be an illustration of duty.Throughout his career, Trump has worked hard to invent his own reality, and largely succeeded. It has made him very rich and, against all odds, elected him president. But whatever happens in 2019, his false version of reality will not survive history, just as Nixon\u2019s did not. Which side of that history do today\u2019s Republicans want to be on?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Slowdown Looms Just as the World Looks for Growth", "Date": "2019-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the past, China has helped to pull the global economy out of weak spots. This time, it might not come through.In the eastern province of Jiangsu, hundreds of chemical factories have closed.Car sales have plunged in China since last summer. Smartphone sales are falling. The real estate market has stagnated, with deeply indebted developers forced to pay steep interest rates to roll over their debts. And trade frictions with the West, coupled with tough policies from Beijing toward foreign investors, have made Chinese and foreign companies alike warier of further investment in China.China on Monday said its economy grew 6.4 percent during the last three months of 2018 compared with the same time in 2017. For all of 2018, China\u2019s economy grew 6.6 percent, the slowest pace since 1990, though many economists believe the country\u2019s headline figures are unreliable.Previous slowdowns in China, like the one in 2015 and 2016, unnerved investors and global business leaders alike, setting off worries that multinational companies would lose profits from their Chinese subsidiaries, or that Chinese companies would dump their surplus production on world markets at very low prices.The question now is to what extent nervous business leaders elsewhere will postpone investment as China slows, and how many investors will dump their shareholdings.\u201cThe global economy and financial markets are incredibly sensitive to China\u2019s growth and currency outlook,\u201d said Robin Brooks, the chief economist at the Washington-based Institute of International Finance. \u201cThe immediate financial linkages are relatively modest, but they are swamped by sentiment channels.\u201dStill, the big question now is, to paraphrase the line about Las Vegas: Will what happens in China stay in China, or will it become a global problem?China is the world\u2019s second-largest importer, after the United States. But the composition of its imports is unusual.It is the largest market for a long list of commodity exporters, from Australia to Uruguay, thanks to its voracious appetite for iron ore, food, energy and other raw materials it needs to keep its economy humming. China is also a large market for factory equipment made in countries like Germany and Japan. But its imports of manufactured goods overall are few for an economy of its size. That has limited the dependence of workers elsewhere, particularly in the United States, on the Chinese economy.\u201cThe weaker the data gets, the more confident we get that they\u2019ll tip a lot of stimulus into keeping the economy moving,\u201d said Michael Blythe, the chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.Many of the biggest new construction projects are in China\u2019s western regions, said Wang Min, the chairman of Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, a state-owned giant. The projects have been good for his company, China\u2019s largest producer of huge earth-moving equipment, and its orders have soared in recent months.But linking together towns in sparsely populated areas of mountains and deserts is expensive. It adds large sums to China\u2019s already very high levels of debt. And the investment may produce scant new economic activity to pay off that extra debt.Previously accumulated debt lies at the heart of a one-two punch that has laid China\u2019s overall economy low in recent months.They set about putting stringent limits on the country\u2019s extensive shadow banking networks. Those networks had been providing a gusher of loans to the country\u2019s small and midsize enterprises, which China\u2019s big, state-owned banks have long neglected in favor of lending to state-owned enterprises.At the same time, momentum was building in Beijing to extend the influence of the Communist Party and state-owned enterprises, mainly at the expense of the private sector. The private sector is responsible for most job creation in China, and the rhetoric from Beijing further scared investors.Business confidence slumped as well. A survey of 270 importers in the United States conducted in late December and early January by Panjiva, a trade data service, found that 71 percent planned to change how and where they bought their goods if tariffs stayed unchanged. And 87 percent said they would do so if the Trump administration raised tariffs further.As companies start moving their supply chains, the main beneficiaries seem to be Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia. But to the extent that those countries buy more factory equipment from places like Germany, some of the negative effects overseas from weaker sales in China could be offset.Most economists are predicting that the first quarter of this year will be weak in China. Many are predicting that the second will be, too.But quite a few say they still have confidence in China\u2019s consistent, four-decade track record of pulling itself out of slumps quickly. Chinese officials have put new emphasis in recent weeks on rebuilding confidence. And they are at least trying to reassure private companies that the government will not favor state-owned enterprises over them.\u201cAs long as we can create a level playing field,\u201d said Ma Jiantang, a senior economic adviser to China\u2019s cabinet, \u201cprivate companies will surely succeed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Save East River Park, the City Intends to Bury It", "Date": "2019-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe crowd at the recent meeting of Community Board 3 was agitated. Vaylateena Jones, a 50-year Lower East Side resident and board official, was especially vocal. \u201cThe way this planning is being done is disempowering,\u201d she said. \u201cCity officials collaborated with us over four years and came up with a detailed design \u2014 only to now return with this entirely new design. Do our voices even matter?\u201dThe topic was the future of East River Park. Once a derelict waterfront space, it had been restored, over 10 years, with well-lit ball fields, children\u2019s fountains and a serpentine esplanade featuring a large sink for fishermen to clean their catch. Then Hurricane Sandy deluged the park, swamping F.D.R. Drive and Lower East Side.The city\u2019s latest plan to protect from future flooding called for burying the park under eight to 10 feet of landfill, and starting over. This was not the original plan, and that\u2019s what had locals upset.The original plan grew out of an unusual collaboration between an organization created after Hurricane Sandy by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to lead the region in addressing climate change along with 20 or so Lower East Side advocacy groups. The proposal called for an eight-foot landscaped berm at the park\u2019s western edge insulating the F.D.R. and the Lower East Side from flooding.\u201cThis renewal project did not come through normal city channels,\u201d said Amy Chester, director of that new organization, Rebuild by Design. Its first target was the Lower East Side, whose low-lying public housing is especially vulnerable. The berm surrounding the park would be the first link in a string of buffers around all Lower Manhattan \u2014 known as the Big U \u2014 to protect against rising seas.\u201cEverything went swimmingly,\u201d Ms. Chester said, \u201cuntil the city announced, on a Friday afternoon in September, with no community consultation, that the plan was being scrapped.\u201dDamaris Reyes, executive director of the grass-roots group GOLES (Good Old Lower East Side), who had phone banked and gone door to door to keep her largely minority community abreast, was outraged. City officials, she said, \u201cwent into radio silence. Suddenly, no one knew what was happening. We were disrespected.\u201dThe city was scrapping the berm, and three months later, it announced its new plan. It would bury the park under landfill and build a new park over that.According to Lorraine Grillo, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Design and Construction, the shift in plans followed the city\u2019s standard review of a design project. Afterward, she said, officials made \u201ca better choice\u201d \u2014 and a notably more expensive one. The original plan was budgeted at $760 million; the city\u2019s revised scheme would cost $1.45 billion.Additionally, HUD had $330 million for anti-flooding efforts, but the agency required this money be spent by 2022 or be forfeited.Looking over the renderings at one of the December meetings that introduced the plan, Bill Buchen, a 40-year East Village resident and landscape architect, shook his head. \u201cI totally hate this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are choosing a way which removes plant life, trees and everything which sustains life \u2014 in favor of what?\u201dFor one thing, in favor of traffic. Unlike the original idea, according to Ms. Grillo the city\u2019s plan would avoid a time-consuming shutdown of a lane of on the F.D.R. Drive \u201cevery night for five years.\u201dEast River Park is different. Running from 13th Street south to Cherry Street, it was conceived by Robert Moses in 1939 across the highway from public housing, and gradually fell into disrepair until its $93 million refurbishment, completed in 2010. Two years later, Hurricane Sandy arrived, killing 43 in the region and causing $19 billion in damage, with the Lower East Side taking the brunt.Now those who live near the park are frustrated that the plan to preserve the ecosystem is being swept aside. \u201cThe community\u2019s painstaking work over four years is being completely pushed aside,\u201d said Carlina Rivera, a councilwoman from the East Village. \u201cThe new plan represents a fundamental departure from anything the City had discussed. The mayor\u2019s office has failed to provide detailed analyses on why the cost increase is necessary. Until those questions are answered, I cannot back the direction the mayor\u2019s office has taken.\u201d She is leading a City Council oversight meeting Wednesday that will address the new park plans.Soon after the group moved into the boathouse, the boiler went out. It took the city three and a half years to replace it. \u201cAnd now,\u201d she asked incredulously, \u201cthe city says it can bury and rebuild the entire park in three years?\u201dFor several years, the Ecology Center has assisted the Parks Department\u2019s gardener in planting the park: hundreds of echinaceas, a coneflower with medicinal properties; 15,000 bluebells; and milkweed to attract monarch butterflies. Volunteers also cared for the park\u2019s hundreds of lindens, oaks, and London plane trees.Nearly all these would be buried under the new plan, replaced by saplings that would take decades to mature.The new plan will also create a temporary ecological desert for hundreds of species migrating the Atlantic Flyway. Buried, too, will be the running track field house with its sea monster tiles and the track itself (just refurbished for nearly $3 million). The fate of the amphitheater, the original home to Shakespeare in the Park, now home to Summer Stage salsa concerts, remains uncertain.\u201cWe have seen no environmental impact statement addressing any of this. Instead, we are told little, our concerns steamrollered,\u201d she said. A draft impact statement will be issued this March, just before the city certifies the proposed plan, Commissioner Grillo said.The deputy parks commissioner Alyssa Cobb Konon pointed out that following Sandy\u2019s saltwater drenching, the park\u2019s tree canopy had considerably thinned. The city\u2019s plan calls for increasing tree species from the original three to 52 hardier ones; by planting 1,300 trees on fresh, raised soil, the new park will resurrect that canopy.In a separate interview, the Parks Department commissioner, Mitchell J. Silver, said that unlike passive parks that double as floodplains, like those by Jamaica Bay, East River Park has structures, lights and synthetic turf, which \u201cdoes not do well\u201d in floods. And with the river projected to rise two and a half feet in 30 years, raising the park is the only way to save it.By bringing in landfill and soil by barge, the new plan allows for daytime construction away from the highway, minimizing traffic disruptions. After its scheduled March 2020 launch, the new plan can thus be completed in three years rather than five, with flood protection in place by 2022.Still, the park\u2019s closing under either plan has left people like Joan Reinmuth, a retired nurse and 30-year East Village resident, doubtful. \u201cThis park is more than a recreation facility,\u201d she said. \u201cThese kids in NYCHA houses don\u2019t take vacation cruises. They don\u2019t shop at Zabar\u2019s for fish; they fish to eat. Early mornings, men are shaving in the fountains.\u201dAt last week\u2019s meeting, Susan Stetzer, district manager for Community Board 3, got a commitment that after initially shutting the park down, the city will look to reopen it in sections. \u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a member of Community Board 3. She is Vaylateena Jones, not Vaylateeba.Because of an editing error, the day of a City Council oversight meeting was misstated. It is Wednesday, Jan. 23, not Tuesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Voting Laws, Democrats Flex Newfound Power in New York", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of lagging behind other states, New York radically overhauled its system of voting and elections on Monday, passing several bills that would allow early voting, preregistration of minors, voting by mail and sharp limits on the influence of money.The bills, which were passed by the State Legislature on Monday evening, bring New York in line with policies in other liberal bastions like California and Washington, and they would quiet, at least for a day, complaints about the state\u2019s antiquated approach to suffrage.\u201cToday we are saying to New York that we are about tearing barriers down,\u201d Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the leader of the Senate Democrats, said earlier on Monday.\u201cWe should not fear making it easier for those who are eligible to vote, to vote,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe should not fear restricting the flow of money into our electoral system.\u201d\u201cWe are finally beginning to see New York\u2019s elections begin \u2014 just begin \u2014 to catch up with the rest of the country,\u201d said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a good-government group.For years, the State Capitol has learned to function in a perpetual equilibrium: Democrats led the Assembly, Republicans ruled the Senate, and Mr. Cuomo usually fell somewhere in between, strengthening his reputation as a centrist. Several of the voting measures that were passed on Monday had previously won the Assembly\u2019s approval, only to fail in the Senate.Indeed, virtually nothing emerged from Albany without the benefit of a back-room handshake, with concessions on one deal facilitating an agreement on another, and neither party getting anything close to its full agenda.But the political tenor shifted last year, when a blue wave of disenchanted Democratic voters pushed for more immediate change. As Mr. Cuomo ran for re-election in November, he became a more forceful advocate for the party; he supported Democratic candidates challenging Republican Senate incumbents, and repeatedly spoke out against the policies of President Trump. And he did so again before the votes in the Legislature on Monday, setting the stage for his annual State of the State address on Tuesday.\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see the most aggressive agenda that I have put forward,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview on WAMC on Monday morning. \u201cWhy? Because I now have the ability to get it passed with a Democratic Senate where I had a Republican Senate.\u201dEven before the Legislature approved the changes, Mr. Cuomo had promised to expand voting hours at upstate locations, make Election Day a state holiday and ban corporate contributions, a talking point of many progressive candidates in last fall\u2019s campaigns.The sudden Democratic enthusiasm has naturally been met with skepticism from their Republican counterparts, who are now in the unfamiliar position of responding from behind.\u201cDemocrats are racing each other to the left to get credit for being the most progressive without stopping to think about the negative ramifications,\u201d said Scott Reif, a spokesman for the minority conference. \u201cIn the meantime, hardworking New Yorkers are overtaxed and overregulated, and upstate is facing an economic emergency. It\u2019s time to find real solutions to the economic challenges facing real people.\u201dThroughout the Capitol on Monday, there were clear signs that the old way of doing the people\u2019s business was being redefined by a crush of new members and a Democratic monopoly on power: committee meetings packed with members, hallways jammed with optimistic good-government groups and legislators touting the power of democracy in action.The morning began with dozens of advocates crowded into a conference room on the first floor of the Capitol, with more spilling into the hallway, for what is typically a desolate meeting of the Senate elections committee. They brought posters, buttons and T-shirts, then filled the hallway outside later for a news conference to declare victory.A subsequent gathering of the Senate Democrats was no less jubilant, with activists hoisting signs and cheering loudly, and Ms. Stewart-Cousins beginning a news conference by issuing a false plea for Republicans to take up the Democrats\u2019 bills \u2014 much as she often did when her party was in the minority.\u201cI\u2019m just kidding,\u201d she said, a moment later, breaking into a wide smile.Ms. Stewart-Cousins also issued a warning of sorts to Mr. Cuomo, noting that he had included $7 million in his executive budget the year before to finance early voting and other reforms, when the Senate Republicans had blocked those changes.\u201cThe reality is that we expect that money to be there again,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause now he has willing partners here in the Senate.\u201dThe action in the Senate was applauded by many in the State Assembly, which had passed such protections before only to see them stall in the Republican-led Senate.\u201cIt\u2019s really nice that a lot of the things that we\u2019ve been working on, sometimes for decades, are finally going to happen,\u201d said Richard Gottfried, an assemblyman from Manhattan who is the chamber\u2019s longest serving member. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be cheering the Senate on.\u201dIf anything, however, legislators seemed to be agitating to move even faster than the governor, passing all seven election-related bills on just their second day in session and before his State of the State address.Carl E. Heastie, the Bronx Democrat who leads the Assembly, made clear again on Monday that his colleagues viewed the change in election laws as an immediate priority.\u201cI promised to hit the ground running,\u201d Mr. Heastie said. \u201cAnd I am keeping that promise.\u201dHis counterpart in the Senate agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s an amazing amount of things that had not been done,\u201d Ms. Stewart-Cousins said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep it moving so that we can catch up. And move ahead, frankly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "McKinsey & Company Is Again Accused of Misdeeds in Bankruptcy Case", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMcKinsey & Company, a consulting firm whose conduct in bankruptcy cases has already drawn the attention of two judges, was accused before a third on Tuesday of improperly receiving and concealing payments from a client on the verge of bankruptcy. This raised the prospect that the judge overseeing the case could order the return of tens of millions of dollars in fees earned by the consulting company.Signs that something could be wrong at the client company, SunEdison, began to surface after its board hired an outside firm to investigate unrelated employee claims that managers were misstating cash flows. The outside company, FTI Consulting, described an email exchange between a McKinsey consultant and a SunEdison executive, discussing how McKinsey was going to be paid for the work it had already done for the company.Ultimately, there was an agreement that McKinsey would not keep billing SunEdison itself \u2014 instead, it would call back its unpaid bills and redirect them to four solar-energy projects that SunEdison had set up for various customers. But there was a problem: McKinsey had not done any work for them.\u201cAcknowledge that this is not ideal,\u201d the McKinsey partner wrote, adding that there had not been many options. \u201cWe should anticipate spirited opposition from some PMs that we will need to push through,\u201d he added, in a reference to the project managers who would be asked to pay for consulting services they had not received.The accusations against McKinsey were contained in a pleading filed Tuesday in United States bankruptcy court in Manhattan by a SunEdison creditor who has made a series of accusations of misconduct against McKinsey. The creditor, the retired turnaround specialist Jay Alix, asserted to Judge Stuart M. Bernstein that McKinsey had used the four projects \u2014 whose financing was separate from that of SunEdison and would not be affected by the bankruptcy \u2014 to remove any risk of the court finding out that McKinsey pulled money out of the company just before it went bankrupt.McKinsey \u201cacted with intent to deceive the court and in a manner that was willfully blind to the truth and was in reckless disregard of the truth,\u201d Mr. Alix wrote.Mr. Alix has already challenged McKinsey in Houston\u2019s bankruptcy court, which handled two recent cases where the companies were advised by McKinsey, and in the bankruptcy court in Richmond, Va., where the judge this month reopened the case of Alpha Natural Resources, also advised by McKinsey. The judges in those cases recently took the unusual step of jointly ordering McKinsey and Mr. Alix to try to resolve their differences in mediation, as one last step before taking the matter to trial.A spokeswoman for McKinsey, asked about the new accusations, said: \u201cAlix has no evidence for his reckless and defamatory fraud claims against McKinsey, in this or any of his other attacks on the firm. Now, he is attempting to disrupt yet another settled bankruptcy based on the same unsubstantiated allegations he has made over and over again.\u201dShe said the firm had always conducted itself in compliance with the law. In the past, McKinsey has also said that Mr. Alix was motivated by a desire to undercut its ability to compete with AlixPartners, a restructuring firm that he founded in the 1980s and in which he still holds a roughly 30 percent stake.SunEdison did not respond to messages seeking comment.The timing of the email exchange found by FTI was important: It took place in February 2016, just two months before SunEdison was to declare bankruptcy. The four solar projects were not going to join SunEdison in bankruptcy court, meaning they would be free to pay bills without the prior review and approval of the judge. It also meant the court would not know SunEdison still owed McKinsey money from before the bankruptcy, which could disqualify the firm as a turnaround adviser helping to decide how creditors would be repaid.To make sure no one tries to remove assets before the court takes control, the bankruptcy code calls for a review of transactions within 90 days \u2014 and sometimes longer \u2014 of when the company files for bankruptcy. If some entity got money it shouldn\u2019t have, the court can order it returned to be used to repay all creditors according to the priority of their claims.The pleading asked the court to disqualify the work McKinsey had done for SunEdison, and to order McKinsey to disgorge at least $37 million in fees.Mr. Alix also expressed concern in the pleading that McKinsey had not offered sufficient and timely detail about its relationship with SunEdison\u2019s departing chief executive, Ahmad Chatila. Although McKinsey did report to the court it had entered into a \u201cbusiness arrangement\u201d with Mr. Chatila, during the bankruptcy, it described him then as a senior officer of an entity \u201cunrelated to SunEdison\u201d and did not explain McKinsey\u2019s role in the arrangement.In January 2017, Mr. Alix\u2019s pleading said, the company formed by Mr. Chatila, FTC Solar, bought an estimated $35 million in SunEdison assets for just $6 million.An email message sent to FTC Solar seeking comment was not returned Tuesday evening. The company did not have a phone number listed on its site.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Democratic Primary Doesn\u2019t Have to Be a Nightmare", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s talk about whose policy proposals are most likable!Opinion ColumnistA few years ago, when I was self-employed and had recently had my second child, my husband went combing through my credit card statements, looking for tax deductions that I\u2019d missed. I\u2019m financially disorganized at the best of times, and with a baby and a toddler, I was barely even trying to keep track of my business expenses. So it\u2019s not surprising that I hadn\u2019t noticed the hundreds of dollars of weird recurring bank charges that my husband discovered.Republicans, who under President Trump have been gutting the C.F.P.B., have long decried the agency as an overweening bureaucracy. To me it was an astonishingly user-friendly tool that cut through opaque corporate bureaucracy on my behalf. My experience with it shaped my perception of Warren as a brilliant policy innovator.If he runs for president, it will be with a single-minded focus on averting climate calamity, in part through an enormous investment in green jobs and infrastructure. \u201cWe have to have a mobilization of our nation\u2019s energies and intellectual capability and entrepreneurial zeal equivalent to our other great challenges that we have met, including World War II and the Apollo Project,\u201d he said. He added a line he\u2019s repeated elsewhere: \u201cThis is the first generation who has felt the damage from climate change, and we are the last generation to be able to do something about it.\u201dInslee dreams of uniting the country \u2014 including at least some of corporate America \u2014 against an existential external threat. \u201cThis is a moment where we can all be heroes, and all of us have a role to play in this heroic effort,\u201d he said. Both of these visions are sweeping and progressive, but they seek to channel different energies toward different, if overlapping, goals. One is full of technocratic optimism. The other is populist and pugilistic. You can\u2019t compare them using the frameworks \u2014 insider vs. outsider, head vs. heart \u2014 that usually dominate campaign reporting. Evaluating them will require Democrats to think hard about their highest aspirations, to decide what is most important to them, and most menacing.Of course, there will be other candidates, other platforms, other conceptions of what the country is and could be. As the race goes on, strategic and process questions will come into play: Pundits will ponder whether candidates, particularly women candidates, are sufficiently likable and ask how they might appeal to swing voters while turning out the base.

{"Headline": "A Blockade and a Murder: U.S. Faces Enduring Problems With Saudis", "Date": "2019-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking with unusual candor, said Sunday that the United States had tried but failed to end a Saudi Arabia-led blockade of Qatar, a crucial military partner in the Middle East.Mr. Pompeo made his remarks in Doha, Qatar, just before flying to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where he is scheduled to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom\u2019s most powerful figure, on Monday.Taken together, the comments underscored the challenges faced by the Trump administration as it tries to maintain its relationship with Saudi Arabia and build a coalition against Iran, while mitigating the fallout from a range of actions undertaken by the kingdom and Prince Mohammed, its de facto day-to-day ruler.The diplomatic split between Qatar and other Arab nations, which began in 2017, has been a problem for the Trump administration, especially as it seeks to forge a coalition of Arab nations to counter Iran.The Arab nations blockading Qatar say the tiny nation is financing terrorists, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close with Iran, all charges that Qatari leaders deny.Officials of Qatar, and the opposing nations, say the blockade could go on for years, and American officials now appear to be veering toward that bleak conclusion.\u201cIt\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind and not at all clear that the rift is any closer to being resolved today than it was yesterday,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in a talk with State Department employees at the United States Embassy in Doha, the Qatari capital. \u201cAnd I regret that.\u201dMr. Pompeo said he planned to raise the issue of the blockade with Prince Mohammed in their meeting on Monday, which had originally been scheduled for Sunday night, right after Mr. Pompeo\u2019s arrival in Riyadh.At a news conference earlier in Doha on Sunday, Mr. Pompeo said he would discuss the Khashoggi murder with Prince Mohammed to \u201cmake sure we have all the facts so that they are held accountable, certainly by the Saudis but by the United States as well where appropriate.\u201dThe prince has played a leading role in Saudi Arabia\u2019s policy with regard to both the Qatar blockade and the Yemen war.As a result of the intractable situation over Qatar, Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine general and former head of American forces in the Middle East, resigned last week from his post as a Trump administration envoy charged with resolving the blockade.\u201cWe were going nowhere on the Qatar issue,\u201d Mr. Zinni wrote last week in an email to The New York Times. CBS News first reported his resignation.The rift among key Gulf partners has frustrated Pentagon officials. A senior defense official said that each time the Americans brought it up, Saudi and Emirati officials would dig in more.The United States has told other Gulf nations that it will participate in a wide range of military training exercises only if Qatar is included. In all but one exercise, the hostile governments have allowed the Qatari military to participate.At a news conference with Mr. Pompeo in Doha, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, called his country\u2019s relationship with the United States \u201ca strong partnership based on very strong premises.\u201dQatar shows no signs of giving up on its commitment to the Pentagon, and the American military continues to operate its air base at Al Udeid, which houses about 10,000 military personnel.But Pentagon and intelligence officials say they fear that the split among the Arab nations will push Qatar closer to Iran.But Mr. Ibish said he did not foresee the United States breaking the relationship over any of those issues.\u201cThere\u2019s one country in the Gulf region that is large, powerful and shares most of our long-term goals about stability and security, and that\u2019s Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the list of options is very short. It\u2019s zero for both countries.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Politics Looms Over Empty Seats as Saudi Arabia Faces Qatar in Asian Cup", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABU DHABI \u2014 Qatar forward Almoez Ali joined a small group of record-makers at the Asian Cup last week, becoming only the fourth player in the tournament\u2019s history to score four goals in a single game. His exploits in his country\u2019s 6-0 thrashing of North Korea were cheered by just one fan sporting the Gulf country\u2019s colors.That was one more than team officials expected.The one flag-waving fan in Qatar\u2019s maroon colors Sunday was a South Korean woman who had traveled from her homeland to root for Qatar, according to Qatari officials. Two other unidentified men sat nearby behind a Qatari flag, a rare spot of color in a sea of white seats. The sparse crowd only avoided setting another tournament record, for the lowest attendance, because of two groups of fans bused in by North Korea\u2019s delegation.The soporific atmosphere most likely will give way to something far different and far more political when Qatar and Saudi Arabia meet to decide the winner of Group E. The countries have not met on the soccer field since diplomatic ties between the countries were severed 18 months ago, but the game\u2019s location in this Emirate capital adds another layer of tension.\u201cThat\u2019s almost more difficult to imagine than the U.S. national soccer team playing Iran in Tehran,\u201d said Neil Quilliam, a senior research fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at London\u2019s Chatham House, a British foreign-affairs think tank. \u201cThere will be some jittery people in Qatar hoping their players make it home.\u201dPolitical intrigue large and small is nothing new at the Asian Cup. On Tuesday, Palestine played Jordan, which has been home to Palestinian refugees for over half a century. A day later, Iran faced Iraq. Yemen, which is on the brink of famine amid a prolonged Saudi-led assault on Houthi rebels, is among the first-time participants in the event.But the main crisis at this year\u2019s Asian Cup remains the ongoing blockade of Qatar. The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have been in lock step in their opposition to Qatar, which they have accused of financing terrorism, interfering in their domestic affairs and growing too close to Iran. The countries were especially incensed by Qatar\u2019s support for a range of activists across the Arab world, including the political Islamists that other Gulf monarchs consider a threat to their rule.Local organizers and the Abu Dhabi Sports Council were not made available for interviews. Neither group responded to emailed questions related to the tournament.Complicating matters further is the tournament\u2019s television agreement. Qatar\u2019s beIN Sports holds the broadcast rights for the event, but several top hotels, including the guest rooms of the Fairmont, where A.F.C.\u2019s official delegation is based, and the hotels adjacent to the stadiums refuse to air beIN\u2019s lineup of channels.Asian Cup organizers have issued statements of frustration and threats of legal action, with little effect. In Bahrain, Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, a son of the country\u2019s ruler, posted a video on Instagram this week of his reaction to his country\u2019s last-minute triumph against India on Monday. His chosen broadcaster, made clear by the logo on the screen, was beoutQ. (The A.F.C\u2019s president is a member of Bahrain\u2019s royal family.)The broader dispute has been visible inside stadiums, too; at several, the partnership between the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia in opposition to Qatar is on display in banners that display both countries\u2019 flags and a set of shaking hands.Qatari officials and players have tried to play down the political cloud hanging over their presence. They say they are focused on improving ahead of the next men\u2019s World Cup, which Qatar will host in 2022.On Tuesday, Qatar\u2019s players appeared to be in good humor as they ran out to practice around sunset at a local field in Abu Dhabi, joking and teasing one another as a group of Spanish coaches put them through their paces. Apart from having no fans present at its games, the team has not faced any issues with the A.F.C. and local tournament organizers, according to a spokesman for the Qatari soccer federation, Ali al-Salat. But the players were briefed to avoid discussing politics ahead of the Saudi Arabia match.\u201cYou might look at it as special, but in our case it\u2019s not that special,\u201d midfielder Salem al Hajri said in a short interview as he prepared to join Tuesday\u2019s training session.Asked about the political implications of the game, Saudi Arabia\u2019s captain and its coach both demurred, saying those thoughts were for others.\u201cWe are thinking exclusively on the sports part of the game tomorrow,\u201d said Juan Ant\u00f4nio Pizzi, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Argentine coach. \u201cWhatever the surrounding issues, we are not entitled to talk about things off the field.\u201dAl Hajri and his Qatar teammates are guaranteed at least one supporter. The South Korean woman at the team\u2019s first two matches, Mary Lee, confirmed that she would attend. Her relationship with the team is a curious one; al-Salat said she has links to the Qatar embassy in South Korea.\u201cWe appreciate the support because she\u2019s the only fan who holds the Qatari flag in the U.A.E.,\u201d al-Salat said. In normal times, she would be joined by at least 2,000 Qatari fans, he said, but the regular flights between Qatar\u2019s capital, Doha, and Abu Dhabi have also been shut down by the blockade.Qataris now need special clearance and two layers of vetting to travel into the Emirates, where many have family members. But without direct flights between the countries, fans interesting in traveling to the Asian Cup would be required to fly through another country \u2014 typically Oman or Kuwait \u2014 as the national team was required to do on its way here. (Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family who leads the soccer federation, has based himself in Oman and flies in for his team\u2019s games.)Saudi\u2019s soccer federation, meanwhile, has secured thousands of tickets for its games, but their fans\u2019 presence has had little effect at a tournament notable for its paltry attendance figures. The lack of fans has created a strange atmosphere inside the stadiums, with loud music echoing around largely empty arenas and M.C.s who exhort those present to \u201cmake some noise.\u201dDespite tickets priced as low as about $7, even neutral fans are staying away. Several migrant workers, a group that heavily outnumbers U.A.E. nationals in Abu Dhabi, said their biggest obstacle was not ticket prices or geopolitical intrigue but something far more basic: As one Nigerian taxi driver said, he was just too busy.\u201cI\u2019m always at work,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walter Chandoha, Photographer Whose Specialty Was Cats, Dies at 98", "Date": "2019-01-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe kitten\u2019s antics \u2014 racing through the apartment each night as if possessed, shadowboxing with his image in a mirror \u2014 inspired the couple to name him Loco. Mr. Chandoha (pronounced shan-DOE-uh) was moved to photograph Loco and quickly sold the pictures to newspapers and magazines around the world.Taking pictures of cats soon began to look like a more fulfilling career path than the one in advertising that Mr. Chandoha had planned while attending New York University, after serving in World War II. So, after graduating, he turned to freelance photography for a living \u2014 and, by the mid-1950s, he had begun a long period as the dominant commercial cat photographer of his era.\u201cWalter Chandoha\u2019s cat models, shown on this page, must be alert, graceful and beautiful,\u201d read a newspaper ad in 1956 for a cat food brand that featured his photos. \u201cTo keep them that way, Mr. Chandoha feeds them Puss \u2018n Boots because Puss \u2018n Boots is good nutrition.\u201dBy the time he died, on Jan. 11, Mr. Chandoha had taken some 90,000 cat photos, nearly all before cats had become viral darlings of social media. He was 98.His daughter Chiara Chandoha said he died at his home in Annandale, N.J., where his last cat, Maddie, a brown, beige and black tabby, followed him everywhere.Although Mr. Chandoha photographed dogs, horses and other animals, he is known primarily for his cat pictures, which appeared in magazines like Life and National Geographic, on the cans of myriad brands of cat food, in calendars and in books like \u201cWalter Chandoha\u2019s Book of Kittens and Cats\u201d (1963) and \u201cHow to Photograph Cats, Dogs and Other Animals\u201d (1973).Mr. Chandoha grew up with cats \u2014 they chased mice away at his family\u2019s grocery store in Bayonne, N.J. \u2014 and felt that their personalities made them ideal subjects for photographs.Mr. Chandoha\u2019s studio photos \u2014 distinguished by backlighting that accentuated his subjects\u2019 profiles \u2014 portrayed cats and kittens in solo portraits and group shots as infectiously adorable and unusually well behaved. But, cats being cats, they needed cajoling to stay in place long enough to be captured sitting atop a pile of pillows, playing with a ball of yarn, staring plaintively into the lens, or appearing to chuckle or snarl.It fell to Maria Chandoha to handle the cats for the photo shoots in their home studios, in Huntington on Long Island and later in Annandale.Chiara Chandoha recalled that her parents borrowed kittens and cats from the local chapter of the A.S.P.C.A.\u201cWe\u2019d feed them first, and my mom would ask me to keep handing her kittens, and she would put them on a stool,\u201d Ms. Chandoha said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhile he was looking through the viewfinder, she\u2019d distract them with a feather or a noise. Sometimes you\u2019d get the shot in 10 minutes, sometimes in two days.\u201dWalter George Chandoha was born in Bayonne on Nov. 30, 1920. His parents, Sam and Pauline (Tychy) Chandoha, were Ukrainian immigrants.Walter began taking pictures with his family\u2019s folding Kodak camera. He learned the fundamentals of darkroom work at the Lens Club in Bayonne. A $12-a-week job after high school as a photographer\u2019s assistant in Manhattan further developed his photographic and darkroom skills.In 1949 he married Maria Ratti, met Loco and graduated. His cat pictures won contests \u2014 in one case he took home a $10 prize from The Brooklyn Eagle for a shot of two kittens appearing to escape over a wall \u2014 and were seen in various newspapers. His early success led him to resign after three weeks from a job taking pictures for college yearbooks.One of his best-known pictures, \u201cThe Mob,\u201d was shot outside his studio. It depicts five determined-looking cats walking on his farm in Annandale, as if looking for trouble. \u201cIt was about time for dinner, and I called \u2018Kitty, kitty, kitty,\u2019 and all the cats came running,\u201d he told CNN in 2016.When they slowed down, he dropped to his stomach and captured their fleeting tough-cats-in-the-countryside moment.Another popular photo, which was used for greeting cards, showed his daughter Paula, then 6 years old, smiling, her mouth missing some teeth, and a kitten perched on her shoulder.After his wife\u2019s death in 1992, Mr. Chandoha focused increasingly on outdoor photography. Heartbroken, he felt he could no longer work in his studio without her; he began to take pictures of his garden and the outdoor cats on his 46-acre property. With his wife\u2019s guidance \u2014 she had a degree in botany from Rutgers University \u2014 he had been growing berries and vegetables for years, partly as a hedge against his freelance income.In addition to his daughter Chiara, Mr. Chandoha is survived by his daughters Paula Chandoha Amaral, Maria Valentino and Fernanda Chandoha; a son, Sam; and three grandchildren. Another son, Enrico, died in 1997.Until shortly before his death, Mr. Chandoha had been working on a retrospective book of 300 of his cat photographs, some of cats with dogs. It will be published this year by Taschen, the art-book publisher.\u201cHe was a freak of nature,\u201d Fernanda Chandoha said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe had congestive heart failure, but that was manageable. He was always doing something. He was working on the foreword to the Taschen book until nearly the end.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Limits to Democratic Actions Against Trump", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImpeachment? Tax returns? Jail time? The Democrat-controlled House of Representatives will no doubt investigate many aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s administration and life. But some of its most aggressive goals will be difficult, if not unlikely, to achieve. With the House of Representatives now under Democratic control and the gavel in Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hands, some of President Trump\u2019s critics are eagerly anticipating a surge of congressional investigations.But some of the more extreme or coveted goals of Mr. Trump\u2019s critics may not be imminent or even feasible. Here\u2019s what Congress can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 do to investigate. Logistically, impeaching a president or other top government official involves two steps. A majority of the House must first vote to approve articles of impeachment, which essentially serve as an indictment of the official and sets up a trial in the Senate. Then, two-thirds of the Senate must vote to convict the official to remove him or her from office. There are three methods by which lawmakers can penalize uncooperative people or compel cooperation.Congress can also refer a contempt case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution. But prosecutors do not always pursue those cases. In 1982, the Justice Department did not bring charges against Anne Gorsuch Burford, who was then the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, for refusing to cooperate with congressional investigators. Nor did similar refusals compel prosecutors to charge Joshua Bolten, the White House chief of staff, or Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel, in 2008, or Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in 2012.Additionally, Congress can file a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to enforce a subpoena. But this approach could lead to a protracted legal battle. For example, the case against Ms. Miers dragged on for 19 months and was ultimately dismissed.An earlier version of this article misstated the circumstances under which congressional committees may release taxpayer information to the full House and Senate. The committees can do so at any time, not only during executive sessions that are closed to the public.Advertisement"}

Now He Approaches It With Caution.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingNick Confessore, an investigative reporter who has written about social media and data privacy, has changed his tech habits after what he has learned.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nick Confessore, an investigative reporter, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.You\u2019ve written a lot about data privacy and the misuse of people\u2019s online data. How do you protect your own data privacy in your work?For search, I mostly use DuckDuckGo, a privacy-optimized search engine that chooses not to collect or save certain kinds of data about the people who use it. I use a browser plug-in from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital civil rights group, called Privacy Badger, which tells me when a site I visit is letting third parties look over its shoulder at what I\u2019m doing.So what do I do? Whatever I can. In my privacy settings, I\u2019ve turned off \u2014 or \u201cpaused\u201d \u2014 all of the Google services associated with my Gmail accounts that track me or collect my data. I never sign into another website or service using my Facebook account, a feature Facebook has used to track its users\u2019 browsing activities off the Facebook platform. I\u2019ve tweaked all the privacy settings on Facebook and other services that I can find.For all that, I have no doubt that a true privacy expert reading this article will laugh at all the things I\u2019m missing. And that\u2019s kind of the point: In the United States, and in some other countries, the deck is stacked against consumers.When I started reporting on Big Tech, a lot of the public criticism about social media focused on Twitter, a relatively small platform that happens to be popular among the American political and journalistic elite. Two years later, a lot of the criticism focuses on Facebook and Google \u2014 and Twitter is by far the social media platform I use the most.That\u2019s partly because I don\u2019t find the Facebook experience all that engaging or fun. But partly it\u2019s for security. Once I started reporting deeply on Facebook, I deleted all Facebook-owned apps from my phone, including Instagram. I don\u2019t know exactly who has access to the data those apps collect, but while meeting with confidential sources, I don\u2019t want to risk that an app on my phone might be sending Facebook my location.The social media app I really miss is Instagram. I always had a private account, and I accept requests only from real-life friends and family. So it\u2019s an ocean of sanity and genuine relationships compared with Twitter, which is a hell of random angry people. But when I log in \u2014 once or twice a week at most, usually on my wife\u2019s phone \u2014 I\u2019m now hyper-conscious that every like, thumb click and scroll may go into my permanent Facebook record.Is deleting Facebook an effective way to protect privacy?Not in the slightest. It may interfere with Facebook\u2019s ability to track you as a consumer. But almost every website you visit or app you have on your phone is to some extent tracking where you go and what you do. What are some of the tech tools of the trade for an investigative reporter? I don\u2019t do anything really elaborate. The main thing I do differently is conduct virtually all of my sensitive work communication over Signal, the encrypted messaging app. It\u2019s an easy way to have reasonably safe conversations with sources who need protection. More recently, I\u2019ve come to rely on LinkedIn. When you\u2019re writing about companies, it is an invaluable way to track down former employees who might be potential sources. People at companies will often describe in their LinkedIn profiles particular projects they worked on, products they developed or initiatives that the company conducted \u2014 often information that is otherwise not public.The most important tool of all? A telescoping back scratcher that I got at a store called Flying Tiger. I keep it in my pencil mug, and it is awesome.If you could invent a product to help people protect their online privacy, what would it be?I\u2019m going to answer this one the long way. The United States has no basic consumer privacy law. So every individual has to be in charge of navigating the entire commercial-surveillance-industrial-complex on his or her own. Which is to say, it\u2019s practically impossible for any nonexperts to protect their privacy in a meaningful way. The privacy expert Ashkan Soltani, whom I\u2019ve quoted in some stories, compares it to ordering a cup of coffee at a Starbucks and being told that the coffee may be loaded with arsenic, but that it\u2019s up to you to figure out whether or not the coffee is safe to drink.I\u2019ve come to the view that no effective privacy-protection product is really possible without clearer \u2014 and probably more stringent \u2014 laws governing what data companies are allowed to collect and what rights I have to control my own information. If such laws did come into play, it would open the door to interesting private-sector privacy solutions. For example, California recently passed a law allowing consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of many kinds of online and offline data collection. With such a law in place, new businesses can sell subscription services that would, for a fee, do all the opting out for you.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?We\u2019re a pretty analog family. Aside from the requisite phones, laptops and iPad, I don\u2019t have a lot of gear. Most of the gadgets we do have I don\u2019t actually like.Sonos is a great-sounding speaker with an inexplicably unwieldy user interface that makes me want to throw my phone out the window. (Hey, Sonos, why can\u2019t I just play my songs directly from my phone\u2019s Music app?) The Nest learning thermostats never seem to actually learn anything. (Also, the Nests give Google the equivalent of a couple of cameras in my home.)I\u2019ve shied away from voice-activated speakers like Amazon Echo. I find these devices extremely creepy. For now, the only such device in my home is in my older daughter\u2019s room. She really, really wanted a Google Home.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britain Needs a Brexit Insurance Plan", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithout a deal, the country\u2019s departure from the European Union will be a disaster. Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 I learned by mail the other day that Brexit poses a risk to my life insurance. My Britain-based insurance company, unsure about whether it would legally be able to cover European Union citizens like me once Britain leaves the 28-nation bloc, wrote me that it intends to transfer my policy to a subsidiary in Dublin.So far, most of the news and commentary about Brexit has been over how London and Brussels are going to manage their unprecedented divorce. Less attention has been paid to how European governments, companies and everyday citizens are wrestling with the hundreds of ways things will change for them at 11 p.m. on March 29, when Britain officially leaves the union, with or without a deal in place. My insurance transfer is just one answer to a particularly difficult question: What happens once the hundreds of millions of European Union citizens are cut off from Europe\u2018s most powerful finance pump, the City of London?At the moment, it looks possible that all this will happen in the worst possible way, with no arrangement in place between Britain and the union on how to manage the separation. Theresa May, the British prime minister, is likely to fail with her draft for transition regulations; too many members of the House of Commons seem to feel that her proposed withdrawal agreement, which she negotiated with Brussels, does not go far enough. But the European Union insists that it will not revisit the deal. With no deal, trade relations between Britain and the European Union would revert to the very basic rules of the World Trade Organization. These entail that neither side is allowed to treat the other more favorably than it treats other trade partners around the globe. If Britain steps out of the union without any bilateral trade deals, a customs regime would have to be installed between Britain and its European neighbors. In the interim, thousands of businesses on both sides, and millions of customers, will be thrown into a costly confusion. At least my insurer has a plan; many other companies are still struggling to find one.The old, once-amusing British headline \u201cFog in the Channel \u2014 Continent Cut Off\u201d could finally come to bear some truth, particularly for Germany\u2018s key industry: automakers. Within Europe, Britain is by far their biggest market. Last year auto manufacturers based in Germany exported three times more cars to Britain than they did to China, according to their trade association\u2019s data. The auditing firm Deloitte believes that the number of German cars sold to Britain could drop from 800,000 to 550,000 annually, endangering 18,000 German jobs.Brexiteers claimed that Britain could shake off the union\u2019s principle of free movement of people yet somehow maintain the usual level of free trade with the continent. Those were pipe dreams. So were expectations that as the hour of Brexit approached, the European Union would bow to Britain\u2019s demands.Despite the damage Brexit will cause in the remaining 27 countries of the union, they are unflinching in their message to London: This will be painful for both of us, but we can\u2019t let you change the rules. Germany, which sells far more cars to the rest of the union than to Britain, has insisted on this hard line throughout the talks. Germany doesn\u2019t want to lose British buyers, but it can\u2019t afford to undermine the common-market structure that undergirds its sales to the rest of Europe.And even if Germany were willing to budge, the more important question is where. No one in Berlin now knows what else to give to Mrs. May to overcome Parliament\u2019s resistance to the withdrawal plan. Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly asked Mrs. May for insights at the last Brussels summit meeting, but, as on previous attempts, got no detailed answer.Consider this, though: What if Mrs. May actually wants her agreement to be voted down? Parliament would then have to deal with the Brexit mess itself. And, as things stand, none of its members want a hard Brexit, either. Aside from the hard-liners, the closer the Westminster lawmakers are pushed toward the abyss of Brexit, and the clearer they see the horrors of it, the more they are coming to embrace a third option: Give the vote over Brexit back to the people through a new referendum. This would of course hurt the credibility of democracy. Hard-line Brexiteers would bemoan the betrayal of the majority who voted Leave in 2016. The rift that runs through the country could get deeper and even more difficult to heal.But it\u2019s either allow a second vote or face a free-fall \u2014 without a safety net \u00ad\u2014 into an economic void. Choose your poison, Britain. But before you do, take out some life insurance. I can recommend a firm, now based in Dublin.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

She recommends a 401(k), if your company offers it, or a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA).Don\u2019t sleep on credit. \u201cIt\u2019s true there are bad forms of debt,\u201d Ortega said, like credit card debt that is rolled over month to month. \u201cBut good debt allows you to leverage and build wealth.\u201d By good debt, she means credit cards that are paid off every month and on time, as well as federal student loans, which often carry a lower-than-average interest rate. How consistently you pay off these debts determines your credit score, and those who don\u2019t have a good credit score (700 or higher) end up paying more in interest over time, especially on big budget items like a home or a car. When you file your tax returns this year, take the opportunity to request your free annual credit report and do a financial inventory. Look out for errors or old debts you can easily get rid of (like that $60 you still owe your phone company, for example). Budget for family support.\u201cIf you are sending remittances home and that is going to be something you do on the monthly, it has to be part of your financial plan,\u201d said Ortega. It can also be a good idea to openly discuss with your siblings how you plan to support your parents, \u201cperhaps setting up a separate account where you all contribute,\u201d she added.A lack of financial literacy education means that many \u201cend up making a ton of money mistakes over a lifetime that are extremely costly,\u201d Ortega said. But investing for the future is \u201cactually what creates financial stability over time.\u201d Let\u2019s secure the bag in 2019, shall we? Here are more stories to read this week.

{"Headline": "Democrats Start Investigative Gears, but Slowly", "Date": "2019-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter two years of pining, Democrats finally have the gavels and subpoenas they need to investigate President Trump and his administration. Blockbuster findings? Don\u2019t expect them anytime soon.WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats, transitioning into the House majority, have quietly sent dozens of letters in recent weeks seeking documents and testimony from President Trump\u2019s businesses, his campaign and his administration, setting the table for investigations that could reach the center of his presidency.Clear targets have emerged in the process, and some others appear to have fallen away, at least for now. Family separation and detention policies at the border have jumped to the forefront. So has the acting attorney general\u2019s oversight of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But Democrats, after slamming House Republicans for their inadequate inquiry, do not plan to reopen a full-scale Russian interference investigation. They have also chosen to hold off on an immediate request for Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns.For eager liberals coming off two years of Republican oversight paralysis, the next few weeks may feel something like a game of hurry up and wait. Arranging witnesses and wrangling sensitive government documents take time, and most House committees have yet to be populated with lawmakers, not to mention much of the legion of lawyers who will do a lot of the work of investigations. The Intelligence Committee did not technically have a chairman until last week.\u201cThose people who are expecting some kind of Hollywood movie here are going to be disappointed because it is going be very orderly,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a senior member of the Intelligence Committee.Here is what Democrats will focus on first.\u201cWe are calling on D.H.S. to preserve any and all evidence related to these horrible incidents,\u201d the chairmen wrote. \u201cWe as a country can and must do better.\u201dAfter seething over Republican use of the House Intelligence Committee to turn an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election into an attempt to discredit the president\u2019s investigators, Democrats plan to quickly flip the lens back on to Mr. Trump and his campaign itself. But the panel\u2019s leaders have cautioned that their approach will be narrower than once predicted.\u201cWe are conscious of the fact that the Senate continues to do their work, Mueller continues to do his work, and at this point in the game, I would not expect the committee to announce an omnibus investigation,\u201d Mr. Himes said. \u201cThe time has passed for that.\u201dDemocrats on the House Financial Services Committee, under Representative Maxine Waters of California, have also been asking questions about the Deutsche loans since early 2017, and plan to press their investigation ahead with the full powers of the majority.Democrats are prepared to subpoena the records if necessary. Mr. Schiff said staff had already begun informal conversations with institutions, potential witnesses and their lawyers about records requests, but because the panel has not technically been appointed yet, formal requests must wait \u2014 most likely until the end of January.Mr. Schiff declined to name specific witnesses except Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Organization\u2019s dealings with Russia and to buying the silence of two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump.In an effort to parry Republican accusations of overreach, the House Ways and Means chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, has decided instead to try to first build a public case for why the returns ought to become public before he lodges a formal request. He plans to convene a hearing this month focused on presidential tax returns in conjunction with sweeping anticorruption legislation that includes language requiring all presidents and candidates to make their returns public.Whether the administration will put up a fight remains unclear. Mr. Trump has said publicly that he does not care if Democrats pursue the documents; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said he will defer to legal counsel. There is, however, scant precedent for this particular case: Mr. Trump is the first president or major presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his returns.Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, had a stern and straightforward message when he sent off 51 oversight letters to cabinet secretaries and Trump Organization lawyers shortly before Christmas: Consider this \u201ca basic first step\u201d and not a voluntary one.Other targets appear to be imminent. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, said she and Mr. Cummings agreed they would study what she called the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to manipulate the 2020 census for political gain.\u201cOur whole democracy is based on representation,\u201d Ms. Maloney said, \u201cand if there is a conscious effort to undercount representation, that is an attack fundamentally on our democracy.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Biden Has Paved the Way for a Possible Presidential Run", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "A series of careful financial decisions, and the creation of nonprofits and academic centers staffed by close advisers, would help a campaign-in-waiting.Supported byWhen officials at the University of Utah invited Joseph R. Biden Jr. to speak there in December, Mr. Biden\u2019s representatives listed a number of requirements for the appearance. His booking firm, Creative Artists Agency, said the school would need to fly Mr. Biden and his aides to Salt Lake City by private plane. It would buy 1,000 copies of his recent memoir from a designated vendor. There would be no insertion of the word \u201cformer\u201d before \u201cvice president\u201d in social media promotions.

BlinkenManaging directorFormer deputy secretary of state andnational security adviser to Vice PresidentBidenBy The New York TimesSo long as a campaign remains possible, Mr. Biden has appeared mindful of the political backlash against the last Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, for earning millions by speaking to private interests in the run-up to 2016, and for her family foundation\u2019s acceptance of huge sums from corporate and foreign donors.He has imposed telling restrictions on his moneymaking and fund-raising activities: Mr. Biden does not speak for pay to corporate, advocacy or foreign groups and does not consult or sit on boards, said Bill Russo, his spokesman. His nonprofits do not accept contributions from abroad, and the Biden Cancer Initiative does not take money from drug companies, he said.Yet Mr. Biden, whose blue-collar roots have been central to his political persona through six terms in the Senate and two as vice president, has accumulated millions of dollars through a lucrative book deal and selective paid speaking.He also has helped to start three foundations, a political action committee and academic centers at the Universities of Delaware and Pennsylvania. At least 49 staff or board members of the various Biden entities worked previously as aides or advisers to Mr. Biden, or held other positions in the Obama-Biden administration or campaigns. Their salaries and stipends consume a substantial share of the budgets of the six groups, including the philanthropic ones.The list includes Mr. Biden\u2019s sister and longtime campaign manager, Valerie Biden Owens, who is vice chairwoman of both the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Biden Foundation, as well as a paid consultant to the institute; Mike Donilon, his strategist across four decades and now the managing director of the institute and a consultant for Mr. Biden\u2019s PAC; and Steve Ricchetti, his vice-presidential chief of staff and now the managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Another longtime Biden operative, Joshua Alcorn, has been paid by Mr. Biden\u2019s PAC while serving as an executive at the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children.Mr. Biden declined through his spokesman to be interviewed about his post-vice-presidency. But several people close to him emphasized that he had built his mini-empire not to prepare for 2020 but to make a continuing contribution on matters of longstanding concern.\u201cThey planned a lot of this under the assumption that Hillary Clinton would be president of the United States,\u201d said Sarah Bianchi, a former Biden policy aide who is now a paid senior adviser to the institute.That said, some top staff members will undoubtedly decamp for a campaign if there is one, several advisers said. Whether all the groups could sustain operations is unclear, given that Mr. Biden could face pressure to suspend fund-raising to avoid improper influence.During the 2018 cycle, Mr. Biden maintained visibility with campaign visits to 24 states and at least 135 other speaking engagements, giving him a platform whenever he wanted. At a book-related talk in Missoula, Mont., in early December, he fueled coast-to-coast speculation about his plans by declaring himself \u201cthe most qualified person in the country to be president.\u201dMr. Biden has long been self-deprecating about his relative lack of wealth, compared with some politicians. He and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, left office with assets worth between $277,000 and $955,000 (not including their house near Wilmington, Del.), as well as a mortgage of $500,000 to $1 million and other smaller loans, according to a 2015 federal disclosure. The report gives values in ranges.Mr. Biden\u2019s only salaried work, according to Mr. Russo, is a Penn professorship that occupies about one day a week. Dr. Biden \u2014 who is writing one of the three books \u2014 earns $99,398 as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, state records show. Mr. Biden, who earned $230,700 a year as vice president, receives a hefty federal pension after 44 years of public service. The couple also receive about $66,000 a year in Social Security benefits and in other pension benefits paid to Dr. Biden, according to their last public tax return, from 2015.Mr. Biden has restricted his paid speeches to about 40 ticketed shows and campus appearances, according to Mr. Russo. Most have been shaped around a yearlong tour to promote his 2017 book \u201cPromise Me, Dad,\u201d a plain-spoken account of the final year of Beau Biden\u2019s life. It spent 11 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list and has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to NPD BookScan.Mr. Biden did make at least two corporate speeches, to conferences held by a financial services company and by the hedge fund led by Anthony Scaramucci, Mr. Trump\u2019s brief-tenured communications director. But he donated the fees to charity and passed on future corporate events, said a person close to him who was not authorized to speak by name.Mr. Biden has spoken subsequently at events for advocacy and partisan groups or underwritten by corporations \u2014 health care conferences; a banquet for the Charleston, S.C., branch of the N.A.A.C.P.; the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s national dinner \u2014 but not for pay, Mr. Russo said.Open records requests to public universities revealed that Mr. Biden had appeared at some without charge \u2014 Rutgers in October 2017 and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, last month. The Nevada school paid $225,000 to the Clinton Foundation for a speech by Mrs. Clinton in 2014.Mr. Russo and Mr. Biden\u2019s representatives at Creative Artists declined to disclose his usual fees. But his contract with the University of Utah, obtained through the state\u2019s freedom of information act, was for $100,000, plus $10,000 for the private plane. In an October email between university officials, one told the other that an agent for Mr. Biden had described that as a discount.The Bidens pay a staff of five to handle scheduling, media and advance work through a Delaware firm they incorporated called CelticCapri, after his and her Secret Service code names.Nearly all of the former vice president\u2019s closest advisers are attached to one of his centers, full or part time.Mr. Ricchetti, who has been gauging donor support for a Biden candidacy, is at the Penn Biden Center, a foreign policy think tank intended to give the university a higher profile in Washington. Others on the staff include Antony J. Blinken, who was Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser, and several regional policy experts.Administrators at both universities declined to provide budgets or salaries. Their presidents called Mr. Biden\u2019s contributions invaluable, particularly in luring dignitaries to their campuses. \u201cAmong our strategic priorities is bringing Penn to the world and the world to Penn, and who better to do that?\u201d said Amy Gutmann, Penn\u2019s president.Mr. Biden\u2019s PAC, American Possibilities, is led by Greg Schultz, a political operative who served as his senior White House adviser. The committee paid him $225,000 over 18 months, records show.The PAC raised $2.5 million during the 2018 midterm cycle from contributors who included the technology entrepreneur Sean Parker and the Hollywood producers Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. But only 21 percent of its spending was distributed to Democratic candidates and committees \u2014 more than 120 in all \u2014 while the rest went to salaries and expenses like Mr. Biden\u2019s travel.There is modest overlap between Mr. Biden\u2019s political donors and the benefactors of the Biden Foundation, the only of his nonprofits that has voluntarily disclosed its donors. Notable is Tim Gill, a Colorado software entrepreneur and influential gay-rights activist, who, with his husband, is listed as giving at least $1 million to the foundation, as well as the maximum $10,000 each to the PAC.\u201cThese are people who have been with him doing these kinds of things throughout his career,\u201d Mr. Russo said.The Biden nonprofits are not traditional grant-makers, and the only one made by the Biden Foundation was nearly $500,000 to spin off the cancer initiative. That group took in $3.9 million in 2017, including three gifts from undisclosed donors worth at least $1 million, according to tax filings.It spent $1.8 million, more than three-fourths of it on salaries and other compensation. That included Mr. Simon\u2019s package and a projected $292,500 for the vice president, Danielle Carnival, who had worked on cancer policy in the Obama White House.At the Beau Biden Foundation, based in Wilmington, Del., salaries accounted for 45 percent of spending in 2016 and 2017, while grants accounted for less than 1 percent.Those around Mr. Biden would not speculate about what might happen to the groups if he entered the 2020 race. But at least one set of plans has already been shelved.Then Donald J. Trump was elected, perversely reviving Mr. Biden\u2019s three-decade dream of winning the presidency, a job that comes with its own library. \u201cSince that time,\u201d said Mark Gitenstein, the foundation\u2019s president, \u201cthe board of the Biden Foundation determined that was no longer a relevant objective.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.Follow Kevin Sack on Twitter at @ksacknyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Indefinitely Postpones Testimony to Congress", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael D. Cohen, the former personal lawyer and fixer for President Trump, indefinitely postponed his congressional testimony set for next month, his lawyer said on Wednesday, depriving House Democrats of one of their first big spectacles in their plans to aggressively investigate the Trump administration.Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny J. Davis cited verbal attacks from Mr. Trump, who had begun suggesting after Mr. Cohen agreed to testify that one of his relatives be investigated for unspecified crimes.Democrats called the president\u2019s attacks \u201ctextbook mob tactics\u201d of coercion. \u201cThe most upsetting thing about all of this is the fact that Mr. Cohen was intimidated,\u201d Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the House Oversight Committee who had invited Mr. Cohen to testify, said in an interview. \u201cAnd not only was he intimidated, but he believes his family also has been intimidated and threatened.\u201dMr. Trump denied the charge, telling reporters at the White House that Mr. Cohen, who was sentenced last month to three years in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes, was \u201cthreatened by the truth.\u201dMr. Cohen\u2019s deferral also put House Democrats in an awkward position. They must decide whether to force Mr. Cohen to testify despite his concerns about security or walk away altogether from a hearing that they held out as the first marquee moment in their plan to showcase their aggressive oversight of Mr. Trump and his administration.Mr. Cummings said he would decide soon whether to subpoena Mr. Cohen to compel his testimony or if he will allow him to testify behind closed doors. Mr. Cohen is due to report to prison on March 6.Privately, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides had predicted that Mr. Cohen would back out of his appearance on Capitol Hill as Republicans prepared to raise questions about his character, including asking questions about his work before he joined the Trump Organization and his own antagonism toward reporters while he worked for Mr. Trump.The president has repeatedly suggested on Twitter that Mr. Cohen\u2019s family members be scrutinized. In a recent interview with Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News host and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred interviewers, he called for Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law to be investigated without citing details.Mr. Trump has referenced the Eastern European background of Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, to imply that Mr. Shusterman has ties to organized crime. No evidence has emerged to back up that suggestion. Mr. Shusterman was sentenced to probation after pleading guilty in 1993, a year before Mr. Cohen married his daughter, to cashing $5.5 million in checks to evade federal reporting requirements. It is not clear that Mr. Trump is aware of that case.A retiree, Mr. Shusterman emigrated to the United States in the early 1970s after facing anti-Jewish persecution in Soviet-controlled Ukraine, Mr. Cohen has told friends.Mr. Trump has also suggested the men have significant financial ties, which Mr. Cohen has denied. The president\u2019s interview with Ms. Pirro prompted a rare statement from House Democrats cautioning that any effort to discourage or influence witness testimony before Congress could be construed as a crime.The president\u2019s allies in Congress dismissed the notion that his attacks constituted a threat to Mr. Cohen. \u201cEveryone knows it wasn\u2019t witness intimidation \u2014 c\u2019mon,\u201d Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight Committee, said in a brief interview. \u201cIf he comes, we\u2019ll be ready. If he doesn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t.\u201dMr. Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and another close ally of the president, indicated in a letter this week seeking documents from Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Guy Petrillo, that his client would face aggressive questioning from House Republicans.Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have acknowledged privately for months that Mr. Cohen\u2019s willingness to reveal the details of his work for Mr. Trump to prosecutors and the public stands as one of the most significant threats to the Trump presidency. In pleading guilty last year to helping arrange hush payments during the campaign to women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump, Mr. Cohen implicated the president, and prosecutors later said Mr. Trump directed the payments. The president has acknowledged that the money for the payments came from him after initially denying that he knew about them.Mr. Cohen was also central to the Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in Moscow, trying to secure permits for the plan during the 2016 presidential race. Mr. Mueller is scrutinizing the plan as part of his investigation into possible ties between Trump associates and Russia\u2019s election interference.Late last year, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress by testifying to congressional investigators that work on the project ended by January 2016. Prosecutors have said that negotiations continued until at least June of that year, and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged this weekend that they went on through the election, though he later sought to distance himself from that assertion.The project has gained renewed attention in recent days \u2014 and Mr. Trump and his lawyer began attacking Mr. Cohen again \u2014 after a disputed report last week by BuzzFeed News said that Mr. Mueller had evidence that Mr. Trump personally directed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about the project. In a rare statement, a spokesman for Mr. Mueller called the article \u201cinaccurate.\u201dMr. Cohen has spent more than 70 hours in interviews with investigators for the Southern District of New York who prosecuted the campaign finance violations and for Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign.Once one of Mr. Trump\u2019s loyal aides, Mr. Cohen fell out of favor with the president after pleading guilty in August to campaign finance violations and financial crimes. The president, who had urged Mr. Cohen to stay \u201cstrong\u201d when federal agents raided his apartment, hotel room and office in April, switched gears and branded Mr. Cohen a convicted liar, weak and even a \u201crat.\u201dMr. Davis compared Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on his client to a scene from the second \u201cGodfather\u201d movie and said that Mr. Trump was aware that Mr. Cohen\u2019s \u201cvulnerability\u201d is his concern for his family.The statements by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani, who have accused Mr. Cohen of lying to get a reduced sentence, would most likely amount to sufficient evidence of witness tampering, according to legal experts, though they cautioned that prosecutors would bring such a case only if they viewed the tampering as part of a larger pattern of obstructive behavior. And a longstanding Justice Department view has held that a sitting president cannot be indicted.For prosecutors to gain a conviction, they need to show only an attempt to influence testimony, not that the witness was actually deterred from speaking, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior Justice Department and F.B.I. official.\u201cEven if Cohen said the comments did not intimidate him, and that he would testify, those comments could still constitute witness tampering,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \u201cThe statute criminalizes the conduct of those who attempt to intimidate witnesses, not just those who succeed.\u201dNicholas Fandos and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Have We Had Enough of the Imperial Presidency Yet?", "Date": "2019-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven a feeble president can impose his will on the nation if he lacks any sense of restraint or respect for political norms and guardrails. Mr. Kruse and Mr. Zelizer are the authors of \u201cFault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.\u201d For all his bluster, Donald Trump is generally seen by presidential observers as a shockingly weak president. Brought to office in an election in which he lost the popular vote, his approval ratings have remained consistently low. Even with his party in control of the White House and Congress for two years, beyond a typical Republican tax cut, Mr. Trump failed to secure a signature legislative accomplishment. The president may seem weak, but the presidency remains strong. Mr. Trump has illustrated that even a feeble commander in chief can impose his will on the nation if he lacks any sense of restraint or respect for political norms and guardrails. True, Mr. Trump has not been able to run roughshod over Congress or ignore the constraints of the federal courts. But he has been able to inflict extensive damage on our political institutions and public culture. He has used his power to aggravate, rather than calm, the fault lines that have divided our country.His \u201cwall\u201d government shutdown is the latest example of his misuse of executive power. To end this essentially pointless standoff of his own making, he is exploring the use of national emergency powers to build a wall Congress and a majority of the public don\u2019t want.The Trump administration has provided a new example of an old concept: the \u201cimperial presidency.\u201d That term, famously used by the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1973 to describe the excesses and abuses of the Nixon White House, fell out of use almost as soon as President Richard Nixon fell from grace. The reckoning of Watergate and the first-ever resignation of a president seemed to show that the executive branch was not as uncontrollable as it had once seemed. Congress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.The National Emergencies Act of 1976 authorized the president to initiate emergency powers of government, but with the condition that he or she specify the particular provisions in detail. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president\u2019s power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.Despite these reforms, four decades later, the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d still seems to be alive and well. What went wrong?The most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support. Since the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one\u2019s own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.Republicans have done much in the same vein, in moments of divided and united government alike. Republicans have also gone a step further to protect the party\u2019s electoral interests through the use of, for instance, strict voter-ID laws. Aggressive presidents also depend on a partisan media to do their work without too much pushback. President Trump has demonstrated how this could be turned into a powerful tool for the White House. Mr. Trump has routinely repeated stories seen on the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d morning program and leaned on conservative cable hosts like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs for advice as well. Indeed, the line between the Trump White House and conservative media outlets has become blurred beyond recognition. The former CNBC host Larry Kudlow now serves as head of the National Economic Council, while the former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Heather Nauert has been nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Bill Shine, a former executive at Fox News, now runs the White House Communications Office. The imperial presidency is, in many ways, propped up by media partisans who insist that the naked emperor has glorious new clothes.Mr. Trump has revealed that the president can act \u201cimperially\u201d because norms matter as much as rules and procedure. The reformers of the 1970s missed the ways in which reforms simply cannot restrain a president who doesn\u2019t care about institutions. The most important source of presidential restraint has been the character of the person in office. For all his flaws, Mr. Nixon was unwilling to tear down the government to save himself. Mr. Trump has revealed that when a president is willing to cross what seemed to be clear lines, no one is there to hold him back.With Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the Mueller investigation seemingly coming to a conclusion as well, Mr. Trump will likely be held to account, in one form or another. But it\u2019s important to remember that the \u201cimperial presidency\u201d will outlive any one president unless more is done to institute real checks and balances on the office itself.Congress has the most effective means of putting new limits on the White House through oversight. Many of the tools that Congress needs are right in front of it \u2014 holding serious hearings about the material in a Mueller report or making sure that legislation like the National Emergency Act is enforced \u2014 but it must use them.If Mr. Trump invokes emergency power to build a wall, Congress needs to respond by passing legislation that will take back some of the power it granted in 1976.Most important, reforming presidential power will fall on the shoulders of voters. In the end, the most effective check on presidential power is to elect presidents who will exercise their authority with some restraint and respect our democratic institutions. That is the choice voters will have in 2020.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s New York\u2019s Hottest Contest: The Race for Public Advocate (Really) ", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by17 people are running for the position of New York City public advocate in next month\u2019s special election.It\u2019s a job that few people know anything about \u2014 and yet one that nearly every used-to-be, want-to-be or current local politician seems to want.Why all the interest? Good question.\u201cLike birds flying south, a couple of times a decade someone makes an unserious proposal to abolish this elected citywide office and it goes nowhere,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cWhy would we not want an advocate watching out for all the people who don\u2019t have lawyers and lobbyists to get access to city decision makers?\u201dThe job does have its perks.Even though the public advocate has little real power and a relatively small budget, the office still functions as a watchdog over city agencies and an ombudsman of sorts for the public. The public advocate also can introduce legislation in the City Council. The job comes with a $184,800 salary, not to mention a driver and an office at the David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building. But for some, a different office likely beckons across the street: City Hall.Bill de Blasio used the office as a springboard to become mayor. Mr. Green attempted the same, but fell short. And Letitia James, who succeeded Mr. de Blasio to become the first black woman elected to citywide office in New York City, was able to parlay that experience and name recognition to win the November election for state attorney general. Her victory created a vacancy, necessitating the special election. More than half of the candidates are African-American, Hispanic or Asian.A better question might be: Who is not running?The field will become clearer in about two weeks, after candidates submit nominating petitions, which must contain the valid signatures of at least 3,750 city voters. Some of the less well-known or less well-funded candidates may not be able to get the necessary signatures in the short time frame, potentially narrowing the field significantly. The first candidate to successfully file gets the first spot on the ballot.But for now, there is a candidate for every taste. You want a candidate with Albany bona fides? Choose from Assembly members Michael A. Blake of the Bronx, who is also a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee; Daniel O\u2019Donnell of Manhattan; Ronald T. Kim, of Queens; and Latrice Walker of Brooklyn.Prefer an elected official with more local flavor? The candidates include the City Council members Rafael L. Espinal Jr. of Brooklyn, Ydanis Rodriguez of Manhattan, Eric Ulrich of Queens or Mr. Williams of Brooklyn. How about a Republican? With so many Democrats, it is conceivable that the traditional Democratic vote could splinter in multiple directions, giving a Republican like Mr. Ulrich a chance, or Manny Alicandro, who sought the Republican nomination for attorney general. Mr. Alicandro did not do himself a favor when he sought to insult Mr. Ulrich on Twitter by characterizing him as a \u201cCUNY graduate\u201d who \u201cisn\u2019t ready for this job.\u201d The comment was broadly criticized on Twitter. There are self-described activists like Tony Herbert and Nomiki Konst. There are people with affiliations to the former President Barack Obama (Dawn Smalls, Benjamin Yee); lawyers (Jared Rich); and former candidates (David Eisenbach, a Columbia professor who ran against Ms. James in the 2017 primary for public advocate, and Helal A. Sheikh, a one-time City Council candidate).With such a crowded field, someone could win with a relatively small number of votes, increasing the chance that a long-shot candidate could eke out a victory. There is no minimum percentage of the vote needed to win. That\u2019s a question that even some candidates seem to flub. Betsy Gotbaum, the second person elected to the public advocate\u2019s job, was at a candidate forum held by Citizens Union, where she serves as executive director. Ms. Gotbaum said she was floored when some candidates started speaking about eliminating student debt, while others mentioned that the office should have subpoena power. The public advocate has the power to deal with neither issue.\u201cI wish some of the candidates would look at the City Charter and see the duties,\u201d said Ms. Gotbaum. \u201cMany did not know and do not know the role.\u201dThe public advocate can refer complaints to the agency in question or conduct an investigation and make recommendations about how to resolve the complaint. The public advocate also presides over City Council meetings and can introduce legislation, but does not have a vote. And, if something were to happen to the mayor, the public advocate is next in the line of succession.Technically speaking, no.February\u2019s election is nonpartisan (although most candidates are Democrats), so candidates can form their own individual party label, leading to some interesting and revealing choices.Mr. Kim is on the \u201cNo Amazon\u201d line; Mr. Blake is running on the \u201cFor the People\u201d line because \u201cpeople don\u2019t feel like the city is working for them and we are not fighting for them the way we should, he said. \u201cAnything with the word public in it is not working the way it should: public housing, public transportation, public hospitals, public education. I think the public advocate is in a position to help.\u201dMr. Ulrich is on the \u201cCommon Sense\u201d line. Mr. Williams is running on \u201cIt\u2019s Time Let\u2019s Go\u201d line; Mr. Yee has \u201cCommunity Strong.\u201d Mr. Espinal has the \u201cLivable City\u201d tag. Mr. O' Donnell, the first openly gay man elected to serve in the State Assembly, is running on the \u201cEquality for All\u201d line.And Ms. Konst is running on the \u201cPay Folks More\u201d party line, because one of her issues is increasing the minimum wage to $30 per hour for municipal employees and businesses with more than 75 workers.The race to raise money will be critical in this sprint of an election. Ms. Mark-Viverito and Mr. Williams may have an edge because of their citywide name recognition; Mr. Williams also has the backing of the Working Families Party, which should provide plenty of volunteers. Ms. Mark-Viverito boasts $200,000 from her old City Council account, and she was the first person to turn in her petitions, which could place her at the top of the ballot if the signatures are approved.\u201cThere are three variables in this election,\u201d said Mr. Green, who has endorsed Mr. Williams. \u201cCan you get enough signatures to get on the ballot? What kind of name recognition do you bring into the campaign?\u201dAnother key factor, he added, is the \u201camount of money you can raise in a short time.\u201dThe Campaign Finance Board will organize two debates, with candidates needing to meet minimum fund-raising and spending requirements to qualify.And all this for a fairly fleeting victory: The winner is only guaranteed to hold the office for a few months. Under the City Charter, party primary elections to choose candidates will be held in September and those candidates will then run in a general election in November. The winner of that election will finish Ms. James\u2019s term, which runs through 2021.Advertisement"}

But this kind of binary thinking is a slight to history. Contributing Opinion Writer What would you do if you could spend a billion dollars a week on any cause, political movement or society-improving innovation of your choice and still have almost $20 billion left over after a year?With half of the family fortune, Ms. Bezos would be worth about $70 billion, solidifying a title she may already hold \u2014 the richest woman in the world.We don\u2019t know her politics or her intentions. The Bezoses have spent money supporting same-sex marriage, early education and help for homeless families. Jeff Bezos is a quirky libertarian, and his Washington Post has been a scrappy counter to a president who has made a punching bag out of the Constitution.But it\u2019s crucial that the Democratic Party, now going through another torturous fight between its soak-the-rich side and the progressive pragmatists, remain open to enlightened people of wealth.\u201cNo to the billionaires,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren said in the first days of her campaign for president. \u201cWe are the Democratic Party and that is the party of the people.\u201dHer brushback pitch was aimed at candidates rich enough to self-fund their campaigns, like Michael Bloomberg. But this kind of binary thinking is a slight to history. The best president of the 20th century, Franklin Roosevelt, was a product of dynastic family wealth, as was John Kennedy. The Obamas, with their newfound riches from books and ventures into the entertainment industry, will soon have the kind of money to draw snark from the socialist wing of their party.I know, I know: The last thing a country struggling with Neo-Gilded Age inequality needs is more influence from billionaire supercitizens. It\u2019s bad enough that the Koch brothers bought themselves a budget-busting tax cut and an energy policy hatched in their corporate boardroom. An 85-year-old casino magnate, Sheldon Adelson, now has more influence on American foreign policy than even the secretary of state, the Koch tool Mike Pompeo.But the Kochs pay for politicians in order to enrich themselves and to gut regulations affecting the polluting industries that made them billionaires. Adelson got a similar tax windfall for the millions he put into electing Republicans, with the added benefit of controlling the State Department\u2019s view of Israel.The progressive billionaires \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Warren Buffett \u2014 are a different breed of fat cat. Mr. Buffett, the third-richest man in the world, has been saying \u201cTax me more\u201d for years \u2014 or at least, \u201cTax me at the same rate as my secretary.\u201d Like Bill Gates, who is the second-richest man in the world, he has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune.Last year, Tom Steyer spent more than $100 million of his own money helping Democrats get elected, and he says he will drop another bundle on Senate races in 2020. Look what he got for his Democratic House: new members calling for a 70 percent tax rate on earnings over $10 million. Steyer, Gates and Buffett are going to get soaked for their political passions. And good for them.The same goes for Bloomberg. He also spent more than $100 million last year on behalf of Democrats, and ballot initiatives on gun regulations and climate change. This got him a kick in the teeth from the Warren crowd.God knows why George Soros continues to pour millions into promoting democracy abroad and going after hate speech at home. For that, he\u2019s a target of crazed bombers and a victim of verbal poison from the likes of people such as the actor James Woods. Just a few days ago, Woods called Soros a \u201cgrizzled old Nazi prick\u201d in a tweet. As a Hungarian Jew, Soros the boy had to hide from the Nazis.The ideal financing model is one perfected by Beto O\u2019Rourke. He raised $80 million, without sucking up to PACs or corporate donors, and nearly knocked off the most hated man in the Senate, Ted Cruz of Texas.I would bet that the time Ms. Bezos spent studying creative writing at Princeton under Toni Morrison did not make her want to build a wall or turn a blind eye to climate change. If her heart is open to benevolence for the greater good, then the least the Democrats can do is not close the door.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Ways Elizabeth Warren (and Other 2020 Hopefuls) Will Campaign When There\u2019s No Campaign Yet", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new year has begun, and so has the nomination process for next year\u2019s presidential election. But what do candidates actually do at this point, when the Iowa caucuses are still 13 months away?The Times talked to presidential campaign veterans, operatives and candidate surrogates about what the Democratic contenders will focus on in these early months. Few would offer predictions on which candidates would be successful, but they identified priorities that are critical in order to emerge as the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2020.Like it or not, the first focus of a new presidential campaign tends to be money. So-called exploratory committees, like the one Ms. Warren created Monday, are a vehicle to raise it. Given that more than a dozen Democrats may jump into the 2020 race, candidates who don\u2019t establish themselves as potential front-runners in the next few months can get drowned out, and raising a lot of money early is one way to show a candidacy is viable.\u201cSuccessful fund-raising is one of the messages that you want to have available to you as a candidate in Iowa, because it\u2019s an indicator of the ability to sustain a campaign as long as is necessary,\u201d said Jerry Crawford, who has led several Democrats\u2019 Iowa operations.The exact timing of Ms. Warren\u2019s announcement \u2014 Dec. 31 \u2014 is significant. It means that in a few weeks, she will have to report her fund-raising totals for the fourth quarter of 2018, which will reveal how much she received on Day 1 in small-donor contributions \u2014 a key benchmark for popularity for Democrats in the nominating race.Like Ms. Warren, candidates often announce their campaigns at the end or the beginning of a quarter, and the choice is strategic: If you announce at the end of a quarter and raise a lot of money very quickly, you can report an impressive total right away and help cement yourself as a serious candidate. If you announce near the beginning of a quarter, you give yourself almost three months to build a respectable total before you have to disclose it.Another benefit of a full calendar year of campaigning is that it provides candidates with ample opportunity to test, refine or popularize new messages. Some Democrats already have signature taglines: Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cNevertheless, we persist,\u201d or the Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown\u2019s \u201cthe dignity of work.\u201d Other candidates will be less decided and may try different messages to see what works.\u201cWith a field like this, I think there will be a lot of late deciders,\u201d Ms. Belin said. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict other events: Some people might stumble along the way. But it\u2019s important to really find your message and appeal to people.\u201d\u201cWe joke about how Iowa Democrats are like, \u2018I can\u2019t decide because I\u2019ve only met this candidate twice,\u2019 but there\u2019s some truth to that and I feel like that myself. I think highly of a lot of people who are going to run,\u201d she added.Repeated trips to Iowa can allow long-shot candidates to become better known among voters there, but top-tier candidates can also benefit from a sharpened message. Ms. Warren, for example, did not travel to Iowa before making her campaign announcement and will have to introduce herself anew to voters in America\u2019s heartland.\u201cShe has a reputation of having a tremendous sense of humor, for example, but I don\u2019t think that people in Iowa have seen that, and they need to,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. \u201cShe needs to develop a sense of what Iowa is, what the people care about and are concerned about. I think she could do herself well to do some of those quieter conversations, sit-downs with Iowans on her first couple of trips here,\u201d rather than big rallies.It takes a lot of people to get to the White House, and there are only so many who have experience running successful presidential campaigns. Nobody wants to start a campaign only to find that the best operatives are already committed to rival candidates.Ms. Warren will undoubtedly be spending a lot of her time in the coming weeks building a staff at least that extensive, as will any other candidate who decides to enter the race early.Candidates must also use the coming year to introduce and differentiate themselves on policy grounds, experts said. Retail politics and interpersonal relationships can generate buzz, but in a crowded field, substance will count for just as much as style. Some candidates have already released baseline plans around issues such as tax policy or housing affordability, but 2019 is a time for details.\u201cIn a crowded field, what will be important is the clarity of your vision and your pathway that you show people,\u201d Mr. Delaney said in an interview. \u201c I think what will differentiate the candidates is the person who can really convince people that they should have faith that my leadership can actually make this happen.\u201dOn a primary debate stage and in rooms with voters, a policy vision gives candidates an air of seriousness. Politically, it can also help a candidate shore up support among voters in more skeptical demographic groups. Ms. Warren, for example, drew praise for her focus on housing affordability, which she targeted at black voters, a key constituency in the Democratic primary. Other Democrats said they were looking to candidates like Senator Kamala Harris of California or Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, to see if their policies will tap into more populist, anti-Wall Street themes.\u201cBeyond Trump, every Democratic candidate will need to prove that they have a policy vision to address the deep inequalities of power and opportunity in America,\u201d said Heather McGhee, the former president of Demos, the progressive political group.She said Ms. Warren had, to this point, led the pack on progressive policy.\u201cElizabeth Warren is the Democrat who has released the most comprehensive ideas about restructuring the corporate sector to reduce inequality,\u201d she said.Every candidate has some sort of weakness or liability he or she needs to address, and those who enter the race early, like Ms. Warren, will want to try to get out ahead of it.Mr. Crawford of Iowa said, \u201cIf they\u2019ve got challenging issues, like that one is for Senator Warren, I think first of all they need to be prepared to discuss it.\u201d\u201cThey need to be very straightforward about it,\u201d he added.The coming weeks, before the campaign really gets underway, will be a good time to identify and even address those potential liabilities.Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congo President Didn\u2019t Run for Re-election, but He\u2019s Still in Control", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a rogue state,\u201d said the opposition leader, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.That was a little over two years ago.Last week, shortly after he was anointed president-elect, Mr. Tshisekedi \u201cpaid tribute\u201d to Mr. Kabila, describing him as \u201ca partner for change, not an enemy.\u201d\u201cKabila is in a very comfortable position,\u201d said one presidential adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cHe was very upset over the results, as we all were, but we still retain power.\u201dOn Sunday, the government came under a degree of pressure from the Southern African Development Community, which had sent election observers to monitor the vote. The group, which has stopped short of congratulating Mr. Tshisekedi, demanded \u201ca recount that would provide the necessary reassurance to both winners and losers.\u201d It also called for a unity government \u201cgiven the strong objections to the provisional results.\u201dMartin Fayulu, the opposition candidate whom many consider the real winner, is contesting the results and has filed an appeal at the Constitutional Court, demanding a manual recount of votes. Election officials deny that the vote was rigged and have threatened to annul the election if it is rejected by foreign powers, some of them openly critical of the outcome.Most analysts expect the Constitutional Court to validate Mr. Tshesekedi\u2019s election, and the inauguration is planned for Jan 22. What happens next is hard to predict.There have been few reports of violence despite repeated warnings in a country that has never seen a peaceful transfer of power, let alone one through the ballot box. (Mr. Kabila himself became president after his father, a rebel leader turned head of state, was assassinated.)The residents of Kinshasa have gone about their business, despite an internet shutdown that has now lasted three weeks. The government said the shutdown was intended to stop the spread of false information and speculation before the election, but critics say it was a move to prevent opponents from organizing demonstrations.The city\u2019s traffic is as chaotic as ever, and yellow minibuses zoom past billboards advertising skin-bleaching creams and \u201cAmerican water.\u201dThere seems little appetite for the sort of violent uprisings that Congo has seen in the recent past. Throngs of supporters ambled Sunday in front of the headquarters of Mr. Tshisekedi\u2019s party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, rebuilt after the attack two years ago. \u201cIt was shocking,\u201d recalled Dady Mutahali, 42. \u201cWe wish for these things to never repeat again.\u201dLooking ahead, the most probable scenario, analysts say, is that the Constitutional Court, presided over by Mr. Kabila\u2019s former chief of staff, will receive Mr. Fayulu\u2019s appeal but rule that it is unfounded. Mr. Fayulu is required to gather evidence, like counting tally sheets from thousands of polling stations \u2014 a task made even more difficult by the shutdown of the internet. It is unclear whether he can manage this in the limited time he has been given.\u201cThe court is controlled by the regime, and is going to try give the semblance of credibility to justice,\u201d said Israel Mutala, the editor in chief of 7sur7, a major news site in the country.Still, Mr. Mutala sees \u201csome form of change.\u201d Congo, he said, \u201chas not yet reached democratic maturity, but it has crossed a threshold.\u201dPierre Lumbi, an adviser to Mr. Fayulu, said in an interview that if the court rejected the opposition leader\u2019s appeal, the party would call for peaceful demonstrations.While Mr. Fayulu pursues his appeal, Mr. Tshisekedi, the son of one of the country\u2019s most prominent opposition leaders, is negotiating with Mr. Kabila. The discussions include a possible grant of immunity for any alleged political and financial crimes, according to analysts and some news reports.The government has denied those reports. And Mr. Tshesekedi\u2019s supporters say he is a strategist who is simply biding his time before consolidating power and making changes.Mr. Kabila has always denied wrongdoing, but he and his family have long been dogged by reports of fortunes squirreled away in offshore holdings. Some of his entourage, including the man he chose as his successor, Emmanuel Shadary, are listed on European and American sanctions lists.But the elections forced Mr. Kabila to choose between two opposition figures, and Mr. Tshisekedi was considered to be more palatable than Mr. Fayulu, analysts said.Mr. Fayulu had the support of two prominent opposition figures who were themselves barred from running for office, one for a war crimes-related conviction and the other for what supporters dismissed as manufactured criminal charges. One of them, Mo\u00efse Katumbi, a billionaire in exile in South Africa, was once an associate of Mr. Kabila but became his sworn enemy, apparently after falling out over a business deal.A Fayulu victory would have meant a victory for Mr. Katumbi, Mr. Mutala said, adding, \u201cThe president and his political family have made it clear that Mo\u00efse Katumbi will never accede to power.\u201dMr. Kabila\u2019s party dominated legislative elections that took place at the same time as the presidential vote. That gives it a majority in Parliament and the power to appoint a prime minister, who in controlling cabinet appointments arguably wields greater power than the president.Mr. Tshisekedi would be likely to make concessions, analysts said, such as leaving to Mr. Kabila\u2019s party plum ministries like the security forces, mining and finance, areas that Mr. Kabila and his entourage are said to have capitalized on to amass extraordinary wealth over the years.\u201cJoseph Kabila,\u201d another analyst, Adeline Van Houtte of the Economist Intelligence Unit, said, \u201cis likely to become the future Senate president, which means he would retain significant control.\u201dMr. Kabila may be forced to make certain concessions, such as giving up his vast holdings of land, property and businesses across the country, Mr. Mutala said. Jeune Afrique, an online magazine, reported that he is expected to remain in his presidential palace, while Mr. Tshisekedi would live in the residence reserved for the prime minister.Mr. Tshisekedi, for his part, said that one of his first actions would be to bring home the remains of his father, Etienne Tshisekedi, whose body has been languishing in a morgue in Belgium since his death two years ago. Tshisekedi p\u00e8re, as some call him affectionately, was so popular for having fought Mobutu Sese Seko, a dictator and kleptocrat backed by the United States, that the Kabila government worried that bringing back his body would be enough to set off a popular uprising.But few Congolese want to see a repeat of the large-scale violence that erupted after elections in 2006 and 2011, as well as 2016, when Mr. Kabila refused to step down after his tenure, limited to two terms by the Constitution, came to an end.\u201cThe Congolese aspire to peace,\u201d said Mr. Mutala.The economy has languished in a country that, paradoxically, is rich in natural resources, but most of its population lives on about a dollar. The killings of hundreds of protesters over the years have exhausted a nation traumatized by state-led violence and impoverishment, he said.\u201cIn the name of peace, they are ready to close their eyes on some irregularities that have marred the electoral process,\u201d Mr. Mutala said. \u201cPolitics in Congo is a game that is exciting, but dangerous,\u201d he said, adding after a pause. \u201cVery dangerous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Start-Ups Have an Unfamiliar Message for Venture Capitalists: Get Lost", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a sunny Saturday morning in New York a few months ago, a group of 50 start-up founders gathered in the dank basement of a Lower East Side bar. They scribbled notes at long tables, sipping coffee and LaCroix while a stack of pizza boxes emanated the odor of hot garlic. One by one, they gave testimonials taking aim at something nearly sacred in the technology industry: venture capital.Josh Haas, the co-founder of Bubble, a software-writing start-up, told the group that he and venture capitalists \u201cwere pretty much totally on different wavelengths\u201d about the trajectory of his business.Seph Skerritt, the founder of Proper Cloth, a clothing company, said that the hype around raising money was a trap. \u201cThey try to make you feel inferior if you\u2019re not playing that game,\u201d he said.The event had been organized by Frank Denbow, 33, a fixture of New York\u2019s tech scene and the founder of T-shirt start-up Inka.io, to bring together start-up founders who have begun to question the investment framework that has supercharged their field. By encouraging companies to expand too quickly, Mr. Denbow said, venture capital can make them \u201caccelerate straight into the ground.\u201dThe V.C. business model, on which much of the modern tech industry was built, is simple: Start-ups raise piles of money from investors, and then use the cash to grow aggressively \u2014 faster than the competition, faster than regulators, faster than most normal businesses would consider sane. Larger and larger rounds of funding follow.The end goal is to sell or go public, producing astonishing returns for early investors. The setup has spawned household names like Facebook, Google and Uber, as well as hundreds of other so-called unicorn companies valued at more than $1 billion.But for every unicorn, there are countless other start-ups that grew too fast, burned through investors\u2019 money and died \u2014 possibly unnecessarily. Start-up business plans are designed for the rosiest possible outcome, and the money intensifies both successes and failures. Social media is littered with tales of companies that withered under the pressure of hypergrowth, were crushed by so-called \u201ctoxic V.C.s\u201d or were forced to raise too much venture capital \u2014 something known as the \u201cfoie gras effect.\u201dNow a counter movement, led by entrepreneurs who are jaded by the traditional playbook, is rejecting that model. While still a small part of the start-up community, these founders have become more vocal in the last year as they connect venture capitalists\u2019 insatiable appetite for growth to the tech industry\u2019s myriad crises.\u201cThe tool of venture capital is so specific to a tiny, tiny fraction of companies. We can\u2019t let ourselves be fooled into thinking that\u2019s the story of the future of American entrepreneurship,\u201d said Mara Zepeda, a 38-year-old entrepreneur who in 2017 helped start an advocacy organization called Zebras Unite. Its members include start-up founders, investors and foundations focused on encouraging a more ethical industry with greater gender and racial diversity. The group now has 40 chapters and 1,200 members around the world.\u201cThe more we believe that myth, the more we overlook tremendous opportunities,\u201d Ms. Zepeda said in an interview.Some of the groups are rejecting venture capital because they\u2019ve been excluded from the traditional V.C. networks. Aniyia Williams, who started the nonprofit Black & Brown Founders, said a venture-funded system that encourages many failures for every one success is particularly unfair to black, latinx and women founders who \u201care rarely afforded the opportunity to fail, period.\u201d Members of these organizations, she added, see more value when whole groups in their communities thrive, rather than venture\u2019s winner-take-all model.Other founders have decided the expectations that come with accepting venture capital aren\u2019t worth it. Venture investing is a high-stakes game in which companies are typically either wild successes or near total failures.\u201cBig problems have occurred when you have founders who have unwillingly or unknowingly signed on for an outcome they didn\u2019t know they were signing on for,\u201d said Josh Kopelman, a venture investor at First Round Capital, an early backer of Uber, Warby Parker and Ring.He said he was happy that companies were embracing alternatives to venture capital. \u201cI sell jet fuel,\u201d he said, \u201cand some people don\u2019t want to build a jet.\u201dRight now, that jet fuel seems unlimited. Venture capital investments into United States-based companies ballooned to $99.5 billion in 2018, the highest level since 2000, according to CB Insights, a data provider. And the investments have expanded beyond software and hardware into anything that is tech-adjacent \u2014 dog walking, health care, coffee shops, farming, electric toothbrushes.But people like Sandra Oh Lin, the chief executive of KiwiCo, a seller of children\u2019s activity kits, say that more money isn\u2019t necessary. Ms. Oh Lin raised a little over $10 million in venture funding between 2012 and 2014, but she is now rebuffing offers of more just as her company has hit on a product people want \u2014 the very moment when investors would love to pour more gas on the fire. KiwiCo is profitable and had nearly $100 million in sales in 2018, a 65 percent increase over the prior year, Ms. Oh Lin said.\u201cWe are aggressive about growth, but we are not a company that chases growth at all costs,\u201d Ms. Oh Lin said. \u201cWe want to build a company that lasts.\u201dEntrepreneurs are even finding ways to undo money they took from venture capital funds. Wistia, a video software company, used debt to buy out its investors last summer, declaring a desire to pursue sustainable, profitable growth. Buffer, a social media-focused software company, used its profits to do the same in August. Afterward, Joel Gascoigne, its co-founder and chief executive, received more than 100 emails from other founders who were inspired \u2014 or jealous.\u201cThe V.C. path forces you into this binary outcome of acquisition or I.P.O., or pretty much bust,\u201d Mr. Gascoigne said. \u201cPeople are starting to question that.\u201dVenture capital wasn\u2019t always the default way to grow a company. But in the last decade, its gospel of technological disruption has infiltrated every corner of the business world. Old-line companies from Campbell Soup to General Electric started venture operations and accelerator programs to foster innovation. Sprint and UBS hired WeWork to make their offices more start-up-like.At the same time, start-up culture \u2014 hoodies and all \u2014 entered the mainstream on the back of celebrity investors like Ashton Kutcher, TV shows like \u201cShark Tank\u201d and movies like \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d Few questioned the Silicon Valley model for creating the next Google, Facebook or Uber.Those who tried to buck the conventional method experienced harsh trade-offs. Bank loans are typically small, and banks are reluctant to lend money to software companies, which have no hard assets to use as collateral. Founders who eschew venture capital often wind up leaning on their life savings or credit cards.Jessica Rovello and Kenny Rosenblatt, the entrepreneurs behind Arkadium, a gaming start-up founded in 2001, initially avoided raising venture money. It took four years before the business earned enough to pay them a salary. The sacrifices were \u201cvery real and very intense,\u201d Ms. Rovello said. Nevertheless, the business grew steadily and profitably to 150 employees.By 2013, though, as investors poured capital into some rivals, the lure of easy money became too tempting to pass up, and the company raised $5 million. Tensions ensued as Arkadium\u2019s investors expected the company to continue raising money with the goal of selling or going public. Ms. Rovello wanted to keep running the company profitably, growing revenue at 20 percent per year and developing a new product that could take years to pay off.In September, Arkadium used its profits to buy out the investors, allowing the company to remain independent and grow on its own terms. Ms. Rovello said she had no regrets about stepping off the venture-funded path.\u201cIf your end game is having a business that you love and continuing to thrive and making careers for people,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I\u2019m winning.\u201dIn September, Tyler Tringas, a 33-year-old entrepreneur based in Rio, announced plans to offer a different kind of start-up financing, in the form of equity investments that companies can repay as a percent of their profits. Mr. Tringas said his firm, Earnest Capital, will have $6 million to invest in 10 to 12 companies per year.Hundreds of emails have poured in since the announcement, Mr. Tringas said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re almost entirely from people who assumed there was no form of capital that matched any version of their expectations,\u201d he said.Earnest Capital joins a growing list of firms, including Lighter Capital, Purpose Ventures, TinySeed, Village Capital, Sheeo, XXcelerate Fund and Indie.vc, that offer founders different ways to obtain money. Many use variations of revenue- or profit-based loans. Those loans, though, are often available only to companies that already have a product to sell and an incoming cash stream.Other companies are inspired by the investor buyouts executed by Buffer, Wistia and Arkadium, and are asking investors to agree to similar deals \u2014 at potentially lower returns on their investments \u2014 in the future.Indie.vc, based in Salt Lake City and part of the investment firm O\u2019Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, offers start-ups the option to buy back the firm\u2019s shares as a portion of their total sales. That caps the firm\u2019s return at three times its investment. In the typical venture capital model, the earnings for a home-run deal are limitless.When Indie.vc started three years ago, it saw two or three applications a week, mostly from venture capital rejects. Now it gets as many as 10 applications a week, mostly from companies that could raise venture capital but don\u2019t want to, said Bryce Roberts, the firm\u2019s founder.\u201cWe think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the one-size-fits-all venture model and want to cherry-pick the pieces of it that work for them,\u201d Mr. Roberts said.Privately, some venture capitalists have bemoaned the way they\u2019re locked into rigid investment mandates with perverse incentives. \u201cWe heard from many investors who said, \u2018I can\u2019t say this publicly, but I\u2019m in the machine and I know it\u2019s broken, and I know there is a better way,\u2019\u201d Ms. Zepeda said.Others have dismissed the trend, according to Mr. Roberts. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how thin-skinned and threatened V.C.s tend to be around people who question their model,\u201d he said.\u201cI think we should, as investors, take seriously our role in driving some of these destabilizing forces in society,\u201d said Rukaiyah Adams, chief investment officer at Meyer Memorial Trust, an investor in venture capital funds and nonprofits. \u201cAs one of the controllers of capital, I\u2019m raising my hand and saying, \u2018Wait a minute, let\u2019s really think about this.\u2019\u201dStill, the new growth models represent a tiny percentage of the broader start-up funding market. And venture capitalists continue to aggressively pitch their wares \u2014 even to companies that aren\u2019t interested.Notion, a collaboration software company based in San Francisco, has just nine employees and close to one million users, many of whom pay $8 a month. The company is handily profitable. Aside from a small seed round in 2013, it has avoided outside funding.Venture capitalists, desperate to get a piece of the company, have dug up Notion\u2019s office address and sent its founders cookie dough, dog treats and physical letters, company executives said. Every few months, a new investor inevitably shows up unannounced at Notion\u2019s gate.Notion\u2019s ambitions are big \u2014 the company wants to replace Microsoft Office. But its executives don\u2019t believe they need hundreds of millions of dollars in financing to do it, nor do they want the strings that come attached.\u201cWe\u2019re not anti-V.C.,\u201d said Akshay Kothari, the company\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWe\u2019re just thinking for ourselves, rather than for them or other peers.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the order in which members of Zebras Unite appeared.

{"Headline": "The $238 Million Penthouse, and the Hedge Fund Billionaire Who May Rarely Live There", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Manhattan, where multimillion-dollar real estate sales are downright routine, a hedge fund tycoon has managed to set a new standard for conspicuous consumption by paying a fortune for an unfinished piece of property in the sky.With a net worth estimated at $10 billion, Mr. Griffin, founder and chief executive of the global investment firm Citadel, is among the richest people in the world. And in recent years, Mr. Griffin has become increasingly willing to flaunt his wealth, spending lavishly on modern art, philanthropy and trophy real estate, even as income inequality is roiling the national political debate.Twice divorced, Mr. Griffin, 50, has three children and is primarily based in Chicago, where Citadel is headquartered. Through a spokesman, Mr. Griffin declined to comment for this story.He is a globe-trotting home buyer, leaving a trail of his pricey purchases, from a $60 million penthouse in Miami to a $122 million mansion in London.All told, according to a person familiar with Mr. Griffin\u2019s spending, he has spent approximately $700 million on real estate and nearly as much on art.But Mr. Griffin has given away about $700 million, according to the person familiar with his finances.Mr. Griffin has also donated huge sums to educational institutions.In 2014 he gave $150 million to Harvard University, at the time, the largest gift in the school\u2019s history. In 2017 Mr. Griffin\u2019s charity said it would donate $125 million to the University of Chicago, which would rename its influential department of economics after him. More recently, Mr. Griffin has turned his acquisitive eye toward real estate.Fellow financiers said Mr. Griffin should be applauded for his philanthropy, rather than vilified for his spending. John W. Rogers Jr., the chief executive of Ariel Investments, who serves on the board of the University of Chicago with Mr. Griffin (as well as on the board of The New York Times Company), declined to comment on his real estate spending. \u201cThe key thing is that he\u2019s decided to be generous now,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cKen is a role model for the next generation of hedge fund managers.\u201dMr. Griffin has cited his maternal grandparents as inspiration for his philanthropy. They ran a fuel oil business in Illinois, and when some customers could not pay their bills during the winter, his grandparents would extend them credit.The Harvard graduate made his fortune through finance. As a sophomore in 1987, Mr. Griffin began trading out of his dorm room using a fax machine, an early personal computer and the phone. Just three years later, he founded Citadel in Chicago.The firm grew rapidly, and today Citadel, which is privately held, manages some $28 billion, trading stocks, fixed income, commodities and more.Wall Street\u2019s compensations have made New York look like a Monopoly board come to life; there are so many ultraluxury residential buildings along the southern edge of Central Park that it has been nicknamed \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Row.\u201dThat Mr. Griffin is spending so freely at a moment when populist movements are gaining momentum around the globe struck some critics as especially tone deaf.\u201cThe plutocrats continue brazenly flaunting the excesses that have enraged much of humanity,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, author of \u201cWinners Take All,\u201d and a critic of wealthy philanthropists. \u201cThey\u2019re displaying very little awareness of the moment that we are in.\u201dMr. de Blasio, who has promoted himself as a national voice against income inequality, has struggled to address the issue, which is acute in a city with a housing crisis, poverty and extreme wealth. About 79,000 people, most trapped by out-of-reach rents and low wages, are homeless, a record number, and the most of any city in the United States, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\u201cYou look at these massive purchases. Does anyone think that these rich individuals can\u2019t afford more in taxes? They have been getting tax break, after tax break, after tax break. Before the Trump tax bill they were already experiencing unprecedented wealth and had a whole system of tax policy that was favoring them in every conceivable way,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThe Trump tax cuts put that on steroids.\u201dMr. Griffin questioned the Trump tax cuts in 2017, suggesting that they were more aggressive than what was needed to stimulate the economy. Mr. Griffin \u2014 who in 2012 said that the wealthy have \u201cinsufficient influence\u201d in politics \u2014 has given to both Democrats and Republicans over the years, though his fiscal policies appear more closely aligned with those usually promoted by conservative lawmakers. He has called for fewer regulations and lower taxes, arguing that such moves would help the economy.He was well-known in wealthy, philanthropic and financial communities. But Mr. Griffin is now known more widely as the man who bought the penthouse for the outrageous price.There was nothing ostentatious about the old building, the one that was mostly demolished by 2013, save for the sought-after address and the spectacular leafy views of Central Park. It first opened in 1954.A state law gives landlords the right to remove tenants from rent-stabilized apartments if they plan to demolish a building and erect a new one, showing proof of financing to do so. Residents received their first eviction notices in 2006. A group of tenants, calling themselves the \u201cSave Our Homes\u201d Association, held on for as long as possible, suing to stay, but eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.Connie Collins, a former TV journalist who worked at WNBC, was one of the holdouts. She recalled being able to see the July 4 fireworks displays from her 12th-floor terrace. \u201cI just hope one of his terraces doesn\u2019t get burnt from a spark because it\u2019s so far up,\u201d said Ms. Collins, 71. She said her monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment was a little over $2,000 when she moved in 2008. \u201cIt was a great time and an affordable time,\u201d she said.Cathy Marshall was also one of the tenants in the old building who stayed as long as possible; she lived there for 36 years. She was in a rear apartment on the eighth floor, so she missed out on the scenic views, but she enjoyed being on the route of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the New York City Marathon. \u201cPeople on your floor, if you were sick, they went down and got you soup,\u201d she said.\u201cI was very happy there.

He was in the city when the Sept. 11 attack occurred, and volunteered to help at the scene, Mr. Yu said. He added that Mr. Spindler\u2019s parents were on their way to Nairobi; their son would have turned 41 next week, and they had planned to celebrate his birthday there.The Gatsby Charitable Foundation said that Luke Potter, its Africa programs director, was among the casualties.

{"Headline": "China Proceeds With Belt and Road Push, but Does It More Quietly", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut China has turned down the volume on its plan, even though it still appears to be moving forward. Spending on the initiative also fell somewhat last year, as the broader Chinese economy slowed.Various senior Chinese government officials are at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, including Vice President Wang Qishan, who is to speak on Wednesday. None of them, though, participated in a panel during one of the forum\u2019s most prominent time slots Tuesday that was focused on the Belt and Road Initiative and billed as a review of \u201cChina\u2019s trillion-dollar vision.\u201dInstead, the vice chairman of a government-linked trade association and the chairman of a state-owned business spoke cautiously about the initiative.The panel on Tuesday seemed like an opportunity to recast the initiative\u2019s image to a crowd stacked with government leaders and tycoons from developing countries, many of which have borrowed heavily from Chinese financial institutions to build infrastructure as part of the program.But China took a different tack. Xu Niansha, the chairman of the state-owned China Poly Group, apologized for not having many statistics about the program, a rare occurrence given that Chinese corporate or government officials often lard their speeches and discussions with numbers.Speaking in general terms, Mr. Xu said China\u2019s rapid economic growth in recent decades had put it in a better position than many countries to foster economic development elsewhere. \u201cWe do know what people need,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I think we can do a better job in cooperation.\u201dThe most recently available data from China\u2019s commerce ministry shows that the value of newly signed contracts under the Belt and Road Initiative fell 20.4 percent in the first 11 months of last year compared with the same period in 2017. Almost all of these contracts are financed by state-owned Chinese financial institutions.(Frank Ning, the chairman of the Chinese chemical giant Sinochem, said during a different panel that there was a new awareness in China about worries outside the country over how its businesses make overseas investments. \u201cI think the Chinese are quite confused, they thought they would be welcome in other countries,\u201d he said.)The Belt and Road discussion was moderated by Tian Wei, a well-known anchor for the state-run China Global Television Network, making the absence of Chinese government officials, who typically shun panels with foreign moderators known to have criticized China, somewhat surprising.Ms. Tian repeatedly hinted at the resentment felt by some people in China about foreign criticisms of the Belt and Road program, which she said was helping to build roads in developing countries that need them. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about facts, let\u2019s talk about case studies, and let\u2019s talk about the real stories, not just hearsay,\u201d she added.Sitting in the audience was Xiao Yaqing, the government minister who oversees state-owned enterprises. Asked to speak by Ms. Tian, he suggested one possible reason for Chinese officials\u2019 caution when he said the Belt and Road push was good for Chinese companies as well as for other countries.There have sometimes been criticisms on Chinese social media, quickly deleted by censors, that Beijing was spending money on overseas development that would be better spent at home, particularly when economic growth is slowing in the country.China has been rethinking two aspects of the initiative: how it decides on overseas spending, and how the initiative is presented to overseas audiences. In September, Mr. Xi promised a further $60 billion for projects in African countries, but he made a point of saying that China would not pay for what he called vanity projects.Nobody thinks Belt and Road is fading away. Mr. Wang, the trade association vice chairman, said China would invite entrepreneurs to events next fall that emphasized business opportunities through the initiative.Among business leaders from countries like India that have been skeptical of the initiative, there are continuing worries that it will keep moving ahead, and leave them behind.\u201cIndian business leaders are concerned that China is building linkages around the world,\u201d Gaurav Dalmia, the chairman of the Indian conglomerate Dalmia Group, said in an interview before the panel talk. \u201cIndian companies may get left out on the resource side.\u201dKeith Bradsher is the Shanghai bureau chief of The New York Times. He has previously served as The Times\u2019s Hong Kong bureau chief and Detroit bureau chief, and as its international economics writer in Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Paparazzi Dogs and Rabbitgirl Conquered New York City Streets", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "Going around the traditional gatekeepers, Gillie and Marc Schattner of Australia have become the city\u2019s most prolific creators of public art.Supported byNew York has gone to the dogs, but the rabbits and rhinos aren\u2019t far behind in their assault.With little fanfare, Gillie and Marc Schattner, married Australian artists, have marshaled their brash bronze menagerie up and down Avenue of the Americas from Greenwich Village to Rockefeller Center, along Astor Place and over to Downtown Brooklyn. Their anthropomorphic statues \u2014 genteel Weimaraners, ladylike hares and gymnastic wildlife \u2014 are leaving behind indelible pawprints in the duo\u2019s covert conquest of New York sidewalks. And in the process, the Schattners have become the most prolific creators of public art in the city\u2019s history, to the dismay of leading art historians.\u201cNothing we\u2019ve done has ever really been planned,\u201d Mr. Schattner, 57, said during a December Skype call from their studio in Sydney. Improvisation is a running theme for the couple, who first met on a shoot in Hong Kong (Gillie was the model and Marc the creative director) before eloping to the foothills of Mount Everest for a Hindu marriage just seven days later, jilting their respective fianc\u00e9s.The Schattners are now full-time artists with a thriving studio enterprise employing 10 in the heart of Sydney\u2019s Alexandria neighborhood, with revenues of $5 million, they said. Their daughter, Jessie, 26, a photographer, works alongside them; their son, Ben, 23, is a composer and musician. And although the Schattners still paint, they are engrossed in their bronze statuary business. Their most popular subjects are \u201cDogman\u201d and \u201cRabbitgirl,\u201d autobiographical ciphers that represent the couple\u2019s personalities.Such candor has not endeared everyone to the Schattners\u2019 art, even when it\u2019s motivated by feel-good causes like gender equality and, in the case of the white rhinos, wildlife conservation. Gillie grew up in Africa, \u201cwatching an elephant being killed before my eyes,\u201d she said by email. \u201cI vowed to do everything in my power to never let that happen again.\u201d Marc spent time in Tanzania in his early 20s studying chimps. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t artists we would be running a conservation reserve in Africa.\u201dWho says they can\u2019t do both?Citing Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, the two define themselves as \u201cpopular artists.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve made terrible mistakes and have gone wrong in the past,\u201d said Mrs. Schattner, 53, explaining the fresh-faced pair\u2019s path to success. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost money and learned from that experience, but we\u2019ve also learned by trying things out, failing, and then trying something different.\u201d\u201cWe want to make work that makes people smile,\u201d said Mr. Schattner.There are 75 BIDs across the five boroughs. The Times Square Alliance was the first BID to commission temporary public art exhibitions, but recently smaller BIDs have begun to recognize the correlation between public art and valuable foot traffic, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the alliance. \u201cThis is something happening on a huge scale, with the trimming of institutional and philanthropic funding for the arts nationwide,\u201d he said.But it wasn\u2019t their art alone that beguiled William Kelley, the Village Alliance\u2019s executive director, when the two offered \u201cPaparazzi Dogs\u201d to Greenwich Village that fall. The Schattners volunteered to self-fund the project, as they have with every public art commission they\u2019ve done in New York. Mr. Kelley said he jumped at the chance. Less than two years later, the BID would also exhibit \u201cThe Last Three\u201d (2017), billed on the Schattners\u2019 website as \u201cthe tallest rhino sculpture in the world.\u201d (The 17-foot-high stack currently resides at MetroTech Commons, in Downtown Brooklyn.)It\u2019s an open secret that very few public art organizations can afford what they commission. Costs are prohibitive because city officials demand work be weatherproof, graffiti-proof, damage-proof and accident-proof. Multiple permits are usually needed, and artworks must be approved by a city engineer. \u201cThe Last Three\u201d cost $200,000, the Schattners said, which included fabrication, shipment, installation and de-installation. Even for a large BID like the Village Alliance, shouldering the costs of the single sculpture would eat 14 percent of its $1.4 million budget, which must also cover year-round expenses for street cleaning, public safety and business development for one of downtown\u2019s busiest areas.But art experts said the monetization of public art risks sequestering city space for only the wealthiest artists who can afford to bankroll their work \u2014 and saves taxpayer dollars at the expense of the field\u2019s diversity. \u201cWhy is it that one pair of sculptors in a city of thousands of thoughtful artists get chosen over and over again, if not that they have accumulated a reputation that is not necessarily based on the artistic merit of their work?\u201d Dr. Bogart said. She added, \u201cThe problem with the BIDs is that they go with what\u2019s familiar or think is popular.\u201dThe boards of the BIDs that commissioned the Schattners are filled with real estate developers and business people. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking someone who isn\u2019t a brain surgeon to operate on a brain tumor,\u201d said Anne Pasternak, who led Creative Time, the New York-based nonprofit, for almost 25 years before becoming director of the Brooklyn Museum. \u201cProfessional advising is critical.\u201dHarriet F. Senie, a historian at the City College of New York specializing in public art, said the Schattners \u201cwould not be considered serious artists with a capital \u2018A\u2019 and yet they have eight commissions? That\u2019s a severe imbalance.\u201dYet they could have had more. According to Mr. Tompkins, the Times Square Alliance declined multiple offers for sculptures from the Schattners. \u201cMy staff tells me they were very persistent,\u201d he said.Funding issues plague artists working within both the municipal and nonprofit worlds. Jennifer Lantzas, the deputy director of public art for the Department of Parks & Recreation, who worked on nearly 60 exhibitions in the last year, said that artists must often privately raise money or ask their galleries to cover part of the costs.Unwilling to go into debt herself, Ms. Shechet got creative; she entered a partnership with Kohler, which makes plumbing products, and worked for seven months at the company. She estimated that collaboration saved her $500,000 in labor and materials \u2014 all for a temporary project. (She would not reveal the exhibition\u2019s final cost.)\u201cCertainly, artists who have resources have a greater chance\u201d making public art, Ms. Pasternak acknowledged, although she pointed out that artists without funding \u201cmake guerrilla actions all the time.\u201d (Banksy is the best known example of this approach.)By appealing to a BID\u2019s bottom line, the Schattners may be setting a precedent for how BIDs work in the future, art experts say. After working with the couple, the Village Alliance created a public art program that requires artists to pay for their work\u2019s \u201cfabrication, installation, de-installation, and site restoration,\u201d according to a policy memo sent to The New York Times.Years of experience prompted the Australians to create their art loan program to woo interested organizations around the world. The artists\u2019 website details their sculptures\u2019 market value. They cite \u201cEarly Morning Coffee,\u201d a 10-foot-tall sculpture of Dogman and Rabbitgirl at a Melbourne pier, as a case study of their success: one million impressions on social media, an increase in treasured foot traffic, 10,000 Instagram and Facebook posts.\u201cI find art kind of off-putting and stodgy, but theirs is really friendly and engaging,\u201d Mr. Aisner said. \u201cYou can sit down and have a coffee with their sculptures. You can\u2019t do that with the Mona Lisa.\u201dThe couple says they invest returns from their studio operation into their public art commissions, breaking even. Still, the Schattners find the money to travel the world for research trips and site visits, to Kenya, India, Shanghai and New York. Their expansive online catalog provides a cushion, offering nearly 1,000 items for sale. It includes 349 sculptures, 308 paintings, 196 prints, and jewelry and scarves recycling images from their public artworks. Prices range from $5.50 for an illustrated card to $520 for a tiger painting to a life-size version of their \u201cVespa Riders\u201d bronze sculpture for $60,000.The Schattners have been known to sell public art once it leaves the streets, though they say the majority of sculptures are donated to permanent spaces. \u201cThe Last Three\u201d is slated for the San Antonio Zoo in Texas this year after its run at MetroTech.Dr. Bogart, whose three-decade career in public art includes a stint on the city\u2019s Public Design Commission, sees the Australians\u2019 self-financed investment plan as an evolution of an approach begun in the \u201960s by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Responsible for monumental installations like London\u2019s \u201cMastaba\u201d (2018) floating in Hyde Park and Central Park\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cThe Gates\u201d (2005), the artist-couple would spend decades fund-raising for a single project by selling smaller drawings and paintings.The important difference between the pairs of artists, Dr. Bogart said, is the level of outreach involved. The Schattners consult with their BID partners while their predecessors consulted with entire communities. \u201cChristo would come to everybody and do courtesy reviews with everyone,\u201d she said.The Schattners said they were blindsided by the criticism, pointing out that the sculpture had been exhibited in Shanghai previously without complaint.\u201cSeventy-five BIDs have sponsored some 147 artworks,\u201d said Mr. Chen. \u201cSome are horrible. Some are ugly. But do you hear about them? No.\u201dAmy Chin, a community organizer in the neighborhood for 30 years who helped draft the petition, sees the issue differently. \u201cBeing public, art has to be responsive to its surrounding community,\u201d she said in an interview. Ms. Chin added, \u201cThe BID had no public process installed because they thought the sculpture would be a gift to the community.\u201dBut is this gift actually intended for residents, or for businesses? \u201cMerchants are bleeding,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cEven if it was a Donald Trump sculpture, I would put it out there if it would increase foot traffic.\u201dThe majority of public art projects, including BID street art, must be approved by the Department of Transportation, the Parks Department, or both. These municipal agencies have boards and advisory committees that review submissions for permits, but Wendy Feuer, assistant commissioner for urban design and art at the transportation department, acknowledges that the agency had no formal art program until 2007. \u201cWe were sort of inventing it as we go,\u201d she explained. One mission \u201cis quite frankly to put art on the streets of New York City,\u201d Ms. Feuer added. \u201cWhile quality is important, people will always debate what\u2019s good or bad art.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a groundswell of opposition to what\u2019s going on with the BIDs,\u201d Mr. Finkelpearl said. \u201cIf I began to sense that people are upset, then we would look into it.\u201d Such actions might include consulting the city\u2019s Department of Small Business Services or commissioning a report.For artists simply trying to bring joy into the streets, the Schattners feel like the art world is disproportionately set against them. \u201cWe want to put a lot more heart into public spaces, more soul and humanity,\u201d Mr. Schattner said. Why should people be so opposed?\u201cCritics don\u2019t speak for everybody and certainly not for the populace,\u201d he added.\u201cEven if we get slammed, that wouldn\u2019t touch me if I knew that the public enjoyed it,\u2019 Mrs. Schattner said.Besides, the two Aussies have much more ambitious plans for New York. Recently the couple flew to Uganda to study the country\u2019s endangered mountain gorilla population for their largest conservation sculpture yet. One day, they hope to install a gargantuan King Kong on the city\u2019s skyline. Maybe their mega-sized ape will tower over Central Park. Maybe he\u2019ll splay across Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Schattner, with ambition in her voice, said the sculpture is still in its early stages.\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be amazing for New York to save the gorillas?\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified Jennifer Lantzas. She is deputy director of public art for the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation, not its public arts coordinator.An earlier version of this article and a picture caption with it, using information from the artists and the MetroTech BID, misidentified the organization that secured \"The Last Three\" sculpture in Brooklyn's MetroTech Commons. While MetroTech Commons is a privately operated space within the MetroTech BID, the BID did not secure the work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ivanka Trump to Help Choose New World Bank President", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s eldest daughter and senior adviser, will play a role in helping to select the next head of the World Bank, the White House said Monday.Mr. Mnuchin called Ms. Trump last week and asked her if she would be involved, an administration official said.Jessica Ditto, a White House spokeswoman, said Ms. Trump was asked because \u201cshe\u2019s worked closely with the World Bank\u2019s leadership for the past two years.\u201dAdministration officials are expected to begin the interview process for the job, which has always gone to an American, on Tuesday. The White House did not provide any names of contenders, but the official noted that one person whose name has been floated \u2014 Nikki R. Haley, the former United Nations ambassador \u2014 was not a candidate.Ms. Trump, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney will make recommendations to President Trump, who will nominate a candidate for the position. Member countries of the World Bank will then vote on the nominee.Traditionally, the American president\u2019s pick is accepted and Europe chooses the leader of the International Monetary Fund because both institutions were founded during World War II. Mr. Kim, for instance, a former Dartmouth College president and a global health expert, was selected for the post by President Barack Obama in 2012.In explaining Ms. Trump\u2019s qualifications for participating in the selection process, the administration official cited both Ms. Trump\u2019s close relationship with Mr. Mnuchin as well as her work with Mr. Kim.Last year, for instance, she helped start the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, a fund administered by the World Bank and branded \u201cWe-Fi,\u201d at the Group of 20 conference in Hamburg, Germany. The goal of the fund, which Ms. Trump is credited with envisioning, is to generate $1.6 billion in capital for female entrepreneurs in developing countries.Ms. Trump\u2019s involvement with the World Bank has drawn criticism in the past. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, sent a letter last year to Mr. Mnuchin raising questions about her role with the fund, given that her eponymous women\u2019s apparel and accessories brand could stand to benefit from its work. Since then, however, Ms. Trump has shut down her clothing line.But Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, still questioned Ms. Trump\u2019s involvement, noting that she holds trademarks around the world, even if she has shut down her brand. He said he had similar doubts about her husband, Jared Kushner, also a senior White House adviser.\u201cI do not believe that Ivanka and Jared have sufficiently divested their assets that they can participate personally and substantially in economic policy \u2014 particularly international economic matters \u2014 without risk of violating financial conflict of interest laws,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Democrats Warn Trump Over Comments on Michael Cohen", "Date": "2019-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three newly empowered Democratic House committee chairmen, alarmed by statements over the weekend by President Trump about his former lawyer\u2019s planned testimony before Congress, cautioned on Sunday that any effort to discourage or influence a witness\u2019s testimony could be construed as a crime.The warning, a stark and unusual message from some of Congress\u2019s most influential Democrats, underscores the increasing legal and political peril facing Mr. Trump. Democrats are beginning their own investigations of him as the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, appears to move toward a conclusion in his investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump.\u201cOur nation\u2019s laws prohibit efforts to discourage, intimidate or otherwise pressure a witness not to provide testimony to Congress,\u201d the chairmen wrote. \u201cThe president should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress\u2019s independent oversight and investigative efforts, including by seeking to discourage any witness from testifying in response to a duly authorized request from Congress.\u201dThe message seemed to imply that if Democrats in the House were to ever try to build an impeachment case against Mr. Trump, attempts to interfere with their work could be used as evidence.In court, he said Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to stop them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with him. He worked closely alongside Mr. Trump during his time as a businessman and candidate, and has spent more than 70 hours with federal prosecutors in Manhattan as well as with Mr. Mueller\u2019s team.As Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on him have intensified, Mr. Cohen has told friends that he is worried for his safety, though no public evidence of any such threats has emerged.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Mr. Cohen on Saturday, made during a friendly interview with Jeanine Pirro of Fox News, were his first extended remarks on the matter since Mr. Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony was announced. Asked by Ms. Pirro if he was \u201cworried\u201d about the testimony, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cohen \u201cweak\u201d and asserted \u2014 in contradiction to filings by federal prosecutors in Manhattan \u2014 that Mr. Cohen had \u201cno information\u201d on him.\u201cHe\u2019s in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff that I know nothing about,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd in order to get his sentence reduced, he says, I have an idea, I\u2019ll tell \u2014 I\u2019ll give you some information on the president.\u201dMr. Trump then implied that Mr. Cohen ought to be sharing information instead on his father-in-law, whose name he said he did not know.\u201cBut he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that\u2019s the one that people want to look at,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s the money in the family.\u201d Pressed by Ms. Pirro for more details, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, but you\u2019ll find out, and you\u2019ll look into it because nobody knows what\u2019s going on over there.\u201dMr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, emigrated from Ukraine in 1975. The year before his daughter\u2019s marriage to Mr. Cohen, he pleaded guilty to evading federal reporting requirements for large cash transactions, admitting that he had cashed $5.5 million worth of checks to evade disclosure laws. He was sentenced to probation after cooperating with prosecutors in a related case.Saturday was not the first time Mr. Trump has targeted Mr. Cohen\u2019s family. After Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to his crimes, the president said Mr. Cohen had done so only to save his wife and his father-in-law.As they prepared to indict him, prosecutors had signaled to Mr. Cohen that his wife could be implicated, since she had also signed his tax returns. That threat helped push Mr. Cohen to plead guilty to the charges, according to a person familiar with the events.Prosecutors have made no move toward his wife since Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea in August.The statement from the three chairmen was also signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman. Both men are investigating the president for various reasons, and Mr. Nadler\u2019s committee would be the body to weigh a possible impeachment.He has also issued repeated warnings about Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on federal law enforcement officials, including Mr. Mueller.In 1974, the Judiciary Committee included obstruction of congressional investigations and proceedings among a litany of offenses for which it voted to impeach President Richard M. Nixon. He resigned from office before the full House voted on the impeachment articles.A previous version of this article misstated Mr. Cohen\u2019s business relationship with his father-in-law. They were never business partners; Mr. Shusterman owned seven taxi medallion corporations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Bank President Abruptly Resigns", "Date": "2019-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe abrupt resignation, which is effective Feb. 1, could prompt a clash between the Trump administration and other governments over the future of the international body. The United States traditionally selects the president of the World Bank, which is made up of more than 100 countries, but Mr. Trump has taken a skeptical view about the importance of multilateral institutions. The World Bank\u2019s priorities \u2014 like combating climate change and engaging in foreign aid \u2014 also tend to be at odds with those of the Trump administration. Last month, the bank announced it would invest $200 billion toward fighting climate change over a five-year period.\u201cJim Kim had deftly struck a balance between keeping the Trump administration mollified and involving the World Bank in work on areas that the administration has been openly hostile to,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s China division. \u201cThe new head of the institution will face a difficult challenge in maintaining the institution\u2019s legitimacy and relevance while hewing to the Trump administration\u2019s open hostility to multilateralism.\u201dSince the institutions were created at the end of World War II, an American has led the World Bank and a European has led the International Monetary Fund. But there have been rumblings in recent years about changing that tradition, and some have suggested that if Mr. Trump makes an unorthodox selection, other countries on the bank\u2019s board could break precedent and block his pick.\u201cThe Trump administration folks have some hard thinking to do about the path forward,\u201d said Scott Morris, a former Treasury official who is now a fellow at the Center for Global Development. \u201cIt is not a given that an American pick will be the next bank president.\u201d\u201cWe appreciate Mr. Kim\u2019s service to the World Bank,\u201d a Treasury Department spokeswoman said, adding that Steven Mnuchin, the department\u2019s secretary, \u201clooks forward to working with his fellow governors in selecting a new leader.\u201dDuring his time at the helm of the bank, Mr. Kim worked to overhaul its structure, which historically was built around a model of rich countries financing the development of poor countries. Mr. Kim sought new sources of financing, encouraging private investors such as sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and insurance companies to contribute trillions of dollars for projects in places like Indonesia, Zambia and India. The strategy rankled some traditionalists at the bank.Mr. Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, also spearheaded the bank\u2019s response to the Ebola epidemic and the refugee crisis in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.Mr. Kim said that in addition to joining a fund focused on investment in developing countries, he will rejoin the board of Partners in Health, a nonprofit health care organization that he helped found more than 30 years ago. The name of the investment fund was not released by the bank.\u201cThe work of the World Bank Group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world, and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity,\u201d Mr. Kim said in a statement.Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank\u2019s chief executive, will serve as interim president until Mr. Trump selects a new chief.Advertisement"}

But deep down, you\u2019re not sure where to start. Sure, you can buy accounting software, sign up for a service or poke around your bank\u2019s online offerings for money management. But don\u2019t overlook what is probably the best option of all: a simple and free spreadsheet you make yourself.Never used spreadsheet software before and not quite sure what it does? Relax, using it to make a budget is easy, because someone has already done most of the work. Here\u2019s how to get started.Spreadsheet programs for home computers have been around for 40 years, giving developers plenty of time to make them more intuitive. Most have a version of the \u201cpersonal budget\u201d template \u2014 with the spending categories, design and formulas already formatted. Take advantage of them. Just type over the sample numbers with your own information and the software does the math.Open your program of choice and look for the \u201cTemplate\u201d or \u201cProject\u201d gallery. Select the template that best matches your needs, like \u201cMonthly Home Budget,\u201d to create a new spreadsheet.Once you open a template, you\u2019ll see the boxes (called \u201ccells\u201d in spreadsheet lingo) to fill in your own numbers. Gather up pay stubs, bills, statements and any other forms that show what you made or spent that month.Enter the information into the designated place. Along with your salary, your pay stub should show the money taken out for things like taxes, retirement savings and health insurance. Add in monthly expenses, like phone, credit card and power bills; car loans; gas, insurance, rent and mortgage costs; gym fees; restaurant meals; and shopping sprees.Once you have all your numbers punched into the spreadsheet, you can see two things. First, you have a line-by-line accounting of your finances for the month.Second, most spreadsheet templates give you added totals in your columns for income and expenses, so you can see your cash flow in action. Some templates even include charts to help you better visualize your situation.If using a simple spreadsheet to record your monthly budget inspires you to keep tracking it over the year \u2014 or take even more control \u2014 you can move up to a dedicated tool that shows spending trends, provides financial coaching and offers tips.No doubt, being diligent and updating your chosen budgeting tool takes time and effort, but it pays off.

{"Headline": "Veterans\u2019 Groups Compete With Each Other, and Struggle With the V.A.", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For generations, Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion posts have been as integral to American political culture as pancake breakfasts, town squares and state fairs. In advocating for veterans \u2014 among the country\u2019s most revered and coveted voters \u2014 the groups have wielded unquestioned power on Capitol Hill and inside the White House.Now, nearly a generation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the oldest and largest veterans\u2019 service organizations \u2014 known colloquially as \u201cthe Big Six\u201d \u2014 are seeing their influence diluted, as newer, smaller organizations focused on post-9/11 veterans compete for money, political influence and relevance.The newer organizations reflect cultural shifts in a smaller community of younger and increasingly diverse veterans who are replacing the older, predominantly male veterans \u2014 many of them having served because of a draft for now long-ago wars.The scores of upstarts include Student Veterans of America, which advocates on education and job issues; Team Red, White and Blue, which promotes service and \u201ccamaraderie\u201d events; and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, which focuses on the specific health and employment challenges those who served in those two wars face.Leaner and more financially efficient than their predecessors, these newer veterans\u2019 organizations focus on issues such as education and job training rather than on brick-and-mortar meeting spaces for veterans to gather or on resources spent lobbying in Washington.In addition, many officials of the newer organizations say, their goals are to integrate veterans back into civilian communities where they feel misunderstood and have lost ties, while helping civilians who have had little contact with veterans \u2014 active-duty troops make up less than 1 percent of the United States population \u2014 understand their experiences.Last April, Mr. Wilkie hosted a breakfast for veterans\u2019 service organizations that included representatives not just of the traditional Big Six, but also the Independence Fund and Concerned Veterans for America, which is financed by Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have backed conservative causes.At a hearing last month on Capitol Hill, some Democrats suggested that Mr. Wilkie was ignoring the opinions of traditional organizations on this law. \u201cA lot of V.S.O.s have talked to me about the communication within the V.A.,\u201d said Senator Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate veteran committee. \u201cIt\u2019s not where it needs to be.\u201dMr. Wilkie made his position clear. \u201cHalf of our veterans are now under the age of 65,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich means they have different cares, they have different interests. What I have done in my short time is actually open the aperture to the table at the Department of Veterans Affairs to bring in veterans who are not traditionally part of the system.\u201dThe shifts, while perhaps inevitable, leave some worrying that the hard work of pressing for the complicated and expensive health care needs, and other issues, will lack a generation of new leaders.\u201cThese smaller groups don\u2019t do policy advocacy while the Big Six have been carrying all the water,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, an assistant director for policy and government affairs at the Vietnam Veterans of America. \u201cThe average vet has no idea what these groups are doing on their behalf. They have a free T-shirt from Red, White and Blue but don\u2019t realize my 72-year-old boss with emphysema walks around Capitol Hill advocating for them on the G.I. Bill.\u201dThe first large veterans\u2019 service organizations, the Grand Army of the Republic and the United Confederate Veterans, arose after the Civil War, with new ones forming after each conflict to serve veterans lacking services.While there are thousands of nonprofit veterans\u2019 organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service, the majority of power has been consolidated among the Big Six: Disabled American Veterans; Veterans of Foreign Wars; American Legion; Paralyzed Veterans of America; Amvets; and Vietnam Veterans of America, which was developed after Vietnam veterans were turned away from other organizations.According to a study this year by the Center for a New American Security, a nonpartisan policy research center in Washington, nonprofits that serve veterans generate about $3.6 billion in annual revenue.While the older organizations control roughly 68 percent of total income in this market, the recent growth has been dominated by large post-9/11 organizations, which have grown in excess of 15 percent per year, compared with the 2 percent income growth of the Big Six. The study also found that post-9/11 organizations save their money at a rate almost 2.5 times greater than pre-9/11 organizations.\u201cThey figured out how to raise money from outside the vets\u2019 community better than anyone else,\u201d said Emma Moore, one of the authors of the Center for a New American Security report. \u201cThe Big Six are struggling with overhead. As the veteran population shrinks, how they end up dealing with the overhead of maintaining buildings and their structures is yet to be determined.\u201dThrough grants, the Wounded Warriors Project also marries legacy Big Six organizations with newcomers to build coalitions around issues like toxic exposure, which brings post-9/11 veterans into advocacy, and legacy groups into the future.\u201cCongress still listens to them,\u201d said Phillip Carter, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation who specializes in military and veterans\u2019 issues, describing the continuing clout of the Big Six. \u201cMembers and staff understand the political throw weight of veterans\u2019 groups based on their large membership and the degree to which they command public respect.\u201dBut when it comes to forming laws, some groups are clearly on the rise, like Student Veterans of America, which played a significant role in drafting a new G.I. Bill. These groups, lacking the large governance structures of the old veterans\u2019 service organizations, tend to be faster on their advocacy feet.Many of the new groups steer away from lobbying on Capitol Hill, and have turned instead to community services, running races and other activities meant not to connect veterans to one another as much as to the rest of the communities they have rejoined.\u201cMany post-9/11 vets served five, 10, 15 years, and they are looking for connection and community and support,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are key to getting people out into their communities and taking what they learned from their service, doing things together shoulder to shoulder to build deep bonds with other people.\u201cOur organization is not necessarily in the advocacy space,\u201d she added. \u201cWe work toward mental health solutions via physical and social activity.\u201dTraditional veterans\u2019 organizations say this new focus does not replace theirs.\u201cWe get bills passed,\u201d said Kayda Keleher, the associate director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States. \u201cWe provide financial assistance to cover bills for veterans who were attending a college that shut down. We provide scholarships and fellowship opportunities, our National Home for Children, and so much more. Those are our strengths and our legacy that will keep us around.\u201dThe greatest demonstration of the power across the spectrum from old and new groups, as well as the Koch-backed organization that has the Trump administration\u2019s collective ear, will be on display next year as Congress carefully examines major changes to health care services for veterans stemming from a large bill passed last year.\u201cVeteran organizations can be like Sears, using the same business model with diminishing returns,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cOr, they can reinvent themselves and their business models to remain viable, and focus on issues that appeal to all generations to remain relevant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lobbyists Blocking Nancy Pelosi and Her New Majority", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShe and her allies face some old, determined adversaries.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Proponents of this ambitious project face a determined adversary, however \u2014 the top ranks of the interest group establishment, skilled in co-opting liberal members of Congress and converting initiatives to square with the interests of corporate America.The upper stratum of the Washington lobbying community often exercises de facto veto power over the legislative process, dominating congressional policymaking, funneling campaign money to both parties and offering lucrative employment to retiring and defeated members of the House and Senate.a limited number of organizations at the very top of the resource distribution have escalated their political investments in ways that increasingly distinguish them from the rest of the pack.This population of groups at the top of the distribution is becoming increasingly stable over the last two decades. This group of top organizations \u2014 which we call the top tier \u2014 is positioning itself as a distinct class.The authors argue that the first tier lobbying organizationsare analogous to the current generation of very wealthy families who now pay for every conceivable tutor so that their children can be advantaged in applying to elite prep schools and colleges, which are now more and more essential to getting ahead in our increasingly economically stratified society. In both circumstances, financial resources and social connections build up over time, reinforcing stratification. Money does not guarantee outcomes. But it helps reinforce inequalities by widening the gap between the very top and everyone else.The ability of this elite constituency to meet politicians\u2019 demands for campaign contributions and other resources, the authors argue, has allowed Congress to ignore traditional \u201cpopulist concerns regarding dominant economic interests\u201d as members of the House and Senate \u201ccontinue their high-dollar fund-raisers and constant meetings with lobbyists.\u201dlarger average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of the income distribution. On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups.The upper ranks of the Washington lobbying community are most effective at blocking enactment of legislation, as opposed to winning approval of new laws. This is the very power \u2014 the crucial power \u2014 that prevents successful legislative initiatives from improving the lives of those in the bottom half of the income distribution.La Raja and Schaffner add thatPartisan polarization tends to exacerbate problems of economic inequality because political stalemate makes government less responsive to the needs of poorer citizens.In the 2017-18 election cycle, securities and investment firms gave a total of $60,566,716, split 53-46 percent between Democrats and Republicans; real estate gave $52,205,352 (51 to 48); accountants, $11,807,757, (46 to 51); the health industry, $159,255,037, (54.6 to 45); and lobbyists themselves contributed $25,828,243, (46 to 53).The stakes of this competition are substantially higher than those involved in picking individual candidates because ultimately they determine entire classes of winners and losers.Greater income inequality alienates and discourages people from engaging with common affairs, thus leading to lower political participation. Yet, lower electoral participation leads towards a less equitable distribution of income. Hence, this study reveals a self\u2010reinforcing mechanism where the unequal distribution of income leads to political exclusion, which in turn leads to more inequality.In other words, increasing inequality undermines support for a progressive agenda \u2014 the agenda most likely to improve the life chances and conditions of the least well off.As a society, we are now caught in one of those self-reinforcing, downward spirals in which the erosion of social capital, government dysfunction, rising inequality and slowing rates of economic growth are all feeding off each other, with more of one leading to more of all the others.Pearlstein continues:Income inequality and political polarization have become mutually reinforcing, creating the vicious circle that now manifests itself daily in the erosion of norms around civility and truth telling, the declining trust in political institutions, legislative gridlock and political dysfunction.Unsurprisingly, such problems lead to ever more disquieting outcomes.Weakened opposition is one reason why business influence over political and regulatory decisions seems greater today than it did before.In addition, Chen argued,one of the big political advantages that business enjoys is that it is continually able to recruit good players and send them to play every game worth playing in the American political and legal system. And there are a lot of games worth playing. Those games might entail having key language inserted into a piece of legislation as it gets finalized by Congress, or sending a top-notch legal team to Federal District Court when a favorable way of interpreting a particular statutory provision is potentially at stake, or making sure that business views are amply reflected in the EPA\u2019s notice-and-comment rule-making process. And those are just some of the games that are being played at the federal level.Still, the newly elected Democratic House majority does not enter the fray without some effective tools of its own. Perhaps most important is the changing source of campaign money.Earlier this month, two reporters for The Times, Stephanie Saul and Rachel Shorey, reported thatDemocratic candidates in the general election collected nearly $296 million in small donations, more than three times the $85 million collected by Republicans.it helped raise $1.6 billion in the 2017-18 election cycle, including money it collects for interest groups and state candidates. The average donation was $39.67.La Raja of warned in an email thatA potentially larger challenge in any Democratic effort to reduce inequality is that allied interest groups and individual donors \u2014 as progressive as they are \u2014 focus on issues that are not necessarily about reducing inequality for the poor and working class. Instead, the emphasis is often on social issues such as abortion and civil rights, or protecting the environment.I think that, all things considered, there is probably more tension than alignment with this goal. To be sure, donors tend to be more ideological than non-donors, so donors to Democratic candidates and/or the Democratic Party are going to be fairly liberal on average. At the same time, donors, particularly significant donors, are likely to be fairly affluent, and therefore heavily invested in the status quo.Democratic campaign contributors, Rhodes continued, would in all likelihood besupportive of progressive policies that would reduce economic inequality at the margins \u2014 e.g. shoring up Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, supporting increases in the minimum wage, and so forth \u2014 but I\u2019m skeptical that they would be enthusiastic about more dramatic policy proposals that would require large tax increases on high incomes.The larger question in the wake of the 2018 elections is whether the forces that propelled Democrats into the majority in the House are powerful and persistent enough to force a shift from the rightward direction of policymaking that has held sway over a significant stretch of the past 40 years.The 2018 election outcome demonstrated that the left has regained momentum and enthusiasm, but the interest group elite \u2014 the prime movers of the regressive distribution of income described by Drutman, Grossmann and LaPira \u2014 have demonstrated exceptional staying power.Corporations and trade groups are far more likely than citizen groups to employ hired lobbyists and former government officials, and the average spending of corporations and trade groups on lobbying and campaign contributions routinely exceeds that of citizen groups by several multiples.Especially in the case of the finance industry, Chen writes,there is rapidly accumulating evidence that campaign contributions deliver a definite and non-trivial improvement in the probability of obtaining a favorable vote.If newly ascendant Democrats are to have a chance in their struggle against the power brokers of the lobbying community, they will have to maintain and expand their current House majority and eventually win the Senate. Perhaps most important, the party must avoid the repetition of past flameouts.Previous implosions include the elections of 1978 and 1980 that crushed the Democratic surge in the wake of Watergate and the 2010 Republican wave election that brought an abrupt halt to the idea that a new Democratic majority had dawned after President Barack Obama\u2019s victory in 2008.Democrats need a leader who can power through the internal contradictions that their multihued, multicultural rainbow coalition presents.They need their own populist playbook and a presidential candidate equipped to forcefully campaign on it, someone whose personality \u2014 bravura, charisma, and bullheadedness \u2014 can seal for even a short while the cracks and schisms that push the party in a hundred different directions.My guess is that this will require the Democrats and their presidential nominee to resourcefully confront \u2014 to creatively reformat \u2014 issues of race and immigration, gender and sexual identity that Republicans have exploited with great success to peel away swing voters. This may be where a candidate\u2019s charisma \u2014 his or her ability to elicit committed followership \u2014 becomes indispensable. The issue is less whether the party should or should not move left, but how a party of the left presents itself to and recruits an Election Day majority from a heterogeneous and deeply conflicted national audience.The danger for Democrats is that intensifying public hostility to President Trump may hand them the White House in 2020 before they have fully cultivated a leadership cadre equipped to address the conflicts that have torn the party apart in the past \u2014 a cadre that must also be strong enough to do battle with the increasingly powerful moneyed class and its voracious lobbying elite.Advertisement"}

One volunteer gave birth to twin girls in November, and another volunteer is now pregnant, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency.The university announced on Monday that it was rescinding Dr. He\u2019s contract and canceling all of his teaching and research activities there.In countries including the United States, such a clinical trial would be banned. But China has laxer regulations on such research, and it was not immediately clear which specific laws Dr. He was accused of breaking.This case has served as a warning that China needs to enact tough laws on gene editing, said Wang Yue, a professor at Peking University who researches health law in China.\u201cEven though the Ministry of Health has issued ethical rules, the legal responsibility is unclear and the penalties are very light,\u201d he said.The government investigation found that starting in 2016, Dr. He had deliberately evaded supervision, used unsafe and ineffective methods, and forged ethical review materials, Xinhua reported.\u201cThis behavior seriously violated ethics, scientific research integrity and relevant state regulations causing adverse effects at home and abroad,\u201d Xinhua said.Dr. He and other personnel and institutions involved \u201cwill be dealt with seriously according to the law,\u201d the report said, citing an unidentified lead investigator. The case will be handed over to public security organs, the report said, indicating the likelihood of criminal charges.The investigation also found that Dr. He had raised funds on his own \u201cin pursuit of personal fame and fortune.\u201d The allegations that he forged documents and financed his work independently could shield from punishment his university, the local authorities and the hospital where the trial was carried out.Still, some critics have asked how Dr. He could have perpetrated such a scheme without some knowledge of the authorities. After his announcement, speculation swirled that the Shenzhen government had funded his work. Local officials have denied it.At the core of Dr. He\u2019s legal problems is informed consent. Chinese medical ethics guidelines require that researchers obtain verbal consent from the subjects of their work. Civil charges can be brought against researchers who exaggerate the benefits of a particular experiment while playing down the risks.Dr. He said he had recruited couples in which the man had H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. He then used in vitro fertilization to create human embryos genetically altered to be resistant to H.I.V. infection. But there are simpler ways of preventing H.I.V. infection that do not involve the risks of such a trial.Bai Hua, the head of Baihualin, an AIDS support group that helped Dr. He recruit the couples, said that he now regretted doing so and was deeply worried about the families. In a statement posted on the social media platform WeChat, Mr. Bai, who uses a pseudonym, said he felt \u201cdeceived.\u201dDr. He\u2019s case has underscored China\u2019s lack of updated laws governing genetic research.Dr. He, who is in his mid-30s, studied at Rice University in Houston, where he first worked with Crispr. He conducted postdoctoral research at Stanford University.Austin Ramzy reported from Hong Kong, and Sui-Lee Wee from Beijing. Elsie Chen contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Book Says You Can Retire Early. But It Doesn\u2019t Really Say How.", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfTanja Hester, a communications consultant who quit working at age 38, says you can. Ms. Hester had a big head start, but her logic is sound, even if she makes it seem simpler than it is for most of us.Retiring early and successfully requires two things, she argues: knowing what you will do with your life without a paying job, and a lot of money to live on.Ms. Hester is terrific in explaining the first part; so-so on the second.She says your extended retirement will be far more enjoyable if you have a specific plan, one that flows from a sense of purpose.\u201cPurpose just means you know why you are getting out of bed each morning or what you want your life to add up to ultimately,\u201d she says.But how are you going to be able to fund that purpose? That brings us to the flaws in the book.My biggest objection is Ms. Hester makes the ability to retire early sound too easy, and one of the reasons it does is she repeatedly draws from her experience with the implicit message: \u201cIf I can do it, anyone can.\u201dBut her situation is not representative.She doesn\u2019t provide specific numbers from her life \u2014 which feels like a cheat \u2014 but we learn a few important facts. She and her husband had each been earning more than $100,000 annually for several years when they retired; had bought a home in Lake Tahoe, Calif., at the bottom of the real estate market, giving them a substantial equity cushion; and had acquired a rental property as well. In addition, they have no children \u2014 kids are expensive (duh) and hinder your ability to save for an early retirement. And, oh, yes, while they were working, their investments were growing during the longest bull market in history, so last year\u2019s decline probably didn\u2019t hurt too much.Not everyone thinking of retiring early will have those advantages.Then there is her limited financial advice. Ms. Hester devotes only about a third of her 260 pages to the financing of an early retirement. And while she provides ideas \u2014 such as overachieve at work to save whatever raises you get before you quit \u2014 she doesn\u2019t go into any great depth.Two quick examples show the problem.A novice, she says, might be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d investing heavily in stocks, so that person should consider an initial mix of 33 percent cash, 33 percent bonds and 34 percent stocks.There are other omissions. Take the matter of how much money you can withdraw from your investments. Ms. Hester cites the well-known research that contends you should be able to take out 3 to 4 percent of your savings annually and probably not outlive your money.But the key word there is probably.The following example, which I\u2019ve constructed, shows the gap between probably and definitely.To be fair, in talking about withdrawals, Ms. Hester does write: \u201cAt a minimum enter your numbers into an online Monte Carlo simulator\u201d to see what the odds are of \u201cyou having enough saved.\u201d But she does not play out any examples. Nor does she spend a lot of time on situations more complicated than the one I created.Ms. Hester seemingly anticipated my carping when she wrote: \u201cI wanted the conversation about early retirement to be about life, not just about money.\u201dStill, I wish she had focused more on the money.Experienced investors know there are only two ways you can end up with more money.\u25a0 Earn more \u2014 by doing things like increasing your work income, getting higher yields on your investments or finding additional revenue from things like rental properties or royalties.\u25a0 Spend less.While I wish Ms. Hester had given much more specific financial advice, simply getting you to think about how you might retire early forces you to ponder how you could cut current spending and increase your income, savings and the rates they earn. That\u2019s good.But when you do, you may find you have a long way to go before you can chuck it all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economics of Soaking the Rich", "Date": "2019-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know about tax policy? A lot.Opinion ColumnistI have no idea how well Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will perform as a member of Congress. But her election is already serving a valuable purpose. You see, the mere thought of having a young, articulate, telegenic nonwhite woman serve is driving many on the right mad \u2014 and in their madness they\u2019re inadvertently revealing their true selves.Some of the revelations are cultural: The hysteria over a video of AOC dancing in college says volumes, not about her, but about the hysterics. But in some ways the more important revelations are intellectual: The right\u2019s denunciation of AOC\u2019s \u201cinsane\u201d policy ideas serves as a very good reminder of who is actually insane.[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]Where do these numbers come from? Underlying the Diamond-Saez analysis are two propositions: Diminishing marginal utility and competitive markets.Diminishing marginal utility is the common-sense notion that an extra dollar is worth a lot less in satisfaction to people with very high incomes than to those with low incomes. Give a family with an annual income of $20,000 an extra $1,000 and it will make a big difference to their lives. Give a guy who makes $1 million an extra thousand and he\u2019ll barely notice it.What this implies for economic policy is that we shouldn\u2019t care what a policy does to the incomes of the very rich. A policy that makes the rich a bit poorer will affect only a handful of people, and will barely affect their life satisfaction, since they will still be able to buy whatever they want.So why not tax them at 100 percent? The answer is that this would eliminate any incentive to do whatever it is they do to earn that much money, which would hurt the economy. In other words, tax policy toward the rich should have nothing to do with the interests of the rich, per se, but should only be concerned with how incentive effects change the behavior of the rich, and how this affects the rest of the population.But here\u2019s where competitive markets come in. In a perfectly competitive economy, with no monopoly power or other distortions \u2014 which is the kind of economy conservatives want us to believe we have \u2014 everyone gets paid his or her marginal product. That is, if you get paid $1000 an hour, it\u2019s because each extra hour you work adds $1000 worth to the economy\u2019s output.In that case, however, why do we care how hard the rich work? If a rich man works an extra hour, adding $1000 to the economy, but gets paid $1000 for his efforts, the combined income of everyone else doesn\u2019t change, does it? Ah, but it does \u2014 because he pays taxes on that extra $1000. So the social benefit from getting high-income individuals to work a bit harder is the tax revenue generated by that extra effort \u2014 and conversely the cost of their working less is the reduction in the taxes they pay.Or to put it a bit more succinctly, when taxing the rich, all we should care about is how much revenue we raise. The optimal tax rate on people with very high incomes is the rate that raises the maximum possible revenue.And that\u2019s something we can estimate, given evidence on how responsive the pre-tax income of the wealthy actually is to tax rates. As I said, Diamond and Saez put the optimal rate at 73 percent, Romer at over 80 percent \u2014 which is consistent with what AOC said.An aside: What if we take into account the reality that markets aren\u2019t perfectly competitive, that there\u2019s a lot of monopoly power out there? The answer is that this almost surely makes the case for even higher tax rates, since high-income people presumably get a lot of those monopoly rents.So AOC, far from showing her craziness, is fully in line with serious economic research. (I hear that she\u2019s been talking to some very good economists.) Her critics, on the other hand, do indeed have crazy policy ideas \u2014 and tax policy is at the heart of the crazy.You see, Republicans almost universally advocate low taxes on the wealthy, based on the claim that tax cuts at the top will have huge beneficial effects on the economy. This claim rests on research by \u2026 well, nobody. There isn\u2019t any body of serious work supporting G.O.P. tax ideas, because the evidence is overwhelmingly against those ideas.Look at the history of top marginal income tax rates (left) versus growth in real GDP per capita (right, measured over 10 years, to smooth out short-run fluctuations.):What we see is that America used to have very high tax rates on the rich \u2014 higher even than those AOC is proposing \u2014 and did just fine. Since then tax rates have come way down, and if anything the economy has done less well.Why do Republicans adhere to a tax theory that has no support from nonpartisan economists and is refuted by all available data? Well, ask who benefits from low taxes on the rich, and it\u2019s obvious.Which brings me back to AOC, and the constant effort to portray her as flaky and ignorant. Well, on the tax issue she\u2019s just saying what good economists say; and she definitely knows more economics than almost everyone in the G.O.P. caucus, not least because she doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d things that aren\u2019t true.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everest Fraud Leads Insurers to Threaten a Boycott", "Date": "2019-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, investigations by the Nepali government and Traveller Assist, a medical assistance company based in Ireland, found that some trek operators, guides, helicopter companies and even doctors and hospitals had conspired to bilk millions of dollars from insurance companies by pushing for emergency mountainside evacuations for minor illnesses, or when simpler treatment options were available.The guides preyed on trekkers when they were most vulnerable \u2014 trudging up remote trails, cold, wet, sick, confused and miles from any well-serviced towns.The Nepali government found evidence that some guides went as far as intentionally making hikers ill by spiking their food with large amounts of baking soda, which can cause vomiting, diarrhea and other ailments, and then calling for an emergency helicopter evacuation.These evacuations can cost as much as $40,000 each, depending on how many trekkers are on board, and insurance companies are often stuck with the bill.Jonathan Bancroft, the managing director of Traveller Assist, which represents three insurance underwriters, questioned why the government has yet to file charges against 17 Nepali companies accused of fraud or tax evasion.In a letter delivered to Nepal\u2019s minister of tourism on Friday, Mr. Bancroft wrote that if the government did not bring charges against these companies, all of which are reportedly still in business, the insurance underwriters would cut off coverage for Nepal starting from Feb. 15.\u201cTo be clear, this is an ultimatum!\u201d Mr. Bancroft wrote. \u201cIf our clients stop issuing travel insurance policies in Nepal, it won\u2019t be long until other insurers do the same. This will have a devastating effect on the tourism industry in Nepal, and your country\u2019s reputation.\u201dThe three insurance underwriters, which control 23 travel insurance brands that cover over 100,000 travelers to Nepal annually, were not identified in the letter. Their market share is sizable: Just over a million tourists visited Nepal last year. Many of them embarked on remote hikes flanked by some of the world\u2019s highest mountains.Most trekking operators in Nepal are upstanding and see client safety as a key concern. Aware of the risks associated with traveling to high altitudes, many visitors buy travel insurance costing several hundred dollars, opting for plans that include emergency helicopter rescues. To ensure proper acclimatization on the way to places like Everest Base Camp, which sits more than 17,000 feet above sea level, hikes are spread over days.But according to government officials, insurers and employees in Nepal\u2019s tourism industry, some mountain guides earn commissions from trekking operators by pressuring inexperienced hikers to be flown back to Kathmandu, the capital, at the first minor signs of altitude sickness.Trekkers are dissuaded from exploring other options, like taking medicine, going to clinics along the hiking route or simply descending a few thousand feet, which solves many cases of altitude sickness. As a scare tactic, the common cold or fatigue are sometimes purposefully mischaracterized as acute mountain sickness, which can be deadly in an advanced stage.In Kathmandu, hospitals involved in the fraud perform unnecessary tests, exaggerate symptoms and even hold on to trekkers\u2019 passports to prevent them from leaving.In another version of the scam, healthy hikers agree to a helicopter rescue in exchange for a cut of money or a free ride off the trail.When bills are submitted for insurance claims, helicopter companies and hospitals inflate prices for their services. Multiple insurance claims are submitted for a single helicopter ride when more than one trekker is on board.Some trekking operators, which act as brokers and take a percentage of rescue fees from helicopter companies, make more money through evacuations than they do charging for hikes. The typical profit margin for each hiker heading to Everest might be just a few hundred dollars. Participating in the scam could net operators thousands of dollars in kickbacks.\u201cTo say this is a complex problem is an understatement,\u201d said Danny Kaine, head of assistance at Traveller Assist. \u201cFraud and corruption in the helicopter rescue industry in Nepal are so ingrained in some companies. It has become an accepted way of doing business.\u201dAlarmed at the increase, travel insurance companies created internal blacklists of Nepali helicopter companies and hospitals, posted advisories warning trekkers of the scam and raised premiums.Traveller Assist found that about 1,600 helicopter rescues had occurred in Nepal from January to August 2018, out of which 35 percent were considered fraudulent, costing insurers some $4 million in losses.But Mr. Bancroft, in his letter, wrote, \u201cNot a single charge has been laid.\u201d From September to December 2018, Traveller Assist determined that about 15 percent of some 1,600 rescues during that period were fraudulent.In interviews, Nepali officials blamed each other.Ghanshyam Upadhaya, a spokesman for the ministry of tourism, said his office had sent their findings to other ministries \u2014 health, home, finance and civil aviation \u2014 but was waiting to hear back.Ramkrishna Subedi, a spokesman for the Home Ministry, shifted responsibility back to the Tourism Ministry to \u201ctake action.\u201dAnother government official who was formerly at the Tourism Ministry, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that nothing had been done on the issue.Penalties could spill out of the country.Madhab Prasad Bhattarai, a Nepali lawyer, said corporate fraud was a criminal offense in Nepal, and tax evasion, which some companies are also accused of, could be considered a criminal or civil offense. Both are punishable by fines and jail time.But because fraud was committed against travel insurance companies based outside Nepal, the cases could be escalated to law enforcement agencies in countries like the United States or Britain. Foreign travel insurance companies that continue to entertain claims from Nepali companies charged with fraud could also be investigated, said Mr. Kaine of Traveller Assist.\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious circle,\u201d he said . \u201cSome insurers and assistance providers are facilitating the fraud by paying large invoice amounts without any questions being asked. This makes our job all the more difficult.\u201dForest Ray contributed reporting from P\u00f4rto Alegre, Brazil, and Rajneesh Bhandari from Kathmandu, Nepal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brexit Vote: After Marathon Debate, a Severe Blow for Theresa May", "Date": "2019-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive BriefingBritain\u2019s big vote finally arrived Tuesday, and as expected, Parliament handed Prime Minister Theresa May a crushing defeat, rejecting her deal for exiting the European Union by a vote of 432 to 202.The opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, promptly made a motion of no confidence in Mrs. May, in the hope of forcing early parliamentary elections. The prime minister said the motion would be debated on Wednesday.After two and a half years of negotiation, argument, predictions and posturing, lawmakers at last cast what is likely to be one of the most important votes in their careers, throwing Brexit into limbo with just 73 days until it is scheduled to take effect.\u2022 No one knows what will come next, as Britain enters uncharted territory, and various factions make contradictory demands.\u2022 Much was at stake in the vote: Britain\u2019s place in Europe, its economic future and possibly the survival of Mrs. May\u2019s increasingly shaky Conservative government.\u2022 Debate concluded at 7 p.m., after more than 50 hours of Parliamentary argument that began in early December, and the vote was over at 7:39 p.m. In a surprise, there were no serious attempts to amend the bill before the vote.At long last, the final day of debate came, and Prime Minister Theresa May made her closing argument to Parliament, continuing to insist, despite all signs that her deal would suffer a crushing defeat, that it was the only viable option, \u201ca decision that will define our country for decades to come.\u201dThere is no possibility of negotiating a better pact with Europe, she said, because \u201cno such alternative deal exists,\u201d and a general election would not change that. She again ruled out a second popular referendum on Brexit as a betrayal of the voters\u2019 will, and argued that leaving the European Union without an agreement would be disastrous.But with her deal, she asserted, \u201cwe can lay the foundations from which to build a better Britain.\u201dHer appeal came at the close of almost six uninterrupted hours of impassioned pleas in the House of Commons from lawmakers \u2014 some angry, others pained \u2014 that illustrated the wide-ranging opposition to her deal. In all, there were more than 50 hours of debate, spread across almost six weeks \u2014 one of the most exhaustive deliberations in modern parliamentary history.\u201cThe withdrawal agreement is, in short, a reckless leap in the dark,\u201d Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said just before Mrs. May spoke. \u201cIt risks many companies relocating abroad, taking jobs and investment with them.\u201dThe prime minister, he said, \u201chas run down the clock in a cynical attempt to strong-arm members into backing her agreement.\u201dSince June 2016, when 52 percent of British voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union, everything had built up to the vote on Tuesday. The bill would have determined the trade and immigration relationship between Britain and the bloc through the end of 2020, while a permanent agreement is negotiated.Long before lawmakers began debating Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s bill in December, it seemed doomed.With Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s bill defeated, the question dominating British politics is: What comes next?Mrs. May has until Monday to present a backup plan to Parliament. The range of possibilities is wide, unappealing and a bit bewildering.If the deal had lost by a narrow margin, she might have tried to win a few concessions from Brussels and return to Parliament for a second vote. But with a resounding defeat, that option becomes less likely.With little time left to negotiate anew, the prime minister may be forced to ask Parliament to postpone Brexit.She could also call a second referendum, an option favored by lawmakers who hope that British voters have changed their minds. And Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, wants to force early elections, in the hope of taking power.The vote did nothing to help little of the detail that businesses need to plan their operations.\u201cThe longer this Brexit political drama continues, the less and less attractive the U.K. is going to be\u201d to investors, Iain Anderson, the executive chairman of the consulting firm Cicero Group, said last week.\u201cMake no mistake, no-deal cannot be \u2018managed,\u2019 \u201d Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said last week.There were many objections to the Brexit bill, making clear that no approach to leaving the European Union commanded anything close to majority support.Hard-line pro-Brexit Conservatives argued that the deal tied Britain much too closely to European trade rules for the foreseeable future. Many contended that a no-deal exit from the bloc would be preferable.The 1998 accord that brought peace to Northern Ireland guarantees free movement of goods and people between that part of Britain and the Republic of Ireland, a European Union member. But many Conservatives, and the Democratic Unionist Party, a small group in Northern Ireland allied with Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government, objected to the way her proposal would protect that guarantee.The deal Mrs. May reached with Brussels includes a \u201cbackstop\u201d that would keep Northern Ireland more closely tied to the bloc than with the rest of Britain if the two sides are unable to reach a long-term agreement by the end of 2020. Critics said that would effectively divide Britain in two.The role is supposed to be strictly nonpartisan.But Mr. Bercow \u2014 easily recognizable with his floppy silver hair and booming voice \u2014 has found himself in the position of an umpire who makes a controversial call in the early innings that could tip the whole game.Last week, a member of Parliament proposed requiring Prime Minister Theresa May to return within three days to announce what the government would do next if the original deal was rejected. She previously had 21 days to decide.By Parliament\u2019s arcane rules (it mostly hinged on the meaning of \u201cforthwith\u201d), Mr. Bercow should have rejected that amendment. But he didn\u2019t. And Parliament passed it by a slim margin.That decision tipped the balance of power to Parliament from Mrs. May\u2019s government, and will let lawmakers weigh in with alternatives.The Brexit drama \u2014 psychological and political \u2014 has left European Union leaders transfixed and horrified. The other 27 member states have their own domestic political considerations, but the vote in London on Tuesday was particularly momentous, though few felt that it will bring any sort of conclusion.Many expect Prime Minister Theresa May, if she survives, to try to return to Brussels for more talks, and then probably to ask to postpone the withdrawal, set for March 29.European officials seem optimistic that the other 27 states would agree unanimously to an extension, as long as there is a sense that Britain is on track to reach an agreement before elections for the European Parliament begin in May.No one wants a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit, even if some think it may shake the markets enough to cause Britain to rethink. Brussels believes strongly that what really matters for a long-term relationship are the negotiations that would follow.The pound often bears the brunt of bad Brexit news, though it has also risen when there was good news.With rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal, investors were focused more on the size of the vote margin, 432 to 202, and the possibility that Britain might leave the European Union with no deal in place.\u201cIf the bill is not passed, as is widely expected, sterling and U.K. financial assets will probably be unmoved since this is the expectation \u2014 the markets have priced it in,\u201d said Nigel Green, the founder of deVere Group, a financial advisory firm, in a note.Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland said on Monday that he was optimistic an agreement would be reached for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, but said his government was continuing to prepare for a chaotic no-deal Brexit.Other than Britain itself, no country has as much at stake as Ireland. Britain is its largest trading partner, and many European goods pass through Britain on their way to Ireland.The most controversial part of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal was the \u201cbackstop\u201d to preserve free movement of people and commerce across Ireland\u2019s border with Northern Ireland. People on both sides of the border cherish that freedom, and a bungled Brexit could put it at risk.Mr. Varadkar warned reporters in Dublin on Monday that a no-deal Brexit would mean certain medicines could fall into short supply and said that the government must be ready for such possibilities.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say to you that everything is going to be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course there will be interruptions and negative impact, but we\u2019ll be as prepared as we possibly can be.\u201dBefore the vote on Tuesday, the Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that his country must \u201chold its nerve\u201d on Brexit.Before Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal got a vote Tuesday night, Parliament was expected to take up a series of amendment to the bill. But in the end, only one amendment was considered, and not terribly seriously \u2014 it was defeated, 600 to 24.But the House Speaker, John Bercow, who has wide leeway to reject amendments, ruled Tuesday afternoon that only four would be considered. Two of the four amendments, introduced by opposition leaders, would have scuttled Mrs. May\u2019s deal while also rejecting a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit and committing to a pursuit of other options.But in a surprise move, when the amendments were called at 7 p.m., the sponsors of three of the four withdrew them. The only amendment left to vote on would have given Britain the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop agreement without the consent of the European Union \u2014 a condition that Brussels considers unacceptable.Amendments that the government supported were rejected by Mr. Bercow, adding fuel to Conservative accusations that he has not been an impartial arbiter.\u2014 Benjamin MuellerThe Confederation of British Industry, representing 190,000 businesses, voiced its support for Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s deal on Tuesday, but said it expected the government to have an alternative solution if the bill failed.\u201cThe vast majority of business would like to see this deal passed tonight,\u201d John Allan, the group\u2019s president, told the BBC. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to be realistic, it looks extremely unlikely that it will be, and we\u2019ll be in a new situation tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cThis will be a situation of national emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only 70-plus days away from crashing out of the E.U. Businesses are making decisions every day about postponing investments, moving jobs to Europe.\u201dA no-deal exit would do \u201cirreparable harm to the U.K. economy,\u201d Mr. Allan warned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Make of Hospital Price Lists? ", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersExperts praise them for transparency and vilify them for confusing patients. To the Editor:The recent federal requirement for hospitals to publish price information is an important first step in the journey toward greater price transparency. But because these prices aren\u2019t actually what a patient would pay, the article rightly points out that more must be done to be responsive to patients\u2019 needs and wants. There are two roads to take, not mutually exclusive. One involves improving this new process \u2014 for example, by having uniform standards for how prices are reported across hospitals so that patients are comparing apples to apples when comparison shopping. Another more long-lasting and effective road is to tackle the underlying roots of the problem, as by doing away with gag clauses in provider-payer contracts that ban sharing of prices with patients or on the price transparency websites of health plans. While these are more difficult paths, if the final destination is meaningful and useful transparency for patients, then it\u2019s time to hit the road.To the Editor: American health care is financed through a free market, which is ineffective in controlling costs because it requires transparency so consumers can compare prices. But the dizzying complexity of both medical care and insurance plan design precludes the consumer from making informed choices. Primary-care doctors strongly influence choice, and insurance company provider networks limit choices even further.Rather, single-payer universal health care is quite cost-effective. Expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product, it has proved to be less costly in many other countries. It will wring out the duplicative and wasteful administrative costs of the free marketplace and provide negotiating leverage to stabilize medical provider and pharmacy costs. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A No-Deal Brexit? Leaders Are Alarmed; Voters, Not So Much", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut at the Hare and Hounds pub in Sunbury-on-Thames, England, in a neighborhood that voted strongly to leave the European Union, queries about a no-deal exit were met with shrugs and snorts of derision. It was not that the men and women drinking there hadn\u2019t heard the warnings about a no-deal exit \u2014 it was that they did not believe them.\u201cWe\u2019ve been lied to so many times, haven\u2019t we?\u201d said Steve Ridley, 60, as snooker balls cracked in the background and a bartender called out crossword hints.Mr. Ridley, who imports motorcycle parts, predicted that a no-deal Brexit would mean \u201cslightly more paperwork until we get it sorted,\u201d but certainly nothing serious, and there was no one in the Hare and Hounds who disagreed. Darren Smith, on a stool behind Mr. Ridley, called the warnings \u201cscaremongering.\u201d\u201cIf the government had come up with these facts and figures before, maybe I would believe them now,\u201d said Mr. Smith, 47. \u201cThey gave us the vote to get out of Europe, and now they delay and delay. It\u2019s just a farce. It\u2019s all a farce. I don\u2019t trust any of them.\u201dThis is where Britain is, on the cusp of one of the largest policy choices in its history: Battered by three years of political opportunism and partisan debate, many voters have less and less trust in the country\u2019s institutions.On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May dialed up the caution, telling lawmakers that a no-deal exit, by granting Northern Ireland a distinct legal status, could lead to the breakup of the United Kingdom.But much of the general public, polls suggest, has tuned out the warnings.Rob Ford, a professor of political science at the University of Manchester, said the government warnings have fallen flat in part because early on, Mrs. May repeatedly declared, \u201cno deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain.\u201d The government, Mr. Ford added, \u201cisn\u2019t regarded as a credible source.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s way too little, and way too late,\u201d he said, of the warnings in recent weeks. \u201cEveryone\u2019s identity on this stuff is way too entrenched. They should have been saying this in July 2016, and it should have been said on all sides in July 2016.\u201d\u201cOnce the tribal thinking has taken hold, I\u2019m not sure that there is anybody that can significantly move the dial with the public,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s my big worry, that the only thing that can move the dial with people who don\u2019t believe there will be nasty consequences to a no-deal Brexit is nasty consequences happening to them.\u201dBritons may find it more difficult to envision collapse, Mr. Ford said, having escaped Nazi occupation in World War II and the kind of drastic change that swept through post-Communist Eastern Europe, he added.\u201cThe idea that everything could fall to bits, and basic things could just stop, it\u2019s not really imaginable to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an idea that we\u2019ll all be all right in the end. Well, we may not.\u201dBut anxiety was low at the Hare and Hounds, a haunt for off-duty workers from Heathrow Airport, about 15 miles southwest of London. The town, home to many mechanics, technicians and airport workers, had voted to leave the European Union by a percentage of 60 to 40. At a bar in London frequented by finance workers, the answers likely would have been quite different.Mr. Ridley compared the anticipation mounting before the Brexit deadline to the run-up to forestall the Millennium Bug, also known as Y2K, in which companies worldwide scrambled to avert technical breakdowns when digital systems switched from 1999 to 2000.\u201cIt\u2019ll be like Y2K,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember that one? They were like panic, panic, panic, the world\u2019s going to end, the electric grid\u2019s going to go down,\u201d Mr. Ridley said. \u201cNone of it is going to happen.\u201dMr. Smith, a truck mechanic, said he had rarely voted in his life \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m working class, I don\u2019t think you can trust any politicians\u201d \u2014 but, on the day he voted to leave the bloc, he said he experienced a rare moment of faith in the system.\u201cI don\u2019t know the ins and outs of government, but if the politicians can\u2019t decide what to do, we should go without a deal,\u201d he said, adding that he would happily live with problems like delays flying in and out of the country. \u201cIf one queue is a bit longer than another, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll just wait a little longer.\u201dAt last he shrugged. \u201cNo one can say what\u2019s going to happen, because no one knows,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But it was the camper van, not his face, that preoccupied the actor and filmmaker as we met at a coffee shop near a house he owns north of Bondi Beach. He took out his phone and pointed to custom trappings, an annex with a tent and shower at the back, all designed for surfing holidays along the Australian shoreline.And something more.\u201cThis is all part of the building of the enticement to come back home more often,\u201d he said.Mr. Edgerton, who has made a career out of playing the kind of broad-shouldered, stoic male his homeland has exported to Hollywood since the days of Errol Flynn, might seem the last person to make a film about gay conversion therapy, had he been set in that mold.The story gripped him immediately and refused to let go. He thought that as a straight man, he had no business turning the book into a movie. As time passed without anyone else taking up the project, his reluctance faded. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to make it, but nobody was interested in the rights for the book, which made me feel more safe to step forward,\u201d he told audiences after a screening at the Toronto International Film Festival.Mr. Edgerton said he was initially drawn into Mr. Conley\u2019s book by the institutionalization aspect, but that the impact on the family was the story he wanted to tell. It was so far from his own childhood, he said, with a lawyer father and a stay-at-home mother; he had always been certain of his place in the family and of his parents\u2019 unwavering love. \u201cTrying to imagine my parents thinking there was something wrong with me, when there wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how I could reconcile that,\u201d he said in an interview.\u201cI\u2019ve done bad things in my life \u2014 I\u2019ve gone down the same old roads that a lot of people do, being self-destructive with bad behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I knew in those moments when my dad pulled me up that there was a reason and that reason revolved around me and my treatment of myself, and it wasn\u2019t just him going, \u2018Because of who you are, and everything you are, I reject you.\u2019\u201dAfter graduating from film school in western Sydney, Joel Edgerton took on small acting roles and began producing short films with his brother, fellow stuntmen and filmmaker friends.\u201cJoel worked out very early on that actors spend a lot of time sitting around waiting for the phone to ring, waiting desperately for someone to like them, and that the best way to combat that is to keep moving, just keep doing things \u2014 and that\u2019s what he does,\u201d Mr. Mich\u00f4d said. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy who can tell me about an idea he\u2019s had for a screenplay and then three weeks later deliver me the first draft. That\u2019s a work rate that blows mine out of the water.\u201dThat work ethic has earned the brothers trust in an industry that warily shells out serious money and always expects serious returns, said Ben Mendelsohn, an Australian actor.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember,\u201d he said over speaker phone while driving around Los Angeles on a recent Sunday, \u201cthese guys come from the country. They come into the city, they do well in the city, then they come to America and they do well here, and that, you know, is certainly not typical. They\u2019ve really got something.\u201dIf Joel Edgerton has managed shifting between acting and directing with confidence, it comes in spite of an Australian attitude that disdains ego and arrogance, qualities he sometimes wishes he had.\u201cI have a weird relationship with confidence,\u201d Mr. Edgerton admitted. \u201cAs I get closer to a shoot when I\u2019m acting in it or directing it, I get really terrified. And if it wasn\u2019t for my relationship with those guys, watching them go through the process of directing a movie, I maybe would never have done it.\u201d Nicole Kidman, who plays the mother in \u201cBoy Erased,\u201d said Mr. Edgerton\u2019s demeanor on set belied the stress he contended with.\u201cJoel is such a strong actor and so naturally gifted in that area, and the way he can just step in and out of character is glorious to watch,\u201d she wrote in an email.\u201cWhen you do things with such ease and grace, and you don\u2019t trumpet your accomplishments, you can sometimes get lost in terms of what people see and how much work you\u2019re actually doing,\u201d she said.Even as he travels the world promoting the film, Mr. Edgerton is not done working on it.

{"Headline": "South Africa Leader, Wooing Investors, Pledges End to Corruption", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 South Africa\u2019s president said Wednesday that his corruption-ridden party, the African National Congress, had lost its founding values and now faced a \u201cDamascus moment\u201d in trying to regain the people\u2019s confidence and support.\u201cWe have said to ourselves: \u2018We cannot carry on like this. We have deviated from the values and the principles that have always defined the A.N.C.,\u2019\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said in an interview with The New York Times in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum.\u201cPeople have lost confidence in us,\u201d said Mr. Ramaphosa, who will lead his party in national elections that will most likely be held in May.Repeating the message he was pushing at the forum, Mr. Ramaphosa said efforts to clean up the African National Congress were already underway. And he pledged to return the party of Nelson Mandela to its past glory.Revelations from a continuing high-level inquiry into corruption during the tenure of Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s predecessor, the scandal-tainted Jacob Zuma, have led his country to a \u201ccathartic moment,\u201d the South African leader said.\u201cThat sort of moment \u2014 Damascus moment for us \u2014 has actually enabled us to get to grip with what needs to be done,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cWe will be able to turn a new chapter on the life of our country, rid of corruption.\u201dSeeking investments to give a jolt to South Africa\u2019s sluggish economy, Mr. Ramaphosa attempted to repair the reputation of his party at the gathering of world leaders and investors in Davos.Since becoming president last February, Mr. Ramaphosa has been unable to fulfill his promises to deliver growth and more jobs, with his country\u2019s economy hobbled by endemic corruption in the government and state-owned enterprises.In Davos on Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa repeated some of the same messages he has been delivering at home in the past year. But the issue is still whether he can deliver on his promises.Mr. Ramaphosa has started to clean out certain ministries, agencies and state enterprises, removing key allies of Mr. Zuma under whom corruption flourished.But Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s support inside the A.N.C. remains uncertain, and with just months left before the elections, he has struggled to unite the party behind him.Though the A.N.C. is expected to win the most votes, it is far from clear whether Mr. Ramaphosa will get a big enough victory to claim a mandate and aggressively root out corruption, as his allies say he wants to do.For now, several political allies of Mr. Zuma who have long been accused of corruption serve in his cabinet or at the highest levels of the party. And Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s own government has been tainted by allegations of the same sort of self-dealing that led to the ouster of Mr. Zuma.Most prominently, his deputy, David Mabuza, was a longtime leader of a small province where corruption was endemic. Mr. Mabuza has been accused of siphoning money meant for education and other services to finance his meteoric rise in national politics \u2014 and deliver the votes that gave Mr. Ramaphosa a slim victory in party elections in December 2017.Asked about his deputy in the interview Wednesday, Mr. Ramaphosa defended him, though not forcefully.\u201cNone of the issues that have been alleged against him has, as far as I know, been brought to either the police or the criminal justice system,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said. The country\u2019s prosecutors, he said, would act \u201cwithout fear, prejudice or favor\u201d should such evidence emerge.\u201cAs a leader, if allegations like that are made against you, you want them to be proven,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said.But the national prosecuting authority is one of the government institutions that were weakened during Mr. Zuma\u2019s presidency. Despite a series of scandals that have rocked the country, few have been held to account for large-scale corruption that has put South Africa\u2019s future in question.At a news conference in Davos, Mr. Ramaphosa said he had \u201ctaken steps to strengthen the prosecuting authority.\u201dMr. Ramaphosa acknowledged the slow pace of progress, saying that \u201cthings like corruption become a way of life.\u201d But he underlined his commitment to deal with the issue ahead of the elections.\u201cThis time we\u2019re not just saying it, we\u2019re living it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cbecause if we don\u2019t do so, we\u2019re going to be punished at the polls.\u201dSelam Gebrekidan reported from London, and Norimitsu Onishi from Montreal.

{"Headline": "Manafort Accused of Sharing Trump Polling Data With Russian Associate", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a top official in President Trump\u2019s campaign, Paul Manafort shared political polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday. The document provided the clearest evidence to date that the Trump campaign may have tried to coordinate with Russians during the 2016 presidential race.Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers made the disclosure by accident, through a formatting error in a document filed to respond to charges that he had lied to prosecutors working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after agreeing to cooperate with their investigation into Russian interference in the election.The document also revealed that during the campaign, Mr. Manafort and his Russian associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, discussed a plan for peace in Ukraine. Throughout the campaign and the early days of the Trump administration, Russia and its allies were pushing various plans for Ukraine in the hope of gaining relief from American-led sanctions imposed after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\u201cThis is the closest thing we have seen to collusion,\u201d Clint Watts, a senior fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said of the data-sharing. \u201cThe question now is, did the president know about it?\u201dThe document gave no indication of whether Mr. Trump was aware of the data transfer or how Mr. Kilimnik might have used the information. But from March to August 2016, when Mr. Manafort worked for the Trump campaign, Russia was engaged in a full-fledged operation using social media, stolen emails and other tactics to boost Mr. Trump, attack Mrs. Clinton and play on divisive issues such as race and guns. Polling data could conceivably have helped Russia hone those messages and target audiences to help swing votes to Mr. Trump.Both Mr. Manafort and Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager, transferred the data to Mr. Kilimnik in the spring of 2016 as Mr. Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, according to a person knowledgeable about the situation. Most of the data was public, but some of it was developed by a private polling firm working for the campaign, according to the person.Mr. Manafort asked Mr. Gates to tell Mr. Kilimnik to pass the data to two Ukrainian oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, the person said. The oligarchs had financed Russian-aligned Ukrainian political parties that had hired Mr. Manafort as a political consultant.A representative for Mr. Akhmetov said he did not request or receive any data from Mr. Kilimnik and has had no contact with either Mr. Kilimnik or Mr. Manafort since before the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Lyovochkin did not respond to a request for comment.Why Mr. Manafort wanted them to see American polling data is unclear. He might have hoped that any proof that he was managing a winning candidate would help him collect money he claimed to be owed for his work on behalf of the Ukrainian parties.Of the various Russian intermediaries to the Trump campaign, Mr. Kilimnik appears to be one of the most important to Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry. A Russian citizen and resident, he faces charges from Mr. Mueller\u2019s team of tampering with witnesses who had information about Mr. Manafort, but Mr. Kilimnik is not expected to ever stand trial. He did not respond to a phone call and email seeking comment on Tuesday.His relationship with Mr. Manafort dates back years. The two men worked together to promote a Russia-aligned politician, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who rose to Ukraine\u2019s presidency, was ousted in a popular uprising and fled to Russia in 2014. The two men continued working together over the next three years as Mr. Manafort\u2019s financial troubles grew and investigators began to investigate a fraud scheme that eventually led to his conviction for 10 felonies.In August 2016, apparently just before Mr. Manafort was fired from the Trump campaign, he and Mr. Kilimnik met to discuss a plan for Ukraine that seemed to further Russia\u2019s interests. They also met several times afterward, including once in Madrid in early 2017. In an interview in February 2017 in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital, Mr. Kilimnik suggested the plan would have involved reviving the political fortunes of Mr. Yanukovych, the ousted Ukrainian leader.For Russia, trying to influence the incoming Trump administration\u2019s policy on Ukraine was of paramount importance. The economic sanctions imposed after Russia annexed Crimea damaged the Russian economy, and various emissaries have tried to convince administration officials to broker a resolution to a long-running guerrilla war between Russia and Ukraine.In one previously reported case, for instance, an obscure Ukrainian lawmaker, Andrii V. Artemenko, worked with two associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s, Felix Sater and Michael D. Cohen, to deliver one Ukraine \u201cpeace plan\u201d to the White House. The plan landed on the desk of Michael T. Flynn, the president\u2019s first national security adviser, just before he was forced to resign.In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Artemenko said that investigators working for Mr. Mueller had questioned him extensively about his efforts to promote that plan. Mr. Artemenko said he knew neither Mr. Manafort nor Mr. Kilimnik and stressed that his plan was different from theirs.Prosecutors have accused Mr. Manafort of lying not only about his interactions with Mr. Kilimnik, but about other matters, including his contacts with senior administration officials in early 2017 and a payment related to a pro-Trump political action committee to cover his legal expenses. In November, after a dozen meetings with Mr. Manafort, they broke off the plea agreement with him, citing what they said was a series of lies.In their filing, Mr. Manafort\u2019s defense lawyers said that Mr. Manafort never intentionally misled federal authorities. Instead, they cast him as a sick man \u2014 troubled by \u201csevere\u201d gout, as well as by depression and anxiety \u2014 who made misstatements because of a faulty memory and lack of access to his own records.They nevertheless said that they would not seek a hearing to challenge the prosecutors\u2019 accusations that he lied, a decision that brings Mr. Manafort one step closer to being sentenced for his crimes.The decision not to seek a hearing reflected the dearth of legal choices for Mr. Manafort, 69, who has been in jail in Northern Virginia since mid-June. One prosecution resulted in his jury conviction in August for bank fraud, tax fraud and other financial crimes. A second led to his guilty plea in September on two conspiracy charges, including one stemming from a witness-tampering scheme with Mr. Kilimnik. Mr. Manafort faces at least 10 years in prison.The plea agreement gives the prosecutors the power to almost unilaterally decide whether Mr. Manafort has violated it. Unless Mr. Manafort can show they acted in bad faith \u2014 a high bar \u2014 their judgment stands. The prosecutors could also decide to file new charges against Mr. Manafort for lying to them, but apparently they do not plan to do so, according to Tuesday\u2019s filing.\u201cThey have him so deeply in the soup here that what both sides are almost saying is that this doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School professor.A previous version of this article misidentified the people to whom Paul Manafort wanted a Russian associate to send polling data. Mr. Manafort wanted the data sent to two Ukrainian oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, not to Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to the Kremlin.Scott Shane contributed reporting from London, and Andrew E. Kramer from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pessimism Looms Over Prospect of a Sweeping China Trade Deal", "Date": "2019-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a critical round of talks with China kicks off next week, the Trump administration is increasingly pessimistic that Beijing will make the kind of deep structural changes to its economy that the United States wants as part of a comprehensive trade agreement, according to officials involved with the talks.The United States is now weighing whether large Chinese purchases of American goods and more modest economic changes will be enough for a deal to end a damaging trade war between the two nations and help calm volatile markets.A Chinese delegation led by Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier, will meet with Robert Lighthizer, the Trump administration\u2019s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, on Jan. 30 and 31. The two countries are racing to strike an agreement by March 2, a deadline set by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.If no deal is reached by that date, Mr. Trump has said the United States will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Mr. Trump has focused on narrowing the trade gap between what the United States imports from China and what it exports, but the administration is also pressuring Beijing to scale back subsidies of state-owned enterprises, drastically open its markets to foreign investment and end its longstanding practice of forcing American companies to hand over trade secrets.For years, American companies, including technology firms and automakers, have been clamoring for such changes as they try to gain access to China\u2019s growing market. But many are beginning to fear that if the continuing brinkmanship between the world\u2019s two largest economies is not resolved, American companies will be left in an even worse position.\u201cI would have a hard time, especially considering what\u2019s happening in Washington, believing that this will be wrapped up in a little bow by March,\u201d said Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Markets have been particularly sensitive to the state of the talks, with stocks gyrating as whispers of progress or setbacks trickle out.Stock prices in the United States spiked last week after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended the removal of some tariffs to hasten a deal. They jumped again after Bloomberg News reported that China had offered to buy $1 trillion of American goods over the next six years.Over the weekend, Mr. Trump expressed hope that a deal could be reached but dismissed suggestions that the United States would roll back tariffs in advance of concessions from China.\u201cWe have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the United States because of the sanctions,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday, apparently confusing sanctions and tariffs. \u201cIf we make a deal, certainly we wouldn\u2019t have sanctions.\u201dIn a tweet on Monday evening, Mr. Trump once again suggested that the United States had the upper hand in negotiations, saying China\u2019s slowing economy should hasten a trade deal.\u201cChina posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies,\u201d the president said. \u201cMakes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s optimism about reaching a deal, others in the administration and on Capitol Hill have been more circumspect.\u201cThis is an ongoing process with the Chinese that is nowhere near completion,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said, rebutting the suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended rolling back tariffs.Last week, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Mr. Lighthizer, who is leading the talks, had told him there had been no progress on the \u201cstructural\u201d changes that the administration sought from China.Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hawk, has been pushing to ensure that China fulfills promises that Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump during a meeting in Buenos Aires last year. Mr. Lighthizer has expressed concern to colleagues and business groups that Mr. Trump could accept a watered-down deal that reduces the trade deficit but offers only symbolic structural changes to help end the trade war and lift the stock market.In an interview on the Fox Business Network on Friday, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said he was hopeful that a deal would be reached but acknowledged that many details still needed to be determined.\u201cThe technology stuff has not been dealt with, the enforcement stuff has not been dealt with,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cThe commodity stuff and the tariff rates, we\u2019re moving on the right track.\u201dTo those who see the negotiations as the best opportunity to rebalance the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing, the prospect of rolling back tariffs without sweeping concessions by China would fail to achieve Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of ending what he has deemed its unfair trade practices.\u201cHe wants to brag about what he got, not stop tariffs and be able to brag about nothing,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.A slimmed-down deal could also open Mr. Trump up to criticism from Democrats, who in some cases are more aligned with the president\u2019s aggressive approach to pressuring China than many Republicans.\u201cAnything less than a full effort to secure a fundamental reset of the U.S.-China trade relationship is a betrayal of the American economy and the future of American workers, industry, consumers and innovators,\u201d said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe Trump administration needs to stiffen its spine and get tough in these China talks.\u201dTrump administration officials have been debating whether they can push more tariffs on China without facing significant repercussions. China\u2019s economy is already slowing, in part because of the tariffs, and any further weakening could hurt global economic growth and the United States economy, which is itself showing signs of cooling.Mr. Mnuchin has been particularly interested in how big a role America\u2019s trade actions are playing in China\u2019s recent economic weakness.Trump administration officials have debated whether they should follow through with plans to raise tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on March 2 if China does not maintain the promises Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump, like accelerating purchases of American goods and making structural changes to its economy.Progress over the next six weeks could result in an extension of the March 2 deadline, even if a final deal is not reached, or some tariff relief as a reward for initial changes that China says it is willing to make. But the decision will ultimately rest with Mr. Trump.One question bedeviling the talks is how to enforce any trade agreement with China, given its opaque business environment and largely managed economy. One option that administration officials have considered is \u201csnapback\u201d tariffs, which would be reimposed if China appears to be reneging on its commitments.Mr. Trump has pointed to China\u2019s economic weakness as a reason it should acquiesce to his country\u2019s trade demands. But the trade war is also taking a toll on the United States economy, and the monthlong shutdown could lead to an economic contraction if it continues to drag on.While business are hoping for greater access to China\u2019s markets, the strategy of using tariffs as a negotiating tool has dented business confidence. According to a survey of 277 American companies by S&P Global this month, 43 percent said they had postponed investment because of the China tariffs.Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the administration, said that there were several important unknowns about the trade discussions that suggested a comprehensive deal was not near.It remains unclear if there is a working text of a deal that the two countries are using to hash out an agreement. And it is unclear whether China will pressure the Trump administration to drop its efforts to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. The executive was arrested in Canada last year as part of a broader agreement. The complicated internal debates taking place within China\u2019s government also make it difficult to predict its willingness to make concessions.\u201cWe are a long way to a deal,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cMuch work remains to be done, especially untangling the debate in China and pressure on Xi Jinping.\u201dBut Mr. Trump is also under pressure and the window for him to use market-rattling tariffs as leverage is likely to shrink as his re-election campaign heats up next year.\u201cThe damage to U.S. business, consumers and exporters is real and ongoing,\u201d Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and scholar at the Cato Institute, said, noting that the risks of this approach only increased if negotiations with China dragged into 2020. \u201cIf you\u2019re the Chinese, delay is your best friend.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Women, Tired of Restraints, Find Ways to Flee", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Whenever her father beat her, or bound her wrists and ankles to punish her for perceived disobedience, the Saudi teenager dreamed of escape, she said.As desperate as she was to leave, however, the same question always stopped her short: How would she get out?If she ran away anywhere within the country, the Saudi police would just send her home, she feared. Saudi law barred her from traveling abroad without her father\u2019s permission.But during a family vacation in Turkey when she was 17, Shahad al-Muhaimeed saw her chance, and bolted. While her family slept, she took a taxi across the border to Georgia and declared herself a refugee, leaving Saudi Arabia behind to start a new life.\u201cI now live the way I want to,\u201d said Ms. Muhaimeed, 19, by phone from her new home in Sweden. \u201cI live in a good place that has women\u2019s rights.\u201dThe phenomenon of women trying to flee Saudi Arabia is not new, coming to the world\u2019s attention as early as the 1970s, when a Saudi princess was caught trying to flee the kingdom with her lover. The couple were tried for adultery and executed.But the number of young women considering and taking the enormous risk to flee Saudi Arabia appears to have grown in recent years, rights groups say, as women frustrated by social and legal constraints at home turn to social media to help plan, and sometimes document, their efforts to escape.\u201cAll these women who 15 years ago would have never been heard from can now find a way to reach out,\u201d said Adam Coogle, who monitors Saudi Arabia for Human Rights Watch.For other women, like Ms. Alqunun, publicity played a key role in their successful escapes, but even global attention does not guarantee that a woman will not be repatriated.In 2017, Dina Ali Lasloom, 24, begged for help in a widely viewed online video after she was stopped while transiting in the Philippines. She was held at the airport until family members arrived and took her back to Saudi Arabia, where it is unclear what happened to her.The women who make it out must contend not only with their families\u2019 efforts to force them home, but also with the Saudi government\u2019s extensive and well-financed efforts to do so, often involving local diplomats pressing for repatriation.Women who are repatriated can face criminal charges of parental disobedience or harming the kingdom\u2019s reputation.\u201cAs Saudi women, we are still treated as property that belongs to the state,\u201d said Moudi Aljohani, who moved to the United States as a student and has applied for asylum. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the woman has any political views or not. They are going to go after her and forcibly return her.\u201dThe ways women choose to flee vary, but interviews with five who succeeded showed common themes. Many had discussed their plans in private chat groups with other women who had already fled or were also considering it.A few months before Ms. Alqunun left her family during a trip to Kuwait, for instance, a friend of hers had fled and reached Australia as a refugee and was giving her advice about escaping.Many fled from Turkey, a popular Saudi vacation spot, to Georgia, which Saudis can enter without a visa. And many aimed for Australia because they could apply for visas online, the only option for women who could not get to a foreign embassy.Some said they had fled because of abuse by male relatives and because they felt that the kingdom offered nowhere to turn for protection or justice.Others wanted out of the kingdom\u2019s strict, Islamic social codes, which limit what women can wear, which jobs they can pursue and with whom they can socialize. And all spoke of wanting to escape the kingdom\u2019s male guardianship laws, which give men great power over the lives of female relatives.\u201cIt is male guardianship that made us flee from Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Ms. Muhaimeed, in Sweden. \u201cThat is the biggest reason that the girls flee.\u201dIn Saudi Arabia, all women are required to have a male guardian, whose permission they need to get married, travel and undergo some medical procedures. The guardian is often a father or husband, but can be a brother or even a son.Those moves have increased his popularity among Saudi women, many of whom say guardianship is not a burden because their male relatives take good care of them. Others escape the rules by seeking jobs in neighboring countries like the United Arab Emirates, where social rules are more lax.But the system\u2019s critics say it gives no recourse to women with controlling or abusive guardians.That\u2019s what sent Nourah, 20, fleeing for Australia. Her father had divorced her mother before Nourah was born, and she was raised mostly by her uncles, she said. Her father sometimes abused her, but her efforts to get help fell on deaf ears.Last year, her boyfriend wanted to marry her, but her family refused because they perceived him as coming from a lower social class, said Nourah, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used for her safety. Her father began to arrange her marriage to a man she did not know and who wanted to bar her from working. In October, a day before her prospective groom arrived, she ran away.Saudi men use a government website to manage the women they have guardianship over, granting or denying them the right to travel, for example, and even setting up notifications so that they receive a text message when their wife or daughter boards a plane.In order to flee, Nourah used her father\u2019s phone to give herself permission to travel, disabled his notifications and flew to Turkey. From there she traveled to Georgia, then bought a ticket to Australia via the United Arab Emirates, although she feared that the Emirati government would catch her in transit and return her to Saudi Arabia.\u201cTo me that was like a suicide mission, but I had no other option,\u201d she said.But she made her connection and safely landed in Sydney, where she applied for asylum.Once abroad, the women often face barrages of insults and death threats from family members and other Saudis who think they have shamed the country.While human rights groups understand why women would want to flee bad situations, they worry that doing so could put them in grave danger.\u201cFor the few who succeed, there are many who fail, and to be sent back after this puts the women in a really dangerous situation,\u201d said Mr. Coogle of Human Rights Watch.He said it is hard to know how many women have fled the kingdom because some who leave never seek help from aid groups, and those who do reach out sometimes fall out of contact before it is clear if they actually made an attempt to leave or, if they did, where they ended up.He said he had been contacted by many women inside Saudi Arabia who wanted help getting out. His organization did not help them do so, he said, although it would help them seek legal protection if they were outside Saudi Arabia.Speaking from a hotel room in Bangkok where she was waiting under guard to learn if another nation would grant her asylum, Ms. Alqunun was already thinking about her new life. She wanted to go to college to improve her English and study architecture, she said.She did not expect the transition to life in a country she had never visited to be easy, but she had no regrets.\u201cThere is no escape other than fleeing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no other way.\u201dBen Hubbard reported from Beirut, Lebanon, and Richard C.

{"Headline": "Prosecutors Examining Ukrainians Who Flocked to Trump Inaugural", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hours after he was sworn in as America\u2019s 45th president, Donald J. Trump and his wife, Melania, swayed together to a rendition of the Frank Sinatra classic \u201cMy Way,\u201d as hundreds of their wealthiest and most influential supporters held aloft smartphones to capture the Trumps\u2019 first dance following the inauguration.He was one of at least a dozen Ukrainian political and business figures who made their way to Washington for the inauguration, several of whom attended the Liberty Ball. Most had more on their dance cards than just parties.They attended meetings and orchestrated encounters at Trump International Hotel with influential Republican members of Congress and close allies of President Trump. Representing a range of views, including a contingent seen as sympathetic to Moscow, they positioned themselves as brokers who could help solve one of the thorniest foreign policy problems facing the new administration \u2014 the ugly military stalemate between Russia and Ukraine and the tough sanctions imposed on Moscow following its seizure of Crimea.Evidence of the Ukrainians\u2019 presence eventually prompted interest from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and has spawned a number of related inquiries by federal prosecutors. The investigations are playing out against growing indications that some of the Ukrainians who came to Washington for the inaugural, or their allies, were promoting grand bargains, or \u201cpeace\u201d plans, that aligned with Russia\u2019s interests, including by lifting sanctions.Such a deal would not just have given the new administration additional flexibility to bring Moscow into American diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, but could also have eased the way for a cast of characters with ties to Mr. Trump \u2014 some of whom in turn had ties to the Ukrainians who came to Washington \u2014 to move ahead on business deals that had been complicated by the sanctions.Federal prosecutors have asked witnesses about how some of the Ukrainians gained access to inauguration events, whom they met with while they were in the United States, and what they discussed \u2014 including questions about various peace plan proposals \u2014 according to people with direct knowledge of the questions and others who were briefed on the interviews.As recently as last month, prosecutors were asking witnesses about illegal foreign lobbying related to Ukraine. Another subject of questions has been whether foreigners from Ukraine and other countries used straw donors to disguise donations to the inaugural committee. Federal law prohibits foreigners from contributing to an inaugural committee, although they can attend events if Americans buy the tickets.Elements of the investigations have gotten new visibility in recent weeks.Mr. Kilimnik was said in the inadvertently disclosed portions of the court filing to have received political polling data from Mr. Manafort in 2016. Mr. Manafort relayed a request to have Mr. Kilimnik pass the polling data to two Ukrainian oligarchs who had arranged or provided financing for Russia-aligned Ukrainian political parties for which Mr. Manafort had worked. One of the oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin, attended the Liberty Ball, according to one person familiar with the guest list and another who saw him there.Last month, prosecutors made a move that was seen as signaling the continuing cooperation of Sam Patten, an American consultant who had worked with Mr. Kilimnik and Russia-aligned Ukrainians looking to build ties to the Trump administration.Other Ukrainians who came to Washington during the inauguration said prosecutors had been asking wide-ranging questions.\u201cI have been interrogated twice by the F.B.I. and Mr. Mueller,\u201d said Andrii V. Artemenko, who came to the inauguration as a Ukrainian member of Parliament bearing a peace proposal that was later criticized as pro-Russian.Mr. Artemenko said he had testified before Mr. Mueller\u2019s grand jury last summer and had answered questions from the Mueller team \u201cabout what is my purpose of this trip, how I can get there, and what I did, how I got invitations and tickets and stuff.\u201dOn Capitol Hill, investigators from the House Oversight Committee, now under Democratic control, are looking into Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, who was a central player in the effort to build a new relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.How active a role Mr. Flynn played in the discussions about a peace plan for Ukraine is unclear, but congressional investigators have been pursuing whether he or his former business partners might have gained financially if the sanctions on Russia were ended.The committee, whose chairman is Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, is continuing to pursue its investigation of Mr. Flynn\u2019s business dealings and \u201chis potential misuse of his public position when he was national security adviser,\u201d a committee spokeswoman said.Mr. Flynn had been part of a business venture to partner with Russia to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East until June 2016, but after his direct involvement ended, he remained close with people involved in the project.In a December 2017 letter to the Oversight Committee, an officer of the company that hired Mr. Flynn as an adviser on the project, ACU Strategic Partners, said that the allegations of the whistle-blower were \u201cfalse and unfounded.\u201dMr. Flynn subsequently intersected with one of the Ukrainian efforts to resolve the problems with Russia.Mr. Artemenko, the former Ukrainian lawmaker, said in an interview that he did not attend any inaugural balls or other events that required paid tickets. Instead, he said he watched Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural address, which was free, and met with various Republicans to discuss his peace plan, which would have lifted sanctions against Russia and which he said had some support from the Kremlin.Within days of the inauguration, the White House made inquiries to the State Department and Congress about what might be required to ease the sanctions. Resetting relations with the Russian government and Mr. Putin had been central to Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy approach during the campaign, the transition and the first days of the new administration, and it is unclear what role, if any, the back-channel Ukrainian entreaties might have played.The official inquiries about an abrupt policy shift set off alarms at the State Department and in Congress.\u201cI heard from various sources that there was a plan to summarily lift sanctions on Russia,\u201d said Daniel Fried, a veteran diplomat who stayed on for the first several weeks of the Trump administration as the State Department\u2019s coordinator for sanctions policy. \u201cI was approached by people who were nervous that the United States was about to do something irretrievably stupid.\u201dSeveral other officials, some of whom would speak only on the condition of anonymity, also recalled jarring questions from the new National Security Council under Mr. Flynn, including whether Ukraine was really part of Russia and whether Crimea wanted to be part of Russia.By March 2017, the White House\u2019s sanctions relief trial balloon had wilted amid opposition from congressional leaders.But that has not stopped the prosecutorial scrutiny of those pushing plans to lift the sanctions around the inauguration, and their roles in prospective business deals that might have benefited from the lifting of the sanctions.By then, Russia was engaged in a surreptitious hacking and social media campaign to bolster Mr. Trump, who was publicly pressing for warmer relations with Russia, including signaling a willingness to consider lifting sanctions.The sanctions posed a potential obstacle for the Trump Tower Moscow project, in which Mr. Sater, who is Russian-American, had positioned himself as a key player. Mr. Sater and Mr. Cohen discussed financing from two Russian banks, VTB and GenBank, but the sanctions prohibited American citizens and companies from doing business with either of them, according to reporting by The New York Times and BuzzFeed.Another prominent businessman who had worked with Mr. Trump years earlier to try to erect a Trump building in Moscow, the Ukrainian-Russian developer Pavel Fuks, also was in Washington for the inauguration.Mr. Fuks, who has since fallen out of favor in Moscow and was placed under sanctions by the Kremlin, stayed at Trump International Hotel, and spent time with Vitaliy Khomutynnik, a businessman and parliamentarian who had been a member of the Russia-aligned party for which Mr. Manafort worked. Mr. Fuks and Mr. Khomutynnik talked with Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Ed Royce, both influential California Republicans at the time.Mr. McCarthy\u2019s office said that the encounter was random, and that the conversation was brief and perfunctory, and noted that Mr. McCarthy has supported sanctions against Russia.In Ukraine, a parliamentarian affiliated with the president, Petro Poroshenko, who is generally regarded as pro-Western, accused rival politicians of paying as much as $200,000 for inaugural tickets.Mr. Kivalov, the Ukrainian lawmaker who posted photos of the Trumps\u2019 dance, did not respond to requests for comment about how he got his tickets to the Liberty Ball. Borislav Bereza, a Ukrainian lawmaker who posted a photo of himself in a tuxedo at the ball, said he got his tickets free from someone \u201cconnected to Illinois,\u201d though he said, \u201cI don\u2019t remember for sure.\u201dKenneth P. Vogel, Scott Shane and Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Iuliia Mendel from Kiev, Ukraine. Sharon LaFraniere and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No Coincidence Here: Trump\u2019s Bezos Attack Was a Valentine to The Enquirer", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMediatorUntil you examined it. Then it started to make sense.In attacking the founder and chief executive of Amazon, President Trump praised The National Enquirer for publishing an article in its Jan. 28 edition with the all-caps headline: \u201cBEZOS\u2019 DIVORCE! THE CHEATING PHOTOS THAT ENDED HIS MARRIAGE.\u201dIn the same tweet \u2014 which made use of the sarcasm and schoolyard-style nicknaming that has endeared him to his base of supporters \u2014 the president saw fit to insult The Washington Post, the newspaper Mr. Bezos has owned since 2013.\u201cSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.\u201dThe news contained in the tweet on Sunday was something that, at first glance, may not seem like news at all: his praise for The Enquirer.Emphasis on \u201cwas.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Pecker has emerged as a cooperating witness in the federal investigation that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are pursuing into the schemes to pay six figures to Ms. McDougal and Stormy Daniels, another woman whose story of an affair with Mr. Trump was buried by the company.Mr. Pecker\u2019s word is of high value to prosecutors \u2014 and highly dangerous to Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen said he had arranged them with the full knowledge that they were equivalent to illegal campaign disbursements, because they were intended to help Mr. Trump win the election. He also said he had made the payments at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction, essentially accusing his former boss of being the driving force behind the whole thing.In December, Mr. Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison on those charges and others. In a court filing provided ahead of that sentencing, the New York prosecutors disclosed the extent of American Media\u2019s cooperation. The company\u2019s willingness to help is why there have been no charges against those involved with the running of the tabloid, prosecutors said.The cooperation of American Media officers was highly significant, because Mr. Cohen made for a flawed witness. His long track record of lies meant anything he said to law enforcement officials would require corroboration, if it were to be of any real value.After months of public denials that the payment to Ms. McDougal had been coordinated with Mr. Trump or Mr. Cohen, American Media flipped the script, telling prosecutors that it had coughed up the cash \u201cin cooperation, consultation and concert with, and at the request and suggestion of, one or more members or agents of\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. The publisher also explained why it had done so \u2014 so that Ms. McDougal \u201cdid not publicize damaging allegations\u201d and \u201cthereby influence that election.\u201dFurther placing Mr. Trump at the center of the scheme, American Media told prosecutors that all the way back in August 2015, Mr. Pecker had met with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen and \u201coffered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate\u2019s relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.\u201d Mr. Cohen was Mr. Trump\u2019s point man in the effort.That\u2019s why the unreported speculation on cable news and social media last week that The Enquirer\u2019s coverage of Mr. Bezos had been cooked up between Mr. Trump and American Media seemed out of whack to those of us who have covered the story.If facts come to light confirming that such a collaboration existed, it will be another jaw-dropper of a story. But for now, sans evidence, it seems that The Enquirer was fulfilling its traditional role of digging up dirt on the rich and famous when it went after Mr. Bezos.And there is this key dictum of Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of politics: The enemy of my enemy is my friend, if only for a news cycle.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Auto Sales Put Up a Big Number, but Show Signs of Strain", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs they recorded another year of strong United States sales, automakers said Thursday that they saw little cause for concern in the months ahead. But a closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts.Annual sales reached 17.3 million new cars and light trucks last year, a rise of 0.6 percent from 2017. It was the fourth year in a row that the figure exceeded 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded.But last year\u2019s increase was driven by higher sales to rental, government and corporate fleets. Sales to individual consumers \u2014 considered a more accurate measure of demand \u2014 were flat, according to Edmunds, an auto-retail data provider.At the same time, the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear. Interest-free loans, for example, accounted for just 5.5 percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in December. That was the lowest level for December since 2005, according to Edmunds.Furthermore, sales in 2018 got a one-time lift from the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul, which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars. Automakers won\u2019t have that tailwind again.\u201cThis year is going to be tougher than last year,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm, \u201cand the next year will even tougher than 2019.\u201dEven though total sales rose in 2018, signs of halting demand were clear, Mr. Wakefield said. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly.\u201cOther than that one segment, there isn\u2019t a lot of growth,\u201d he said.In addition, Tesla\u2019s sales more than tripled in 2018, and without that increase, the industry would have reported a decline in sales. G.M., Ford and Toyota reported lower sales for a third year in a row. G.M.\u2019s domestic market share fell to 17 percent \u2014 its lowest level since the company\u2019s infancy a century ago.Most automakers posted gains early in 2018, with sales markedly weakening late in the year. G.M. reported a decline of 1.6 percent for the full year, but its estimated year-over-year decline for December was 3.7 percent. (The company no longer reports monthly sales.) Ford\u2019s sales fell 9 percent in December.Beyond the domestic market, automakers face other potential challenges. The potential tremors from an economic slowdown in China became more palpable this week as Apple slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhone sales there.Lower consumer spending in China could hurt G.M., Ford, Toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth, and some reap considerable profits there. Ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in China and is trying reorganize its operations there.Those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on Thursday.Ford said any worries about a slowdown in China were not likely to be a factor in domestic demand. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we look at, as a global company,\u201d Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford\u2019s chief economist, said of the China outlook. But as far as the United States market, she said, \u201cI think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations.\u201dShe added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence.Likewise, a Toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve \u2014 and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers.\u201cInterest rates are always going to be a concern at some level,\u201d Jack Hollis, a group vice president at Toyota\u2019s North American manufacturing arm, said in a conference call. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t slowed the industry to a point of concern.\u201dOne thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued American preference for larger vehicles. Slumping oil prices \u2014 at about half their level five years ago \u2014 have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy a priority. And unless supplies are constrained, an economic slowdown should keep prices low.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Leaders at Davos Call for Global Rules on Tech", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 Leaders of Japan, South Africa, China and Germany issued a series of calls on Wednesday for global oversight of the tech sector, in a clear signal of growing international interest in seizing greater regulatory supervision of an industry led by the United States.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country would use its chairmanship of the Group of 20 nations this year to push forward a new international system for the oversight of how data is used. Data governance will be the theme when the group\u2019s presidents and prime ministers gather in June in Osaka for their annual summit meeting.The emphasis will be on expanding World Trade Organization rules to encompass trade in data as well as goods and services, he said. \u201cI would like Osaka G20 to be long remembered as the summit that started worldwide data governance,\u201d Mr. Abe said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.Mr. Abe\u2019s proposal was echoed in remarks by other world leaders at the forum. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said greater oversight of the tech sector would also be on the agenda of African Union leaders when they meet early next month in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\u201cWhen it comes to technology, I would support an overarching body that\u2019ll set standards on a whole range of things,\u201d Mr. Ramaphosa said in an interview, specifically mentioning cybersecurity as a priority.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany called in a speech for a \u201ccommon digital market\u201d in the European Union. She said international oversight of data usage was needed to head off opposition to the entire tech sector from those who fear the current pace of technological change.Speaking after Ms. Merkel, Vice President Wang Qishan of China also cited a need for more international coordination in oversight of the tech sector, but did not mention personal privacy. In what appeared to be an oblique reference to the Chinese government\u2019s close ties to that country\u2019s tech sector, which involves extensive surveillance of civil society, Mr. Wang emphasized that each country should also be free to set some of its own policies.\u201cWe need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participate in the global technological governance system as equals,\u201d said Mr. Wang.The remarks by the four leaders did not appear to represent a coordinated effort to push forward a new international architecture for oversight of the tech sector. Nor were they consistent in citing which tech sectors might merit further international rules.There was no consensus on what a global architecture might look like.The United States has largely deferred to the tech behemoths of Silicon Valley, which have favored some kind of international understanding among governments on data standards, but want those standards to impose few restrictions on how companies use that data.China has not accepted any limits on the government\u2019s ability to access people\u2019s personal information. The Chinese government has wide access to electronic communications and employs indoor and outdoor facial recognition and other monitoring and people-tracking technology.The rapid spread of digital technology in daily life and the implications that has on the future of work and data security will require more international cooperation, not less, Ms. Merkel said. But she acknowledged that nobody knows how to write the rules.Neither the American nor the Chinese approach would work for Europeans, who place a high value on privacy and social justice, Ms. Merkel said.\u201cI still have yet to see any global architecture that deals with these questions,\u201d she said.Mr. Abe said Japan wanted to move fast on data governance during its leadership this year of the Group of 20. But he provided only a general indication of what a new architecture might look like.\u201cWe must, on one hand, be able to put our personal data and data embodying intellectual property, national security intelligence, and so on, under careful protection, while on the other hand, we must enable the free flow of medical, industrial, traffic and other most useful, non-personal, anonymous data to see no borders, repeat, no borders,\u201d he said.Mr. Abe suggested that the world look for a way to broaden W.T.O. rules. The W.T.O. already regulates some kinds of telecommunications services as part of its rule-setting for international trade in goods and services.Europe, and Germany in particular, have emerged as the de facto regulators of the technology sector, exerting influence beyond their own borders. Berlin\u2019s digital crackdown on hate speech, which took effect last year, is being closely watched by other countries.But if the Continent wanted to continue to take a leading role in shaping international data standards, it would also have to become \u201can important actor\u201d in the industry itself, Ms. Merkel said.Africa presents further issues for designing any global system for the oversight of data or for the tech sector overall. It has emerged as a tech Wild West, with very few rules, varying by country.Mr. Ramaphosa said the African Union needed to act in concert with the international community.\u201cAfrica as a whole should for itself begin to see whether there should be standards that we should all adhere to so that, in the end, we do not have an exclusive type of architecture, which excludes smaller countries, less well-endowed countries financially,\u201d he said in the interview.The Trump administration has imposed increasing restrictions on exports of tech products to China. The administration has also sought to discourage countries around the world from buying telecommunications equipment from Huawei, particularly for advanced 5G mobile communications networks. It has suggested that Huawei may be linked to Chinese intelligence and to the shipments of American gear to Iran in violation of United States sanctions. Huawei has denied these claims.Vice President Wang appeared to push back against the United States\u2019 overall stance on tech issues.\u201cIt is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony, interfering in other countries\u2019 domestic affairs and conducting, shielding or protecting technology-enabled activities that undermine other countries\u2019 national security,\u201d he said.Mark Landler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

How? Mr. Minhaj dared to question Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, both for the C.I.A.\u2019s conclusion he ordered the murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi and for Saudi war atrocities in Yemen.Add another 10 paces to America\u2019s retreat from its place at the forefront of free speech and political expression.But each small step for dictatorial crackdowns abetted by American leaders \u2014 be they in politics or business \u2014 is one giant leap for the forces that are now so successfully stanching free expression and dissent across the world.L\u2019affaire Netflix raises a big question: As America\u2019s new media overlords grow at a stunning rate, expanding into every nook and cranny of the globe where governments will let them in, are they compelled to defend universal values like free speech that their home country was founded on?Increasingly, it seems, profit, expansion and perhaps a wee bit of cowardice are trumping the very principles that made the United States entertainment and news industries what they are \u2014 and that made a Netflix possible in the first place.I\u2019m not so na\u00efve that I don\u2019t understand that this is the cost of becoming a dominant media player now, when success is measured by how many more hundreds of millions of users a company can attract.\u201cStock price is measuring expected future earnings and those turn on global user numbers,\u201d said Sam Blatteis, the former public policy lead for Google and YouTube in the Gulf and now chief executive for MENA Catalysts, a Middle East government affairs consulting firm.Growth lies in emerging markets, many of which may be run by less-than-savory characters ruling by less-than-savory means.\u201cCompanies have to walk this tightrope between their cosmopolitan values on one side and realizing that going abroad into many emerging markets is a contact sport,\u201d Mr. Blatteis, speaking from Dubai, told me last week. \u201cYou have to roll up your sleeves and that can involve adapting and compromise.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t enough for President Trump, who sowed doubt about the intelligence conclusion while praising Saudi Arabia for \u201ckeeping oil prices at reasonable levels.\u201d The message on human rights and the First Amendment: Make me an offer.Mr. Trump didn\u2019t invent realpolitik. But previously, even when American actions contradicted its vision of itself, presidential paeans to democratic norms carried at least symbolic weight.Netflix had an opportunity to send a different message.\u201cEven more because Trump and the White House have been so much putting money over lives, frankly, I\u2019d hoped that this was where American businesses could take a stand,\u201d said The Post\u2019s global opinions editor Karen Attiah, who edited Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s columns. \u201cNetflix really had a chance to stand up for values and for Hasan.\u201dAt the very least, she said, Netflix should have never called the Saudis\u2019 legal request \u201cvalid,\u201d even if it believed it had to comply to maintain its presence in the country.Netflix wouldn\u2019t answer my question about what made the request \u201cvalid.\u201d In a statement to me, its general counsel, David Hyman, said, \u201cOur programs push the boundaries on important social and other issues in many places around the world.\u201d But, he added, \u201cto run a global service\u201d the company has to abide by foreign laws \u201ceven when we disagree with them.\u201d That is, a Netflix that compromises with rogue-ish regimes is better for free expression than no Netflix at all.One person outside the production, who was briefed on the deliberations in real time, told me Netflix discussed potential problems the episode would cause in Saudi Arabia before Mr. Minhaj filmed it, and raised the idea of scuttling it. This person would only speak on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions. An executive at the company, speaking on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said it only shared potential legal consequences with Mr. Minhaj\u2019s team as due diligence, noting it ultimately went forward with the show and its distribution in Saudi Arabia.Until it didn\u2019t.But throughout the war and afterward, they, along with many other major American corporations, joined the robust national effort to defeat the Nazis and promote American values throughout Europe, which helped the United States win the Cold War.It\u2019s a little hard to imagine such a national effort coming together now.Maybe that\u2019s partly because the major social media and entertainment platforms have such global scale that they\u2019re almost their own borderless governments.\u201cIt seems to be a moment in the evolution of the corporation that it starts to become akin to a world actor in its own right,\u201d Nicholas J. Cull, a professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism who has written extensively on the American information effort during the Cold War. When it comes to their home country, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018We\u2019re sympathetic, but we have our own set of interests.\u2019\u201dThe media behemoths would be wise to remember that their future growth will rely on having the same liberties that fostered their creation.I\u2019m reminded of a line from the Netflix-BBC One co-production of \u201cWatership Down,\u201d based on Richard Adams\u2019s allegorical novel about a noble herd of rabbits\u2019 pursuit of a peaceful homeland. After their leader Hazel helps another group of rabbits escape a totalitarian warren, he tells them, \u201cYou have fought so hard to earn your freedom, but now you must fight to keep it, because the battle for liberty is one which has no end.\u201dTake heed, Netflix.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fight to Keep Teachers in Tech Hubs From Being Priced Out", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Mr. Manzon, a culinary arts teacher at a nearby high school, had to pay market rates for his one-bedroom apartment, housing costs would eat up 75 percent of his $65,000 salary, he estimated.Luckily for him, he pays just $1,450 per month.Mr. Manzon, 38, is getting this bargain only because his employer, the Santa Clara Unified School District, owns his apartment complex and rents to its teachers at below-market rates. It is an uncommon arrangement \u2014 employer as landlord \u2014 that is starting to catch on elsewhere as school employees say they cannot afford to live comfortably in regions awash in tech dollars.And it is just one of several radical solutions for struggling educators in the nation\u2019s economic boom towns. From San Francisco to Seattle to Denver to Los Angeles, some are spending four hours per day commuting, or have relied on charitable funding for mortgage assistance. While several districts have tried to make it easier for teachers to live where they work, their efforts are not always welcomed by local homeowners, opening up new debates over gentrification and what obligations the expanding tech sector has to the cities that host its offices.The Santa Clara apartments are considered a model by school district officials in San Jose, the large city a few miles southeast. The San Jose Unified School District has its own plan: raze aging school buildings, send their students to new facilities, and turn that land into affordable rental housing for at least 300 teachers and school workers.But in a city that is rolling out the red carpet for Google employees \u2014 the City Council recently voted to approve a major land sale to the tech giant \u2014 the teacher housing idea has drawn a backlash.Some parents in Almaden Valley, a suburban-style enclave on the outskirts of San Jose, are not eager to see two of their schools, Leland High School and Bret Harte Middle School, relocated about two miles away in order to build affordable rental housing for educators.\u201cThey are both very, very high-end schools\u201d with lots of parental involvement, said Greg Braley, a leader of the opposition to the district\u2019s proposal and a resident of the neighborhood. \u201cHonestly, the schools are so good, people pay a premium to live in this area.\u201dMr. Braley works in finance and sends his own 9-year-old daughter to private school, but said she may attend public school in the future. Rather than disrupting a high-achieving community, he argued, it would make more sense to provide teachers with a housing allowance of some kind \u2014 something the district says it cannot afford to do.Hundreds flocked to an October community meeting to vent their frustration with the district\u2019s plan, and over 6,000 people have signed an online petition, started by Mr. Braley, against it. \u201cLow-income housing doesn\u2019t belong in Almaden,\u201d one resident commented on the petition. \u201cThis would devalue home prices in the area significantly,\u201d wrote another.District-owned housing would have interested Jesse Escobar, 33, an academic counselor at a middle school in San Jose. He and his girlfriend, Shana Riehart, a high school teacher, were priced out of town and moved 25 miles away to Hayward, Calif. Ms. Riehart quit her job to take a position closer to their new home. Traffic means Mr. Escobar\u2019s commute sometimes takes an hour and 45 minutes each way. He said it had been hurtful to hear parents oppose the housing plan for educators.\u201cInstead of saying teachers, if you had said engineers from Google or doctors from Kaiser, would the tone have been different?\u201d Mr. Escobar asked. \u201cFamilies trust us with their kids from 8 to 3 every day. I don\u2019t know why it wouldn\u2019t be the case that they would trust us in their communities.\u201dSupporters of the housing plan have a long fight ahead. On Election Day, a ballot initiative to approve a city bond that could have helped pay for the proposal fell just short of passing. The plan now needs the approval of the district board of education, and eventually, a property tax assessment would have to pass at the ballot box. It could be a yearslong process, and opponents warn it could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.Stephen McMahon, the district\u2019s deputy superintendent, blamed much of the neighborhood opposition on the stigma against affordable housing.Standing outside of Leland High School, one of the campuses that could be torn down in the proposal, Mr. McMahon said, \u201cThey\u2019re closing their eyes and seeing a 10-story apartment complex with people smoking pot on the doorsteps. That\u2019s not at all what we discussed doing out here.\u201dMr. McMahon said that each of the proposed housing sites would match existing housing stock: high-rise apartments downtown; single-family houses in Almaden Valley. He acknowledged that the school district lacked expertise in real estate, but said partner organizations would be brought on to help.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the work we want to do,\u201d Mr. McMahon said. \u201cWe have to do the housing thing because not being able to get employees compromises everything we want to do with our instruction and learning.\u201dMr. Manzon, a former chef, will have to leave his home in three years, because each resident is allowed to stay in the district apartments only seven years. He is considering leaving teaching \u2014 he has received higher-paying offers to work as an executive chef \u2014 or moving to Nevada, where much of his family has relocated.There, \u201cmy brother was able to purchase a home on a Honda mechanic\u2019s salary,\u201d he said.Holly Gonzalez, 34, a kindergarten teacher in East San Jose, and her husband, Daniel, a school district I.T. specialist, were able to buy a three-bedroom apartment for $610,000 this summer with help from their parents and from Landed. When they sell the home, they will owe Landed 25 percent of any gain in its value. The company is financed partly by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s charitable arm.Ms. Gonzalez, who has two sons, said that she and her husband were grateful, but that they had given up a lot, like a backyard. \u201cTo be willing to pay what we paid for this? You have to be desperate,\u201d she said.They remain anxious about their economic future, especially since San Jose\u2019s land sale to Google, which the City Council approved in December over the shouts of anti-gentrification activists, and is expected to bring in 20,000 mostly high-income tech jobs.Gentrification, Ms. Gonzalez said, could push out even more low-income families in her district, and declining school enrollment could mean layoffs for teachers.Supporters of the Google deal, like Mayor Sam Liccardo of San Jose, say the company will help finance affordable housing. As part of the agreement, any new apartment buildings constructed near the campus will set aside a quarter of the units as affordable.Mr. Liccardo said it was unfortunate that anxiety about closing schools had gotten mixed up with the debate over cost of living in the city. But he projected that within a few years, some of the same parents who opposed San Jose Unified\u2019s plan for teachers would grasp the importance of affordable housing.\u201cWhen people see their own children can no longer afford to live in the community\u201d as young adults, he said, \u201cit will change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hitachi to Cease Work on Nuclear Power Plant in North Wales", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHitachi said on Thursday that it was suspending work on a 15 billion pound, or $19.3 billion, nuclear power project in North Wales after failing to agree on financial terms with the British and Japanese governments.\u201cThe decision was made from the viewpoint of Hitachi\u2019s economic rationality as a private enterprise,\u201d the company, based in Japan, said.Ben Russell, a spokesman for Hitachi\u2019s British venture, Horizon Nuclear Power, said that discussions with the governments would continue but that its staff, currently around 300 people, would be cut to \u201ca minimal handful.\u201dHitachi will also stop planning work on a second project, in Oldbury, England. The company said it planned to take a write-off of 300 billion yen, or $2.75 billion, on the projects.The decision by Hitachi is a blow to the British government, which is betting heavily on nuclear installations to help meet the country\u2019s electric power needs in the coming decades.The big question is whether Hitachi\u2019s move will be a death knell for Britain\u2019s campaign to build nuclear plants, which so far has resulted in only one project under construction.While there are signs that the government is rethinking its energy policy, it was willing to go a long way toward trying to keep Hitachi on board.In a statement to Parliament on Thursday, Greg Clark, the secretary of state for business and energy, said the government had been willing to consider providing one-third of the equity financing for the project and to take on all of the construction debt. When Hitachi continued to balk, Mr. Clark said, \u201cI was not prepared to ask the taxpayer to take on a larger share.\u201dThe Hitachi plant would have been a big boost for the struggling local economy in North Wales, providing up to 850 permanent jobs.Anglesey Island, where the plant, called Wylfa Newydd, was to be built, will most likely feel the harshest impact. Llinos Medi, leader of the Anglesey Council, the local government authority on the island, said in a statement that she was concerned about the suspension\u2019s \u201cimmediate impact on local men and women whose employment is at risk as a consequence of this suspension.\u201dFor Hitachi, though, the announcement could mark the end of a long and expensive saga. The company acquired the Horizon sites from two German utilities in 2012 for \u00a3697 million, or about $900 million, and wound up spending around \u00a32 billion in total on design approvals, staff and other matters. It has been hiring apprentices, who have been training at a technical college on the island and going to Spain and Japan for work experience. At times in recent months more than 100 archaeologists were on the site, excavating and recording ancient structures that the construction would have destroyed.Hitachi hoped Britain would prove to be an international showcase for its reactor designs. Ultimately, the company lost patience with the high level of spending required to land such a project there.Hitachi had sought to arrive at a financial arrangement that would attract long-term investors like pension funds to the project and reduce its own exposure. But the offers of support from both the British and the Japanese sides were not enough.In an interview on Thursday, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon\u2019s chief executive, said the Wales site was very attractive and had a supportive community, but that alone, he added, is not enough to attract outside investment.Investors, Mr. Hawthorne said, were put off by the eight- to 10-year wait for a return, as well as the risks of cost overruns and other issues. With the project gaining momentum and spending rising, \u201cit became too much for Hitachi to keep going,\u201d he said.Mr. Hawthorne said Hitachi would prefer to return to Britain as a supplier rather than a developer taking on large upfront risks.In his statement, Mr. Clark said it was clear that the government needed to consider a new approach to financing large nuclear projects. He also said the government was considering supporting small nuclear reactors, including a consortium led by Rolls-Royce, the British jet engine maker.Hitachi\u2019s stepping back from Britain leaves France\u2019s state-controlled EDF Group and its Chinese partner, CGN, as the only companies pursuing nuclear power projects in the country. EDF, through a British subsidiary, owns Britain\u2019s operating nuclear power plants; with CGN, it is building Britain\u2019s first nuclear plant since the 1990s in southwest England at a cost of \u00a320 billion. CGN wants to build a plant in eastern England.China now has by far the world\u2019s largest nuclear building program, but it is largely domestic. CGN would like to use Britain as a steppingstone to an international nuclear business, though there is skepticism in Britain about relying on companies tied to Beijing for a strategically important service like electric power.The dwindling number of companies willing to make the huge investments required to develop nuclear plants also reflects the falling costs of renewable energy sources, like solar and offshore wind.\u201cThe economics of the energy market have changed significantly in recent years,\u201d Mr. Clark said, with the cost of renewables trending downward and those for nuclear plants rising.Antony Froggatt, a nuclear analyst at Chatham House, a research organization, noted that nuclear energy was costly and controversial, and that having a foreign company like Hitachi build a plant in Britain was unlikely to contribute to building a British industry.\u201cFor all those reasons,\u201d he said, \u201cnuclear falls away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018New Chapter\u2019 in Space Exploration as China Reaches Far Side of the Moon", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe landing of the probe, called Chang\u2019e-4 after the moon goddess in Chinese mythology, is one in a coming series of missions that underscore the country\u2019s ambitions to join \u2014 and even lead \u2014 the space race.China landed another rover on the moon in 2013, joining the United States and the Soviet Union as the only nations to have carried out a \u201csoft landing\u201d there, but the Chang\u2019e-4 is the first to touch down on the side of the moon that perpetually faces away from the Earth.The mission \u201chas opened a new chapter in humanity\u2019s exploration of the moon,\u201d the China National Space Administration said in an announcement on its website. The agency said the spacecraft landed at 10:26 a.m. Beijing time at its target on the far side of the moon.Although a latecomer by decades to space exploration, China is quickly catching up, experts say, and could challenge the United States for supremacy in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other fields.China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 became the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the far side of the moon.\u201cThis space mission shows that China has reached the advanced world-class level in deep space exploration,\u201d said Zhu Menghua, a professor at the Macau University of Science and Technology who has worked closely with the Chinese space agency. \u201cWe Chinese people have done something that the Americans have not dared try.\u201dChina now plans to begin fully operating its third space station by 2022, to put astronauts in a lunar base by later in that decade, and to send probes to Mars, including ones that could return samples of the Martian surface back to Earth.Though the moon is hardly untrodden ground after decades of exploration, a new landing is far more than just a propaganda coup, experts say.The crater where the Chinese landed is the oldest and deepest on the moon, so the probe\u2019s discoveries may offer insights into the moon\u2019s origins and evolution. And some scientists suspect that the surrounding basin may be rich in minerals. If exploiting the moon\u2019s resources is the next step in space development, a successful mission could leave the Chinese better positioned.\u201cThis is a major achievement technically and symbolically,\u201d said Namrata Goswami, an independent analyst who wrote about space for the Defense Department\u2019s Minerva Research Institute. \u201cChina views this landing as just a steppingstone, as it also views its future manned lunar landing, since its long-term goal is to colonize the moon and use it as a vast supply of energy.\u201dThe place the probe is exploring, Dr. Goswami said, could become a future refueling base for missions deeper into space in the way \u201cnavies viewed coaling stations, for purposes of refueling and resupply.\u201dIt landed in the Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, a flat feature about 110 miles wide that sits inside a larger basin near the moon\u2019s south pole. The main lander will release a 300-pound rover that, barring mishap, will roam the crater. (The rover\u2019s name, the subject of a public contest and vote, has not yet been revealed.)The instruments aboard the lander and the rover include cameras, ground-penetrating radar and spectrometers to help identify the composition of the area, which was formed by a meteorite. Scientists hope the rocks and dirt in the area will add to the understanding of the moon\u2019s geology.The lander will also conduct a biology experiment to see if plant seeds will germinate and silkworm eggs will hatch in the moon\u2019s low gravity.Since the moon prevents direct communications from the far side, China launched a satellite to act as a relay, allowing the rover to bounce signals off it first before they continue back to earthbound scientists.The fear of losing face over failures, as well as the sensitivity of the technology involved, has made the Chinese government reluctant to discuss its programs in detail, compared with the relative openness of NASA and other space programs. Last April, a Chinese space station, the Tiangong-1, fell to earth after officials lost communication with it.Ahead of the landing, reports about the Chang\u2019e-4 were fairly sparse \u2014 leaving astronomy experts and amateurs scouring for clues.Some people might ask, \u201cSo what?\u201d said John M. Logsdon, an emeritus professor at the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, but scientists take a different view.\u201cWe learn more about the moon,\u201d Dr. Logsdon said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to a place that no spacecraft has ever visited, so it\u2019s true exploration.\u201dChina\u2019s membership in the elite ranks of space nations has unquestionably been a source of national pride, carefully managed to emphasize the Communist Party\u2019s strong and steady leadership.China is only the third country \u2014 it followed the United States and Russia \u2014 to send its own astronauts into space aboard its own rockets. The first crewed mission took place in 2003, and the Chinese have since sent a total of 11 astronauts into space. In 2016, two of them spent 30 days in China\u2019s space station.In 2018, for the first time, China launched more rockets into space \u2014 38 \u2014 than any other country; one launch failed in October. Another moon landing, of the Chang\u2019e-5, is planned for later this year.Many of the launches last year carried satellites for China\u2019s own version of the Global Positioning System, which already covers China and much of Asia. China hopes its system, called Beidou, will cover the entire globe by next year, and become a commercial and political rival to the American one.The Chinese space agency has experienced setbacks, including the failed launch in 2017 of a new heavy-lift rocket, the Long March 5. That caused a ripple of delays that is still being felt. The country\u2019s space budget also remains far smaller than NASA\u2019s.Even so, conquering space remains a national priority. And the country\u2019s political system, dominated by the Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, means that funding and planning are less vulnerable to political mood swings like those that have affected NASA\u2019s budgets over the years.\u201cDeep-space exploration requires a tremendous amount of time and money,\u201d Mr. Zhu, the Macau professor, said. \u201cThis is not something a small country is able to do.\u201dHe said he was confident that \u201cin several years or a decade, China will gradually catch up from behind and take a leading role in this area.\u201dFollow Steven Lee Myers on Twitter: @stevenleemyers.Eric Nagourney contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Considering Indra Nooyi to Head World Bank", "Date": "2019-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House is considering Indra K. Nooyi, the former chief executive officer of PepsiCo, for the position of World Bank president, according to several people familiar with the process.Ms. Nooyi, who stepped down from her role at PepsiCo last August after leading the company for 12 years, has been courted as an administration ally by Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s eldest daughter, who is playing a role in the selection of a nominee.The decision-making process for the top post at the World Bank is fluid and in its initial stages, and early front-runners and candidates often fall off the radar, or withdraw from consideration, before the president makes his ultimate pick. Mr. Trump often makes his own gut decisions about whom to chose.Negative comments that Ms. Nooyi made after the 2016 election, during which she did not publicly endorse any candidate, are seen as a potential roadblock to her nomination. Mr. Trump\u2019s win, she said, created a lot of questions among her daughters and her employees.\u201cThey were all in mourning,\u201d Ms. Nooyi said in an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times\u2019s DealBook conference in 2016.\u201cOur employees are all crying. And the question that they\u2019re asking, especially those who are not white: \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 Women are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 LGBT people are asking, \u2018Are we safe?\u2019 I never thought I\u2019d have had to answer those questions.\u201dMs. Nooyi later tried to clarify her remarks, and a spokesman for PepsiCo told Fortune magazine that \u201cMrs. Nooyi misspoke. She was referring to the reaction of a group of employees she spoke to who were apprehensive about the outcome of the election. She never intended to imply that all employees feel the same way.\u201dThat those past comments may hinder her chances are a reminder that Mr. Trump does not have a large circle of loyalists to choose from for top positions.The process of choosing a successor is being overseen by Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary; Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff; and Ms. Trump, whose role in the process was announced by the White House on Monday.Ms. Trump\u2019s role in the process drew some criticism from ethics watchdogs on Monday, who said that it could pose a conflict of interest for the president\u2019s daughter to be involved in international economic matters when she has not completely divested from her assets.But Ms. Trump\u2019s role is notable because of her unique sway over her father when it comes to personnel matters. The group was expected to begin the interview process on Tuesday in order to present Mr. Trump with recommendations for a nominee.A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the candidates.An earlier version of this article misstated Indra K.

{"Headline": "Described as Defeated, Islamic State Punches Back With Guerrilla Tactics", "Date": "2019-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe group has been declared vanquished before, only to prove politicians wrong and to rise stronger than before.\u201cPeople make the mistake of thinking that when you lose territory, it\u2019s linear \u2014 that they will continue to lose,\u201d said Seth G. Jones, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the author of the center\u2019s recent study assessing ISIS\u2019 troop strength.\u201cWhen you lose territory, smart groups shift to guerrilla strategy and tactics, including targeted assassinations, ambushes, raids, bombings,\u201d he added. \u201cThat is how you wear the enemy down.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s declaration that ISIS has been defeated is the second time the group has been described this way.With his troops exhausted and outnumbered, the emir of the terrorist group privately lamented that they could no longer hold ground.Recent estimates indicate that the Islamic State has more than 20 to 30 times the fighters it had the last time it was left for dead.But the crumbling of the state has made it difficult to recruit and only a trickle of new members are believed to still be heading to the region from overseas, down from the thousands that were crossing into their territory before.With the attack on the Syrian restaurant, the world was again reminded of the group\u2019s ability to carry out deadly attacks.Two American troops were killed in that suicide bombing, doubling the death toll for United States forces killed in combat since the start of their four-year deployment to Syria.\u201cEveryone knows, and we have always said, that the battle against ISIS has not ended, the danger of ISIS has not ended,\u201d said Shervan Darwish, the spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, where the attack occurred. \u201cISIS still has power, still has cells and it is working to reorganize its ranks.\u201dThose figures do not account for the thousands of fighters based in the caves of Afghanistan, in the scrubland of Niger and Mali, in the Sinai Desert, in lawless stretches of Libya and Yemen, and in the numerous other countries where affiliates of the group have taken hold.Online, the terror group has repeatedly boasted about how the United States\u2019 pullout is evidence that the Islamic State has outlasted the American operation.In one video narrated by a well-known ISIS propagandist, Turjman Aswarti, the terror group brags that they are stronger now than the last time American forces withdrew.\u201cWhen Obama announced America\u2019s flight from Iraq, the fire of our war was only burning in Iraq,\u201d he says, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist content. \u201cToday the flames of war are still burning in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen, Sinai, East Africa and Libya,\u201d he said, naming the other countries where ISIS affiliates have flourished.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that the group today is vastly more powerful than the Islamic State of Iraq was then,\u201d said Brian Fishman, a former director of research at the Combating Terrorism Center at the United States Military Academy in West Point and the author of book on the rise of ISIS.Experts say the White House is mistakenly equating the group\u2019s shrunken territorial holdings with its overall strength.From its peak four years ago, when it held almost half of Syria and a third of Iraq, the Islamic State has now lost all but a fraction of the land it once held in the region.But it has made a tactical shift to a guerrilla strategy, as Mr. Jones of the strategic and international studies group described it.In the newsletter, the Islamic State compared its situation now with the tatters it was in before the last American pullout.\u201cIt became impossible in early 2008 to continue the fight in its conventional ways,\u201d ISIS said in the essay.The essay explained that fighting detachments were abolished and the group\u2019s remaining fighters were all trained in using improvised explosive devices.\u201cInstead of clashing with the heavily equipped American Army, compared to our small and underequipped one, the fight took an absolutely new shape,\u201d the article said.At the height of its territorial power, ISIS resembled a conventional army, at times rolling into battle with T-55 tanks.Mr. Hassan documented how, in early 2016, the group stepped up hit-and-run attacks in towns it had lost. These hasty operations appeared aimed at inflicting harm on these towns\u2019 new rulers, with no intention of regaining territorial control.Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, documented how throughout Iraq the group has focused with laserlike precision on killing \u201cmoktars,\u201d or village chiefs, as well as tribal elders and local politicians.These targeted assassinations drew little coverage in the international news media, and yet they have helped undercut the trust Iraqis place in their government\u2019s ability to protect them \u2014 as well as drive young men back into ISIS\u2019s fold, Mr. Knights said.\u201cIf ISIS can come to your town and kill the most important person in your town any night of the year, do you feel you\u2019ve been liberated?\u201d he asked.The group\u2019s current tactics mirror ISIS\u2019 strategy a decade ago, which led to its rebirth.\u201cThey realized you don\u2019t have to mount 6,000 attacks per month,\u201d Mr. Knights said. \u201cYou just have to kill the right 50 people each month.\u201d\u201cThey spend time learning the routine of the new security forces in town,\u201d Mr. Hassan said. \u201cThey look for security gaps. They look for patterns.\u201d\u201cOnce you see gaps, you start working through these gaps,\u201d he added. \u201cThey don\u2019t just have a crazy guy run out, start shooting and get killed.\u201dIt is in that context that analysts are viewing the deadly attack last Wednesday on American forces in Manbij.The soldiers seemed to have made little effort to hide their presence or vary their routine to make it harder for enemies to track them.In the article, the ISIS operative explained the surveillance the group had used, saying American forces were positioned at three small bases on the outskirts of Manbij. He said United States troops moved regularly among these bases in convoys of five to 10 armored cars, escorted by guard vehicles belonging to an American-backed Kurdish militia.While it is impossible to verify the claims made in the ISIS newsletter \u2014 and the Pentagon has released no further details on the attack \u2014 the surveillance described in the article is consistent with what is known about how the group is carrying out its insurgency.He explained that American soldiers entered the city in convoys of Land Cruisers, but rarely appeared outside their armored cars, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist content.\u201cTo conduct an attack like this means that ISIS was conducting intelligence and reconnaissance on the movement of U.S. soldiers and had someone pre-positioned in the city so that once they got info on timing and location they could get someone on the site pretty fast,\u201d said Mr. Jones of the strategic and international studies group. \u201cThat means that in Manbij, they have a cell structure.\u201dMr. Jones said strikes like the one on the American troops require militants to carry out intelligence, build the bomb, transport the bomb and deploy a suicide bomber.\u201cIt shows they have a clandestine network,\u201d he said.Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon, and Karam Shoumali contributed from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Renault Names New Leaders to Replace Carlos Ghosn", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompany officials said Renault would accelerate efforts to smooth tensions over the future governance of the global car alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors of Japan and which Mr. Ghosn oversaw for more than a decade. Renault and Nissan have each viewed the other as trying to capitalize on the leadership vacuum since Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest to tip the balance of power in its favor.How easily they can turn a page remains to be seen. Renault, which holds a 43 percent stake in Nissan, has been the dominant partner even though Nissan sells more cars, a state of affairs that has rankled executives in Japan.The task of corporate diplomacy will fall to Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the French tire maker Michelin, who was named Renault\u2019s chairman Thursday. The son of an ambassador and a meticulous executive, Mr. Senard, 65, has a reputation for easing industrial relations with unions at Michelin and for operating with a deliberate style.His immediate priority will be to restore confidence in the relationship with Nissan, where Mr. Ghosn was viewed as having outsize power. Mr. Senard will be Renault\u2019s point person for managing strategic and operational issues in the alliance, including turning the focus as soon as possible back to the companies\u2019 business, as the automakers face headwinds in their key markets.Thierry Bollor\u00e9, Renault\u2019s chief operating officer, was named Renault\u2019s chief executive and will run the company\u2019s day-to-day functions. Mr. Ghosn had filled both the chairman and chief executive positions.\u201cIt\u2019s important to re-establish calm after the extraordinary events that we\u2019ve all just been through,\u201d Mr. Senard said in a brief appearance Thursday with Mr. Bollor\u00e9 at Renault headquarters in Paris. Keeping the alliance together \u201cis essential,\u201d he added.Renault, which depends on Nissan for financial contributions, is especially eager to have a say over who Nissan\u2019s next chairman will be; Mr. Ghosn was stripped of that role after his arrest. Renault is likely to propose Mr. Senard, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, said he hoped to hold talks with the new Renault leadership as early as possible. \u201cI think we will be able to hold big, forward-looking discussions,\u201d he said at a late-night news conference at Nissan\u2019s global headquarters in Yokohama, Japan.But Mr. Saikawa also made clear that Nissan did not intend to be overshadowed by its French partner. \u201cAs the company with the biggest corporate footprint, I\u2019d like Nissan to take a more active role in the alliance,\u201d he said.He added that Nissan didn\u2019t regard Renault\u2019s 43 percent stake as a right to dictate policy in the alliance. \u201cWhether the alliance is generating value, the yardstick is not to be seen from the shareholding ratio,\u201d Mr. Saikawa said.Though no longer in his leadership positions, Mr. Ghosn remains on the boards of Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault, and can be removed only by shareholder votes.The companies must act quickly to put their differences behind them. Together, the alliance employs about 450,000 worldwide. Renault has more than 47,000 workers in France, making it one of the country\u2019s biggest employers.\u201cThey need the alliance,\u201d said Peter Wells, a professor at the Cardiff Business School in Wales who focuses on the auto industry. \u201cThe whole trend is more agglomeration.\u201dTo move forward, analysts said, Renault should acknowledge that Nissan has become the dominant partner in terms of its position in the world car market and adjust the alliance accordingly. The trick will be to find a new balance of power acceptable to the Japanese and French governments as well as shareholders and company management.\u201cThis is as much a political process as it is corporate,\u201d Mr. Wells said.Renault previously signaled that it wanted to pursue closer financial ties with Nissan, with Mr. Ghosn at one point considering a merger, an impulse that Nissan has opposed. Mr. Saikawa has said Nissan\u2019s preference is to even out the shareholding structure \u2014 to increase its holdings in Renault and reduce Renault\u2019s holdings in Nissan.That issue is not on the table \u201cfor the moment,\u201d the French finance minister, Bruno LeMaire, said Thursday in an interview on BFM television from Davos, Switzerland.But even if it comes up for discussion later, Renault is not inclined to change the shareholding structure, according to the person with knowledge of the situation. For now, at least, Renault considers its larger stake to be a source of protection for Nissan at a time when the Japanese automaker\u2019s performance and operating margin have slipped, the person said.Mr. LeMaire sought to play down tensions between the automakers, saying in the television interview that it was important that Nissan move forward at the April meeting.Mr. Saikawa denied at the news briefing that Nissan was seeking to exclude Renault from decision-making by not holding the meeting sooner. Such an event requires many preparatory steps, he said, and April is the earliest possible time.\u201cWe are absolutely not seeking to delay,\u201d he said.Mr. LeMaire said strengthening the alliance was a top priority, along with maintaining stability and jobs.\u201cWhat counts are hundreds of thousands of jobs, and how Renault can continue to be a global leader, especially for electric vehicles,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the age of Jean-Dominique Senard, the new chairman of Renault. He is 65, not 66.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Hiroko Tabuchi from Yokohama, Japan. Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Guatemala\u2019s Experiment in Fighting Corruption Is Under Attack", "Date": "2019-01-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Almost a dozen years ago, a panel of international prosecutors backed by the United Nations arrived in Guatemala. Their goal: to team up with the Guatemalan attorney general\u2019s office, strengthen the rule of law and combat the criminal networks that had taken hold after the country emerged from more than three decades of civil war.It was a bold experiment in outsourcing justice, but given Guatemala\u2019s fragile democracy, its weak institutions and the extent of corruption in the country, the government was prepared to cede sovereignty.Since the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala began its work in 2007, it has peeled back layers of corruption, helped strengthen the courts and professionalized the attorney general\u2019s office, winning the approval of the Guatemalan people and sending powerful politicians, leaders of organized crime and businessmen to jail.But when a 2017 inquiry into illegal campaign financing focused on President Jimmy Morales directly, he began to stifle the work of the commission, known as Cicig, according its Spanish initials.Mr. Morales has defied the court in the past. If he does so this time, Mr. Morales would plunge the country into a constitutional crisis.Here are some key questions about what this could mean for the country.The corruption schemes cut a wide swath across the government, tainting legislators, judges, and municipal officials, and infiltrating Guatemala\u2019s customs agency, its main public health care provider, a major port, its passport office and the communications ministry.But the commission\u2019s contribution toward strengthening the rule of law in Guatemala goes beyond disrupting these schemes and jailing corrupt politicians and their allies.More broadly, Cicig\u2019s work in Guatemala has been a powerful example of a successful anti-corruption battle in Latin America, where citizens have increasingly expressed revulsion against entrenched graft and impunity.Under the leadership of Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, a Colombian prosecutor who arrived in 2013, Cicig has worked closely with two attorneys general.At first, Mr. Morales allied himself with the anti-corruption movement, promising to work with Cicig and appointing a cabinet of young reformers.Because of the agreement with the United Nations, though, the Guatemalan government did not expel Cicig.That changed this week, when the government declared on Monday that it was withdrawing from the agreement and gave Cicig\u2019s international staff 24 hours to leave the country. In response, the country\u2019s highest court on constitutional matters threw out the government\u2019s decision.Elections. The country votes for a new president and Congress in June. Although Mr. Morales is ineligible for re-election, he and his allies will oppose any candidate who supports Cicig and the continuation of its investigations into government corruption. Mr. Morales will lose immunity once he steps down from office.With Cicig out of the picture, the government may find it easier to pressure electoral authorities not to allow presidential candidates who can cause trouble for it \u2014 such as Thelma Aldana, the former attorney general who worked with Mr. Vel\u00e1squez to bring the highest profile prosecutions.Washington has been the commission\u2019s main source of funding, along with Canada and European countries. The Obama administration was a strong supporter of Cicig, seeing its role in strengthening the rule of law in the region as central to American interests, among them stemming the flow of migrants and drugs from Central America.On Tuesday, the United States Embassy in Guatemala City came out in support of Cicig.\u201cThe U.S. government is concerned about the future of anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala,\u201d the statement said. \u201cRule of law, reduced corruption and an end to impunity are key to security, stability, and prosperity, not only in Guatemala, but throughout the region.\u201dIt is unclear. If the Guatemalan government perceives that it can continue to defy the court, then it will block the return of Cicig\u2019s international staff, who have left the country for their safety. Without Cicig\u2019s prosecutors, the attorney general\u2019s office may struggle to try the cases it has built with the commission.Allies of Mr. Morales in the Guatemalan Congress and the courts are maneuvering to remove three of the constitutional court\u2019s five magistrates. If that effort is successful, then the last formal check on the government\u2019s power will be lifted.That leaves only the international community, including the United States, and Guatemalans themselves to pressure the government to uphold the rule of law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Government Calls for Carlos Ghosn to Be Replaced as Renault\u2019s Leader", "Date": "2019-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 For nearly three months, as its chairman and chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, remained jailed in Tokyo on allegations of financial misconduct, the French carmaker Renault stood by him.On Wednesday, the French government, Renault\u2019s largest shareholder, called on the company to replace Mr. Ghosn and install new leadership in the coming days.\u201cWe now must move to a new phase,\u201d Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview on the French television channel LCI. He added, \u201cI have always said that if Carlos Ghosn were to be durably incapacitated, we\u2019d have to move on to something else, and we\u2019re there now.\u201dThe public push for Mr. Ghosn\u2019s removal from Renault came after senior French officials flew to Tokyo after the Tuesday bail hearing. Martin Vial, one of two French government representatives on the Renault board, and Emmanuel Moulin, Mr. Le Maire\u2019s chief of staff, are expected to meet Japanese officials and Nissan stakeholders during the trip, which was planned a few days ago, according to a Finance Ministry spokeswoman.Demand for cars in China, the United States and Europe, the three biggest markets, is falling. Analysts say the partnership that Renault and Nissan founded in 1999 to share purchasing and expertise is essential if the companies are to stay competitive in an industry where size provides a crucial advantage.In a nod to the importance of scale, Ford Motor and Volkswagen outlined on Monday what they hope will become their own broad alliance to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars, potentially creating competition for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance on that front.Nissan and Mitsubishi removed Mr. Ghosn from their boards immediately after his initial arrest on Nov. 19, but Renault and the French government have maintained that he had a \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d Privately, though, succession plans were being prepared in case of a prolonged detention. Because Mr. Ghosn still faces a long trial in Japan, he cannot carry out his executive functions.Appointing a successor to Mr. Ghosn would not necessarily mean Renault considered him guilty of wrongdoing, but could instead reflect his inability to perform his duties from jail, where, his family says, the spartan conditions have also harmed his health.On Monday, Mr. Ghosn\u2019s wife, Carole, published a letter to Human Rights Watch, a global advocacy group, calling her husband\u2019s detention \u201ca case study in the realities of a draconian system.\u201d She said that Mr. Ghosn had lost almost seven pounds in two weeks of mostly eating rice and barley, and that he had been denied medication and allowed to bathe only two or three times a week.The case has taken on a political dimension in France, where President Emmanuel Macron is facing scrutiny as a result of the so-called Yellow Vest protests against income inequality and the declining purchasing power of the country\u2019s working-class residents. The alliance has employees around the world, and Renault, with over 47,000 workers, is one of France\u2019s biggest employers.Mr. Le Maire said the decision to push for the carmaker to replace Mr. Ghosn was linked to the need to preserve jobs and stability at the alliance. \u201cJobs are the priority,\u201d he said in the television interview.It is possible that Mr. Bollor\u00e9 would now be appointed chief executive on a permanent basis. As for the chairman\u2019s position, Mr. Le Maire urged in the television interview that Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the tire maker Michelin, be considered.It is a challenging moment for Renault and Nissan. Renault\u2019s new car sales in Europe have declined lately, diminishing the company\u2019s share of its core market. In the United States, Nissan is facing the consequences of a strategy championed by Mr. Ghosn that focused on winning market share through discounts at the expense of profits. Nissan is trying to cut back on the discounts just as the overall market enters a downturn.Renault still relies on financial contributions from Nissan, the alliance\u2019s dominant performer, and some Renault officials are concerned that Nissan\u2019s sales and financial performance have been slipping.The companies\u2019 relationship has been strained by suspicions in France that Nissan may be using the vacuum left by Mr. Ghosn\u2019s arrest to reshape the alliance\u2019s balance of power. Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds a 15 percent share in Renault that does not carry voting rights.Nissan has been seeking a rebalancing of the alliance since the French government abruptly doubled its voting rights in 2015. In an effort to ease tension, Renault, which controls three seats on the Nissan board, agreed not to meddle in Nissan\u2019s governance.But the arrests of Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kelly left two Nissan board seats vacant. And last month, Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, declined a Renault request that an urgent meeting be held to appoint immediate replacements.Instead, Nissan formed a committee that is to issue a report on the matter in March. That fanned suspicions in Paris that Nissan was maneuvering to prevent Renault from participating in alliance decision-making at a critical time.In a rare interview published in the French business daily Les Echos on Monday, Mr. Saikawa dismissed talk that Nissan had organized a plot to oust Mr. Ghosn as \u201cabsurd,\u201d and contrary to the \u201cserious\u201d evidence he said the company had gathered.Nissan\u2019s internal investigation, he said, \u201csuggests that we are dealing with deliberate manipulation and concealment.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Saikawa did not press the point about rebalancing the alliance, while playing down questions about how Nissan could have overlooked the alleged improprieties by Mr. Ghosn that stretched back years.Mr. Saikawa said in the interview with Les Echos that he was certain that if Renault directors, who have not yet seen the documents handed over by Nissan, had access to the full file, they would \u201cdraw the same conclusions we did.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, meets with Mrs. May today, and automakers such as Honda, Nissan and Toyota, which manufacture in Britain for export into continental Europe, are pushing him to press the case against a no-deal Brexit.Growth has slowed, unemployment has risen and small-business owners are complaining. The troubles suggest South Korea\u2019s limits in solving economic problems, especially without addressing underlying structural issues.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Official: The Trump Tax Cuts Didn\u2019t Pay for Themselves in Year One", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews analysisFederal tax revenues declined in 2018 while economic growth accelerated, undercutting the Trump administration\u2019s insistence that the $1.5 trillion tax package would pay for itself.A year after the $1.5 trillion tax-cut package took effect, economic growth has accelerated, just as Republicans promised it would when pushing the law through Congress. Growth appears likely to hit 3 percent for 2018, after adjusting for inflation, which is a full percentage point higher than the Congressional Budget Office forecast for the year in 2017. Not all of that increase is attributable to the tax cuts, but some of it is. That\u2019s good news for Republicans\u2019 longstanding claim that cutting taxes would provide such an economic bump that additional tax revenue would flow in to make up for what was lost through lower tax rates. But the bad news is that hasn\u2019t happened. The additional tax revenue has yet to show up, even with stronger growth. Data released this week by the budget office provides the first complete picture of federal revenues for the 2018 calendar year, when the tax cuts were in full effect. (The government\u2019s 2018 fiscal year included three months from the end of 2017, when most of the tax cuts were not in effect.) That\u2019s true whether you adjust revenues and growth for inflation \u2014 or not. After adjusting, it looks even worse. Revenues fell by 2.7 percent \u2014 or $83 billion \u2014 from 2017. Contrast that with the last time economic growth approached 3 percent, back in 2015. The economy grew by 2.9 percent after adjusting for inflation that year \u2014 and tax revenues grew by 7 percent.The historical contrast makes the drop-off look even steeper. Typically, economists expect stronger growth to generate more revenue. People earn more money, corporations generate higher profits and they all pay taxes on it. The way most economists \u201cscore\u201d a tax proposal is to ask how it would change revenue levels compared to what you would expect the government to collect if the tax cut had not passed \u2014 what economists call a \u201cbaseline.\u201d In the summer of 2017, for example, the budget office projected that the economy would grow by 2 percent in the 2018 fiscal year, and that personal, corporate and payroll taxes would add up to $3.24 trillion. Then the tax cuts passed, growth accelerated and, for the 2018 fiscal year, tax revenues fell $183 billion \u2014 or 5.6 percent \u2014 short of that projection. Republicans, particularly in the Trump administration, sold the tax law on claims that it would pay for itself \u2014 even when economists outside the administration, like the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, released models contradicting them. As corporate tax receipts fell significantly last year, some Republicans began to insist that, in fact, the bill was paying for itself, because total tax revenues were very slightly up. The 2018 figures contradict that argument, too.The best-case scenario for proponents is that the cuts spur a sustained increase in productivity and growth, which in turn produces increasingly higher revenues several years down the road \u2014 enough to reduce the \u201ccost\u201d of the bill to the budget deficit.The 2018 results are, oddly enough, what a lot of economists predicted would happen with Mr. Trump\u2019s cuts, including ones who generally favor tax cuts. Total federal revenues in 2018 came in roughly where the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that typically projects large growth boosts from tax cuts, had forecast \u2014 which is to say, well below the budget office\u2019s baseline. Just because the new law helped to increase economic growth, said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist with the Tax Foundation, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean that it is going to pay for itself.\u201d Mr. Pomerleau said additional growth from the law \u201cwill continue to be modest over the next couple of years.\u201d \u201cThat will offset some of the initial cost,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it will still be nowhere near enough to make the tax cut self-financing.\u201dIn December 2017, as Republicans sped the tax cuts through Congress, the Tax Foundation released a projection that the cuts would add about $450 billion to federal deficits over 10 years, after accounting for the additional economic growth it would spur. The group has since redone the analysis, with what Mr. Pomerleau called improvements to its methodology. It now predicts deficits will increase by $900 billion \u2014 double its original forecast.

{"Headline": "Mitch McConnell Got Everything He Wanted. But at What Cost?", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "FeatureThe president whom the Senate Republican leader helped elect has turned out to be the one thing he can\u2019t control.Supported byThat morning, Jan. 10, Washington\u2019s principal chaos agent, the president of the United States, had given a typically accusatory and free-associative news conference on the White House lawn, reiterating his demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the Mexican border and his intention to continue the shutdown without it. Then he decamped to the border for some photo ops with Customs and Border Protection officials. Republican senators spent the lunch hour shuttling back and forth between Vice President Mike Pence and McConnell, sequestered in different quarters on the Capitol\u2019s second floor. Now the last speeches of the day were being made, the reporters had mostly gone and McConnell sat in his office, reciting an unfamiliar tale: that of his own powerlessness.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the meetings,\u201d McConnell, dressed in a pinstripe suit and a banker collar, said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t have the votes that can consummate the deal.\u201d Those votes could come only at the behest of Trump or the new House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, he insisted \u2014 and, McConnell continued, \u201cit seems to me the principals, the only people who can make this deal, as of the moment we\u2019re having this discussion, seem to both think they have a winning hand.\u201dMcConnell went through the motions of fully blaming Pelosi, as he did on the Senate floor that morning, displaying a poster with two identical pictures of a Southern border wall, one labeled \u201cPRES. OBAMA\u201d and the other \u201cPRES. TRUMP,\u201d under a legend reading, \u201cWHAT BORDER FENCING DO DEMOCRATS SUPPORT?\u201d But he knew as well as anyone that he had in fact negotiated at least a temporary escape from the looming shutdown with Paul Ryan, then the House speaker, in December, which would have funded the government through February, before \u201cthe president, let\u2019s just say, changed his mind,\u201d Ryan told me this month, laughing ruefully. \u201cI spoke to him and tried to get the plan back on track, but that just wasn\u2019t in the cards. And here we are.\u201dOr here McConnell was, at least: marooned in a newly divided Congress, trying hard to stay out of the light. \u201cHe\u2019s been very quiet,\u201d Dick Durbin, the Democratic minority whip, who was in recent shutdown-negotiation meetings with McConnell and the Democratic Senate leadership, told me that afternoon, \u201cand has said repeatedly that he\u2019s not going to call any bill that the president doesn\u2019t approve of. And that has basically been the sum and substance of his contribution.\u201d\u201cIt would be hard to find two people by personality, or any inclination, that are more diametrically opposed than the president and Senator McConnell,\u201d says Roy Blunt, the Missouri senator who heads the Senate Republicans\u2019 policy committee. \u201cSenator McConnell, very careful and thoughtful about what he says, deeply studied in the history of the country and how the federal government works. The president would not be offended if he heard somebody say he did not spend his time becoming that well versed in those things.\u201d When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump\u2019s secretary of transportation and McConnell\u2019s wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the president that, and you\u2019ll have to ask the leader that.\u201d When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, \u201cYeah, we get along fine.\u201d[6 Takeaways from this Mitch McConnell profile.]All of this made it more remarkable that, by the fall of last year, McConnell had emerged as one of the few unambiguous winners of the Trump presidency to date. When I first spoke with him, this past November, he talked of the preceding two years with a faint air of mystified amusement at his own fortune: as if a minor meteor had streaked through the window of the majority leader\u2019s office, narrowly missing his head before exploding against the two-century-old marble fireplace, and then also turned out to be filled with candy and hundred-dollar bills. \u201cI think even though we\u2019re pretty different in every way you can think of,\u201d he told me, clearing his throat, \u201cwe\u2019ve had a good sort of team effort here to accomplish as much as we can.\u201dMcConnell is the first majority leader whose career has been built on the assumption that the Senate that could produce the great legislative works of his predecessors is a thing of the past \u2014 a fact that itself owes a great deal to McConnell. As minority and then majority leader during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, he fashioned himself as the essential impediment to Obama\u2019s vision of a sequel to the Great Society, using tactics that were once the province of Senate factions as a strategic blueprint for the entire Republican caucus.When I first approached McConnell\u2019s office about interviewing him to discuss this legacy, shortly after the Kavanaugh confirmation, he agreed quickly, eventually obliging with several hours of conversations over the course of two months. He also encouraged a couple of dozen friends, colleagues, conservative pundits and members of Trump\u2019s White House staff and cabinet to talk to me. The ways in which a subject tries to shape the reporting of his or her story \u2014 as canny subjects do \u2014 are revealing in their own right. During the interviews, there were the recurrent phrases: McConnell \u201ccan very quickly read the last page in the book.\u201d He was \u201ca listener by nature.\u201d And in virtually every McConnell-authorized conversation, it was said that he was a \u201cstudent of history.\u201dBut beneath this unconcern is a different kind of self-regard, a sense of himself as a historical figure in waiting. In his first Senate race, his campaign paid for a rare two-minute TV commercial tracing the arc of his life and work at a time when his elected career consisted of two terms as the judge-executive \u2014 a county-level mayor, essentially \u2014 of Jefferson County, Kentucky. When he was named Senate majority leader in 2014, and The Louisville Courier-Journal described him as the third from Kentucky, his staff called the paper, insisting he was the second and demanding a correction. (Earle Clements only filled in briefly for Lyndon Johnson after his heart attack.) At the McConnell Center that McConnell founded at the University of Louisville, his alma mater, there is an exact replica of the mahogany desk McConnell used as a junior senator, which was once occupied by Henry Clay, a fellow Kentuckian and one of the heroes of the 19th-century Senate, who engineered the Missouri Compromise. There is a bronze statue of Clay standing at the desk, but the brass nameplate on the desktop says \u201cMr. McConnell.\u201dBut the particular way in which McConnell has always conceived of his own historicity is significant and unusual among contemporary Republicans. The Tea Partyers have their Mel Gibson-movie fantasies, the Trumpists their Pinochet-meets-\u201cDie Hard\u201d pastiches. But McConnell aspires to be not the bloody and maybe tragic hero in a revolutionary drama but one among a short list of undisputed masters of the machinery of American government, both essential to and dwarfed by the history of this machinery. Notably, the political philosopher he cites to the near exclusion of all others is Edmund Burke, the 18th-century Irish writer and Whig politician who essayed trenchantly against the French Revolution, and whose influence on 21st-century Republican politics you would have to squint very hard to make out.This began to change under the leadership of Lyndon Johnson in the late 1950s, but especially under Mike Mansfield, the Montana Democrat who served as majority leader from 1961 to 1977, longer than anyone before or since. Though he enjoys a lesser profile than Johnson, Mansfield is more admired within the Senate by Democrats and Republicans alike, as a magnanimous and gentlemanly conductor of the upper chamber\u2019s fractious orchestra. \u201cHe treated everyone alike, without regard to politics or seniority,\u201d Ted Stevens, the Republican senator from Alaska, once said. It was on Mansfield\u2019s watch that the Senate passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, enacted Medicare, forced the resignation of Nixon without conviction and passed an array of post-Watergate reforms to the government and the Senate itself. Senators talk about Mansfield the way jazz musicians talk about Charlie Parker: He is the figure whose accomplishments they are doomed to be judged against forever, even as the context in which those accomplishments were possible recedes irretrievably into the past.McConnell first arrived in the Senate in what was arguably the most momentous year of the Mansfield era, 1964, as an intern for John Sherman Cooper. A moderate-to-liberal Republican, Cooper was then helping round up Republican votes for what would become the Civil Rights Act. McConnell, who supported civil rights as a college student, has spoken reverently of attending the signing ceremony for the Voting Rights Act in the Capitol Rotunda, at Cooper\u2019s invitation, the following year. In his telling, it remains the platonic ideal of legislation, passed with the support of majorities of both parties.\u201cI greatly admired Mansfield,\u201d McConnell told me. \u201cMansfield did have a big advantage, however: a massive majority of his own party.\u201d The Montana senator presided at the peak of a remarkable run of Democratic hegemony in the Senate, which the party had by then controlled for all but four years since the Depression. It was also an age of emerging liberalism within the Democratic ranks; the Southern conservatives who had been the gravitational center of the party, blocking anti-lynching and civil rights legislation in the Senate since the 1920s, were in retreat, a diminished force in the Democratic Senate caucus and not yet at home among the Republicans.In 1976, Mansfield\u2019s last year in the senate, Ronald Reagan ran for president for the second time, losing the nomination to the sitting president, Gerald Ford. But Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in November, and by then the conservatives who favored Reagan\u2019s candidacy had begun claiming the commanding heights of the Republican Party. They had also begun drawing in the white voters and politicians in the South and the Northern suburbs who, post-civil rights, were increasingly alienated from the Democratic Party. In 1980, Reagan won on the strength of these votes, and Republicans, for the first time since Eisenhower, captured the Senate. Neither party has held it for more than eight consecutive years since.In her 2016 book, \u201cInsecure Majorities,\u201d the University of Maryland political scientist Frances E. Lee argues that the political trends that came to a head in the 1980 election \u201cchanged the political calculations of members of Congress in a fundamental way.\u201d In the old, asymmetrical Senate, Republicans had an incentive to behave as John Sherman Cooper did; stuck in a terminal minority party, their only hope of influence was to work with Democrats to make policy. Once every election came to promise the prospect of a change in power, however, everything lawmakers did came to be seen through the lens of the next election \u2014 and the ascendant congressional figures of the era, like Newt Gingrich, were necessarily the ones who most unwaveringly saw it that way. \u201cAfter 1980,\u201d Lee writes, \u201cforces favoring more confrontation steadily gained advantage.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to that,\u201d McConnell said, when I described Lee\u2019s thesis. He had himself invoked the good old days of Mansfield\u2019s Senate when he took over as majority leader in 2015. But \u201cmost of the \u2018good old days\u2019 that are referred to,\u201d he told me, \u201care days of Democratic dominance, with largely Democratic outcomes. People only tend to get offended when conservatism rises and you start getting different outcomes.\u201dMcConnell proposed his own bill that would ban direct contributions from political-action committees to congressional candidates, a deliberately limited reform that would give Republicans cover to oppose the more sweeping changes Byrd and Boren were proposing. The Democratic bill died in the face of Republican opposition three months later.For more than a decade, McConnell fought one campaign-finance bill after another. Once the Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold and the Arizona Republican John McCain began their effort, in the mid-1990s, to pass the bipartisan legislation limiting the role of soft money in politics that now informally bears their name, McConnell became the primary strategist in the fight against it, in which he had the tacit support of most of the Republican Senate conference. It was the formative legislative battle of his career.\u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen a more determined and skilled tactician,\u201d Feingold told me. McConnell was vilified by the major newspaper opinion pages and leaned into the role, becoming a regular presence on the Sunday-morning talk-show circuit. When reform advocates started referring to him as Darth Vader, he appeared at a news conference with a toy light saber. When he was in the hospital in 2003, recovering from triple heart-bypass surgery, Feingold sent him a note that read, \u201cI miss my Darth Vader.\u201dFrom the outset, McConnell understood two essential aspects of the campaign-finance-reform debate. The first was that senators \u2014 certainly his Republican colleagues and, more quietly, many Democrats \u2014 were more interested in being seen as supporting campaign-finance reform than actually enacting it. The second was that the popularity of the reform proposals among the public, while real, was also shallow, unlikely to factor in many constituents\u2019 votes. For a junior senator like McConnell, volunteering to play \u201cspear catcher,\u201d as he put it, on campaign finance was likely to cost him little more than bad press and earn him the gratitude of his caucus and political capital within it. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether they will ever build a monument to the senator from Kentucky,\u201d McConnell\u2019s colleague Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican, later said in a floor speech, \u201cbut he is already memorialized in my heart. I will never forget the fight he has made.\u201dThe campaign-finance battle taught McConnell the tactics that would make him a virtuoso obstructionist during the Obama years. \u201cHis point of view was that, first of all, we\u2019re going to have to filibuster this; we don\u2019t have Democrats who are going to help us,\u201d says Steven Law, the president and chief executive of the Senate Leadership Fund super PAC and a member of McConnell\u2019s staff at the time. \u201cAnd if at all possible, we need to hold every member of the caucus together. If there\u2019s any crack in it, it will give license for others to jump ship.\u201d McConnell and Law consulted Senate parliamentarians on obscure procedural maneuvers that could expand McConnell\u2019s opportunities to block legislation with the filibuster \u2014 the ability of even a single senator to delay a vote as long as he or she can physically continue speaking on the Senate floor \u2014 which he did in September 1994, killing a major campaign-finance bill co-sponsored by George Mitchell, then the Democratic majority leader.Tom Foley, the Democratic House speaker at the time, called it \u201cthe worst case of obstruction by filibuster by any party that I\u2019ve ever seen in my 30 years in Congress.\u201d Mitchell condemned McConnell and his allies on the Senate floor. \u201cThe very people who want to keep this system which brings the institution of Congress into such disrepute are trying to be the beneficiaries of that disrepute,\u201d he said \u2014 to \u201ctear down the institution so that we can inherit the rubble.\u201dThe bluntest instrument senators in the minority have to wield to this end is the filibuster or, more often, the threat of it. To measure this kind of obstruction, political scientists often use cloture filings, which are the formal procedures for cutting off Senate debate to end or preclude a filibuster. When people try to quantify McConnell\u2019s influence as minority leader in the Obama years, when his command of obstructive techniques made him arguably the most important Republican in Washington, they often point to the spike in cloture filings. The number of such filings, which had gradually crept upward beginning in the 1970s, jumped significantly in McConnell\u2019s first Congress as minority leader in 2007 and 2008, to 112, nearly twice the highest previous number. They remained historically high throughout Obama\u2019s first term and then nearly doubled again by the end of 2014.But McConnell also slowed down the process in more subtle ways, particularly in his yearlong effort to derail the Affordable Care Act, which made him once again the public face of a particularly unapologetic form of Republican intransigence. \u201cHe said, \u2018Our strategy is to delay this sucker as long as we possibly can, and the longer we delay it the worse the president looks: Why can\u2019t he get it done? He\u2019s got 60 votes?\u2019\u2009\u201d Bob Bennett, the late Utah Republican senator and a friend of McConnell\u2019s, said in Alec MacGillis\u2019s 2014 McConnell biography, \u201cThe Cynic.\u201d Senate committee Democrats would negotiate policy particulars for months with their Republican colleagues only to see the Republicans\u2019 votes evaporate at the end of the process. McConnell\u2019s staff, meanwhile, battered the bill relentlessly in public, publicizing the sweetheart accommodations Democratic senators were receiving for their votes. By the time Obamacare passed in March 2010, according to a CNN poll, only 39 percent of the country viewed it favorably, and McConnell had mostly run out the clock: There were less than eight months left, by then, until the midterm elections in which Republicans would take the House.Legislation is one of the Senate\u2019s core responsibilities; the other is confirming executive-branch appointments, such as administration officials and judges. By custom, the Senate had previously approved district-court judge nominations in groups, in the interest of efficiency. Under McConnell\u2019s leadership, Republicans insisted on confirming Obama\u2019s nominations individually, drawing out the process enough that, by the summer of 2010, there were 99 vacancies on the federal bench and 40 \u201cjudicial emergencies\u201d had been declared by overburdened courts.\u201cThey\u2019ve always sort of made the argument that somehow I started all this,\u201d McConnell told me. \u201cWe didn\u2019t.\u201d Still, when McConnell inveighs now against Schumer\u2019s efforts to block Trump\u2019s executive-branch appointments, it is with the barely suppressed pride of an artist looking upon what seems to him a pale imitation of his finest work. \u201cFar be it from me to complain about obstruction,\u201d he told me, permitting himself a chuckle. \u201cBut generally, when I\u2019ve been involved in obstruction, there was a point to it.\u201dAs it happened, Kennedy had just been reading \u201cThe Caning,\u201d Stephen Puleo\u2019s 2012 book about the incident. The following week, he sent a copy to McConnell, with a letter enclosed. \u201cThere are times,\u201d Kennedy wrote in the letter, \u201cwhen an isolated episode is a portent of an event which will change the course of history. In this case, that episode took place on the floor of the Senate.\u201dA flurry of phone calls ensued. Leonard Leo, of the Federalist Society, whose advice on judicial matters wields unparalleled influence among Republican politicians, told McConnell that he was already hearing from some of the half dozen Republican presidential candidates wondering what to say at the televised debate that night. Josh Holmes, a campaign strategist close to McConnell, warned him that Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, was likely to seize the issue of blockading Scalia\u2019s seat in the debate, which he feared would make it harder to rally support for the idea. Cruz is unpopular with many of his Republican colleagues, including McConnell, and \u201cif the first idea of it came from Ted Cruz,\u201d Holmes told me, \u201cit was an assurance that you were going to lose half your conference.\u201dAt the presidential debate that night, when the moderator, CBS\u2019s John Dickerson, raised the question of what should be done with the Scalia seat, one candidate gave a curiously specific answer: \u201cWe could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor, we have some fantastic people,\u201d Donald Trump said. These names were a pleasant surprise to conservative legal activists, who had long considered both Sykes and Pryor to be ideal choices for the Supreme Court. The names were less of a surprise to Trump\u2019s campaign counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, who spoke to Trump earlier that day.McGahn was a specialist in election law, an expertise that had placed him on the same side of the previous decade\u2019s campaign-finance battles as McConnell. Even as McConnell was fighting against McCain-Feingold on the Senate floor, the senator was making contingency plans to continue his fight by other means if necessary. By the time the law passed, in 2002, he had already assembled a legal team to challenge it in the Supreme Court. When the court ruled against him late the following year, his attention shifted to the Federal Election Commission, the government agency tasked with enforcing campaign-finance laws. According to Meredith McGehee, a veteran campaign-finance-reform lobbyist who is now executive director of the bipartisan campaign-finance-reform advocacy group Issue One, \u201cMcConnell understood pretty quickly, faster than other folks, that you can have the best laws on the books, but if there\u2019s no law enforcement, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dThe Federal Election Commission\u2019s six commissioners, three Republicans and three Democrats, are typically picked by the Senate party leaders. Holmes, who was McConnell\u2019s chief of staff, told me that of all the government agencies for which McConnell, as the Senate Republican leader, selected and vetted potential appointees, \u201cthe one that I know of where McConnell himself interviewed every single person was the F.E.C.\u201d When McGahn \u2014 who, as general counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee, fought against McCain-Feingold \u2014 was nominated to the commission in 2008, McGahn told me, \u201cMcConnell was very supportive every step of the way.\u201dWhen McGahn\u2019s services were recommended to Trump by his deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, it was ostensibly for his election-law experience. But McGahn, a dedicated member of the Federalist Society, saw another opportunity in the campaign. Shortly after news of Scalia\u2019s death surfaced, Trump called him on the phone to discuss what he should say at that night\u2019s debate. Watching the candidate rattle off names he had given him earlier that day, McGahn recalled in a speech at a Federalist Society dinner last year, \u201cwas really the beginning of the idea of a list.\u201dThe list of Federalist Society-approved judges that Trump would consider appointing to the Supreme Court, which McGahn and Leo drafted, would be one of Trump\u2019s principal selling points to conservatives and also to McConnell, who had by then not only held open Scalia\u2019s Supreme Court seat, but also 88 district and 17 circuit-court seats, in hopes that a Republican president would be in office in 2017. Leonard Leo recalls speaking with McConnell shortly before the senator met with Trump in the spring on 2016. McConnell, Leo told me, said he \u201cwas going to stress with him that the judges\u2019 enterprise was extremely important.\u201dFrom August onward, McConnell and McGahn talked periodically. The conversations \u201cwere around judges,\u201d one of McConnell\u2019s senior staff members told me. \u201cHow do we handle them? How do we prioritize them? Beyond the Supreme Court, in the circuits, how do we get a number of them into the system early, and how can we start to process them early?\u201dRyan and his chief of staff at the time wrote and circulated a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really a good sign that the speaker took the pen and drafted the statement,\u201d McDonough told me. \u201cWhat happened then was, everybody signed off except Senator McConnell.\u201d McConnell has said his concerns had to do with wording regarding election infrastructure. McDonough says there were other substantial disagreements but declined to elaborate on what they were. Ryan says he took McConnell\u2019s side in the dispute. The process of drafting the statement was drawn out for several weeks, \u201cto the consternation and frustration of everybody \u2014 to include the speaker of the House,\u201d McDonough says. \u201cAt the time, the speaker evinced to me considerable frustration.\u201dWhen I repeated Comey\u2019s statement to McConnell, he bristled. \u201cWell, the Obama administration screwed up the election and then started pointing the finger at everybody else,\u201d he said. I reminded him that Comey, like McDonough and Clapper, had blamed him very specifically. \u201cThey were trying to blame everybody else but themselves,\u201d he said again. \u201cRyan and I did what we thought was appropriate.\u201dBut McConnell hesitated. \u201cI talked to him at the time,\u201d Holmes, the strategist, told me, \u201cand he said, \u2018Do you see any evidence that it would make any difference for candidates to distance themselves?\u2019\u2009\u201d McConnell called several members of his caucus who were in tight re-election races, among them Roy Blunt of Missouri. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m doing all kinds of events today,\u2019\u2009\u201d Blunt recalls. \u201c\u2009\u2018I\u2019m not hearing that voters, at least who speak to me, are willing to abandon our nominee over this clip. So I\u2019m sticking right where I am.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe seat, which would be filled a year later by Trump\u2019s nominee, Neil Gorsuch, would be the centerpiece of McConnell\u2019s broader court-remaking project \u2014 a bridge from his obstructionist past to his next act. \u201cA day or two after the election, I was in the car with him,\u201d Brian McGuire, at the time McConnell\u2019s chief of staff, told me, \u201cand he said, \u2018We are going to move judges like they are on a conveyor belt.\u2019\u2009\u201dMcConnell, who had kept so many of Obama\u2019s nominations from the bench, was busy mapping out a strategy to avoid the fate he had so recently meted out. He would take advantage of Harry Reid\u2019s decision to eliminate the filibuster for lower-court judicial nominees and, when Senate Democrats tried to block Neil Gorsuch\u2019s appointment, would lead Republicans in voting to extend it to the Supreme Court. McConnell instructed Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that they were going to diminish the weight they assigned to \u201cblue slips,\u201d a procedural formality that allowed home-state senators, even from the minority party, an opportunity to say whether or not a judicial nominee should receive a hearing on the Judiciary Committee. Under recent committee chairpeople, this had been treated as an informal veto power, one that McConnell\u2019s Republicans had used to great effect in the minority in the Obama years. Under the new interpretation, that would no longer be the case for circuit-court judges. And McConnell would prioritize judicial nominations before other kinds of nominations on the Senate schedule and fill the more influential circuit courts first.McConnell walked Trump through the judicial appointments that he and McGahn had been moving through the Senate. As they were speaking, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, came in to tell Trump that he was due at a news conference in the Rose Garden.The news conference marked Trump\u2019s first acknowledgment of what McConnell and McGahn had been quietly doing for months \u2014 an achievement that seemed to just then dawn on him. \u201cSomething that people aren\u2019t talking about is how many judges we\u2019ve had approved, whether it be the court of appeals, circuit judges, whether it be district judges,\u201d Trump said.McConnell seemed to realize something, too: That his spare communication style was not the best way of dealing with this particular president. He now speaks to Trump several times a week. \u201cI think that one of the things that the leader has done a better job of over time,\u201d Billy Piper, McConnell\u2019s chief of staff until 2011, told me, \u201cis understanding that that\u2019s an important part of a positive relationship with the president: direct and frequent communications, so that the president, you know, is hearing directly what\u2019s going on and how his agenda\u2019s being advanced, as opposed to getting it through third parties or news reports.\u201d He added, \u201cThat\u2019s probably not McConnell\u2019s intuitive nature.\u201d\u201cYou watched the mother of all fights last month,\u201d McConnell told the crowd when it was his turn to speak. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh is going to be a great Supreme Court justice for a very long time. They tried everything in the book, but I think we proved two things, my friends: Presumption of innocence still applies in America, and the Republican Senate is not going to be intimidated by an angry mob!\u201d McConnell proceeded to offer a summary of his last two years in office: the judges appointed, the taxes cut, the regulations rolled back. It was only later, after Rand Paul \u2014 the other senator from Kentucky \u2014 delivered a spirited tribute to the president, that I realized McConnell had barely mentioned him, uttering the name \u201cTrump\u201d just once in his nine-minute speech.\u201cIt\u2019s a statement of the obvious that Donald Trump and I are very different,\u201d he told me several weeks later, after the election. Still, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019ve both focused on the things we agree on and not some of our personality differences.\u201d He went on: \u201cWhen there have been policy areas that I think require some reinforcement, I\u2019ve done it, for example, his skepticism about NATO,\u201d and other issues. \u201cOn a whole lot of other things that the president likes to talk about, I just choose not to engage in that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to. Again, I\u2019m going to do everything I can to maximize chances of success during this opportunity we\u2019ve been given, which comes to an end in a month. Because, you know, when Pelosi and I talked to each other, we were both kind of struggling to think of things we might work on together.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just sort of not a natural thing.\u201dThe remaking of the judiciary is one of the few aspects of the Republican agenda that is unlikely to be slowed down by November\u2019s congressional elections, which gave the Democrats a decisive majority in the House of Representatives, but also expanded the Republican majority that McConnell leads in the Senate by two seats. This means less time wasted on quixotic legislative efforts, like the Obamacare repeal effort, and more time for appointments.One of the bittersweet facts of the Senate majority leaders\u2019 job is that their legacies are rarely perceived by the broader public as their own. Mike Mansfield may have played a central role in negotiating the passage of the Civil Rights Act, but most people who are not Senate history buffs \u2014 that is, most people \u2014 remember it as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s triumph. Harry Reid may have seen the Affordable Care Act through the Senate, but nobody calls the law Reidcare. McConnell\u2019s portrait no doubt will hang somewhere in the Capitol; perhaps he will get his name on a room like Mansfield, a balcony like Bob Dole. But for everyone outside the tribe of the Senate, it is likely that when McConnell\u2019s remaking of the judiciary is remembered, he will be a figure off to the side, perhaps slightly out of focus, in a photograph of Donald Trump.When I asked McConnell how he felt about his legacy and Trump\u2019s being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office.\u201d I asked what he meant. \u201cThe decision not to fill the Scalia vacancy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the most consequential thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201dBut what about the judicial appointments? I asked. Surely those would be remembered as a partnership between him and Trump.\u201cWell, that\u2019s fine,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s done what I thought ought to be done.\u201d Judges, regulations, taxes. \u201cIf Marco Rubio had been president, we\u2019d have done it. If Jeb Bush had been president, we\u2019d have done it. I say that not to take anything away from President Trump, but he took good advice on all three of those areas that are \u2014\u201d he slowed down for emphasis \u2014 \u201ctraditional. Republican. Positions.\u201d\u201cI think to expect Republican elected officials not to try to achieve as much as they possibly can, that they\u2019ve always been for, out of pique over presidential behavior, is nonsense,\u201d McConnell said when I read him what Browning had written. \u201cHe got elected. And we\u2019ve been able, as a result of that, to achieve things like tax reform. It had been sitting there undone for 30 years. We\u2019ve discussed ad nauseam the courts. A lot of deregulatory activity that we think has contributed to a robust economy. So critics like that expect us all to just join them in a huff and do nothing? Really? I think my responsibility as the majority leader of the Senate, in a Republican administration, is to achieve as much as I can for the American people along the lines that I\u2019ve believed in my entire life.\u201dThat, of course, had been Browning\u2019s point; setting aside the particulars of the comparison, I asked, \u201cDo you ever worry that with the record of success that you\u2019ve had, that you\u2019re strengthening the hand of a president who does seem, in some ways, very much inclined to do damage to institutions of American governance?\u201d\u201cWell, I mean, the ultimate check against any of this is the ballot box,\u201d McConnell replied. \u201cAnd one could argue, at least with regard to the House of Representatives last year, that there were plenty of people who wanted a midcourse correction.\u201d The results of the election did not seem to surprise him. \u201cThe party has to be bigger than white men who didn\u2019t graduate from college,\u201d he told me late last year. \u201cAnd you look at what happened to the House of Representatives. Look at the suburbs. It\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s right there to look at. We were losing women\u201d \u2014 a chronic problem for the Republican Party, he acknowledged. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a sustainable position, politically, if you want to be a competitive party.\u201dIt was a statement of gloom that, if you scratched off its outer layer, revealed a sort of sanguine optimism: A belief that the system was, ultimately, self-correcting. Whatever Trump had unleashed in the Republican Party, its damages would be visited upon the party, not the country, and they would be temporary. The demagogues would burn themselves out, and the pragmatists would rebuild upon the ashes.In one of our conversations, I brought up the book. \u201cWhat do you see as your role, the majority leader\u2019s role, in a time of crisis?\u201d I asked McConnell.\u201cWell,\u201d McConnell replied, \u201cI think what I have to do, my goal, and depending upon what the numbers are, and what\u2019s achievable, is always to get as right-of-center an outcome as possible.\u201d He brought up the example of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which we had been discussing: a bill produced from a high-stakes negotiation between the White House and congressional Republicans in which McConnell, breaking with newly elected Tea Party hard-liners in the House, played deal maker, providing the Democrats with bipartisan cover for a necessary debt-limit increase while also securing cuts that Republicans had sought.\u201cI mean, at the risk of sounding like I\u2019m patting myself on the back, who would have ever thought with Barack Obama in the White House you could get something like the Budget Control Act in August of 2011, which actually drove down government spending for two years in a row?\u201d McConnell said. \u201cTo me, given the numbers, and if you prefer America right of center, that\u2019s my definition of success.\u201d I was startled not just by his frankness but by the type of crisis that McConnell\u2019s mind had gone to, which was not exactly the kind of worst-case scenario that was foremost on many minds during Trump\u2019s presidency.Later, I put the same question to Paul Ryan: What did he think his role, and McConnell\u2019s, was in a crisis? \u201cFirst of all, I think the country\u2019s strong and is going to be fine,\u201d Ryan said, sounding very much like the youth basketball coach he now is, reassuring the parent of a 12-year-old who was lying at half-court clutching his knee. \u201cAnd I think it is to preserve the institutions. The way I described it to my staff these last two years, when we had unified government, was, our job is to build the country\u2019s resilience and its antibodies, so that it is stronger and better prepared for whatever comes its way. And then make sure that those institutional guardrails are upheld. Mueller wasn\u2019t fired. There wasn\u2019t a constitutional crisis.\u201dI noticed that Ryan was speaking in the past tense now, as if this were already an era of American politics safely mothballed away in the closet of history. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chatter, there\u2019s a lot of tweeting, there\u2019s a lot of all that,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut institutionally, everything\u2019s fine. You know, we didn\u2019t impeach Rod Rosenstein, you know? We didn\u2019t do things like that. A lot of chatter about it, but the institutions are there, they\u2019re standing.\u201d\u201cDoes Trump share your view, and McConnell\u2019s view, of institutions?\u201d I asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Ryan said.\u201cIt\u2019s a futile gesture,\u201d he told me \u2014 which, in the tightly controlled vocabulary of McConnell\u2019s politics, is the gravest of insults. \u201cEven if this bill were to pass the Senate,\u201d he went on, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t pass the House. If it passed the House, it wouldn\u2019t be signed by the president. I don\u2019t have time for that kind of futile gesture, particularly when there\u2019s no threat. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dMcConnell is a man of institutions and establishments, but his legacy is now tied to that of a president who seems hellbent on burning both to the ground.When I spoke with Ryan, I asked if he and McConnell had planned for a scenario in which Trump decided to fire Robert Mueller.\u201cYes,\u201d Ryan replied unhesitatingly.\u201cWhat was the plan?\u201d I asked.\u201cI\u2019ll just leave it at that,\u201d he said. \u201cDid we discuss it? Yes, we discussed it. Yes, we were prepared if that actually would have happened.\u201d A minute later, he added: \u201cI can answer that with a question: Has the guy been fired? No, he\u2019s continuing on.\u201d These were the proverbial adults in the room; they had this.Interested in what McConnell would have to say about this, I texted his press secretary, David Popp, asking to speak with him that afternoon. Popp wrote back to say it was unlikely; they were in the thick of negotiations to stave off the government shutdown that was then looming.Six days later, I got a phone call from a Virginia area code. \u201cHello,\u201d said the voice on the other end, \u201cthis is Jim Mattis. Mitch McConnell called and said you\u2019re interested in talking to me. What can I do for you?\u201dMattis was genial and relaxed \u2014 distractingly so, given the circumstances. \u201cI\u2019m just kind of hanging out,\u201d said the man who in three working days would be handing over the keys to the most lethal war-making apparatus on the planet, on the orders of a president with whom he had voiced irreconcilable differences about America\u2019s place in the world. \u201cYou know, doing the usual stuff.\u201dI asked if, in his opinion, there was a divergence in foreign-policy values between Republicans in Congress and the White House. \u201cWell, I\u2019d leave that for you to determine,\u201d he said, before allowing himself what seemed like a hint: \u201cCertainly, when foreign ministers of defense or foreign leaders visited and they asked who they should talk with, I always spoke about Leader McConnell, because he could reassure them.\u201dI had been told to expect the call, but still, as we spoke, I was preoccupied with the question of why it was occurring. I hadn\u2019t asked to speak with Mattis, specifically; a couple of weeks earlier, I asked Popp if there was anyone in the administration who might be able to shed light on McConnell\u2019s relationship with Trump \u2014 the sort of request that usually yields a legislative-affairs director, maybe a deputy chief of staff.I agreed that it was.\u201cAll right, you take care, Charlie,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run.\u201dA few weeks later, Popp texted me a cellphone number for John Kelly, who until a week before had been Trump\u2019s chief of staff. A retired Marine Corps general, Kelly had been assumed to be, like Mattis, a load-bearing wall restraining the Trump presidency from a collapse into truly dangerous chaos. And yet Kelly testified unwaveringly to McConnell\u2019s close relationship with the president: \u201cHe and the president spoke frequently, you know, on every topic you could imagine,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey were compadres, so to speak.\u201dWhy, I asked Kelly, did he think that McConnell had exclusively referred me to people \u2014 himself, Mattis, Don McGahn \u2014 who were widely understood to be keeping Trump in line, and were all, by now, gone from the administration? \u201cYou know, I know you don\u2019t mean it this way,\u201d Kelly replied, \u201cbut you almost come across like it was some type of conspiracy. And it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI am a new member of the U.S. Senate, the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body, and in my first few months here I have witnessed what the Senate can do, when it wants to,\u201d the 43-year-old McConnell, practically a teenager by Senate standards, began. He exhorted his colleagues to join in \u201ca unified effort to correct one of the most abhorrent and criminal examples of injustice evident in the world.\u201d\u201cAs much of a fan as all of us were of Reagan,\u201d McConnell told me two days later, \u201cI ended up actually voting for the bill and in favor of overriding his veto.\u201d The bill passed.The apartheid speech, the Mattis and Kelly testimonials \u2014 the self-portrait they suggested, of a man on the right side of a historical record that might judge the current president more harshly, was clear enough, even if McConnell would not have permitted himself to describe it so directly. In one of our interviews, I had asked him about the statement he issued after Charlottesville \u2014 a forceful denunciation of Trump\u2019s words that carefully stopped short of criticizing Trump himself by name. When I asked McConnell why, he offered only a tautology: \u201cThe way I expressed myself was the way I thought I ought to express myself.\u201d He has always wanted the mantle of principle but also the agenda. The question is whether his attempt to have both will be remembered as shrewd politics or as an act of moral compromise \u2014 or both.The thing is, the apartheid speech he wanted me to know he had made \u2014 it was good. \u201cConservatives and liberals, Republicans and Democrats, can and should act in unison,\u201d McConnell, standing for the first time at Henry Clay\u2019s desk, the eyes of his new colleagues and history upon him, had said. \u201cAnd we should act now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and the number of troops that President Trump said he would withdraw from the country. Seven thousand of 14,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan were going to be pulled out. It is not the case that only 7,000 troops were still deployed to Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Seek to Boost Small Donations, but a Fragmented System Stymies Them", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year at this time, Republicans feared the \u201cblue wave,\u201d a surge of voter enthusiasm for Democrats in the midterm elections.With the election over, and the fears of Republicans partly realized, the party\u2019s worry has shifted to the \u201cgreen wave:\u201d $39.67 here, $39.67 there.That kind of uniformity and heft in small-dollar donations \u2014 typically defined as $200 or less \u2014 was missing on the Republican side, a costly shortcoming that the party is now confronting after losing 40 seats, and control of the House, to Democrats.Republicans still receive streams of money from super pacs financed by big donors like the casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and through individual donors who send larger amounts. And the Republican National Committee exceeded the Democratic National Committee in fund-raising in the cycle nearly two to one. In addition, President Trump\u2019s campaign is known for its prolific fund-raisingBut individual Democratic candidates for House and Senate seats outraised their Republican counterparts overall, $1.4 billion to $880 million and a significant portion of the difference can be attributed to small donations whose impact has increased significantly.Overall, Democratic candidates in the general election collected nearly $296 million in small donations, more than three times the $85 million collected by Republicans. As Democrats have increasingly excelled in that area, aided by ActBlue, Republicans have come to realize that those little donations, repeated over and over again, add up to big numbers.\u201cWe simply can\u2019t go to the next election cycle as underfunded as we were compared to the Democratic candidates in the target races,\u201d Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a way to even out that funding situation.\u201dBut Republicans cannot simply copy the Democratic model. While ActBlue is a nonprofit, Republican efforts at collecting small-dollar donations are fragmented among for-profit processing vendors. There are more than a half-dozen such vendors servicing Republican candidates and committees. And there is big money to be made from their portion of the processing fees, typically around 4 percent, some of which goes to banks and credit card companies.The companies\u2019 makeup reflects the small world of online political fund-raising and the connections between some vendors and powerful forces within the party, which could complicate efforts to streamline and centralize the system.Among the three main players, for instance, one has ties to the Republican National Committee and counts President Trump\u2019s campaign as a client. A principal in another company is the brother of the digital director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee; and the founder of the third, a former congressional candidate himself, processes donations for most of the state parties as well as many influential members of Congress.In a tweet that highlighted how competing interests and fiefs could impede a solution, one Republican consultant, Tim Cameron, posted a photo of the actor Mel Gibson and a line from his movie Braveheart: \u201cUnite the Clans.\u201dThere are efforts at the national party level to streamline funding. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has initiated discussions about a possible merger or information-sharing arrangement among vendors.Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff for Mr. McConnell who is advising his office on the issue, contacted several companies recently to discuss a solution, the vendors said.Several Republican consultants and fund-raising experts, though, warned that fixing the operational bugs won\u2019t completely solve the problem.\u201cI think a lot of it is historical legacy, where Republicans traditionally have relied on a smaller number of larger donors,\u201d said David Nickerson, who teaches political science at Temple University. Democrats have built a tradition of small-dollar donation, he said. \u201cIt has become part of the culture.\u201dThere is some evidence that is beginning to change, with Mr. Trump\u2019s populist appeal energizing Republican small donors. Enthusiasm at the presidential level, though, has not transferred to individual Senate and House Republican candidates, who have fallen way behind Democrats.The fund-raising gap was particularly notable in close and hotly contested races, with Democrats making inroads into previously conservative districts and suburban areas, a grim sign for Republicans.In Virginia, for example, the Democratic challenger Abigail Spanberger collected more than $1.5 million from small donors \u2014 double the total for the Republican incumbent, Dave Brat, who lost his seat. In Illinois, Lauren Underwood ousted the incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren from his district near Chicago after collecting nearly $1.2 million from small donors, 15 times more than Mr. Hultgren. And in Oklahoma City, Kendra Horn defeated incumbent Republican Steve Russell after collecting 10 times more from small donors.In House races, the organization said, more than half the money from individual contributors to Democratic candidates was raised through ActBlue.The site\u2019s influence and fund-raising have grown exponentially in the past several years, aided by Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s appeal to small donors in 2016 and his campaign\u2019s decision to use ActBlue. The service also collects a fee that it uses to pay banks and credit-card companies, and rolls the rest back into operations.In addition to providing Democratic donors with a one-stop site, ActBlue allows them to store their credit card numbers and, with one click, donate to virtually any Democratic candidate or liberal cause through a process called ActBlue Express, which the group says has 5.8 million users.\u201cRight now as a Republican donor, you have to go to multiple websites,\u201d said Mr. Mackowiak, the strategist. \u201cIf you have someone who is motivated for one reason or another to give, you want that person to be able to contribute to as many races as possible.\u201dMr. Holmes, the former aide to Mr. McConnell, suggested that industry players might consolidate or forge a sharing arrangement to make donations easier. But several Republicans said they would not support the party picking one vendor as a central clearinghouse for donations, calling it antithetical to Republican philosophy.Instead, an agreement might work like this: A visitor to Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign site clicks to make a donation, which is processed by Anedot, a Dallas-based company owned by Paul Dietzel, a 2014 Republican congressional candidate, that provides services to Mr. McConnell and the campaigns of other Republicans.The donation is processed, with Anedot collecting the fee. The site would then ask the donor\u2019s permission to share his name and credit card information with other G.O.P. fund-raising vendors.When that donor decides to send money to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the system would recognize him and quickly process the information \u2014 much in the same way that ActBlue Express works \u2014 even though N.R.C.C. donations are processed through another vendor, Victory Passport.Still, this kind of workaround illustrates the challenges Republicans face in unifying their donation system.All of which makes ActBlue\u2019s uniform processing operation look more appealing.Matt Gorman, communications director for the N.R.C.C., said the committee has been reviewing small-dollar donations for more than a year, focusing on ActBlue.\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing its practices, how they go about their business, where the money goes, how they get their money and how we can bring some of the practices we find helpful to the Republican side,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voting Issues and Gerrymanders Are Now Key Political Battlegrounds", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVoting rights and partisan gerrymandering, traditionally the preoccupation of wonky party strategists and good-government groups, have become major flash points in the debate about the integrity of American elections, signaling high stakes battles over voter suppression and politically engineered districts ahead of the 2020 presidential race.When Democrats take the majority in the House on Thursday, the first bill they plan to introduce will be broad legislation focusing on these issues. Early drafts of their proposals include automatic voter registration, public elections financing and ending gerrymandering by using independent commissions to draw voting districts.But action and anger go far beyond Congress. With voters increasingly aware of the powerful impact of gerrymandering and doubtful about the fairness of elections, voting issues have become central to politics in key states including Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Voters in five states last year passed ballot questions shifting the power to draw political districts away from partisan lawmakers.In widely criticized lame-duck sessions of the Wisconsin and Michigan Legislatures, Republicans raced to strip powers from new Democratic governors, partly to protect their ability to gerrymander after the 2020 census.At issue, many voting experts say, is a momentous clash between demographic changes that are slowly and powerfully reshaping the American electorate, making it younger, more diverse and more favorable for Democrats, and the entrenched power of Republican lawmakers, who see restrictions on voting and partisan redistricting as ways to hold on to political power.\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is construct a system where a minority of the voters can actually obtain majority power,\u201d said the former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who sued states over voting rules during the Obama administration.Republicans say the influence of gerrymandering is overblown. They argue that Democrats fail to win seats in proportion to their popular votes because Democratic voters are clustered in urban districts. Republicans defend voting restrictions like ID laws as popular with majorities in both parties and needed to ensure confidence in elections.That concerns about gerrymandering have gone mainstream was underlined last month when President Barack Obama said he would join forces with a group Mr. Holder leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. It was formed in 2017 in response to many state legislatures shifting sharply to the right on abortion, taxes, education and collective bargaining. Democrats contend those shifts were built on Republicans\u2019 securing majorities at the state level through extreme gerrymandering after the 2010 census.The Republican State Leadership Committee, which helped secure many of those statehouse victories, argues the initial races were run in districts drawn by Democrats in previous decades. Matt Walter, the committee\u2019s president, said some of the 2018 ballot measures to make redistricting less partisan were quietly backed by groups that seek to elect more Democrats.\u201cCleverly worded ballot measures regarding redistricting are often nothing more than Democrat politics wrapped in some sort of illusion of citizen-participated good government,\u201d he said.In the November elections, Democrats gained more House seats than they have in any midterm since Watergate, picking up 40 seats. But the gains might have been even bigger, election experts said, if Republican gerrymanders hadn\u2019t been drawn to withstand a blue wave.In Ohio, Republicans won 52 percent of the overall votes for Congress, but they retained 11 of the state\u2019s 16 House seats.In North Carolina, Republicans won 50 percent of the popular congressional vote, but 9 out of 12 seats, not counting one still in dispute.\u201cIt\u2019s the result of digitally diabolical gerrymandering,\u201d said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.North Carolina has been ground zero for what critics call aggressive Republican attacks on democracy, including a strict voter ID law, extreme partisan gerrymandering and a power grab during a lame-duck session of the legislature after Mr. Cooper\u2019s election in 2016. Courts have overturned many of these efforts.The governor echoed critics of gerrymandering who say that putting lawmakers in safe districts leads to partisan polarization, because incumbents fear only a primary challenge from the extremes and lack any incentive to reach across the aisle.\u201cIt has prevented progress in North Carolina on closing the health care gap,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cI think in Washington it has torpedoed common sense immigration reform.\u201d In June, the United States Supreme Court sidestepped the question of whether partisan gerrymandering was unconstitutional.Republican supermajorities in both of the state\u2019s legislative chambers have overridden 22 of Mr. Cooper\u2019s vetoes. In November, Democrats flipped enough seats in the General Assembly to limit Republicans to simple majorities, restoring the governor\u2019s veto authority. Rather than wait for the new legislature to convene in January, Republicans met this month to override two of Mr. Cooper\u2019s vetoes of voting laws.Phil Berger, the president of the State Senate, said critics accusing North Carolina Republicans of undermining democracy ignore the fact that the party won its majorities in 2010 using maps drawn by Democrats. The laws enacted since then, including voter ID, reflect the will of the majority, he said.\u201cThe Democrats have a geographic problem,\u201d Mr. Berger said, referring to the clustering of Democratic voters in a handful of cities. \u201cOur view is we were returning North Carolina to more of the mainstream.\u201dIf North Carolina was the template, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and Michigan both met in lame-duck sessions last year to strip powers away from incoming Democratic governors. Speaker Robin J. Vos of the Wisconsin State Assembly was candid about his motives for checking the incoming governor, Tony Evers, the former state superintendent of schools. \u201cWe are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in,\u201d he said in early December.Wisconsin\u2019s legislative maps, drawn in 2011, protected Republican supermajorities even after Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated last year. Republican candidates for the State Assembly won just 46 percent of the popular vote, but they captured 64 percent of the chamber\u2019s seats.In Michigan, however, most of the Republican pushback against the election results fizzled, either because bills died in the legislature or were vetoed by former Gov. Rick Snyder.According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 24 states, most Republican-led, have introduced restrictions that have made access to voting harder since 2010.Wendy R. Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, said there was a correlation between states that have restricted voting and those with high African-American turnout in 2008, the first year Mr. Obama was elected, as well as those that recorded large increases in Hispanic population in the 2010 census.\u201cThe more a state saw an increase in political participation by African-Americans or an increase in the Latino population, the more likely they\u2019d introduce new laws cutting back on voting access,\u201d she said.At the same time, many states have expanded voting access in recent years. Midterm voters in Nevada passed automatic registration for those receiving a driver\u2019s license, and Maryland authorized same-day registration at the polls. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for an overhaul of the state\u2019s voting laws, considered among the most archaic in the country.One of the Republicans defeated at the polls last year, Kris W. Kobach, lost a race for Kansas governor after being rebuked in federal court for insisting without evidence that noncitizen voting was widespread. Mr. Kobach had led the commission to look into President Trump\u2019s baseless claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2016. It disbanded without documenting his claim.The issue has become a galvanizing one for Democratic candidates.In November, voters in Colorado, Missouri, Michigan and Utah approved changes to limit the role of partisanship in drawing congressional and legislative districts. Ohio passed a similar measure in May.Mr. Holder, who is among the Democrats considering a presidential run, said issues about voting and democracy are now central to American politics.\u201cHealth care will clearly be the primary issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think if you\u2019re looking for a top-five issue, this one has broken through and will be something people will talk about and make their decision about who they\u2019re going to vote for.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "FIFA\u2019s Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFIFA President Gianni Infantino\u2019s plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe.Since proposing several major changes to the sport\u2019s calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA\u2019s 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments \u2014 an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams \u2014 that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.The listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA\u2019s governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption \u2014 and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA \u2014 would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year.Each of the meetings on Infantino\u2019s tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer\u2019s six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.Infantino\u2019s problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views.Some of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA\u2019s tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams.Ceferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA\u2019s Champions League and add to the workload of players.\u201cI cannot accept that some people who are blinded by the pursuit of profit are considering to sell the soul of football tournaments to nebulous private funds,\u201d Ceferin said in a speech last May. \u201cMoney does not rule \u2014 and the European sports model must be respected. Football is not for sale. I will not let anyone sacrifice its structures on the altar of a highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism.\u201dInfantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank\u2019s Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.European leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote.The vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami.At the last summit, in Morocco, Infantino expressed frustration to the officials who declined to take part in the vote for his plans, according to multiple people present at the meeting.\u201cAs part of this discussion, people are asked to give their feedback on a series of proposals and, as in any democratic consultation process, every member can express its opinion freely,\u201d FIFA said in a statement. \u201cThe feedback received will be fed back to the Council together with the results of the other consultation platforms.\u201dFIFA\u2019s task force for the two tournaments will hold its next meeting on Feb. 21 in Rio de Janeiro. As tensions grow, however, there is a chance that European executives will not attend, according to a person familiar with the continental leaders\u2019 plans.UEFA declined to comment. The organization has been seeking the support of European clubs and leagues to oppose Infantino\u2019s proposals. At the last two meetings, Ceferin has arrived armed with signed letters of opposition from The European Club Association, a union of the continent\u2019s top clubs, and a separate group representing the continent\u2019s domestic leagues.The proposals to expand the Club World Cup and to create a new global Nations League similar to the recently created UEFA version largely have the backing of officials from South America, Africa and Asia \u2014 likely enough to win a vote should Infantino choose to take one at the Miami meeting. Any such move would exacerbate the growing rift with Europe, however, and potentially lead to a larger crisis if top clubs and leading nations from UEFA refuse to participate in the new FIFA-controlled tournaments.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Competing Against Chinese Loans, U.S. Companies Face Long Odds in Africa", "Date": "2019-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe main problem was the big advantages enjoyed by the competition: two Chinese energy companies, one of them a state oil giant with Beijing\u2019s support.In Africa, American businesses have been largely absent while Chinese companies have put down roots, nurturing powerful allies through both legitimate and illegal means. Some target individual African officials and their family members with cash bribes or deals for services, like legal representation or insurance.In a sign of the intense infighting, Uganda\u2019s domestic intelligence agency investigated three officials believed to favor the American consortium and questioned its ability to finance the project, according to a copy of the agency\u2019s report reviewed by The New York Times.\u201cSo why not take advantage of both?\u201d he asked.The African Great Lakes have long tempted outsiders seeking riches, including the European nations that began plundering the continent in the 19th century. But in 2006, four decades after the end of British rule in Uganda, a prize untapped by the colonialists was discovered: oil deposits by Lake Albert that are among the largest in East Africa, enough to transform parts of impoverished Uganda.Mr. Museveni\u2019s government negotiated for years with foreign companies before agreeing to a plan for extraction and the construction of a pipeline southeast to the Tanzanian coast, where the oil could be shipped around the world.But Mr. Museveni also insisted on building a refinery in Uganda to ease the region\u2019s dependence on imported fuel. The contract went to Russians at first, but they withdrew.From a shared work space in Washington, she recruited partners for what she hoped would be the first project for Yaatra Ventures, which she founded in 2015 to invest in African infrastructure.\u201cWith G.E., here was an American company that could bring capabilities,\u201d she said.She was not alone in sensing the opportunity. Uganda received more than 40 proposals to build the refinery.But their proposals included tough terms, according to interviews and an internal government assessment reviewed by The Times.Dongsong wanted a sovereign loan guarantee \u2014 making the Ugandan government responsible for the project\u2019s debt if it failed \u2014 and insisted that 60 percent of labor and materials come from China. CNOOC, meanwhile, wanted greater access to the oil fields themselves.The American consortium tried to set itself apart, proposing that Uganda\u2019s state oil company and other East African nations own up to 40 percent of a new private company that would build and run the refinery. The consortium would finance the project by selling shares to investors as well as by borrowing, but it was not asking for a sovereign guarantee.The American proposal meant less debt risk for Uganda, but there were questions about the consortium\u2019s ability to raise the money. The Chinese bids, by contrast, promised immediate financing from Chinese state banks. And at the energy ministry, officials were longtime proponents of Chinese companies.\u201cAt the end of the day, we are developing a lot of capital-intensive projects,\u201d said Robert Kasande, a top energy official. \u201cWe need the financing. The Chinese can do that.\u201dUgandan soldiers with Kalashnikov rifles stand guard at Dongsong\u2019s headquarters in Kampala, a hilltop villa with a swimming pool and sweeping views of the capital. L\u00fc Weidong, the company\u2019s founder, flies in several times a year.\u201cMy biggest ambition is that when I walk into Ugandan villages, villagers line up and welcome me with applause,\u201d he said at his China office, seated behind a rosewood tea table inlaid with carved dragons. \u201cI hope to drive the industrial development of Uganda, and let the history of East Africa and Uganda remember my name.\u201dSlim, bald and vegetarian, Mr. L\u00fc personifies Beijing\u2019s \u201cgoing out\u201d strategy, which encourages Chinese businesses to establish footholds around the world. After focusing on domestic hydropower projects, Dongsong sought opportunities in mining overseas.Mr. L\u00fc, 50, a former bank manager who belongs to a political advisory body controlled by the Communist Party, said he ventured to Uganda after a chance meeting with the country\u2019s consul general in Guangzhou. Soon, he got the mine deal. \u201cEvery decision is made by heaven,\u201d he said.South SudanAfricaUgandaUgandaLakeAlbertDem. Rep.of CongoKampalaLakeVictoriaRwandaTanzaniaBy The New York TimesBut Dongsong\u2019s presence in Uganda has been laced with controversy.Dongsong has also been accused of fraud in a lawsuit by one of Mr. L\u00fc\u2019s early partners in Uganda, and it is mired in property disputes around the mine. In 2017, two finance ministry officials were arrested on suspicion of demanding and accepting bribes from Dongsong.The company has faced problems in China as well. A court in Hebei Province said last year that Mr. L\u00fc had set up a shell company to pay bribes to two state bank officials who were convicted on corruption charges.Mr. L\u00fc denies any wrongdoing, and his legal problems do not appear to have bothered Ugandan officials. They put Dongsong\u2019s refinery proposal on their short list and traveled to Guangzhou in 2017 to conduct due diligence interviews.Mr. L\u00fc impressed the team with slick presentations and punctual shuttle buses, an official on the trip said. The team noted that Dongsong\u2019s consortium included a Chinese state company with experience building refineries in Africa.Dongsong also secured a promise of financing from one of China\u2019s largest state banks \u2014 as long as Uganda guaranteed the loan.And yet, Dongsong enjoyed unique advantages in the refinery competition.In an internal report afterward, the team gave Dongsong a higher rating but also recommended inviting the Americans and Chinese to Kampala for parallel negotiations. The government set a date in June 2017.But Mr. L\u00fc asked whether Dongsong was the preferred bidder and declined to attend or send anyone. The Ugandan officials decided to enter final talks with just the Americans after they appeared.In a letter to the Ugandan energy minister reviewed by The Times, Mr. L\u00fc responded by threatening to challenge the process.Around that time, the other Chinese bidder, CNOOC, quietly emerged with a late push to build the refinery and take control of additional oil fields. (CNOOC did not respond to written questions on the project.)Ms. Jandhyala sought help in Washington.The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the American government\u2019s development finance agency, could not commit to the kind of billion-dollar financing offered by Chinese banks, but it provided a letter saying it would consider lending $250 million and providing loan insurance.\u201cThat lent confidence to other people,\u201d Ms. Jandhyala said.\u201cThere were a lot of interested parties beholden to the Chinese who tried to derail the process,\u201d Ms. Malac said.Among the skeptics was Sam Kutesa, the foreign minister, she said.In Uganda, all major decisions end up before Mr. Museveni. Officials jockey for his ear, and the president is adept at playing them off one another.That gave the Americans an opening. Despite naysaying by energy officials, Mr. Museveni liked the idea of balancing the Americans and Chinese in the oil industry, and he was intrigued by G.E.\u2019s involvement, Ugandan officials said.Last January, he called the meeting at Lake Victoria and forced energy officials to sit down with Ms. Jandhyala and her partners. He then got cabinet approval. The deal was signed in April.\u201cI think the big lesson is that we have to be aggressive,\u201d Ms. Malac said. \u201cWe have to be willing, as the U.S. government, to find our opportunities to advocate on behalf of our companies.\u201d\u201cThis example shows that despite the idea that China might prevail, we can win if we get our act together,\u201d she said.At the Beijing signing, Mr. Museveni and Mr. Kutesa smiled as they shook hands with Chinese executives.Lydia Namubiru contributed reporting from Kampala, and Keith Bradsher from Guangzhou, China.

{"Headline": "China Pours $218 Billion Into the Economy as Growth Slows", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With the Chinese economy beginning the new year on a decidedly downbeat note, Beijing\u2019s leaders are injecting more than $200 billion into its financial system to ease lending.Chinese officials pledged last month to step up support of the economy, and they are facing new urgency, said Mark Williams, chief Asia economist for Capital Economics, a research firm. Retail and auto sales are down, and China\u2019s latest manufacturing data showed factory activity shrank in December. While monthly data released on Friday showed improvement in China\u2019s services sector, the overall picture has become more concerning.\u201cThe consistently downbeat tone of the data released since then will only have underlined the strains the economy is facing,\u201d Mr. Williams said.The move by the central bank on Friday appeared to be part of a coordinated effort. Earlier in the day, Li Keqiang, the country\u2019s premier, said China would move to shore up the economy through measures that included cutting bank reserve requirement ratios and lowering taxes.The central bank said it would cut its reserve requirement ratio \u2014 a measure of how much cash from deposits that lenders need to keep \u2014 by half a percentage point on Jan. 15 and another half a percentage point by Jan. 25.The move will give banks more leeway to lend money, though analysts noted the net amount of money flowing into the system would be roughly half the $218 billion headline figure, as the central bank shuts off other sources of funds. It also comes roughly a month before China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, when Chinese households sometimes strain the monetary system by spending more and by giving cash as gifts.The cut \u201cwill be good for curbing the economic downturn and solving the financing difficulties of enterprises,\u201d said Yu Yongding, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\u201cBut this is just one policy,\u201d Mr. Yu added, saying it risks pouring money into real estate and the stock market, which would do little to solve the economy\u2019s problems. \u201cWe need a lot of other policies to cooperate.\u201dFor several weeks, economists and analysts have speculated that officials could move to push a hefty stimulus package that would give the flagging economy a shot in the arm. But such bold moves have become increasingly difficult for the Chinese government, which is contending with a huge debt load accumulated over the last decade to spur growth.Still, many analysts took the move as a sign that China\u2019s leader would be proactive in heading off any worsening slump.\u201cThe central bank has made it clear that this wasn\u2019t \u2018releasing the floodwaters\u2019 by providing a huge stimulus comparable to that introduced in 2009, but it is clear that they are redoubling efforts to stabilize the economy and the currency,\u201d Geoffrey Yu, the head of the British investment office of the Swiss bank UBS, said in an email.\u201cThis swift action supports our view that there won\u2019t be a sharp deceleration in the Chinese economy this year and that fears of a major global slowdown are overdone,\u201d Mr. Yu added.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the name of a Chinese city. It is Shenzhen, not Shenzen.Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " The Green New Deal Rises Again", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a good idea that didn\u2019t catch on in 2007. Now we\u2019re running out of time.Opinion ColumnistThe Green New Deal that Ocasio-Cortez has laid out aspires to power the U.S. economy with 100 percent renewable energy within 12 years and calls for \u201ca job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one,\u201d \u201cbasic income programs\u201d and \u201cuniversal health care,\u201d financed, at least in part, by higher taxes on the wealthy. Critics argue that this is technically unfeasible and that combining it with democratic socialist proposals will drive off conservatives needed to pass it.If they all adopt the per-capita consumption habits of today\u2019s Americans, we\u2019re going to burn up, heat up, eat up, plow up, choke up and smoke up the planet, whether the climate changes or not. That means that clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing, clean water and energy efficiency have to be the next great global industries \u2014 otherwise, we humans are going to be a bad biological experiment, whether the climate changes or not.Who believes that America can remain a great country and not lead the next great global industry? Not me. A Green New Deal, in other words, is a strategy for American national security, national resilience, natural security and economic leadership in the 21st century. Surely some conservatives can support that.And to make sure that they have an incentive to, I would also guarantee that a portion of every dollar raised by a carbon tax in a Green New Deal would be invested in two new community colleges and high-speed broadband in rural areas of every state. Each state could decide where. Every American needs to feel a chance to gain from a Green New Deal.But which Green New Deal? Mine is focused on innovation. I believe there is only one thing as big as Mother Nature, and that is Father Greed \u2014 a.k.a., the market. I am a green capitalist. I think we will only get the scale we need by shaping the market. If I were drafting a Green New Deal platform today, it would put in place steadily rising mileage, manufacturing and emissions standards; stronger building codes; and carbon market prices that would say to our industries and innovators: Here are the goals, here is the level of clean power or efficiency that you have to hit every year \u2014 and may the best company win.As I wrote in my 2007 column: \u201cTo spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances \u2014 and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power \u2014 California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.\u201dTo keep it simple, my goals would be what energy innovator Hal Harvey has dubbed \u201cthe four zeros.\u201d 1. Zero-net energy buildings: buildings that can produce as much energy as they consume. 2. Zero-waste manufacturing: stimulating manufacturers to design and build products that use fewer raw materials and that are easily disassembled and recycled. 3. A zero-carbon grid: If we can combine renewable power generation at a utility scale with some consumers putting up their own solar panels and windmills that are integrated with the grid, and with large-scale storage batteries, we really could, one day, electrify everything carbon-free. 4. Zero-emissions transportation: a result of combining electric vehicles and electric public transportation with a zero-carbon grid.That\u2019s my Green New Deal circa 2019. It basically says: Forget the Space Race. We don\u2019t need a man, or woman, on Mars. We need an Earth Race \u2014 a free-market competition to ensure that mankind can continue to thrive on Earth. A Green New Deal is the strategy for that. It can make America healthier, wealthier, more innovative, more energy secure, more respected \u2014 and weaken petro-dictators across the globe.I am eager to see what other people propose, but we don\u2019t have another decade to waste. This may well be our last chance to build the technologies we need at the scale of the challenge we face in the time we still have to \u2014 as scientists say \u2014 manage the unavoidable aspects of climate change and avoid the unmanageable ones.As the environmentalist Dana Meadows once put it, \u201cWe have exactly enough time \u2014 starting now.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Who was the \u201cself,\u201d and what was to be \u201cdetermined\u201d? Progressive in spirit but deeply unsettling for the empires that were dismantled, this new notion \u2014 self-determination \u2014 and the mechanisms by which it could be achieved was anything but clear. Ireland was diving head first into one of the 20th century\u2019s defining challenges: reimagining sovereignty on a more human level, so that, as Wilson explained, \u201cthe interests of the populations concerned \u2026 have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined.\u201dThese questions dogged Ireland as it hurtled toward independence. Catholic nationalists sought independence from British rule, while Protestants, concentrated in the north, remained loyal to the crown. Although Ireland had been integrated into the United Kingdom in 1801, it was still effectively governed as a colony into the early 20th century, with Catholic tenants paying Protestant landlords, who in turn were protected by crown forces. Following a catastrophic potato crop failure in the 1840s, famine had devastated Ireland and roused deep antipathy toward profiteering by the ruling class. Which side would decide what constituted Ireland\u2019s \u201cself,\u201d and who would do the determining?The decades before the Mansion House meeting saw Ireland and its people struggling to answer that question. It was, in part, economic: The quest to reclaim Ireland continued through the so-called Land Wars of 1879, when farmers rallied for \u201cfair rent, free sale, and the fixity of tenure.\u201d By 1882, the Irish Parliamentary Party, organized under the leadership of Charles Steward Parnell, mobilized farmers in favor of Home Rule, a policy that would keep Ireland within the United Kingdom but give it far more autonomy. Although Home Rule was rebuffed by parliamentary Conservatives in London, Parnell\u2019s popularity signaled a growing desire for independence.Cultural and economic independence, as much as political independence, informed the Dail\u2019s Democratic Program of 1919. Careful to protect Irish turf in all its regards, the document asserted that sovereignty extended not only to Ireland\u2019s people but \u201cto all its material possessions,\u201d including \u201cthe Nation\u2019s soil and all its resources.\u201d The new government promised to \u201cincrease the productivity of its soil\u201d and to exploit its mineral deposits and peat bogs. By 1919, self-determination was also an international question; Ireland, more than most places, had to integrate not only its internal views, but those of the countless Irish who had left the country but still claimed a stake in its future. One of the millions who had fled to America, James Stephens, returned to Ireland after the famine. On March 17, 1858 \u2014 St. Patrick\u2019s Day \u2014 he established the Irish Republican Brotherhood, which pledged to \u201cmake Ireland an independent democratic Republic.\u201d On the same day in New York, the Irishman John O\u2019Mahony established the similarly motivated Fenian Brotherhood. Aid groups, like the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and Clan na Gael, responded. The Friends of Irish Freedom in New York set out to raise $2 million. Reports explained that the American Committee for Relief in Ireland raised as much as $5 million, which the Irish White Cross distributed. Although relief organizations assured the public that the money was reserved for humanitarian aid, others sent guns and ammunition. In 1920 it was reported that 2,000 American rifles had been delivered to fighters in County Clare. In June 1921 the police in Hoboken, N.J., seized 500 machine guns and ammunition from a steamer bound for Ireland.Although De Valera sought a constitutional means to independence, Michael Collins, the Dail\u2019s minister for home affairs and later of finance, looked to violence. By 1919 a grass-roots militia called the Irish Volunteers joined with several other militant groups to form the Irish Republican Army. They began attacking British forces, which retaliated. In December 1920, the British passed a new Government of Ireland Act, which partitioned Ireland between the Protestant North and Catholic South, granting them both Home Rule governments. The North accepted it, but the South, committed to creating a united republic, would not. Violence continued through the summer of 1921, when Britain and Ireland, under pressure from the United States, called a truce.The Mansion House declaration may have been the beginning of Irish independence, but it did not end the violence between Ireland and Britain. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 created the Irish Provisional Government, which began to function as an independent state, and also divided the Irish nationalists.Collins agreed to the treaty, but De Valera rejected it and resigned as president. The I.R.A. split, with those in favor of an independent republic siding with De Valera and those in favor of the treaty forming a National Army. During the summer of 1922, the two sides descended into civil war. Fighting spread across Ireland, causing some Americans to rethink their contributions. The New York chapters of the Friends of Irish Freedom and the revolutionary women\u2019s group Cumann na mBan condemned \u201cthe collection of money in America to enable one set of Irishmen to fight other Irishmen.\u201d Collins died in battle, but his provisional government prevailed and in December 1922 formed the Irish Free State. The civil war ended in a cease-fire, though more than 11,000 I.R.A. soldiers were imprisoned, including De Valera. He was released in July 1924, among the last to see freedom.While De Valera remained politically marginalized, the Irish Free State made important diplomatic gains. In 1923, it joined the League of Nations, and in 1925 affirmed partition with Northern Ireland. In 1931 it earned independent status as a British dominion. But a year later De Valera\u2019s new Fianna Fail party took control and in 1937 introduced a new constitution, which established the sovereign state of Ireland. In 1938 Ireland and Britain signed a trade agreement, but when it failed to end partition, the I.R.A. grew disenchanted and began a bombing campaign in England that lasted until World War II. On April 18, 1949, Ireland left the British Commonwealth, and finally became a fully independent state.Irish Independence, declared a century ago but incomplete for another 30 years, was a tortuous process. Like the American Revolution, its fight against British rule became a battle between neighbors. But by borrowing language from America\u2019s founding documents and the revolutionary genre they inspired, Ireland shrewdly positioned itself to profit from America\u2019s moral authority, financial resources and the extraordinary organizing capacity of its Irish-American citizens.

But a professor who studies tourism trends said the family\u2019s exploits captured New Zealanders\u2019 anxieties about the ballooning number of visitors from overseas.\u201cPeople are viewing it as not necessarily a harbinger of things to come, but it shows our worry about what could happen,\u201d said Simon Milne, a professor of tourism at Auckland University of Technology and the director of the New Zealand Tourism Research Institute.\u201cIt does cut to the heart of a lot of our concerns and our desire to have a clean, green environment,\u201d he said. He added that the pictures and videos of the garbage-dumping, peace-disturbing family had most likely caused some locals to \u201cfeel uncomfortable about our own behavior from time to time.\u201dPopular tourist spots around New Zealand have reported that the local infrastructure cannot handle the tourist influx, forcing the government to scramble to mitigate the damage. Starting later this year, visitors to New Zealand will pay a fee of 35 New Zealand dollars, or about $23, which will be split between conservation and infrastructure. And last October, the fees to stay at huts or campsites in New Zealand\u2019s most popular national parks for hiking were doubled for overseas visitors.Jim Boult, the mayor of Queenstown, a popular ski resort town where visitors outnumber locals 34 to 1, said he was glad the government was aware of the problem. But he said the new visitor tax \u2014 even if awarded solely to Queenstown \u2014 would not scratch the surface of what tourism was costing the town. He wants a larger, more targeted tax instead.\u201cWe\u2019re the shop window for New Zealand,\u201d he said, alluding to photos of the area that he said drove \u201ca large percentage of tourist numbers.\u201d\u201cQueenstown is having to mortgage itself to the hilt for the rest of the country\u2019s benefit,\u201d he said, adding that growing local government debt to finance the area\u2019s rapidly growing infrastructure and accommodation needs was driving up costs for local residents, many of whom struggled to find affordable housing in a rental market catering to wealthy tourists.\u201cWe don\u2019t think that is fair,\u201d he said.The boom is only expected to continue. In February, New Zealand will introduce a yearlong Chinese tourism initiative; China is the country\u2019s second-largest source of tourists after Australia, and the fastest growing. The campaign aims to attract visitors during off-peak times and to lesser-known regions, and also to help businesses better cater to visitors from China.But Mr. Milne, the tourism professor, said not enough had been done to prepare New Zealand communities for an expected doubling in the number of Chinese visitors. He added that New Zealand had a history of overlooking local residents\u2019 concerns as it sought to aggressively increase tourism.The British family accused of wreaking a trail of havoc down the North Island over the last month first came to public attention when a woman in Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city, filmed a dispute over the family members\u2019 refusal to pick up trash they had appeared to leave behind at Takapuna Beach.Although the family members had been issued deportation notices by New Zealand immigration officials after an incident at a Burger King in the city of Hamilton, some remained in the country as of Tuesday. (New Zealand permits visitors to appeal deportation notices, and they cannot be deported until their appeals are complete.) One of the family members, Tina Maria Cash, was convicted of theft in the Hamilton District Court and ordered to pay 55 New Zealand dollars for stealing from a gas station.And in 2017, 200 angry residents of Waiheke Island \u2014 a short ferry ride from Auckland, and popular for its beaches and vineyards \u2014 blocked the passage of a double-decker sightseeing bus that locals said was too large for the island\u2019s narrow, winding roads.A new government and tourism industry initiative introduced last November aims to better educate visitors about New Zealand\u2019s cultural values by asking them to promise to care for the local environment on their trip.Bruce Smith, the mayor of Westland, a remote and sparsely populated area on the South Island that is increasingly popular with tourists, said such education initiatives were sorely needed.\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem at all with locals throwing tourists in a lake when they leave their rubbish lying around or biff it out a window,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s China Problem", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBerlin is walking a thin line between its strongest ally and its biggest trading partner.Contributing Opinion WriterBERLIN \u2014 As the trade impasse between the United States and China grinds on, the rest of the world is reduced to being anxious bystanders \u2014 and nowhere are leaders more anxious than here in Germany.Over the last decade, Germany, the largest economy in Europe but still a middle power by global standards, has steadily adapted itself to the realities of Chinese economic dominance. We have welcomed Chinese investment, and encouraged our companies to play by Beijing\u2019s rules to get access to its markets. At the same time, Germany has remained a stalwart member of the Western political and security alliance. The geopolitical tumult of the last six months has led to a strategic awakening among Germany\u2019s leaders of the risks involved in trying to play both sides. Whether Germany has the capacity to rise to those challenges may be the biggest question facing the country over the next several years.Until now, trade has defined Germany\u2019s foreign policy on China, its single most important trading partner. It has sought close relations with China, setting up regular bilateral government consultations. Like many in the West, Germans believed that growth would push China in a more economically and politically liberal direction. But over the last few years, these hopes have been shattered by the increasingly nationalist, expansionist and statist politics of President Xi Jinping.According to analysts like Mikko Huotari, the deputy director of the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies, Chancellor Angela Merkel has long held a skeptical view of China\u2019s political development. But it was not until about two years ago that the rest of the government came around to her way of thinking, and pushed the rest of the government to sign onto a new, multifaceted China strategy. This new approach begins with the premise that China is not just expanding its economy, but seeking to impose a global agenda that not only promotes its interests but also chips away at the rules-based, multinational order established after World War II. In response, Germany needs to be more active, perhaps even combative, in defending its interests.But it was not until the last several months that the government began to change its public stance, becoming bolder in its talk of a \u201cnew great power struggle.\u201d In a speech in November, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas argued that Europe had \u201cthe most of all to lose\u201d from growing America-China tensions and America-Russia tensions. In a recent, unusually outspoken paper, the Federation of German Industries, one of the country\u2019s most powerful business associations, declared that there was \u201csystem competition\u201d between China and Germany \u2014 in other words, that trade between the two countries had become a zero-sum battle. While German industry should continue to \u201ctake advantage of the opportunities offered by economic exchange with China,\u201d the federation said, the \u201cchallenges posed by China cannot be ignored.\u201d But is all this enough? Policymakers and diplomats refrain from speaking of a paradigm shift in Germany\u2019s China politics. \u201cWe have carefully adjusted our policy,\u201d said Niels Annen, the minister of state at the Foreign Office. Indeed, unlike Germany\u2019s foreign policy on Russia, the country\u2019s relations with China are under less vigorous and ideological public scrutiny. Russia is a passionately divisive topic; most Germans could care less about China. And diplomats probably like it that way.When it comes to China, Germany has to walk a very thin line in a rapidly changing international environment. The trans-Atlantic relationship has been rattled since Donald Trump took office; Germany suddenly finds itself agreeing with China more on certain issues, like climate change, than with the United States, its longtime ally. As a consequence, German diplomats have to play a tricky game: Partnering with an ideological adversary against its close ally on some issues, while sticking with that suddenly difficult ally against its most important trading partner on others. And in both cases, it has to stand by its commitment to the rules-based international order when neither of those partners holds the same level of commitment, at least at the moment.How much longer Germany can continue to walk this line while staying committed to the old trans-Atlantic relationship remains to be seen. Mr. Huotari of the Mercator Institute expects Germany to be put on the spot sooner or later. \u201cChina may be content as long as Germany doesn\u2019t take sides with the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the United States is expecting us to clearly position ourselves. We are in the middle of the game already \u2014 and the pressure is going to increase.\u201dGermany\u2019s best option seems to be finding safety in numbers by uniting its European allies, not least because part of China\u2019s geopolitical strategy is to divide Europe. Six years ago, it established the 16+1 framework, an initiative to engage 16 Central and Eastern European countries, 11 of which are members of the European Union, in closer relations to influence European policies in its favor. Lately, however, several of those countries have become disenchanted. In some, China is having trouble keeping up with its investment promises. Others, like Poland, face increasing pressure from Washington to loosen ties with Beijing. This could be Germany\u2019s opening, but it has to play it exactly right \u2014 and uniting Western, Central and Eastern Europe is no easy task. It is the eternal quandary of German foreign policy: Germany can\u2019t go it alone, but Europe is too divided and too slow to step up. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republican Lawmaker Floats Bill to Expand Trump\u2019s Tariff Powers", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A Republican lawmaker plans to introduce legislation on Thursday that would embolden President Trump\u2019s trade war by granting him sweeping new executive powers to increase tariffs on imports.The proposal, by Representative Sean P. Duffy of Wisconsin, is unlikely to pass Congress, but it has alarmed conservative advocacy groups and business lobbyists, who warn that such an idea could further destabilize the global rules of trade and prompt other countries to adopt similar presidential powers.The legislation would allow Mr. Trump to unilaterally raise tariffs on a foreign product if he determined that a trading partner had imposed \u201csignificantly\u201d higher tariffs or other trade barriers on that same American good. The draft proposal would also give the president power to enter into new trade agreements without congressional approval.The president already has broad powers to impose tariffs but must go through certain channels to put them into effect, including a formal investigation by the Commerce Department or other agencies. His actions can also be overturned, in some cases, by the United States International Trade Commission or the World Trade Organization.\u201cWe can mirror the tariffs they have on our products,\u201d Mr. Duffy said. \u201cAnd the idea here is, we\u2019re free traders. We don\u2019t want tariffs. But our trading partners have no incentive to negotiate with us.\u201dThe bill would have Congress officially adopt an economic philosophy that Mr. Trump favors but that most economists reject, declaring that the American trade deficit in goods \u201cis a drag on economic growth and undermines economic prosperity.\u201dA White House spokeswoman had no comment on the bill. But two senior administration officials said the idea to embrace a call for more tariff powers in Mr. Trump\u2019s coming State of the Union address was being pushed by the president\u2019s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, and had been circulated last week with several other drafts of the speech.No decision has been made about including the language, the officials said. The idea is opposed by the director of Mr. Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, and other advisers who have repeatedly raised questions about the impact of more tariffs on the country\u2019s economy.Democrats are unlikely to advance any legislation granting Mr. Trump more trade authority, either in the House, which they control, or in the Senate by providing votes for a bill.\u201cGiving him even more authority is a recipe for more economic chaos,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, calling Mr. Trump\u2019s approach so far \u201cineffective and ham-handed.\u201dBusiness lobbyists and free-market advocacy groups have begun a pressure campaign to dissuade rank-and-file Republicans from signing on as co-sponsors of Mr. Duffy\u2019s bill, which they warn would undermine American competitiveness and upend the rules of international trade. The critics also warn that the law could violate Article I of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to tax and set tariffs.Some of those groups worry Republicans might support the bill simply to help Mr. Trump, without considering its long-term effects.\u201cEven though the likelihood of the passage of this thing is pretty low, it\u2019s a dangerous marker for them to be throwing down,\u201d said Brandon Arnold, the executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative advocacy group in Washington. \u201cThis is a complete game-changer, in a very negative sense, for the rules-based system of trade that the United States and the globe have benefited from.\u201dThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation\u2019s foremost business lobbying group, urged lawmakers to reject the proposal in a letter last Friday, warning that it would \u201cinvite massive tariff retaliation against U.S. exports,\u201d undermine job creation and hit farmers and ranchers particularly hard.\u201cThe harm to Americans would be immediate,\u201d wrote Neil Bradley, the chamber\u2019s executive vice president and chief policy officer. \u201cTariffs are taxes, and they are paid by American families and American businesses.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly invoked his existing trade authorities to raise tariffs and other duties on imported goods. He has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of imports from China, which his administration accuses of intellectual property theft and a long list of other trade violations. And he has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union and countries like Canada and Japan to protect industries that his administration calls vital for national security.Mr. Duffy\u2019s bill would grant presidents the ability to raise tariffs in a similar way for any good \u2014 whether it is being \u201cdumped\u201d or not \u2014 to counter high tariffs on the American version of the same good.\u201cThe president should have a wide array of tools to open the markets of United States trading partners,\u201d the draft text reads, \u201cand encourage participation in negotiations to liberalize trade in goods on a fair and reciprocal basis, including the authority to adjust tariff rates to reciprocal levels.\u201dThose tools include raising tariff rates against a trading partner \u2014 and continuing to escalate them should the other country retaliate. The president would also gain the ability \u201cto negotiate and seek to enter into an agreement with the foreign country that commits the country to reduce the rate of duty or reduce or eliminate nontariff barriers\u201d on the good in question.Under current law, presidents may enter into trade agreements, but Congress must approve them.Emily Cochrane and Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "GoFundMe to Refund Border Wall Donations After Fund-Raiser Falls Short", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe crowdfunding platform GoFundMe said that more than $20 million in donations were slated to be refunded after a campaign to raise $1 billion for the Trump administration to build a wall on the border with Mexico had fallen well short of its goal.More than 325,000 donors had pledged in the GoFundMe campaign that the organizer, a veteran from Florida named Brian Kolfage, said would have been used for President Trump\u2019s border wall.But in a note posted on the campaign\u2019s website on Friday, Mr. Kolfage said the federal government would not be able to accept the donations \u201canytime soon.\u201dMr. Kolfage said in an interview that donating to the government would have required approval from Congress and that he knew that a Democrat-controlled House would not give its approval.Instead, Mr. Kolfage said, he has formed a Florida-based nonprofit organization called We Build the Wall that will use donations to finance a private effort to build parts of the wall where private landowners allow construction.GoFundMe donors would have to proactively choose to redirect their money to the nonprofit; otherwise, they would be refunded.Mr. Kolfage said he did not know exactly how many donors would want to redirect their money nor how many landowners would want parts of the wall constructed on their properties.\u201cWhen Americans see us completing real miles of beautiful wall, we know that we will raise the many billions we need to finally secure the entire border,\u201d Mr. Kolfage said on the updated GoFundMe campaign page.The Department of Homeland Security and the Trump administration did not respond to requests for comment on Friday evening on the possibility of a privately funded effort to build the wall.Typically, GoFundMe campaigns can still collect money even if they do not meet their goal.But Bobby Whithorne, a spokesman for GoFundMe, said in a statement on Friday that Mr. Kolfage\u2019s original campaign page had said \u201cIf we don\u2019t reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny\u201d and that \u201c100% of your donations will go to the Trump Wall. If for ANY reason we don\u2019t reach our goal we will refund your donation.\u201dMr. Whithorne said that since the campaign was not going to reach the $1 billion goal, and that both GoFundMe and Mr. Kolfage had determined the money raised could not be given to the federal government, GoFundMe had contacted all donors to the original campaign about the refund.Donors can ask for a refund immediately, Mr. Whithorne said, but if they do not choose to redirect their money to the nonprofit, they will automatically receive a refund in 90 days.Jonathan Ryan, president and chief executive of Raices, said that despite the change in Mr. Kolfage\u2019s campaign, the original critiques of it still stand.\u201cIt\u2019s a difference without a change,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThe wall remains the wrong direction for us as a country, something that will not help advance any of our national interests and that would only serve to further harm vulnerable refugees and immigrants seeking protection in our country.\u201dThis week, Mr. Trump appeared on television in an attempt to pressure Congress into paying for the border wall, characterizing the situation at the Mexican border as a \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d that was exposing the country to crime, drugs and terrorism.Experts, however, point out that migrant border crossings have been declining over about two decades. The State Department said in a recent report that there was \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the country through Mexico.Advertisement"}

Mr. Lasseter, 61, will start this month at the company, which Mr. Ellison, 36, started in 2010 with money inherited from his father, the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison.In giving Mr. Lasseter a comeback opportunity, Mr. Ellison appears to have weighed his own professional ambitions \u2014 to build a major entertainment company \u2014 against any potential blowback, including from employees and advocacy organizations like Time\u2019s Up.\u201cJohn is a singular creative and executive talent whose impact on the animation industry cannot be overstated,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement. Skydance wants \u201cto expand our animation efforts for the global marketplace,\u201d he added. \u201cWe look forward to John bringing all of his creative talents, his experience managing large franchises, his renewed understanding of the responsibilities of leadership and his exuberance to Skydance.\u201dStill, Mr. Ellison continued: \u201cWe did not enter into this decision lightly. John has acknowledged and apologized for his mistakes and, during the past year away from the workplace, has endeavored to address and reform them.\u201dMr. Ellison did not specify how. A Skydance spokesman noted that the company\u2019s two most senior-ranking women, Dana Goldberg, chief creative officer, and Anne Globe, chief marketing officer, both supported the decision to bring aboard Mr. Lasseter.In an email to Skydance employees, Mr. Ellison said he had hired \u201coutside counsel to thoroughly investigate the allegations, which we considered serious.\u201d He did not reveal any of the conclusions but said the company had \u201ccarefully evaluated the findings of this extensive investigation.\u201dIn a statement of his own, Mr. Lasseter insisted that he had spent time in \u201cdeep reflection, learning how my actions unintentionally made many colleagues uncomfortable, which I deeply regret and apologize for.\u201d He added that he planned to build Skydance Animation in the same way he built Pixar, albeit with a new commitment to \u201csafety, trust and mutual respect.\u201dTime\u2019s Up, whose founders include Reese Witherspoon and Shonda Rhimes, said three things were needed for men like Mr. Lasseter to return to positions of authority: a demonstration of true remorse, deep work to reform their behavior and restitution to those harmed.\u201cOffering a high-profile position to an abuser who has yet to do any of those things is condoning abuse,\u201d the organization said.As word spread in Hollywood this week that Mr. Lasseter was close to finding new employment, several influential women involved with the #MeToo movement noted that he expressed no regret for his behavior or discussed making efforts to reform when he left Disney in June. In a statement at the time, he said he had made his own decision to \u201cbegin focusing on new creative challenges.\u201dDisney had put Mr. Lasseter on leave in November 2017. At that time, he sent an email to employees at Pixar and the separate Walt Disney Animation studio apologizing \u201cto anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape or form.\u201dAs Mr. Lasseter looked for a new job in recent months, people in his camp contended that he had been unfairly swept up in the #MeToo movement. At one point, he talked to Warner Bros. about a role there.Skydance, based in Santa Monica, has divisions dedicated to movies, television and video games. Skydance\u2019s recent films include \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout,\u201d which collected $791 million at the box office last year. It controls the \u201cTerminator\u201d franchise and supplies the hit series \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d to Netflix. Coming up, Mr. Ellison is working with Paramount Pictures on a \u201cTop Gun\u201d sequel and \u201cGemini Man,\u201d a science-fiction thriller directed by Ang Lee.Skydance Animation, founded in 2017, has not released any films. One of its first movies, \u201cLuck,\u201d directed by Alessandro Carloni (\u201cKung Fu Panda 3\u201d) and aimed toward theatrical release by Paramount in 2021, explores a world where secret organizations called Good Luck and Bad Luck secretly control people\u2019s lives.

{"Headline": "With Kim\u2019s Visit, China Shows U.S. It Has Leverage on Trade", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, has offered carrots to President Trump to stop a trade war that has contributed to a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy. On Tuesday, he also seemed to brandish a stick.The trade talks were originally set to wrap up Tuesday, but wound up being extended into Wednesday. The two sides are laboring to finish a deal before March 2, when higher American tariffs will kick in and escalate the trade war.The trade war isn\u2019t the only reason for China\u2019s slowdown, but it is making the slump worse.\u201cThe trade war, in addition to its direct costs, has created huge uncertainties for exporters and importers, producers, consumers, entrepreneurs and investors,\u201d Fred Hu, the founder of a large private equity firm in Hong Kong, said at a UBS conference in Shanghai on Monday.By contrast, the Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks see China\u2019s offers so far as inadequate, people with detailed knowledge of the talks said last week.The trade hawks have been pushing China to add more specifics to what they have characterized as nebulous promises to improve intellectual property protection, to limit government subsidies and to stop putting pressure on American companies to transfer valuable technology to China.\u201cKim is eager to remind the Trump administration that he does have diplomatic and economic options besides what Washington and Seoul can offer,\u201d said Harry J. Kazianis, an expert on North Korea and the director of defense studies at the Washington-based Center for the National Interest, referring to the United States and South Korea.\u201cThat should make America quite concerned,\u201d Mr. Kazianis said, \u201cas China could easily turn Trump\u2019s \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 strategy into nothing more than a memory, as almost all North Korea\u2019s external trade flows through China in some capacity.\u201dAt a daily news briefing on Tuesday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said the talks were unrelated. \u201cChina has many diplomatic events, and our diplomatic schedule is very full,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cIf there are some overlaps, it is also natural.\u201dChina has since made other offers, such as stronger protections for intellectual property and foreign companies\u2019 trade secrets. It could also further cut its tariffs on global imports, experts say. Still, it could be difficult to get the United States to come to a full agreement.While Mr. Trump is now expected to attend the World Economic Forum this month in Davos, Switzerland, his administration has resisted Chinese efforts to schedule any formal trade negotiations then. The administration has also sought to delay an expected visit by Vice Premier Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar and an important figure in the talks, to Washington for further trade negotiations until after Mr. Trump delivers his State of the Union address on Jan. 29.The problem for Beijing is that such a delay would mean that any progress from Mr. Liu\u2019s visit would come too late to fortify consumer confidence before China\u2019s Lunar New Year holiday, which begins on Feb. 4. The weeks before the holiday typically bring a binge of consumer spending; they are often among the biggest weeks of the year for car sales, for example.So Mr. Kim\u2019s visit gives China a chance to show that it still has something the United States wants.Since Mr. Kim\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day speech, analysts have wondered about what he meant when he threatened to \u201cfind a new way\u201d if Washington refused to ease sanctions. Some saw it as a veiled threat to resume the nuclear and long-range missile tests North Korea has suspended since late 2017.But others said North Korea was trying to play a balancing game between China and the United States, capitalizing on the trade war.Keith Bradsher reported from Shanghai, and Choe Sang-hun from Seoul, South Korea.

{"Headline": "Unearthing Photography\u2019s Time Capsule", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn March of 1985, the photographer Robert Frank arrived with a paper sack at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston to use Polaroid\u2019s 20-by-24-inch camera. It was a hulking beast of an apparatus, worlds away from the diminutive 35-millimeter Leica that had freed him to roam the country while shooting \u201cThe Americans,\u201d the 1959 book of photos that crowned him a king of counterculture and the most imitated photographer alive today.He emptied the bag of salvaged miscellany he\u2019d brought to shoot, jotted a few cryptic words on bits of paper, and then pinned them together with old photos and other ephemera onto timeworn corkboards. In the resulting six-paneled work \u2014 \u201cBoston, March 20, 1985\u201d we see the corkboards arranged in grids like signs at an old grocer\u2019s. Few clues reveal Frank\u2019s intentions, but we know that his fellow trailblazing photographers, Robert Heinecken, Dave Heath and John Wood, were somehow involved: The images show scrawled dedications to them.They saw that creative photography could require just as many painstaking decisions as painting a blank canvas might, and they wanted to explore that idea.\u201cThese were our heroes, and we could watch them work, watch them interact,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIt was an amazing time for us.\u201d He and Ms. Cohen, who were (and still are) married, entered the lives of the unlikely collaborators, and for two and a half years documented every step, videotaping their prickly, coffee-fueled meetings in Rochester, N.Y., and elsewhere; interviewing them in their homes; observing them in the studio; and writing extensively on their findings.The group eventually determined that the project would culminate in an exhibition at the Visual Studies Workshop, a hotbed of experimental activity in Rochester, founded and run by the powerhouse photographer and thinker Nathan Lyons. The artist Joan Lyons, his wife, would design the catalog.But nearly three years in, with the exhibition just months away, budgets tightened at Polaroid and the funding stopped. The project was shelved, and an untold chapter of photographic history closed. That chapter is now being reopened along with the dozen-odd bankers boxes of archival materials that Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson stored in a closet in their Belmont, Mass., home more than 30 years ago. Those materials will soon be made available to the public for the first time at the Harry Ransom Center, a humanities research library and museum at the University of Texas at Austin, which just announced the acquisition of the archive from Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson.The cache, now known as the Susan E. Cohen and William S. Johnson Creativity Project archive, includes dozens of photos; 50 hours of interviews and conversations on videotapes and audiocassettes; artworks given to the couple; essay drafts; correspondence; and research materials on each artist. (Mr. Johnson, a Harvard art librarian early in his career, is known in the field as an intensely thorough bibliographer and archivist.) Also included are the 16-page maquettes of artist\u2019s books that Mr. Frank, Mr. Heath, and Mr. Wood created for the catalog, as well as a published copy of the one Mr. Heinecken published himself.Jessica McDonald, the Ransom Center\u2019s curator of photography, a specialist in Nathan Lyons and the buzzing photography scene in mid-20th-century Rochester that sprang up around Kodak and the George Eastman House, first discovered the archive through talks with Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson about the possibility of one day publishing the unfinished catalog and artist\u2019s book maquettes.It was the pair\u2019s invitation that enticed the artists to participate in the first place, Mr. Johnson said, explaining that, at the time, most established photographers were under pressure to stand out in the crowd, not collaborate with it.The only surviving participant of the four, Mr. Frank, might be the most surprising addition to the group, given his reputation for keeping to himself. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.) He stopped making photographs shortly after the publication of \u201cThe Americans,\u201d turning instead to filmmaking. But he returned to the medium in the 1970s.\u201cWe were the first guys to get him to talk about his art. He had absolutely refused to do so before. We were just lucky. I think it was that his mother was dying, and he was in a reflective mode,\u201d Mr. Johnson recalled. \u201cWe walked into Robert\u2019s studio in New York and there were piles of prints on the floor of his living room. And they were magnificent. He\u2019d been using Polaroids and he was writing on them, and that was very exciting to me. I said, \u2018Here\u2019s a guy who has reinvented himself.\u2019\u201dThe others had also moved squarely beyond the conventional single-image shot and photo essay. Mr. Wood had quietly innovated ways of combining different types of photographic and printing processes. Mr. Heath, who first gained attention in 1965 with his photo essay \u201cA Dialogue With Solitude,\u201d was experimenting with Polaroid cameras as well as with carousel slide installations. Mr. Heinecken, meanwhile, was known for his cutting-edge manipulations of media imagery from sources including magazines and catalogs. The most widely circulated work to come out of the project was probably his 1985 artist\u2019s book \u201c1984: A Case Study in Finding an Appropriate TV Newswoman (A CBS Docudrama in Words and Pictures),\u201d which he made by holding photographic paper up to a television.While like-minded in their rejection of photographic conventions, the four artists were too set in their ways to collaborate on a single work. \u201cBut it would be wrong to say that there was no collaborating,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.In an audio clip from a May 1983 meeting at the Lyons home, for instance, we hear the wonderfully analog sound of Mr. Heath\u2019s Polaroid SX-70 churning out snapshots. He later worked those Polaroids into his artist\u2019s book, and sent others to Mr. Wood, who collaged them into his contributions to the exhibition.The whereabouts of much of the artwork is still unknown, but none of it would probably have existed if Ms. Cohen and Mr. Johnson hadn\u2019t initiated the project. Ms. McDonald hopes that she\u2019ll be able to piece together a checklist of what was to have been in the planned show.\u201cIf the exhibition and book had happened, it would have been amazing, but in a way the archive itself is the best way to understand what happened,\u201d Ms. Cohen said. \u201cYou open a box and you read a file full of paper and you put on a videotape and watch that, and it\u2019s in tiny pieces like that. That\u2019s realer to what happened. The map is not the territory.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Toll on Science and Research Mounts as Government Shutdown Continues", "Date": "2019-01-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the first sessions of the American Meteorological Society\u2019s annual conference in Phoenix this weekend seemed like just the sort to attract plenty of government scientists: \u201cBuilding Resilience to Extreme Political Weather: Advice for Unpredictable Times.\u201dBut the conference, where more than 700 federal employees had been expected, will have few federal scientists in attendance. Many are barred from participating during the partial government shutdown, just one of the numerous consequences for the science community during the capital\u2019s latest spending standoff.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity lost,\u201d said Daniel A. Sobien, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization and a forecaster in the agency\u2019s office near Tampa, Fla.The shutdown, now in its third week, has emptied some laboratories across the country, forced scientists from the field, upended important scientific conferences, imperiled the flow of grant money and disrupted careful planning for future studies, some of which are time-sensitive.\u201cWe\u2019re not collecting data,\u201d said Leland S. Stone, an area vice president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents many federal scientists. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not analyzing the data and we\u2019re not able to make the advances that we\u2019re paid to do.\u201dDr. Stone, who works at a NASA center in California and studies how humans perform in challenging conditions, added: \u201cMost taxpayers don\u2019t want to pay taxes and not get the progress they\u2019re paying for. Is it the end of the universe? Is it the end of America as we know it? No. But is it pointless? Is it avoidable?\u201dThe impasse, current and former officials said, will eventually show in shutdown-size gaps in data that scientists often collect across generations. Time-sensitive observations, which are impossible to recover or recreate, are going unseen and unrecorded.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the gap,\u201d said Sally Jewell, who was the secretary of the interior during the 16-day shutdown in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s the ability to correlate that with a broader picture of what\u2019s happening environmentally and ecologically. It really does mess things up.\u201dThe current shutdown has not affected every part of the government\u2019s sprawling science apparatus because some agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, were entirely or mostly funded through other legislation. The Department of Energy, which runs the nation\u2019s nuclear laboratories, is similarly unaffected.But many other agencies have closed or slowed down. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, has furloughed many workers. The Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s offices are mostly empty, and the National Park Service has few employees on the job. Almost all employees at the Environmental Protection Agency and NASA have been furloughed.In limited circumstances since the shutdown began on Dec. 22, some scientific work has continued at agencies that were otherwise mostly closed. NASA, for instance, is still undertaking its \u201ctracking, operation and support\u201d of the International Space Station, and the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s shutdown contingency plan called for some animal caretakers to report for work.But rank-and-file scientists said the shutdown was exacting a gradual toll that might not be fully realized for several years, affecting research, morale and, perhaps, the recruitment of prospective employees.Loreen Targos, a Chicago-based physical scientist for the E.P.A., said at this time of year, she would ordinarily be working on designs and permitting for projects to help improve the Great Lakes.\u201cAll of these things have to be heavily negotiated with attorneys for the science to ever manifest,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re going to end up having is delays on these outcomes.\u201dOther current and former government scientists expressed similar concerns about the fates of environmental maintenance efforts, like prescribed burns that help prime habitats and prevent wildfires, and research projects, such as wildlife counts, that had been planned from oceans to tundras. They also worried about any curtailing of monitoring efforts for diseases like white-nose syndrome, which has been blamed for the deaths of millions of bats in recent years.\u201cA shutdown has these cascading effects on the scientific work of the organization,\u201d said Daniel M. Ashe, a former director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to foresee or predict right now, but they\u2019re crippling, really, and they affect the organization not for three or four weeks, but for the rest of the year because of all of this complex orchestration of field work.\u201dThe Fish and Wildlife Service declined to comment beyond its published contingency plan, an eight-page document covering nearly 8,400 employees.The effects could soon reach beyond government workers and labs, and scientists who are not on Washington\u2019s direct payroll have been fretting over how the shutdown might interrupt the flow of grant money to researchers across the United States. The National Science Foundation, which underwrites billions of dollars in research each year, will cancel dozens of proposal review panel meetings this month if the government remains closed. Other agencies that dole out research money have also effectively put their plans for future spending on hold.\u201cHaving that review process literally shut down now, plus also having the budget year truncated, puts a ton of pressure in terms of getting money out to the states and these federal-state partnerships in order to do science,\u201d said Dr. W. Russell Callender, the director of Washington Sea Grant, which receives money from NOAA and is based at the University of Washington.\u201cYou need the feds as a partner in order to be able to conduct the science the states need,\u201d said Dr. Callender, a former NOAA official, \u201cand to be able to get the money the states need.\u201dThe turmoil also spread elsewhere in higher education. Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, wrote on Twitter on Friday that he would not accept any new graduate students because he had proposals pending with NASA and the National Science Foundation.\u201cI don\u2019t want to accept a student and then find out I don\u2019t have funding for them,\u201d he wrote.Steven Kahn, the director of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which is under construction and will someday be able to take pictures of the sky above the entire Southern Hemisphere, said the portion of the project financed by the National Science Foundation could continue for at least several more weeks without interruption.David Reitze, the executive director of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, said he faced a similar timeline. But he, and others, suggested their concerns would mount with every broken-down negotiation in Washington.\u201cIf this goes on for a real long time \u2014 and, of course, we hope it doesn\u2019t \u2014 then it\u2019s going to impact our operations,\u201d said Dr. Reitze, a physicist who oversees a project designed to detect the gravitational waves that Albert Einstein theorized about more than a century ago. \u201cThe longer it goes, the worse it\u2019s going to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo\u2019s Blunt Subway Strategy: Humiliate the M.T.A. to Force Change", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City\u2019s subway and bus system needs higher fares to shore up its finances and to make much-needed improvements in service. But on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he opposed the increase, once again publicly humiliating the behemoth transit agency in an attempt to force it to change.The brinkmanship has deepened the sense of crisis at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, throwing into doubt the future of the agency\u2019s leadership and leaving riders wondering about what will happen to fares and promised renovations after years of decay.With his comments, Mr. Cuomo, who has insisted that he does not actually control the authority, has put pressure on the M.T.A.\u2019s leaders to more quickly overhaul the system. The issue, though, is whether being so publicly blunt about the agency, as Mr. Cuomo has been twice this month, is the most effective way to turn things around there.On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo argued against a fare increase and questioned whether the agency actually needed the money.\u201cI have no faith in what they say,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said in an interview, in reference to the fare hike debate.Mr. Cuomo made clear that his comments were part of a broader strategy to bring about reforms. Asked whether the agency might have to cut service without the revenue, Mr. Cuomo said, \u201cNo. Tighten your belt. Make the place run better.\u201dWith a fare vote scheduled for Thursday, a close ally of the governor, Lawrence S. Schwartz, has intervened to force the agency to examine other options. The board is considering fare proposals that could raise the cost of a MetroCard swipe to $3 in March.But Mr. Schwartz, an M.T.A. board member and former top aide to Mr. Cuomo, plans to offer his own proposals, which include tying fare increases to better service and investing additional money toward combating fare evasion, which the agency says has become a serious problem.\u201cI\u2019m dead set against voting for any fare increases without performance improvements tied to it,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said in an interview, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen on Thursday.\u201dBut the transit agency\u2019s financial plan relies on modest fare and toll increases, every two years, across its sprawling system of subways, buses, commuter railroads and paratransit service. The fare increase is expected to bring in an additional $316 million per year.The authority is working to make reforms and improve service with its existing resources, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority.\u201cThe M.T.A. board will have robust discussion and decide on the best course of action in the context of the M.T.A.\u2019s dire financial position, which requires fare and toll increases as well as new, sustainable, adequate sources of funding in order to balance the budget while avoiding painful service cuts,\u201d Mr. Tarek said in a statement.Even with the fare increase, subway leaders say the system is in a grim financial situation. They have warned that without new revenue sources, their only options would be even higher fare increases or drastic cuts to subway and bus service. The agency expects to have a deficit of nearly $1 billion by 2022.\u201cIf the legislature were to not pass congestion pricing, we would be effectively back at the drawing board trying to figure out what our next steps would be, to be quite honest,\u201d said Patrick McCoy, the authority\u2019s finance director.Mr. Cuomo has complained that the creation of the authority was \u201cdiabolical\u201d and intended to keep elected officials from being held accountable for tough decisions.\u201cIt was purposefully designed so that everyone can point fingers at everybody else, and nobody\u2019s responsible,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said this month. \u201cWhy? Because no politician wanted to be responsible. You\u2019re talking about trains and subways and fare increases. And no politician wants to be the one who suggested a fare increase.\u201dThe authority\u2019s board votes on major issues for the regional transit system like fare increases and service changes. The board typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by the mayor. Mr. Cuomo also selects its chairman and had a role in hiring the agency\u2019s top leadership like Andy Byford, the subway\u2019s leader.Mr. Schwartz said he had decided to search for other fare options on his own and had not discussed the matter with Mr. Cuomo.\u201cWe have to try to do it in a way where those who are economically vulnerable or rely on the system the most are impacted the least,\u201d Mr. Schwartz said. \u201cAnd I want to assure riders that New York City Transit and Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road are going to be held accountable for performance metrics.\u201dMr. Schwartz did not give specifics about his proposals, but did say that in order for fare increases to take place, leaders would have to show, for instance, that on-time rates were improving.Lisa Daglian, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a watchdog group, said she was concerned about what would happen to the system without a fare increase.\u201cHow does that money get made up?\u201d she said. \u201cAll of the Plan B scenarios are bad and they\u2019re not something riders should want. Nobody wants a fare increase, but nobody wants service cuts.\u201dAt the board meeting on Tuesday, riders made heartfelt pleas against a fare increase. Valerie Joseph, who relies on the Access-A-Ride paratransit service, said she had limited income and could not afford higher fares.\u201cRaising the fare,\u201d she said, \u201cI won\u2019t even have money to eat.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rashida Tlaib\u2019s Expletive-Laden Cry to Impeach Trump Upends Democrats\u2019 Talking Points", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Impeachment was always going to hang heavily over a divided Washington. But it took little more than 24 hours this week for a freshman House Democrat\u2019s exuberant, expletive-laden impeachment promise to upend the bonhomie of a new Congress and prompt President Trump, by his own telling, to ask the newly elected speaker if Democrats planned to impeach him.The episode began Thursday night, just hours after the 116th Congress was sworn in, when a camera captured Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan promising profanely to impeach Mr. Trump as she drew cheers from liberal activists at a celebration at a bar near the Capitol. By the time Mr. Trump discussed the matter directly in a news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon, weeks of speculation about his potential peril had burst into the open.Republicans, eager to portray Democrats as out to destroy Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, piled on criticism of Ms. Tlaib \u2014 some of it racially tinged. (Ms. Tlaib, who is Palestinian-American, is one of the first Muslims in Congress. The Christian Broadcasting Network referred to her as a \u201cfoul-mouthed Islamic congresswoman.\u201d) Democratic leaders, who view discussion of impeachment as politically dangerous and premature, offered worried words meant to tamp down speculation about their intentions.[President Trump threatened to keep the federal government partly closed for \u201cmonths or even years.\u201d]Perhaps out of a belief that an impeachment fight would help him politically \u2014 as it did President Bill Clinton in the 1990s \u2014 or outright fear that newly empowered Democrats actually might threaten his presidency, Mr. Trump dived into the conversation head first.Senior aides to Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats in the room disputed that characterization. The president had indeed invoked Ms. Tlaib and other House Democrats who want to impeach him, they said, but Ms. Pelosi tried to shift the meeting back to its intended topic and did not offer the president reassurances.Regardless, Mr. Trump\u2019s frank embrace of the issue was another astonishing development: a president of the United States talking openly about his potential impeachment at a White House news conference.Ms. Pelosi and senior Democrats said they were determined not to take the bait for now and risk generating a backlash from Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, who would most likely see impeachment as the overreaction of out-of-control Democrats. But the words of Ms. Tlaib, who stood by her comments on Friday, made evident the pressure already mounting from the left, where public opinion polls suggest a majority of liberals want the president removed from office.\u201cPeople love you and you win,\u201d Ms. Tlaib told the crowd Thursday night. \u201cAnd when your son looks at you and says: \u2018Momma, look, you won. Bullies don\u2019t win.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Baby, they don\u2019t.\u2019 Because we\u2019re going to go in there, and we\u2019re going to impeach the motherfucker.\u201dShe made no apologies for the remark on Friday, proclaiming that \u201cI will always speak truth to power\u201d and fashioning her own hashtag, #unapologeticallyme. She told a Detroit television station that \u201cit\u2019s probably exactly how my grandmother, if she was alive, would say it.\u201dMs. Pelosi defended Ms. Tlaib on Friday at a town hall hosted by MSNBC at the speaker\u2019s alma mater in Washington, Trinity University. \u201cI\u2019m not in the censorship business,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.The Constitution grants the House the power to impeach executive branch officials for \u201ctreason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d but what constitutes such crimes has traditionally been defined by the majority party of the House. A vote to impeach takes a simple majority in the House, but a two-thirds vote is needed in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.Mr. Nadler, Ms. Pelosi and other party elders believe Mr. Trump is threatening the country\u2019s democratic institutions. Privately, many harbor suspicions that he obstructed justice, collaborated with the Russians in 2016 or both. But they also argue that an impeachment that does not have a reasonable shot of winning a conviction in the Senate will backfire and strengthen Mr. Trump in the 2020 campaign. In the meantime, they are planning to open multiple investigations into accusations of wrongdoing around the president, his campaign and his administration.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn\u2019t avoid impeachment for a political reason,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just have to see how it comes.\u201dRepublicans ignored the distinction.\u201cIs this the behavior that we are going to find with this new majority party in Congress?\u201d Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, asked at a news conference. He repeatedly singled out Ms. Pelosi, asking why she had not censured Ms. Tlaib.Mr. Trump was similarly critical of Ms. Tlaib.\u201cI thought her comments were disgraceful,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the news conference. \u201cI think she dishonored herself, and I think she dishonored her family.\u201d He added that her comments were \u201cdisrespectful to the United States of America.\u201dMs. Tlaib is far from alone among House Democrats. Representatives Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas formally introduced an article of impeachment on Thursday, charging that Mr. Trump had obstructed justice in firing James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Others are expected to follow.\u201cI continue to believe that obstruction of justice is the clearest, simplest and most provable high crime and misdemeanor committed by Donald J. Trump,\u201d Mr. Sherman said in a statement. \u201cI hope that the articles of impeachment are the subject of hearings before the Judiciary Committee early in 2019.\u201dMany of Ms. Tlaib\u2019s new colleagues expressed sympathy for her sentiments, even as they said the House should proceed differently.\u201cDonald Trump is going to be impeached whether it is by the ballot box or Congress,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cIt will just be a matter of which one comes first.\u201dBut, Mr. Swalwell added, Democrats need to avoid making \u201ca martyr\u201d out of Mr. Trump by affording him \u201ca fairer investigation than he deserves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "El Chapo Trial Suggests Trump\u2019s Wall Would Do Little to Stop Drug Smuggling", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of the drugs were hidden in passenger cars, concealed in trucks in cans of jalape\u00f1os or stashed in tanker trains with ordinary loads of cooking oil. Others were sent beneath the border in sophisticated tunnels.The 10 weeks of testimony at the trial of Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the drug lord known as El Chapo who was convicted on drug conspiracy charges on Tuesday, revealed that his innovative smuggling network typically went through legal checkpoints \u2014 not isolated stretches of the border where a wall might be an obstacle.President Trump\u2019s plan to build a wall along the southwestern border was not mentioned at the trial, but it lurked in the background of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s prosecution, a watershed moment in America\u2019s war on drugs.The trial, in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, was the first time that American federal prosecutors publicly revealed the inner workings of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa drug cartel, offering the most extensive details yet on the organization\u2019s structure, financing and distribution methods. In doing so, prosecutors relied on firsthand experts: a long list of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s own former underlings and allies.Though Mr. Trump has primarily pitched his border wall as a way to stop illegal immigration, he has recently suggested that it would also help allay the cross-border drug trade.\u201cIf we build a powerful and fully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border, the crime rate and drug problem in our country would be quickly and greatly reduced,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cSome say it could be cut in half.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe can stop heroin.\u201dBut the Guzm\u00e1n trial indicated that stopping the flow of drugs into the United States might be more complicated than that. Through the testimony of people who worked with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, prosecutors showed that his cartel for decades was endlessly creative, constantly inventing new methods to circumvent detection.\u201cWhat you\u2019re hearing in this trial is what front-line border workers observe throughout,\u201d said Doris Meissner, who served as the commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000 and now works at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.Ms. Meissner added, \u201cThe idea that people are walking drugs across the border as though they are illegal immigrants who would then be stopped by a wall across the border, that is not the pattern.\u201dBut some supporters of the wall have noted that a physical obstacle along the border is needed as a safeguard to ensure the frontier is sealed as much as possible.\u201cIt\u2019s about checking all the boxes: sea, land, air, port of entry and the space between the port of entries,\u201d said James Carafano, vice president for foreign policy and national security at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re not implementing an effective border strategy. An effective strategy means that you create the most barriers possible. You don\u2019t just close off one so they have 99 others.\u201dBut Mr. Guzm\u00e1n also used more dramatic and unusual tactics to transport drugs.At one point, testimony at the trial showed, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n sent tons of cocaine across the border in cans of jalape\u00f1os marked with the label La Comadre chiles. The cans were stacked on pallets in the backs of commercial tractor-trailers, which simply drove through official border entry points. To protect his product from being found, witnesses said, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n often placed the cans filled with cocaine in the middle of the pallets, surrounded by cans with actual chiles.Proponents of the wall have said such a structure could help improve inspections at the border.\u201cOne of the big problems is we have too many people standing on guard between and at points of entry and not enough people doing inspections, analysis and intelligence, so the wall will certainly channel the flow into areas you can manage, analyze and search more thoroughly,\u201d said John P. Walters, the former director for drug control policy for President George W. Bush and the chief operating officer for the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cThe wall itself does not stop all flow, but the wall becomes a way to stop all flow.\u201dHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying a wall will do everything, but what I\u2019m saying is: How do you try to stop it without a wall?\u201dBut Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s methods went beyond regular border crossings. One witness at the trial, Tirso Mart\u00ednez Sanchez, told jurors in December that he personally helped persuade Mr. Guzm\u00e1n to use commercial tanker trains that traveled on cross-border rail lines.According to Mr. Mart\u00ednez, cartel operatives first created front companies that appeared to be selling legal items like cooking oil. After shipping a few real loads of oil from Mexico to various American cities to make it seem as if the company was legitimate, Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s workers then packed cocaine into secret compartments in the tankers and sent them over the border.In the United States, other operatives received the trains at a network of secret warehouses, which, Mr. Mart\u00ednez said, were located mostly on rail spurs so that the trains could be driven directly into them from major cargo rail lines.Sea routes were another, if a bit less frequent, means of moving drugs into the United States. This month, for instance, witnesses testified that Mr. Guzm\u00e1n once sent a load of marijuana by boat from Mexico north on the Pacific Ocean to the coast near San Diego. The drugs were meant to be unloaded offshore by smaller boats. The shipment never reached San Diego, and three of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s workers were arrested.The kingpin also sent bulk shipments of cash through normal border checkpoints in the opposite direction \u2014 from the United States to Mexico. As early as 1989, in fact, one of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s brothers, Arturo Guzm\u00e1n Loera, was briefly detained at the Douglas, Ariz., port of entry after border agents there found more than $1 million packed into the tailgate and side panels of his black Ford Bronco.Mr. Carafano said he understood that drug smugglers would always try to find new methods, and that the wall would simply be \u201cpart of the mix.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt is part of the tool, but you have to do all three simultaneously: at the port of entry, on the border and you have to do it at sea, so you\u2019re creating just a series of bad options for the smugglers.\u201dBut then there\u2019s the matter of El Chapo\u2019s most famous smuggling method: tunnels.The entrance on the Mexican side, Mr. Zambada said, was hidden under a pool table that could be raised off the ground by hydraulic lifts. The lifts were activated by turning what appeared to be an ordinary garden hose valve in the yard outside.And the tunnel exit in the warehouse in Arizona?Remarkably, Mr. Zambada said, it was located only blocks from a local office of Customs and Border Protection.Emily Palmer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new legislative session kicked off on Wednesday, with Democrats in control of the Legislature and the governor\u2019s office. But big fights still await.ALBANY \u2014 The words \u201cAlbany\u201d and \u201clively\u201d are not often used together, but on Wednesday, the first day of the year\u2019s legislative session, the halls of the New York State Capitol were roaring.Legislators shouted greetings down the ornate Romanesque hallways. Aides jogged between offices. Lobbyists swarmed the elevators and rifled for business cards.\u201cNot that long ago, women weren\u2019t even allowed to walk on the floor of these chambers,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is nothing to stop us, and there is so much more that we have to accomplish,\u201d she said.While that may be true on some bills \u2014 the ones above are expected to sail through \u2014 on others, fissures are already showing. And for the most part, the disagreements are within the Democratic Party: between urban legislators and those from outside cities, moderates and progressives.In other words, the liveliness of the first day is sure to continue in the months ahead, but the fate of the optimism remains to be seen.Here are five of the most pressing and vexing questions that loom in Albany:The subways need money. The subways have no money. On that much, lawmakers agree. But when it comes to how to get that money, things get complicated fast.The most high-profile suggestion is congestion pricing, which would charge drivers who enter parts of Manhattan during the busiest times of day. Mr. Cuomo has declared it the \u201conly realistic option\u201d for saving the subway, and groups from unions to real estate developers have backed it. But the plan foundered last year after lawmakers outside Manhattan said it would burden constituents in transit-starved areas who had no choice but to drive.Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, said he had seen no indication that revenue would go toward urgent repairs, rather than flashier projects like the new Second Avenue subway stations.\u201cIf I had to make a list of priorities, adding a few subway stations to the richest neighborhood in the country wouldn\u2019t have been my top,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe have to remember that we have five boroughs, not just Manhattan.\u201dNew York\u2019s rent stabilization laws expire in June, and activists and lobbyists are already arming for what they say will be one of the year\u2019s biggest battles.Tenants\u2019 rights advocates say this is their chance to end loopholes that help landlords remove apartments from rent stabilization. Bills that lawmakers may tackle relate to vacancy decontrol, which lets landlords deregulate certain apartments when they become empty; preferential rent rates, which can disguise illegally inflated rent; and the use of major capital improvements to allow landlords to raise rents after big renovations.But the real estate industry has long been a source of political donations, funneling money to Mr. Cuomo and the long-reigning Senate Republicans. This year, as the political winds shifted, developers began giving to the Senate Democrats, and they also fueled the wins by Mr. Cuomo and the new state attorney general, Letitia James.Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, an advocacy group, said he was optimistic but not na\u00efve about winning stronger rent laws.\u201cWe obviously can\u2019t take anything for granted just because we have a Democratic majority,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work very hard for this, because we have powerful enemies and they have a lot of money.\u201dThe trouble started in December when Mr. Cuomo called a 1993 lawsuit, which successfully argued that the state had underfunded public schools, a ghost of the past. Six newly elected senators hit back to say the state still owed districts money. \u201cAnd if the governor tries to deny me that, then he\u2019s got a fight on his hands,\u201d Senator Robert Jackson, who was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in an interview.Lawmakers, advocacy groups and Mr. Cuomo have continued to trade barbs on the topic, with the governor comparing his critics to people who believe Earth is flat.New York State United Teachers, the state\u2019s powerful teachers union, has also called for more funding. It is still pushing to increase oversight of charter schools and decouple teacher evaluations from test scores \u2014 a measure that both chambers actually agreed on last year, but that ultimately died amid end-of-session horse-trading.A bill to create a Medicare for all-styled system for New York would be one of the most expensive items the Legislature could take up this year. It has passed the Assembly several times, and Senate Democrats have pledged their support, too. The idea has high-profile backers including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson. So it should fly through, right?Not exactly.Mr. Cuomo \u2014 a fiscal moderate \u2014 may also not run to sign such a bill. He has called single-payer \u201cconceptually\u201d the right idea but said it would be better tied to action on the federal level, citing the huge upfront cost to the state.\u201cI have a lot of great ideas of Christmas gifts that I want to get, but then I\u2019m going to have to deal with the reality of the cost and the budget,\u201d he said in a radio interview.If a promise to clean up Albany is a prerequisite for any candidate\u2019s stump speech, a failure to do it seems the norm once they are elected.Mr. Heastie has promised to address the issue somehow this year, though he\u2019s been short on details.Then there are the escalating threats over who will investigate the other more. Several Democratic legislators have promised to make the Legislature a more robust investigative body, open to probes of the governor\u2019s office. Mr. Cuomo, in turn, threatened to investigate them right back, in what he called \u201can investigations battle.\u201d\u201cEvery grant that the Legislature does goes through my government, so I can investigate every one of those,\u201d he said in a radio interview.The Legislature\u2019s track record on actually moving oversight bills does not inspire confidence. Last session, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to clean up the state\u2019s contracting process and create a \u201cdatabase of deals\u201d to track state subsidies. The Assembly refused to take it up. Still, some reformers are optimistic that the wave of energetic progressives will finally force lawmakers to act. Or as Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a newly elected Democrat from the Bronx who will lead the chamber\u2019s ethics committee, put it: \u201cLet me get to work!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Female Economists Push Their Field Toward a #MeToo Reckoning", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 The economics profession is facing a mounting crisis of sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying that women in the field say has pushed many of them to the sidelines \u2014 or out of the field entirely.Those issues took center stage at the American Economic Association\u2019s annual meeting, the largest gathering of the profession, last weekend in Atlanta. Spurred by substantiated allegations of harassment against one of the most prominent young economists in the country, top women in the field shared stories of their own struggles with discrimination. Graduate students and junior professors demanded immediate steps by the A.E.A. to help victims of harassment and discipline economists who violate the group\u2019s newly adopted code of conduct.Leading male economists offered an unprecedented acknowledgment of harassment and discrimination in the field. \u201cEconomics certainly has a problem,\u201d Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who took over as A.E.A. president this year, said during a panel discussion. The profession has, \u201cunfortunately, a reputation for hostility toward women and minorities,\u201d he said.Janet L. Yellen, who was the first chairwoman of the Fed and will head the A.E.A. next year, said that addressing the issue \u201cshould be the highest priority\u201d for economists in the years to come.During a panel discussion on gender issues, Ms. Yellen was one of several women who shared stories of discrimination and bullying. Her fellow panelists described a list of \u201cknown\u201d male predators in academic departments who have never been punished for behavior that included repeatedly making unwanted sexual advances toward junior colleagues.One of the panelists, Susan Athey, a Stanford economist, said she had bought \u201ckhakis and loafers\u201d to fit in with the men in the lunchroom of her first economics department, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She did so even though the department was the \u201cmost supportive environment\u201d she has encountered in her career.\u201cI spent all my time hoping that no one would remember I was female,\u201d said Ms. Athey, a past winner of a prestigious award for young economists. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to remind people that I\u2019m a sexual being.\u201dCertain subfields, like finance, have a particularly poor record of advancing women. A branch of the American Finance Association presented survey results in Atlanta that show barely 10 percent of tenured finance professors, and 16 percent of tenure-track faculty, are women. In economics as a whole, women accounted for about 23 percent of tenured and tenure-track faculty in 2015.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to rely on whisper networks to protect us from abuse and inappropriate behavior,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have the power to discipline our supervisors, or even our peers. You do. Please, listen to us.\u201dSome of that frustration bubbled over in the A.E.A.\u2019s formal business meeting Friday evening, a usually dry affair in which members hear reports on the association\u2019s finances and similar matters.\u201cThere\u2019s just a ton of anger and resentment around how the profession has been,\u201d Elisabeth Perlman, 34, an economist with the Census Bureau, said at the meeting. She added that the profession must also address the misconduct that was allowed to go unchecked for decades.\u201cThe silence from the executive committee has really been deafening,\u201d Jennifer Doleac, a professor at Texas A&M, said at Friday\u2019s business meeting. \u201cA lot of the profession is really waiting to hear from you, and for some semblance of leadership about the direction of the profession and what will be tolerated and what won\u2019t be.\u201dOlivier Blanchard, the association\u2019s departing president, said for the first time Friday that the executive committee had asked Mr. Fryer to resign. He called that request \u201cthe best way out\u201d because the association had no formal procedure to remove an elected officer. The committee, Mr. Blanchard said, is now working to develop such rules.Some members of the executive committee wanted to go further and establish procedures to punish or expel members for violations of the code of conduct. There are currently no such penalties.Other members seemed more skeptical of that idea when it was raised in a closed-door session last Thursday, according to several people who were there. Mr. Blanchard cut off discussion, saying he was hungry and it was time for lunch, these people said. The committee will take up the issue again in April.Mr. Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, did not dispute that account. \u201cThe job of the person in charge of the meeting is to make sure that all issues on the agenda are taken up and discussed,\u201d he wrote in an email on Wednesday, adding a parenthetical: \u201cand yes, that people, including me, have time to eat.\u201dHe also said that he was \u201chappy\u201d that the profession was taking women\u2019s concerns seriously, and that \u201cI think the A.E.A. is playing a strong role\u201d on the issue.Lisa D. Cook, a Michigan State University economist who is one of the most prominent black women in the field, credited younger women with forcing the A.E.A. to move more quickly.\u201cI told them they have more power than they know,\u201d Ms. Cook said of graduate students and other young people pushing for change. \u201cThis is the possible beginnings of a sea change.\u201dMany male economists long dismissed claims of bias and discrimination, arguing that gender disparities must reflect differences in preference or ability. They pointed to theories that predict that, in the simplified world of economic models, discrimination on the basis of characteristics like gender and race would disappear because of competition.Shelly Lundberg, a University of California, Santa Barbara, economist who has long pushed the field to include more women, said that each study had faced \u201can unusual level of scrutiny and skepticism,\u201d but that taken together, they were hard to dismiss.\u201cThe realization that this is real, that there is bias, is starting to sink in,\u201d Ms. Lundberg said. \u201cI really think this may have been the breakthrough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bolsonaro vs. Maduro: The Next Clash in Latin America?", "Date": "2019-01-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBoth leaders threaten the region\u2019s hard-won democracy.Mr. Casta\u00f1eda was foreign affairs minister of Mexico from 2000 to 2003.In addition to his fraudulent election, Mr. Maduro has egregiously violated human rights, driven the Venezuelan economy into the ground, and generated a humanitarian crisis that has forced nearly three million of his countrymen into exile. With prices languishing for oil, Venezuela\u2019s only export, the country will sink even further into chaos.The political and personal characteristics of these two leaders, inaugurated just days apart, are a recipe for disaster.Though Mr. Maduro belongs to the hard left, and Mr. Bolsonaro to the extreme right, they share authoritarian similarities. The clash between these like-minded leaders is a conflict foretold. There are several hundred thousand Venezuelans across the border in Brazil and Colombia. Presidents Bolsonaro and Duque both detest Mr. Maduro. Both sympathize with President Trump, and he sympathizes with them. A pincer movement by the two countries\u2019 armies, with more or less discreet United States backing, is increasingly conceivable, particularly as the region drifts to the right.The great absence, perhaps for better than for worse, is Washington. It will almost certainly not play a role in any of these potential or already burning crises, except maybe by clumsily encouraging Colombia and Brazil to overthrow Mr. Maduro by force. But it surely will not lead the hemisphere away from these authoritarian temptations, nor toward greater collective responsibility. Given President Trump\u2019s penchant for making everything worse everywhere, this may not be a bad thing. But United States passivity implies one less counterweight in a region that needs as many as it can find.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Embargo on Cuba Failed. Let\u2019s Move On. ", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNo one, particularly ordinary Cubans, is benefiting from the 60-year feud.Opinion ColumnistHAVANA \u2014 It has been 60 years since Fidel Castro marched into Havana, so it\u2019s time for both Cuba and the United States to grow up. Let\u2019s let Cuba be a normal country again.Cuba is neither the demonic tyranny conjured by some conservatives nor the heroic worker paradise romanticized by some on the left. It\u2019s simply a tired little country, no threat to anyone, with impressive health care and education but a repressive police state and a dysfunctional economy.Driving in from the airport, I saw billboards denouncing the American economic embargo as the \u201clongest genocide in history.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous. But the embargo itself is also absurd and counterproductive, accomplishing nothing but hurting the Cuban people \u2014 whom we supposedly aim to help.After six decades, can\u2019t we move on? Let\u2019s drop the embargo but continue to push Havana on improving human rights, and on dropping support for other oppressive regimes, like those in Venezuela and Nicaragua.I\u2019m not a Cuba expert, and I don\u2019t know how this country will evolve. But Cuba has a new president, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, who is associated with experiments in opening up the economy. Fidel is gone and his brother Ra\u00fal is fading from the scene.In the 1960s, we were scared of Cuba. We feared that neighboring countries would tumble like dominoes into the Communist bloc, and the Soviet Union attempted to place on Cuba nuclear missiles that could have threatened America. But today even as those fears have dissipated, our policy has ossified.President Barack Obama took the necessary step of re-establishing diplomatic relations and easing the embargo, but President Trump reversed course and tightened things up again out of knee-jerk hostility to anything Cuban and anything Obaman.Cuba is changing, albeit too slowly. About one-third of its labor force is now in the private sector, and this is just about the only part of the economy that is thriving. I stayed in one of the growing number of Airbnbs in Havana, and people were friendly, even if governments are not: When I said I was from the United States, I inevitably got a big grin and a reference to a cousin in Miami or New York or Cleveland.Plus, extra credit goes to a country that so lovingly preserves old American cars. I rode in from the airport in a pink 1954 Cadillac.In another sign of flexibility, Cuba recently hammered out a deal with Major League Baseball that will allow Cuban players to travel legally to the U.S. and play on American teams.Consider the persistence of North Korea and Cuba, and there\u2019s an argument that sanctions and isolation preserve regimes rather than topple them. China teaches us not to be na\u00efve about economic engagement toppling dictators, but on balance tourists and investors would be more of a force for change than a seventh decade of embargo.Moreover, trade, tourism, travel and investment empower a business community and an independent middle class. These are tools to destabilize a police state and help ordinary Cubans, but we curtail them. America blames the Castros for impoverishing the Cuban people, but we\u2019ve participated in that impoverishment as well.It is revising its Constitution, and my hope is that over time \u2014 despite ideologues in both Havana and the United States \u2014 relations will continue to develop. Some American seniors who now winter in Florida could become snowbirds in Cuba instead, relying on its health care, low prices, great beaches and cheap labor. You can hire a home health care aide for a month in Havana for the cost of one for a day in Florida.China\u2019s economic boom began in the early 1980s partly with factories financed by Chinese overseas, and after the American embargo ends, Cuba will have similar opportunities to forge mutually beneficial business partnerships with Cubans overseas.That would benefit both sides. For 60 years we\u2019ve been feuding, like the Hatfields and the McCoys, in a conflict whose origins most Americans don\u2019t even remember clearly.So come on. We should all be bored by a lifetime of mutual recriminations and antagonisms. Let\u2019s put aside the ideology, end the embargo, tone down the propaganda and raise a mojito together.I propose a toast to a new beginning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Better Than the Powerball", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor New Yorkers looking for an affordable home, the odds of winning a housing lottery are 1 in 592.Winning a spot in one of New York City\u2019s affordable housing lotteries might seem completely out of reach, the stuff of urban legend.But every day across the five boroughs, tens of thousands of New Yorkers play the odds, and a lucky few check their inboxes to discover they have won an affordable new home. For some, the welcome news may have come just months after they first applied, while for others, it may have taken years. \u201cI was like, \u2018Are you being serious?\u2019 For a minute I thought it was a joke,\u201d said Josh Boscarino, 28, a former actor, after hearing that he had won a large rent-stabilized studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with an oversized window facing the waterfront, months after submitting his first application.Winners include older adults who rely on Social Security as their sole income and 30-something singles with graduate degrees earning six figures. The vast majority of the units awarded are rent-stabilized apartments that range in price from a few hundred dollars a month to nearly market-rate amounts, although the lotteries also offer some below-market-rate condominiums and cooperatives, and even a few coveted single-family houses.The housing stock available is built and owned by private developers who typically receive subsidies, tax abatements or zoning benefits in exchange for creating below-market-rate units. The units can be found in buildings that are entirely affordable housing, as well as those that include a mix of affordable and market-rate apartments, depending on the type of subsidy the developer received.Applicants chosen in the agency\u2019s random drawings are screened by the developers, who verify income and interview candidates (a process that is separate from the city\u2019s public housing, which is owned and operated by the New York City Housing Authority).But the increase in the number of units available has been accompanied by a surge in the number of people applying. In 2018, there were more than 4.6 million applicants, with the odds of winning just 1 in 592. In 2012, there were fewer units available, but the odds were far better, at 1 in 80; in 2011, they were 1 in 63.Despite those daunting statistics, chances of winning are better than it may seem. That is because many of those who apply are disqualified, either because their earnings exceed or are below the requirements for a specific development, or because they fail to provide the necessary paperwork, including work history and tax records.Those who have won housing lotteries are a diverse group, from a variety of socioeconomic, racial and geographic backgrounds. Despite their differences, however, they tend to have something in common: Many have faced challenging life events, and nearly all insist that the key to winning the lottery is determination. \u201cYou have to know how to hustle and be on it,\u201d said Erika Lindsey, an urban planner who spent nearly a decade applying to lotteries before winning a one-bedroom in Brooklyn, near Barclays Center. \u201cMy main advice is to be persistent.\u201dLizzie Villas Boas suffers from hip dysplasia and has had 25 surgeries and four hip replacements. \u201cI\u2019ve had to learn to respect my pain,\u201d said Ms. Villas Boas, 57, who is from Brazil. \u201cI cannot change my life, and so I always try and find the happiness.\u201dHer first purchase for her new home reflects that. In October, when she moved into her new one-bedroom in the South Bronx, Ms. Villas Boas went to Target to fill her empty refrigerator. As she wandered the aisles, her eyes alighted on a wooden sign that read, \u201cGive Thanks Always.\u201dMs. Villas Boas, who gets around on a scooter, depends on Supplemental Security Income, and she couldn\u2019t afford what amounted to a luxury, but she splurged on it anyway. \u201cI just had to have it,\u201d she said of the sign, which hangs over her kitchen sink. It is one of her few furnishings: The television set in her living room sits on a stack of empty moving boxes, and another pile of boxes serves as a coffee table.The mother of two adult sons, Ms. Villas Boas is twice divorced; her second husband, she said, had been abusive since they married in 2007. In 2015, a nurse assisting her helped her leave her husband and get a place in a shelter for domestic abuse victims in the East Village. After spending nearly three years there and applying to several housing lotteries, she finally won a place of her own.\u201cThis apartment is a physical space where I can exercise my love with my family,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to eventually buy a table, maybe even a recliner, but I\u2019m not in a hurry. For now, I have all I need.\u201dIn 2015, Josh Boscarino was renting a room in a four-bedroom apartment in Hamilton Heights, in Manhattan, trying to make it as an actor while working at the Apple store on Fifth Avenue. \u201cI was just fed up,\u201d said Mr. Boscarino, 28. \u201cI had three roommates, but it was a constant revolving door of people.\u201d In desperation, he began searching for \u201caffordable housing\u201d and \u201cNYC\u201d online, and stumbled onto a link to the city\u2019s housing lotteries. \u201cI had heard about the lottery before,\u201d he said, but dismissed the idea. \u201cI mean, nobody wins the lottery. But I wasn\u2019t making a lot of money and there just weren\u2019t a lot of other options.\u201dAfter the interview, he heard nothing for five months. Then, in August of 2016, less than a year after he first applied, he found out he had been accepted into the building. \u201cThere\u2019s this misconception that I would never qualify for the lottery, that I make too much money,\u201d said Mr. Boscarino, who has given up acting and now works as a finance associate for a theater merchandising company. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true. The lottery is for everyone \u2014 well, not rich people obviously \u2014 and anyone who is considering it should apply.\u201dElsie Rivera had to do some sleuthing to win her apartment at Essex Crossing, a new 1.9-million-square-foot project on the Lower East Side that includes retail and office space, restaurants and more than 1,000 units of housing. About half the apartments there are designated as permanently affordable, some of them set aside for people who lived in the neighborhood when it was cleared for redevelopment in the late 1960s. But in order to qualify, applicants must show documentation proving their prior residency.\u201cI was there as a child,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the building burned down and we had to move away.\u201d After living in Brooklyn, she returned to the neighborhood, moving to a place on Montgomery Street, near her old home. One day, her childhood friend Tito Delgado, a community activist, handed her an application for Essex Crossing and urged her to apply.But how would she prove she had once lived on Suffolk Street? Ms. Rivera had an idea. \u201cI went to my old school, P.S. 42, and asked them if they had anything with my name and address on it. And, thank God, they did! They were able to prove it.\u201dNow she lives in a brand-new one-bedroom with stainless-steel appliances and a view of Delancey Street. \u201cIt is so beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cMy neighbor down the hall used to know my mom. It\u2019s beautiful that they kept us together.\u201dErika Lindsey is nothing if not persistent. Ms. Lindsey, 36, spent eight years applying to housing lotteries before she won her dream home.In 2010, she was working as a senior policy adviser and urban planner for the city and living in a fourth-floor walk-up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. \u201cMy neighbors in Bed-Stuy were leaving for East New York because the rent was going up,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it was stressful always having to sign a new lease.\u201d The rents on apartments like Ms. Lindsey\u2019s can be nearly as expensive as those found on the open market, if not more so. But as the city sees it, having a mix of incomes helps create a more diverse building, and higher-income units also help landlords offset the cost of providing apartments to lower-income tenants. Ms. Lindsey concedes that her apartment isn\u2019t exactly \u201caffordable,\u201d and that she pays more now than she did in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where her rent was $1,450 a month. But her new building has more amenities \u2014 and it isn\u2019t a walk-up.\u201cI did the math: I spent $200 a month on Lyfts, because I often had to take a car home at night, so I\u2019m saving on that,\u201d she said. And because you cannot be evicted based on income increases once you win a housing lottery, she added, \u201cI told myself that at some point, because it is rent-stabilized, the apartment will feel like a deal.\u201dFor Benito Gonzalez, winning the housing lottery was like, well, winning the lottery. \u201cI fell on my knees crying,\u201d he said. \u201cI was so happy that I was finally going to have a place to call my own. At my age, it is the greatest blessing I could receive.\u201dMr. Gonzalez, 68, who relocated from Puerto Rico in 1966, had been living for years with a girlfriend in the Bronx. But his name wasn\u2019t on the lease, and when she died he was evicted. He ended up in a homeless shelter, and then rented a room in the basement of his sister\u2019s house in Queens. \u201cIt was like living in a box,\u201d said Mr. Gonzalez, who depends on Supplemental Security Income. \u201cThere were only small windows, and you couldn\u2019t see the street, and it was cold like crazy.\u201d In 2009, he began applying to every housing lottery for which he qualified. Last year, he finally received notice that he had been approved for a building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. But when he went to the developer\u2019s office for his interview, he saw a rendering of a building he preferred, on Channel Drive in Far Rockaway, Queens. \u201cSo what did I do?\u201d he said. \u201cI told the person interviewing me, \u2018Listen, I don\u2019t want this building. I want that building.\u2019\u201dAnd Mr. Gonzalez got his wish. In November, he signed a lease on a one-bedroom in the new tower, with unimpeded views of the water and the Manhattan skyline. \u201cI was coming out here on the train, and tears were coming out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in a lot of bad neighborhoods, and this place, it is so quiet.\u201dStill, his new home didn\u2019t have everything he wanted. \u201cThey gave me the apartment, but it was empty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me I don\u2019t qualify for the furnished apartments, because they are reserved for people who are homeless.\u201d He has applied to the city\u2019s Human Resources Administration for help buying furniture. But for now, he sleeps on a bed from his sister\u2019s house, and there is a single table in his otherwise empty living room. Even so, he said, \u201cNot since I was young have I had an apartment of my own \u2014 this is a dream.\u201dFor Rachel Kambury, an editorial assistant at a publishing house, the best part of winning a housing lottery is being able to see her books. \u201cMost of these books have never been on a shelf,\u201d she said. \u201cMy lifelong dream was to have a personal library.\u201dMs. Kambury, 27, went through several years of real estate hell before moving into her light-filled one-bedroom in Harlem. After coming to New York for college from her native Oregon, she lived in a ground-floor apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn. But the construction was shoddy, with numerous leaks, she said, and the landlord was unresponsive, so four years later, in 2014, she moved to East Harlem.She loved the neighborhood and her apartment, but when she lost her job she had to leave. \u201cI was left with no options,\u201d she said, \u201cso I found the first place I could afford\u201d \u2014 a room in Central Harlem, advertised without photos on Craigslist, for $750 a month.The kitchen consisted of only a mini-fridge; Ms. Kambury eventually added a toaster oven and microwave. There was a shared bathroom down the hall that was infested with cockroaches. She spent most of her time sitting on the bed in her room, a former studio apartment that had been cut in half twice, and now measured 8 by 16 feet. \u201cIt was basically a brick box with no air-conditioning, and because I couldn\u2019t feed myself properly without a kitchen, any extra money went to pay my phone bill and eat takeout.\u201dNevertheless, she said, \u201cI\u2019m stubborn. I was determined to find a way to make it work, even if it meant living in a cockroach-infested firetrap.\u201dIn 2016, a friend told her about the housing lottery, so she applied. But it wasn\u2019t until last summer that she heard she had made it to the interview stage for a building on West 114th Street.That was two weeks after her stepmother, who raised her, had passed away, and several months after her grandfather died. For a devastated Ms. Kambury, it was a welcome respite from a string of bad news.\u201cWhen I first got the email I was in such a bad place that it washed over me, and I didn\u2019t even register it,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI told myself to come back in two days and look again. When I did, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201dIn September, Ms. Kambury was approved for a one-bedroom apartment. \u201cI could afford the security deposit because my stepmom and grandfather had left me money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was bittersweet that the people who would have reveled in this success most weren\u2019t there to see it.\u201dNatia Mosahvili began applying to various housing lotteries in 2008, but for years she heard nothing. Then out of the blue, in 2017, Ms. Mosahvili received a letter forwarded from an old address. It informed her that she had been awarded an interview for a one-bedroom apartment on West 28th Street in Chelsea.\u201cIt had my old income, my old information; I updated all my information, but they told me I was overqualified,\u201d said Ms. Mosahvili, 44, a real estate broker and single mother who is originally from the Republic of Georgia. At the time, she was living with her teenage son in a cramped alcove studio on York Avenue, on the Upper East Side, and was desperate for more space.Ms. Mosahvili appealed the decision, arguing that much of her income was in commissions that could not be counted upon, and that not only was she a single mother, but she was also caring for her own mother, who suffered from Parkinson\u2019s. She also began applying to new lotteries.In June 2017, she received an official rejection letter. Two weeks later, she got an email saying that she had been chosen to interview for another building, on East 60th Street. The building was within her income bracket of $51,000 to $60,000, and because of its location, she was eligible for the community inclusion bonus. \u201cI thought it was a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cI had already been rejected once. I didn\u2019t bother replying. But then I got a letter in the mail with all my updated information, and thought, \u2018Maybe this is for real.\u2019\u201dBy the time Ms. Mosahvili realized she should take the notice seriously, she had only a few days left to submit an application. But she had already compiled her financial documents for the one-bedroom in Chelsea, so she was able to apply quickly.Ms. Mosahvili and her son moved into a roomy two-bedroom in the building that December \u2014 not long after receiving a notice that she had been chosen to interview for a third project, on West 52nd Street. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cFor 10 years I hear nothing, then I get three in row!\u201dDrew Pham and Molly Pearl needed a win. In 2013, Mr. Pham had finished his tour of duty in the Army, after serving in Afghanistan, and was trying to figure out what to do next. Ms. Pearl had been accepted to the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College. Neither was earning much money.The couple, who met as undergraduates at New York University, found an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, that they could afford if they had a roommate. But the heat, water and electricity in the building were unreliable, with frequent brownouts and no smoke detectors. \u201cIt was like 50 degrees half the time inside, and in the summer you couldn\u2019t run the A/C and microwave at the same time without blowing a fuse,\u201d said Mr. Pham, 31.Then Mr. Pham came down with what they thought was the flu. When it grew worse, Ms. Pearl took him to the emergency room, where he received a devastating diagnosis: He had leukemia.Mr. Pham, who was 26 at the time, began chemotherapy and received a bone-marrow transplant. It soon became obvious that because he now had a compromised immune system, they couldn\u2019t stay in the apartment.The couple managed to find an apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, after a prolonged search. But the rent was $2,200 a month, far more than they could afford on an income that consisted of disability pay from the Department of Veterans Affairs and Social Security benefits. \u201cWe had to take it,\u201d said Ms. Pearl, 30, who now works as an adviser to student veterans at Baruch College. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to apply to every single housing lottery that we are eligible for.\u2019\u201d They quickly got a call about a building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and another about one in Midtown Manhattan. But their income was too low for those apartments, and they were rejected. Eventually they were notified that they had been accepted into a renovated three-unit building on St. Marks Place in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn.While he is grateful for the housing lottery, he said, \u201cFor the vast majority of us in the millennial age bracket, there\u2019s no expectation that we will get that basic human right that we all deserve \u2014 a place to live.\u201d Ms. Pearl added: \u201cIt is dystopian, if you think about it, that the housing lottery even has to exist.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Senate Intelligence Committee Subpoenas Trump Attorney Michael Cohen", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena to compel Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, to appear before the panel next month to formally correct false testimony that he delivered last year about a proposed Trump Organization project in Moscow, one of his lawyers confirmed on Thursday.The subpoena was disclosed a day after Mr. Cohen pulled out of a public hearing scheduled for Feb. 7 before the House Oversight and Reform Committee, citing in a letter from his lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, verbal attacks by Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen\u2019s initial agreement to appear before the Oversight Committee had been voluntary, but he will have little choice in complying with the Senate request. Democrats in charge of the House Oversight and Intelligence committees have signaled in recent days that they may follow suit and issue subpoenas of their own, despite acknowledging Mr. Cohen\u2019s safety concerns.Unlike the Oversight session, Mr. Cohen\u2019s return to the Senate Intelligence Committee will almost certainly be behind closed doors. The panel has conducted a wide-ranging investigation of Russia\u2019s election interference campaign, and possible ties to the Trump campaign, for roughly two years now largely out of the public eye.Mr. Cohen has appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee twice before behind closed doors. In one case, the panel\u2019s leaders abruptly cut short the session after learning that he had shared with reporters a written opening statement he would deliver in private \u2014 testimony that would later prove to have contained falsehoods about a Trump Organization proposal to build a skyscraper in Moscow. He was later brought back for a closed-door session with Senate investigators, the details of which have remained secret. (Mr. Cohen also made false statements to the House Intelligence Committee, according to the special counsel.)Since his guilty plea in late November for lying to Congress, Senate Intelligence Committee officials have worked with Mr. Cohen and his lawyers to try to secure a return visit voluntarily so he can correct his false testimony and answer other questions pertinent to the panel\u2019s investigation. But those talks were unproductive, even as Mr. Cohen agreed to appear publicly before another congressional panel.The back and forth over Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony was the cause of continued sniping on Thursday between Mr. Trump and Mr. Davis. The president linked Mr. Cohen to his one-time Democratic political rival, Hillary Clinton, a pairing that seemed designed to excite his core voters.Mr. Trump has previously raised the notion that Mr. Cohen\u2019s father-in-law, Fima Shusterman, a Ukrainian immigrant, has ties to organized crime, but there has been no evidence to back up those claims. Mr. Shusterman pleaded guilty in 1993 of trying to evade federal income reporting requirements and was sentenced to probation.\u201cMr. Trump has immunity from indictments, so it\u2019s alleged or argued in the Justice Department,\u201d Mr. Davis said on Thursday in an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cBut Mr. Giuliani has committed a crime or at least should be indicted for that crime on the face of what he said on national television.\u201dMr. Giuliani responded on Thursday, saying that the president\u2019s remarks were \u201cmore than sufficient\u201d to answer those claims.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Henry Fok Ying-Tung: The Man Who Helped Build a Stronger China", "Date": null, "News": "China DailyAdvertisementShareThe late Hong Kong entrepreneur was honored for his role in China\u2019s reform and opening-up.Henry Fok Ying-tung\u2019s vision, innovative spirit and entrepreneurship started the trend of investment in the Chinese mainland drawn from Hong Kong and overseas. His various projects had a significant impact on economic development in Guangdong province and, by extension, the whole country.In addition to promoting economic reform, Fok devoted strenuous efforts to helping the nation gain membership of a number of international sporting organizations that were important to the rise of modern China.When he died in 2006 at age 83, he was vice-chairman of the 10th National Committee of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference, the country\u2019s top political advisory body.On Dec. 18, he was awarded the medal of \u201creform pioneer\u201d, along with other 99 compatriots, at a grand gathering to mark the country\u2019s 40 years of reform and opening-up in Beijing.Born in Hong Kong in 1923, Fok had humble beginnings, having lost his father at a young age. He started secondary education at Queen\u2019s College in the city, but left when Hong Kong fell to Japanese forces in December 1941.In partnership with 12 other businesspeople, his mother opened a grocery store, which Fok soon took over. After World War II, he made money at government auctions of unwanted military supplies. Having studied English, he could easily read the lists of items.He was also involved in the transportation sector. During the Korean War (1950-53), China was placed under an embargo by the British government in Hong Kong by way of a U.N. resolution, but Fok provided ships to transport essential supplies such as medicines and iron sheets to the mainland. It was his first contact with the mainland.The iron sheets were used to make oil storage tanks. At the time, there was a shortage of oil in China, so the tanks were needed to store fuel imported from the Soviet Union, according to Fok\u2019s second son, Ian Fok Chunwan, who assisted his father\u2019s business ventures on the mainland and is now CEO of the Henry Fok Ying Tung Group.\u201cMy father had an innovative brain and good insight. He did things people had never done before, and he was humble in seeking other people\u2019s advice,\u201d Ian Fok recalled.\u201cAfter the liberation of Hong Kong, many people began flooding into the city. As the population surged, there were not enough homes, and that prompted him to invest in the property sector. In the old days, buildings were sold in entire blocks. But, after consulting lawyers, he decided to sell flats (apartments) one by one, even before they were completed, to solve people\u2019s housing needs. That\u2019s the system of pre-completed flats we have today.\u201dHenry Fok always wanted China to be strong and was keen to assist the country\u2019s development. He seized his opportunity, becoming the first entrepreneur from Hong Kong to invest in the mainland. He decided to build a modern hotel because he realized that if China were to open its doors to foreign investors, the visitors would require comfortable accommodation.Construction of the Zhongshan Hot Spring Resort \uff0d the first hotel funded by overseas capital \uff0d in Zhongshan, Guangdong, in the west of the Pearl River Delta, began in early 1979.At the time, China was extremely poor. The government could only afford to hire workers and buy raw materials, while Henry Fok was responsible for raising capital, supervising construction work, hotel management and staff training. He also imported a host of equipment, furniture and hotel supplies.Aiming to have the hotel completed within a year, Henry Fok had the idea of handing out bonuses to accelerate construction. As a result, the hotel began operations on the scheduled date.Zhongshan was relatively isolated, so to connect the city with other parts of Guangdong he suggested improving the transportation infrastructure by widening roads and building bridges. However, the provincial government was reluctant to act, fearing future maintenance costs, so he proposed the use of road tolls and bank loans to finance the work.In 1982, Henry Fok spent a further HK$15 million (equal to about $2.6 million at the time) to build a golf course that met international standards near the resort. According to Ian Fok, the golf course was built to raise the hotel\u2019s status and attract a larger number of upmarket visitors.Ian Fok said his father encountered a great deal of resistance and red tape in his endeavors. \u201cBefore the resort was completed, many officials and cadres were concerned that it would fail, but Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was determined and told them, \u2018There\u2019s no way back.\u2019 Years later, when the luxury White Swan Hotel opened in Guangzhou, Guangdong, some cadres wept, fearing China was walking the path of capitalism,\u201d he said.In 1978, Henry Fok proposed building the five-star White Swan Hotel on the shore of a lake in Guangzhou, which had become an increasingly important city for both foreign businesspeople and tourists. The hotel was a joint venture between Henry Fok and the provincial tourism administration, and required combined investment of HK$200 million.He insisted that the hotel should be designed by Chinese architects and managed by Chinese employees. However, mainlanders lacked experience of running luxury hotels, so he brought the management team to Hong Kong and let them stay in five-star hotels to see how they were run.It took three years to build the White Swan Hotel, which opened in 1983. The tycoon insisted that local residents and people from outside Guangdong were allowed to enter the Zhongshan Hot Spring Resort and the White Swan Hotel, take photographs and admire the marvelous developments, despite concerns about crowd control.\u201cWe managed the White Swan Hotel for 15 years before handing it over to the provincial authorities. My father\u2019s main aim was to contribute to the economic development of Guangdong and the country as a whole, while the money we made was used to repay bank loans and interest,\u201d Ian Fok said.Before the People\u2019s Republic of China joined the U.N., Taiwan took part in international sports events under the name \u201cRepublic of China\u201d.After the civil war (1945-49) and the Korean War, many countries imposed sanctions on China in an attempt to stop the country joining international organizations. Henry Fok tirelessly lobbied international supporters to break the impasse, but many Chinese sports officials were wary of initiating contacts with organizations overseas.In 1974, Henry Fok invited the president and secretary-general of FIFA \uff0d world soccer\u2019s governing body \uff0d to visit Beijing. However, no Chinese officials met with the guests, who were entertained by Henry Fok and his eldest son, Timothy.During his time as president of the Hong Kong Football Association from 1970 to 1997, Henry Fok worked to help China join the Asian Football Confederation. The country joined FIFA in 1975. Later, in 1979, he was delighted that his years of lobbying and hard work had paid off when the International Olympic Committee approved the entry of the Chinese Olympic Committee after 30 years in the international wilderness.Badminton is a popular sport in China and it has always been one of the country\u2019s strong suits. However, years ago, the International Badminton Federation was dominated by the United Kingdom, which was anti-China and rebuffed the country\u2019s membership application.In response, 19 Asian and African countries formed a new organization \uff0d the World Badminton Federation \uff0d in Hong Kong in 1978 and broke away from the IBF.Following negotiations, the two sides signed a merger agreement in May 1981, which allowed China to join the IBF. The organization was later renamed the Badminton World Federation, and Henry Fok was appointed honorary president in recognition of his huge contribution to the sport.Joseph LiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post\u2019s\u00a0creation."}

But with Democrats needing to define themselves in what will likely be a crowded field, the most liberal candidates are making an issue of wealth even though some of these billionaires have liberal policy views themselves.\u201cI believe in the grass roots, just as Senator Warren does,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have pushed for is the broadest possible democracy, power to the people, at all times. What we\u2019re saying is \u2014 what counts in this is the voice of the American people.\u201dMs. Warren has moved out front quickly to use wealth as a cudgel against potential opponents and try to establish herself early with voters as a vanguard of middle-class and working-class concerns \u2014 a kind of \u201cpeople-not-the-powerful\u201d message that Democrats like Al Gore tried in the past. If they run, liberals like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke are likely to advance similar arguments as well.Anti-billionaire populism is convenient for both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Neither has the financial wherewithal to fund their own campaign, and both have well-developed lists of online donors. With ideological leftists ascendant in the party \u2014 like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her call for much higher taxes on the wealthy \u2014 their attacks on billionaires may appeal particularly to liberal millennials and middle-class workers in early caucus and primary states.\u201cIf you look at the entire period since the financial crisis, the resentment of corporations \u2014 and particularly how they failed to work for their own companies and their own workers \u2014 that resentment is strong,\u201d said Stan Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cPeople really do believe they\u2019ve been buying influence. They think there\u2019s a nexus of C.E.O.s, corporations, big business and politicians that\u2019s corrupt.\u201dMs. Warren repeated her criticism of self-funded campaigns last Saturday in Iowa, on her first campaign swing to the early caucus state. \u201cNone of us want super PACs to help us and none of us believe the billionaires should be able to self-finance,\u201d she told a crowd in Des Moines.Rob Hogg, a state senator and 2016 Democratic convention delegate, said the message could resonate with some Iowa voters. \u201cYou have the reaction from activists in both political parties that we\u2019re not sure we want this campaign to be bought,\u201d Mr. Hogg said.In South Carolina, an early primary state, a candidate\u2019s extreme wealth could be a turnoff to a state party membership that skews poorer than Democrats in the rest of the country, said Gibbs Knotts, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston. Many voters are fed up with the concentration of political power among the wealthy, he said.\u201cFor Democrats, given the unique character of the South Carolina Democratic electorate, I think that would be something that could be hard to overcome,\u201d said Mr. Knotts, who is writing a book about the South Carolina primary.Self-funding can cut both ways. Not only do candidates with vast resources have the ability to weather campaign setbacks that can dry up donations, they also can argue that they are not beholden to unpopular corporate interests.Laura Belin, a close Iowa caucus observer, said she doesn\u2019t think being a billionaire self-funder is necessarily a deal-breaker.\u201cI don\u2019t think of Iowans as automatically rejecting a billionaire candidate,\u201d said Ms. Belin, an author on the Bleeding Heartland blog. \u201cI feel like there are bigger issues for people that are more like litmus test issues, like Medicare for All.\u201dRather than accepting contributions from special-interest PACs whose backers fuel disgust, Mr. Bloomberg can point out that he made all the money himself \u2014 via his company that pioneered providing computerized data to investors \u2014 and owes nothing to anyone.\u201cHe\u2019s never taken a dime of any special interest money,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cThat fact has allowed him to act independently, totally on the merits, without ever having to wonder what donors or other special interests expect or want from him. Mike is somebody who did not grow up with privilege. He made all of his money on his own.\u201dMatt Mackowiak, an Austin-based Republican strategist, pointed to another advantage for Mr. Bloomberg.While casting billionaires like Mr. Bloomberg as plutocrats may resonate among some Democrats, longtime party advisers point out that the strategy is tricky and that, by embracing it, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are ignoring historical reality: Several of the party\u2019s wealthiest leaders have been among its most progressive.\u201cIf you look at the last century, the people who did the most, in many ways, to advance progressive politics in the country \u2014 F.D.R. and the Kennedys \u2014 all came from great wealth,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a longtime adviser to Democratic candidates.Even so, Mr. Shrum, who teaches at the University of Southern California, said that almost any viable Democrat running this year will talk in some way about having a president who is there to serve the people, not the powerful, the theme that Mr. Shrum coined for use in Mr. Gore\u2019s 2000 campaign.Susan E. Howell, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of New Orleans, said that even in an era of populist backlash against the wealthy, the message could backfire.\u201cWhat\u2019s working against Warren and Sanders is that, let\u2019s face it, we are a capitalist country with a capitalist culture,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the working class in a large part, over time, has bought into this. This has been our culture, that you can work hard and become a Bloomberg.\u201dMr. Bloomberg, a businessman regarded as an economic centrist, was a loyal ally of Wall Street while he was mayor of New York City, but he has nevertheless embraced the liberal side of some of the country\u2019s most pressing social issues \u2014 including climate change and gun control. As mayor, he was known for fighting the tobacco and soft drink industries.Of 73 general-election candidates for governor who spent $1 million or more on their campaigns since 2000, only 25 won, according to data collected by National Institute for Money in Politics.Mr. Schultz, whose net worth is estimated at $3.6 billion, did not respond to requests for comments on whether or when he would announce plans for 2020. But in a move that could help set the stage for a bid, Mr. Schultz is set to begin a national tour to promote his new book, with the first stop scheduled for Jan. 28 in New York.Rachel Shorey contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gracie Gold\u2019s Battle for Olympic Glory Ended in a Fight to Save Herself", "Date": "2019-01-25", "News": "Gold appeared to be a gold medal favorite in figure skating for the 2018 Winter Games. Then her mental health unraveled, and a cry for help became her boldest move.Supported byASTON, Pa. \u2014 The day she covered every mirror in her new apartment because she could not stand the sight of herself anymore was a red flag.But no one was around to register it. And Gracie Gold, a figure skater once on the cusp of Olympic stardom, was in no shape to help herself. Holed up in a Detroit suburb, she kept her lights off so often, she said, that the electric bill one month was less than $20. She slept as much as 24 hours at a time, then stayed awake for three nights straight.A good day was when she managed to brush her teeth and her hair.Her dream of an Olympic gold medal? That had evaporated long ago, during her slow boil of a meltdown that she was struggling to keep a lid on.In 2014, Gold was a charismatic teenage prodigy, hailed as an athletic Grace Kelly because of her tight blond bun, bright red lipstick and regal bearing, her personality so sparkling it sometimes blinded people to the fact that she had not won an individual Olympic medal.Three years later, in the dark of a Michigan winter, Gold felt her world closing in. She was hiding from her family, gorging on forbidden food and, with the next Olympics less than a year out, unwilling \u2014 or unable \u2014 some days to summon even the energy required to drive to the practice rink less than 15 minutes away.On occasion, Gold said, revealing the depths of her mental illness for the first time, she imagined taking her life and nobody finding her body until the landlord came to collect overdue rent.\u201cI was suicidal for months,\u201d Gold said, adding, \u201cIf I had just continued the way I was in Detroit, I\u2019d probably be dead.\u201dThis week the top figure skaters in the country have gathered in Detroit for the national championships, and Gold had planned to be among them, plotting the first chapter of her sequel. But she is not back. Not yet.As Gold has discovered, mental health is a slippery slope, and she is still trying to find her footing.Until Gold\u2019s life began to unravel, she couldn\u2019t comprehend mental illness. \u201cI\u2019d hear someone say, \u2018I\u2019m so depressed,\u2019 and I\u2019d think, \u2018Tough it out,\u2019\u201d she said.That attitude is typical of elite athletes, said Caroline Silby, a sports psychologist who was a national-caliber skater. She has not treated Gold, but has worked with prodigies like her.\u201cSome of it is predestined,\u201d Silby said. \u201cThe DNA is such that these individuals would be faced with these issues regardless of their Olympic prowess. Some of it is developed through habits and practices that feed the athletic quest for excellence but drive these individuals further away from being healthy, productive non-athletes.\u201dGold, 23, decided last fall that she was ready to talk publicly about her ordeal, including an unhealthy relationship with food that, at her lowest point, led to an extreme weight gain. She sat for a series of interviews, displaying her wry sense of humor but very little skin, wearing baggy, long-sleeve sweatshirts and jackets that camouflaged her physique.Gold had lost more than half the extra weight but was too self-conscious, she said, to wear anything as revealing as a tank top or shorts.The place where Gold feels most at ease is the ice. She returned to it nine months ago, armed with new insights, coping mechanisms and a revamped support team that she hopes will help her better navigate the Olympic ambitions that she never completely abandoned, even at her nadir.To secure her eligibility for the national championships, Gold entered a high-level event in Moscow last fall against her coach\u2019s recommendation. Whether piecing together a program or her life, Gold is drawn to dramatic narratives, and this one was particularly irresistible: Detroit, where her collapse accelerated, would serve as a backdrop for her comeback.But Gold wasn\u2019t ready.She withdrew from nationals two weeks before she was to skate. Her performance in Moscow contributed to the decision. With less than seven months of consistent training behind her, she delivered a short program so ragged that she pulled out of the competition before the long program.Gold also realized that she did not relish the idea of returning to Michigan. She is so haunted by memories of her time there that, she said, she rerouted a December trip to California to visit her mother and twin sister because her original itinerary required her to fly through Detroit.Though it was there, in that Stygian apartment, that she bottomed out, Michigan was not where her problems began.Gold and her twin, Carly, were born 40 minutes apart on Aug. 17, 1995, and her family would later say it was only natural that Gracie led the way out of the womb. Throughout their childhood, she was fixated on being first, and flawless.In the classroom, she would furiously, and tearfully, erase an entire sentence if she misspelled a single word. By second grade, she had found an outlet for her compulsiveness, taking formal skating lessons at a rink near the family home in Springfield, Mo.Carly followed her into the sport a few months later and did well, but never rivaled her sister. Unlike Gracie, she was wired more for fun than for perfection.\u201cShe didn\u2019t cross those lines that needed to be crossed to be an elite athlete,\u201d Gracie said of her twin. \u201cShe didn\u2019t push past the border of being normal and into the realm of insanity.\u201dGold\u2019s skating ambitions led to several moves around the country over a decade. Through her teens, she was accompanied everywhere by her sister and her mother, Denise, a retired emergency room nurse. The twins\u2019 skating schedules consumed Denise\u2019s life and left their father, Carl, an anesthesiologist who had stayed put, a weekend parent financing his children\u2019s nascent careers.\u201cI remember when we were in Illinois, a sports psychologist saying, \u2018Can\u2019t you just go to another coach in the area?\u2019\u201d Gold\u2019s mother said. \u201cAnd I said: \u2018No, skating\u2019s not like that. In the whole world there\u2019s only a few coaches that are world-class caliber.\u201dGold was seen as someone who could reverse America\u2019s fortunes, a personality in the mold of Kelly, the Hollywood star turned royal princess. Gold never saw herself that way, but the comparison sounded compelling, and soon she was reflecting back what others saw, describing Kelly in interviews as her style icon.\u201cI almost created this other person,\u201d Gold said, adding: \u201cI wanted to be the most flawless, angelic, plastic, Barbie-doll-face human who just says all the right things and does all the right things and is sterling. And people just don\u2019t like her because she\u2019s so perfect.\u201dUntil she was well into her teenage years, Gold said, she didn\u2019t fixate on her weight and never counted calories. She would routinely chug a carton of chocolate milk before practice without a second thought, then promptly burn it off her still-growing frame.Then one day she weighed herself in front of a coach, a common practice, and the scale read 124 pounds. \u201cThat\u2019s a big number,\u201d she remembered the coach saying.Stung by the remark, Gold searched the internet for weight-loss tips. She stumbled onto a website on which people, primarily young women, shared strategies for extreme weight control. In one post, someone wrote about consuming 200 to 400 calories a day. Gold felt her competitiveness shift into high gear.\u201cIt all started off with me being dramatic and testing the waters,\u201d Gold said, \u201clike I wonder if I could do this.\u201dShe cut her food intake from roughly 2,000 calories a day to a few hundred, ignoring her mother\u2019s warnings that there was no \u201cmagic diet\u201d and subsisting many days on meals of one tomato and several cups of coffee.\u201cThe more weight I lost, the quicker and faster I felt on the ice,\u201d Gold said. \u201cIt was win-win, because I was skating better and people were saying, \u2018You look amazing.\u2019\u201d Gold\u2019s mother thought her daughter was becoming too thin, and she remembered urging Gracie to eat more in the lead-up to the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\u201cThat was a nervy situation,\u201d Denise Gold said.The next two years were a blur of fashion shoots and celebrity elbow rubbing with the likes of the pop singer Taylor Swift. Then came the 2016 World Figure Skating Championships in Boston. Gold entered the competition fresh off winning her second national title and seemed poised to become the first American woman in a decade to win a singles medal at the event.But after finishing first in the short program, Gold faltered on her opening jump sequence in the free skate and tumbled to fourth, two spots behind another American, Ashley Wagner, who skated exquisitely.Gold was devastated.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just her pain,\u201d Denise Gold said of what fed her daughter\u2019s crushing disappointment. \u201cIt was her family\u2019s pain. It was her agent\u2019s pain. It was the country\u2019s pain. It was that she was letting everyone down.\u201dWithin months, Gold\u2019s body, and her psyche, had begun to deteriorate. In the summer of 2016, she arrived in Colorado Springs for one of U.S. Figure Skating\u2019s regular monitoring sessions for elite skaters \u2014 something of a training camp, if you will \u2014 with an extra 20 pounds on her 5-foot-5 frame and a glower almost perpetually on her face.Gold was depressed, and her deteriorating relationship with food now involved binge-purge cycles. Her private struggles became immediately clear to Wagner, her rival, who said recently, \u201cThere was just no one home, and that was a scary thing to see.\u201dWagner alerted a skating official that Gold seemed unwell and needed help. Sam Auxier, the president of U.S. Figure Skating at the time, said the association, which makes licensed psychologists and other specialists available to athletes dealing with mental health problems, had acted promptly. But attempts to assist Gold, he said, went nowhere.\u201cI don\u2019t know if being more forceful with Gracie would have worked,\u201d Auxier said, \u201cjust because she was in such denial.\u201dIn retrospect, Gold said, she should have taken time off in 2016. But with another Olympics on the horizon, she tried to stay the course.\u201cYou want people to see your pain so they see you need help,\u201d Gold said, \u201cbut you don\u2019t want to ask for help. So you live in this kind of terrible limbo.\u201dGold\u2019s facade crumbled entirely at another Colorado Springs monitoring session in the summer of 2017.Out of shape after isolating herself in Michigan, Gold took the ice looking like the Grim Reaper, wearing a hoodie and carrying 50 extra pounds.Her spins sputtered and her jumps, long considered spectacular, landed with a thud.Perhaps worse than the weight gain was what she had lost. Gold\u2019s smile, one as dazzling as any jump or spin, no longer reached the corners of her mouth, much less the upper reaches of the arena.When the judges delivered their critiques, some could not hold back tears. Gold interpreted their comments as accusations. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I snapped,\u201d she said.She remembers sobbing, cursing and at one point screaming, \u201cCan\u2019t anybody see the cry for help that is my existence right now?\u201dOne of the judges confirmed Gold\u2019s account of that day. Two members of the camp\u2019s support staff soon approached Gold, persuading her to delay her career and seek treatment. Within a month, she entered an inpatient program for eating disorders, its cost covered by U.S. Figure Skating.Though initially skeptical about entering the Meadows, a treatment center in Arizona, Gold quickly embraced the experience, she said, \u201cbecause I thought it literally can\u2019t get any worse or I\u2019m going to die, and I want to live.\u201dGold issued a statement that she was taking time off from her sport. Then she disappeared.\u201cI just dropped off the face of the earth for 45 days,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was liberating.\u201dThese days Gold is on better terms with her family. She received a Prozac prescription at the Meadows, but she said she had weaned herself off it. And she comes to the rink in any kind of weather wearing rimless orange sunglasses, which give her a brighter outlook.Gold gravitated back to skating because she sought the kind of structure that had grounded her during treatment. Last spring, she moved to the Philadelphia area for a fresh start with a new coach, Vincent Restencourt, who earned her trust by insisting that she gradually reverse her weight gain. He insists on dining with Gold at least once a week, and at their first meal together he coaxed her into eating at least half a hamburger, emphasizing that she should not starve herself back into shape.Since June, Gold has lost more than 30 pounds, the result of a healthier combination of foods, she said, not any fad diet.She gives skating lessons to young children and adults, trains alongside teenagers and wonders what they must be thinking.\u201cWhen I was their age,\u201d Gold said, \u201cI never had a semiretired, mentally ill Olympian come to my rink.\u201dThe comeback feels a lot like starting from scratch. The first time Gold executed a clean triple Lutz, she felt an immense sense of accomplishment. \u201cYou forget how magical those moments are,\u201d she said.As Gold moves forward with her life, the lyrics remind her of why she needed to step back: \u201cShe is hard on herself. She is broken and won\u2019t ask for help. She is messy, but she\u2019s kind. She is lonely most of the time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Wales, Nuclear Plant Would Mean New Jobs. For the U.K., It May Mean More.", "Date": "2019-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCEMAES, Wales \u2014 Not far from this harbor village of brightly painted houses on Anglesey Island, a huge construction project is underway. Gates and wire fences are up. Archaeologists are sifting through dirt to document stony dwellings dating from 100 B.C. A technical school is welcoming apprentices eager to learn how to maneuver in high-tech control rooms and operate water-cooling systems.The activity is all tied to a plan by Horizon Nuclear Power to turn this rugged outpost into the home of a plant that could be critical not just to the company, but to the Welsh economy and Britain\u2019s energy future.Horizon, a subsidiary of the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi, is in private talks with the British government over how and when it might build a nuclear plant here at the northern tip of Wales. If the parties reach a deal on how the project\u2019s estimated 15 billion pound ($18.95 billion) cost will be paid, this stronghold of Welsh culture will change in ways that residents are just starting to consider.Some people worry about nonstop truck traffic, the blasting of rock and soil, and the waves of outsiders the plant would bring to live and work in the area.Others in northern Wales herald the economic benefit the potentially enormous investment could have. They see the Horizon plant, which is expected to produce enough electricity for 5.5 million homes, as a vehicle for rebirth.But Horizon and Hitachi executives are frustrated with the pace of the talks. In an interview, Duncan Hawthorne, Horizon\u2019s chief executive, said Hitachi had spent \u201cbillions\u201d of pounds on the project, including the cost of acquiring it from two German utilities in 2012.\u201cIt is a very long and expensive road here,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe next several months will be critical.\u201dHitachi, without providing exact figures, wants government financing from Britain and Japan to help attract outside investors like pension funds that seek long-term income streams. Investments by the governments would also help lower Horizon\u2019s risk rating.The Wylfa Newydd plant, with two giant reactors, would be just the second nuclear plant to be built in the United Kingdom since the 1990s. Once a world leader, Britain\u2019s nuclear industry atrophied after serious accidents in Ukraine and the United States spurred broad resistance to nuclear power.Britain has legally committed to cutting carbon emissions. As a result, the government is reassessing its energy options amid a decline in natural gas from the North Sea oil fields and a decision to phase out the use of coal.Proponents of wind and solar energy say Britain should be putting its money there, but those sources have not been able to match the steady supply of power nuclear energy produces. So nuclear plants are back in vogue. One is being built at Hinkley Point in southwest England, and at least four more are planned.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to conceive that nuclear does not have an important role to play,\u201d said Steve Holliday, a former chief executive of National Grid, the British power system operator.Britain\u2019s renewed interest in nuclear power stands out among Western countries, where such plants have become forbiddingly costly and complex. The challenges were evident in October when Toshiba scrapped plans to build a plant in northern England.Delays and cost overruns at plants being built at Olkiluoto, Finland, and Flamanville, France, have hurt the industry\u2019s reputation elsewhere in Europe. Germany, the region\u2019s top manufacturing power, is phasing out nuclear power. An abundance of cheap shale gas has undercut interest in the United States, although two new plants are in the works.Hitachi is intent on the plant in Wales, Mr. Hawthorne said, because it would provide a key European foothold after the 2011 Fukushima accident dampened interest in Japan. Horizon executives have described the area as an ideal location, with water from the sea to be used in the cooling system and the rocky terrain able to bear the massive concrete structure that nuclear power demands.For Anglesey Island, with a population of about 70,000, the project would provide a huge lift and create around 850 permanent jobs. Many local residents favor it because a smaller nuclear facility on a nearby seaside bluff was a dependable employer for nearly 50 years before closing in 2015.Gareth Winston Roberts, a local councilor who worked at the plant \u2014 known as Wylfa, after the bluff \u2014 before retiring in the 1990s, called it \u201ca godsend.\u201d\u201cIt kept people here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt produced a lot of engineers.\u201dGwen Parry-Jones worked there beginning in 1989. Since April, she has been Horizon\u2019s executive director and is steering the negotiations with the government. For the previous decade, she was an executive at EDF Energy, a French-owned utility that has taken over much of Britain\u2019s nuclear system.\u201cI benefited from having a nuclear power station effectively on my doorstep as a young scientist,\u201d she said. \u201cI strongly feel that we are benefiting from the fact that there is an existing nuclear power station here.\u201dThe need for jobs is obvious. The Wylfa plant still employs some technicians to remove fuel rods, but a local chemical plant closed in 2004 and an aluminum smelter closed in 2009. Britain\u2019s plan to leave the European Union this year could hurt another key employer, the port at Holyhead, a hub for trade with Ireland, an E.U. member.\u201cWe find ourselves in a position where we need that one big project,\u201d said Edward T. Jones, a local cattle farmer who also lectures on economics at Bangor Business School in North Wales.Some local leaders also see the plant as a vehicle for preserving the island\u2019s character.\u201cWe still have got the Welsh language, and it\u2019s quite a strong part of our community,\u201d said Llinos Medi, the leader of the island\u2019s governing council. \u201cWith work we can keep our young people and our culture and our Welsh language.\u201dBut some residents believe the plant could damage the island\u2019s rural charm and hurt tourism. A walk along the pebble beach at Cemlyn Bay, a wildlife sanctuary next to the construction site, suggests why.The old Wylfa plant sits at the beach\u2019s eastern end. Because the new one will be far larger, much of the surrounding landscape must be reshaped to accommodate it. The North Wales Wildlife Trust has been asking that fragile wildlife populations \u2014 thousands of terns nest here every summer \u2014 be taken into consideration.\u201cIt is going to completely spoil the area,\u201d said Simon Walker, a retired businessman who was on the shore with his wife, Susan, watching his four dogs splash in the water.Last month, in a nod to environmental concerns, the Welsh government said it would review the site preparations. Horizon said it disagreed with the move, which could result in delays.Whether the plant proceeds will probably come down to how it will be paid for.A key yardstick is the Hinkley Point facility in southwest England. The government is financing that plant\u2019s \u00a320 billion cost through a so-called contract for difference, an arrangement that guarantees developers of big energy projects a long-term base rate for the power they produce. If the price of electricity falls below that rate, customers pay higher bills to make up the difference.At Hinkley Point, the British government guaranteed the owners an inflation-indexed price of \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour for 35 years. That is about 50 percent higher than current energy rates. Not surprisingly, the government has been criticized for potentially saddling consumers with expensive electricity for decades.With Horizon, the British government is pushing for a rate up to 30 percent lower than what it agreed to for Hinkley Point. Mr. Hawthorne of Horizon said he anticipated the Wales plant could provide power at \u201ca significant price reduction\u201d compared with Hinkley Point.The question is whether a British government consumed with the process of leaving the European Union is prepared to move quickly on the Anglesey Island project \u2014 and how pivotal it believes the plant is to its climate change promises.Advertisement"}
