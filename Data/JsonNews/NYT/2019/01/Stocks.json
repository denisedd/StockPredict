{"Headline": "John C. Bogle, Founder of Financial Giant Vanguard, Is Dead at 89", "Date": "2019-01-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn C. Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group of Investment Companies in 1974 and built it into a giant mutual fund company, with $4.9 trillion in assets under management today, died on Wednesday at his home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 89.His personal assistant, Michael Nolan, said the cause was esophageal cancer. Mr. Bogle, who had struggled with a congenital heart defect and had several heart attacks, received a heart transplant in 1996.Mr. Bogle built Vanguard, which is based in Malvern, Pa., on a cornerstone belief that was anathema to most mutual fund companies: that over the long term, most investment managers cannot outperform the broad market averages. He popularized and became the leading proponent of indexing, the practice of structuring an investment portfolio to mirror the performance of a market yardstick, like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index.\u201cIndexing was the purview of institutional investors, but Jack Bogle came up with the consumer version,\u201d said Daniel P. Wiener, the editor of The Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter and website that has tracked the company for decades. \u201cHe made people aware of expenses, and told them that costs come right out of the bottom line.\u201dBut Mr. Bogle became a harsh critic of the mutual fund industry in later years. In the second half of the 1990s, he said, stock market investors were spoiled by average annual returns of more than 20 percent per year and, as a result, cared too little about the high expenses they were paying to mutual fund managers for those managers\u2019 presumed expertise at picking stocks. Mutual fund companies, he said, were all but immoral for accepting such fees.In recent years it has been hard to argue with that. Since 1984, less than half of the actively managed mutual funds that invest in a broad array of American stocks have outperformed the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, one of the world\u2019s largest, with more than $441 billion in assets under management, according to Vanguard.Vanguard\u2019s advantage came from the unusual corporate structure that Mr. Bogle adopted. Vanguard managed its indexed mutual funds at cost, charging investors fees that were far lower than those of virtually all of its rivals.Mr. Bogle also went a step further in differentiating Vanguard from other companies that sponsor mutual funds. In contrast to a management company, which in most cases controls the fund complex and provides all the investment, administrative and marketing services required in its operations, Vanguard is more like a mutual insurer, owned by investors in the funds, which employ their own officers and staff. Those employees are responsible to the funds\u2019 directors.Mr. Bogle argued that Vanguard funds were thus completely independent of their advisers and operated solely in the interests of shareholders \u2014 able to monitor investment results objectively, negotiate advisory fees at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d and change advisers if need be.The superior performance of the Vanguard funds attracted investors and assets in droves. In the last three years of the 1990s, Vanguard received more new money from investors than the next three largest fund companies combined.Vanguard\u2019s consistent growth produced riches for Mr. Bogle, but not to the extent that another ownership structure might have done. For example, Edward C. Johnson III, the chairman of Fidelity Investments, has a net worth of $7.4 billion, according to Forbes. Mr. Bogle\u2019s net worth was generally estimated at $80 million last year.Most fund companies spend huge sums to attract new customers. But Mr. Bogle eschewed the product- and marketing-driven thinking of much of the industry that has spread with the boom in mutual fund sales this decade.\u201cWe\u2019re never allowed to use the word \u2018product,\u2019\u201d he told an interviewer in 1995. \u201cIt sounds like toothpaste and beer.\u201dHis reputation as a tightwad was well earned. At breakfast with a reporter in 1993, at a suburban Philadelphia restaurant near Vanguard\u2019s headquarters, Mr. Bogle figured out that he would beat the $5.95 cost of the buffet by ordering from the menu. If he had an early-morning meeting in New York, he would take the early Amtrak Metroliner shuttle rather than pay for a hotel room in Manhattan.Mr. Bogle readily took swipes at the press for lauding fund managers who temporarily got a hot hand, and for focusing heavily on a fund\u2019s quarterly performance. Even a fund manager\u2019s long-term record is not an accurate predictor of future performance, he said.It was that combative nature that had led him to start Vanguard in the first place.After graduating magna cum laude from Princeton in 1951 with an economics degree, Mr. Bogle was hired by Walter L. Morgan, founder of the Wellington Fund, a Philadelphia-based fund management company. Mr. Morgan had read Mr. Bogle\u2019s senior thesis on mutual funds.While working his way up at Wellington, Mr. Bogle persuaded Mr. Morgan to introduce a new all-equity fund, called the Windsor Fund, to complement Wellington, which invested in both stocks and bonds.Mr. Bogle was named president of Wellington in 1967, and soon thereafter it merged with the Boston investment company Thorndike, Doran, Paine & Lewis. Several years later, a management dispute with the principals of the new company led Mr. Bogle to depart; he founded Vanguard in 1974 to handle the administrative functions of the mutual funds overseen by Wellington Management.Two years later, Mr. Bogle founded the First Index Investment Trust, later called the Vanguard Index Trust, now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the first index fund for individual investors. The next year he again broke from industry practice, selling mutual funds directly to investors rather than through brokers, and thus eliminating the sales fees of up to 9 percent that funds typically charged.\u201cOur challenge at the time was to build, out of the ashes of a major corporate conflict, a new and better way of running a mutual fund complex,\u201d Mr. Bogle said in 1985.He officially stepped down as chief executive of Vanguard in January 1996 and remained as chairman until the end of 1999. Tim Buckley is the current chief executive.Mr. Bogle\u2019s retirement did not come easily. After giving up the chief executive title to his handpicked successor, John J. Brennan, Mr. Bogle openly disagreed with several of Mr. Brennan\u2019s decisions. A rift developed between them, which contributed to Mr. Bogle\u2019s failure to persuade Vanguard\u2019s board of directors to allow him to stay on past the traditional retirement age of 70.\u201cI thought there would be an exception for the company\u2019s founder,\u201d he said in 2012. Vanguard veterans say that Mr. Bogle and Mr. Brennan barely spoke, if at all, in the years afterward.Mr. Bogle left the Vanguard board and set up the Bogle Financial Markets Research Center, a financial research institute, in order, he said, to \u201clet the controversy die away in a gracious way.\u201dMr. Brennan was succeeded by F. William McNabb III, who told Mr. Sommer in 2012 that people at Vanguard \u201crevere Jack Bogle.\u201dJohn Clifton Bogle was born in Montclair, N.J., on May 8, 1929. A twin brother, David, died in 1994.Mr. Bogle graduated from Blair Academy in Blairstown, N.J., and, in 1951, from Princeton; he was a scholarship student at both.Mr. Bogle was treated for arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, a congenital heart defect, for more than 30 years, and had at least six heart attacks, the first in 1960. After his heart transplant in 1996, he returned to good enough health that he was able to play squash daily.Mr. Bogle served on the board of the Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group, from 1969 to 1974, and as its chairman from 1969 to 1970. In 1991, he was named by the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Richard C. Breeden, to the Market Oversight and Financial Services Advisory Committee.In addition to \u201cBogle on Mutual Funds,\u201d his other books include \u201cCommon Sense on Mutual Funds\u201d (1999) and \u201cThe Clash of the Cultures: Investment vs. Speculation\u201d (2012).Mr. Bogle married Eve Sherrerd in 1956. She survives him, as do a brother, William Yates Bogle III; four daughters, Barbara Bogle Renninger, Jean Bogle, Nancy Bogle St. John and Sandra Bogle Marucci; two sons, John Jr. and Andrew; 12 grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.Mr. Bogle regularly gave half his salary to charities.\u201cMy only regret about money,\u201d he said in 2012, \u201cis that I don\u2019t have more to give away.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated both the original name and the current name of the fund Mr. Bogle established shortly after founding Vanguard. It was originally called the First Index Investment Trust, not the Vanguard Index Trust (that was a later name); and it is now known as the Vanguard 500 Index Fund, not the Index 500 Fund. The earlier version also omitted part of the name of the heart condition for which Mr. Bogle had been treated for more than 30 years. It is arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, not right ventricular dysplasia.Ana Fota contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Dodge a Market Dip That Threatens Your Retirement", "Date": "2019-01-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recent volatility in the stock market can make older investors feel vulnerable. Here are some strategies to make sure your money lasts as long as you do.You\u2019ve heard it before: When the markets become erratic, or seem poised for a prolonged downturn, the best thing you can do is nothing at all. But if you\u2019re on the cusp of retirement \u2014 or, perhaps worse, newly retired \u2014 a turbulent stock market can make you feel particularly vulnerable.While there\u2019s some validity to those feelings, it\u2019s more productive to redirect any panic into prudence, which will help ensure your money lasts longer. The same type of variability can occur based on the sequence of your market returns in retirement \u2014 except it\u2019s amplified because instead of adding to the money you\u2019ve invested, you\u2019re spending it.There are very simple strategies to try to reduce the effects of an ill-timed downturn or cancel them out altogether: Work longer or pick up a part-time job. Those aren\u2019t feasible for people with health problems, or those who were laid off by their employers a few years shy of when they intended to retire. But they tend to be the most effective ways to help your money last.Here are some other steps retirees can take to lengthen the life of their savings when markets are less than cooperative:If you answer \u201cno\u201d to these questions, you should reassess (preferably with a pro) how reducing your stock exposure might change your ability to spend what you want in retirement.But if your portfolio value takes a significant hit, your withdrawal rate may have to increase to support your spending. If that rate starts to approach 5 percent, and certainly 6 percent, there\u2019s a greater chance you\u2019ll outlive your portfolio, Mr. Pfau warned. So adjustments may be in order.The simplest way to deal with a dip would be to hold your spending steady, rather than increasing it with inflation. That approach can be enough to steady your finances even if your portfolio were to drop by 25 percent from its original value at retirement, according to Judith Ward, a senior financial planner with T. Rowe Price, based on a recent study. She suggested to keep spending steady for two to four years, depending on when the portfolio rebounds.\u201cKeep in mind, steady spending over a number of years may still result in some kind of spending cuts depending on the inflation environment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat may be the easiest and most intuitive approach for many retirees.\u201d Putting too much money in cash, however, may weaken overall returns because you will have less invested to begin with, and therefore less to build on.\u201cThe effective return of delaying Social Security is much higher than what you will earn in the market today,\u201d said David Blanchett, head of retirement research for Morningstar. \u201cIt is like a 10 percent guaranteed return.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons for Corporate Boardrooms From Yahoo\u2019s Cybersecurity Settlement", "Date": "2019-01-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewShareholders haven\u2019t been successful in holding companies accountable for data breaches.That changed in the first month of 2019.A derivative lawsuit is a legal mechanism that gives the owners of a company \u2014 the shareholders \u2014 a way to hold corporate directors and management accountable for their actions. Shareholders file a claim on the company\u2019s behalf, with any money recovered going to the corporation, not the individual shareholders, because the violation harmed only the organization.A $29 million settlement might seem trivial for a company that has a market capitalization of $38 billion. But it signals that director and officer liability for cybersecurity oversight is entering new and potentially perilous territory. That is especially so in cases like Yahoo\u2019s, in which shareholders allege egregious misconduct at the highest levels of an organization.Those allegations might explain why the Yahoo case was settled.The parties jointly told the court that the settlement was fair, in the best interest of all parties, and that a series of data security improvements have been worked out to minimize the chances that this will happen again. But the facts of the case most likely led the insurers to conclude that their exposure could be greater than the settlement.The reason is that the actions alleged in the lawsuit are outrageous. The nearly 120-page complaint \u2014 which is heavily redacted \u2014 reads at points more like a criminal indictment than a lawsuit. It accuses Yahoo\u2019s former leaders of engaging in an elaborate, yearslong plot to cover up hacks going back to 2013 and conducting a \u201csham\u201d investigation to \u201cconceal the largest hacking incident in U.S. history.\u201dYahoo was a pioneer of the internet era, and the core of its business was providing ways for users to communicate with one another confidentially. Yet Yahoo failed miserably at this fundamental mission, according to the shareholders\u2019 complaint. The expectations for consumer privacy and data security are far different for an internet company than a corner hardware store. The insurance carriers clearly understood this fact.Any company that figured it had little to fear from shareholders after a breach should now think twice. And in the meantime, this is definitely not the time to cut back insurance for officers and directors.Craig A. Newman is a partner and chair of the privacy practice at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, a New York law firm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In This Market, It May Be Time to Play Defense", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter months of stock market declines, investment strategists are divided on appropriate responses.There is a range of possible approaches, none as simple as the kind of straightforward investing that can lead to immediate rewards when the market is consistently rising.\u201cWe do advise our investors to hold lower allocations to global equities \u2014 particularly U.S. equities \u2014 than normal,\u201d Mr. Brightman said. He urged broad diversification into such vehicles as Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, commodities and real estate investment trusts, as well as a tax-sheltered structure known as a master limited partnership. But he concedes that with \u201cthe exception of M.L.P.s,\u201d all are expensively priced.Holding cash, in the form of a money-market fund, is another answer, but it is far from perfect, he said. \u201cThe problem with cash is you don\u2019t make any money,\u201d Mr. Brightman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the safest place to keep your money, but you get zero real return.\u201dNick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco, said it was worth at least \u201cthinking about\u201d tweaking a portfolio to fortify it against risk.He suggests funds that focus on stocks specifically selected because their fluctuations are low: They are known as low-volatility stocks, and they have outperformed the S&P 500 in 14 of the last 15 market downturns since 2011, according to Invesco.Four times a year, Invesco compiles a list of the lowest-volatility stocks in the S&P 500. These are the companies whose shares are least affected by market turbulence. The current list features Coca-Cola as the least-volatile equity, followed by two utilities, the WEC Energy Group and Duke Energy, according to Mr. Kalivas.But investors who shift toward low-volatility portfolios should remember that such portfolios have historically lagged once the market turns up.Investors may also be wondering what to do about tech stocks, especially the Faangs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google), which have been losing altitude rapidly after a seemingly endless ascent.Through December, Facebook and Netflix were both down over 35 percent from their highs of last year. Apple and Amazon were each off more than 25 percent from their 2018 highs.With evidence of rising public concern about consumer privacy, Mr. Landis said, he expects to see greater regulation. \u201cI spent the last 15 to 20 years being appalled at how readily people surrendered their own privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cI welcome the idea that they\u2019ve become more aware.\u201dMr. Landis said there were still good values in smaller tech companies. One major holding is Roku, which hopes to lure consumers who subscribe to cable. He contrasted its market cap of under $4 billion with Netflix\u2019s $111 billion market cap and said Roku was a better value.But she said there were at least two major threats in the longer term. \u201cWe are increasingly concerned about long-term deficits and their impact on the bond market,\u201d she said. Bonds, already pressured in the near term by Federal Reserve rate increases, could also face long-term rate pressure from the ballooning Treasury financing required by mounting budget deficits.Ms. Moore also said tech stocks could eventually lose value if new regulations were imposed to protect consumer privacy. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect any major regulatory changes in 2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly expect the government will impose regulations over the medium term.\u201dMr. Haghbin of Oppenheimer emphasized that portfolio decisions should reflect an investor\u2019s view of the larger economy. \u201cIf an investor feels that growth will continue to slow and risk appetite continue to decline, historically he would emphasize high-quality and low-volatility companies.\u201dBut, as Mr. Haghbin warned, investors may need to be nimble. \u201cThings can change very quickly,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Health Care May Not Cure What Ails Portfolios This Time", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHealth care stocks have traditionally done well during market downturns. But whether they can repeat the feat with continuing uncertainty about the future of health insurance in the United States is a big question.For one thing, in the declining stock market that began just before the fourth quarter, health care failed to hold its own. Through December, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in the health care industry fell 14.6 percent, on average, since the market peak on Sept. 20, Morningstar said, compared with a drop of 13.3 percent for the S&P 500. And the iShares U.S. Health Care E.T.F., which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Health Care Index, lost 10.2 percent.That\u2019s not a performance for health care stocks that defensive-minded investors can celebrate.Health care has done well in rough periods for the market in the past, said Jean Hynes, a managing partner at Wellington Management, who runs the portfolio for the $48 billion Vanguard Health Care fund. But \u201cit\u2019s not cyclically immune,\u201d she said.In a way, the sector\u2019s current problems may stem from its multiyear outperformance before the most recent quarter. The sector went on a tear in the five years through September. The S&P 500 health care index returned 13.4 percent on an annualized basis then, beating the full S&P\u2019s 11.6 percent gains, according to S&P Capital IQ.Why did the sector do so well in that stretch? At the most basic level, the more people use a hospital\u2019s beds and the more drugs they need, the better off a hospital\u2019s or pharmaceutical company\u2019s stock will be.It\u2019s why HCA Healthcare, one of the largest public hospital groups in the nation, has had such a strong run since the Affordable Care Act was fully put in place in 2014. More people in the United States have health insurance, and that has led to greater use of HCA\u2019s beds.Over the five years through September, while HCA\u2019s total hospital beds increased 11 percent, revenue rose 36 percent, and the stock rose 259.4 percent. The S&P 500 rose 73.3 percent during the same period, S&P Capital IQ said.Since the advent of the Affordable Care Act, more people have had insurance, and the amount spent on health care services rose 35 percent from 2010 through 2017. That extra money bolstered health care companies\u2019 balance sheets.But in the last recession, while health care performed better than the overall market, it didn\u2019t perform particularly well. Part of the reason was uncertainty surrounding the future of health insurance after the 2008 election. Passage of the Affordable Care Act provided some clarity.These issues, as well as the sector\u2019s outperformance in recent years, may make health care less of a solid performer in tough times now, but it certainly has an outstanding record.\u201cYou\u2019re going to a doctor and buying medicine, whether it\u2019s good or bad economically,\u201d says Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute.The data shows that the industry has performed well during market struggles. According to Bank of America Merrill Lynch research, through the last six bear markets since 1973 \u2014 defined as a 20 percent or more decline from the market\u2019s peak \u2014 when the S&P 500 experienced an average loss of 39 percent, the health care industry outperformed the S&P by 11 percent annualized.It lagged only consumer staples, energy and utilities stocks. And, according to CFRA Research, since 1946, health care has outperformed the overall market 75 percent of the time during similar downturns.During times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to cut back on the things they don\u2019t need. While enthusiasm for restaurant dining or a new smartphone may wane, the need for medical care continues.The rise in health care stocks in recent years has left the industry more expensive than the overall market, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 20 for health care stocks in the S&P 500 compared with only 17.7 for the entire index, according to Bloomberg.\u201cIt has been a good place to hide,\u201d says Lindsey Bell, an investment strategist at CFRA Research. If a recession were to hit, it wouldn\u2019t mean health care would be immune; it\u2019s \u201cnot bulletproof,\u201d Ms. Bell said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chilling Davos: A Bleak Warning on Global Division and Debt", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 As business and political leaders arrive in the Swiss Alps for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, a surprisingly alarming letter from an influential investor who studiously eschews attention has already emerged as a talking point.The letter, written by Seth A. Klarman, a billionaire investor known for his sober and meticulous analysis of the investing world, is a huge red flag about global social tensions, rising debt levels and receding American leadership.Mr. Klarman, a 61-year-old value investor, runs Baupost Group, which manages about $27 billion. He doesn\u2019t make the annual pilgrimage to Davos, but his words are often invoked by policymakers and executives who do. His dire letter, which is considerably bleaker than his previous writings, is a warning shot that a growing sense of political and social divide around the globe may end in an economic calamity.\u201cIt can\u2019t be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions,\u201d he wrote.He made the remarks in a 22-page annual letter to his investors, which include the endowments of Harvard and Yale and some of the wealthiest families in the world. It was being passed around ahead of the Davos gathering, which draws business leaders like Bill Gates and Sheryl Sandberg, social and cultural figures like Bono, and elected officials like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.Mr. Klarman expressed bafflement at how investors often shrugged off President Trump\u2019s Twitter outbursts and the retreating American role in the world during the past year.\u201cAs the post-World War II international order continued to erode, the markets ignored the longer-term implications of a more isolated America, a world increasingly adrift and global leadership up for grabs,\u201d he wrote.Citing the \u201cyellow vest\u201d marches in France that spread throughout Europe, Mr. Klarman said, \u201cSocial frictions remain a challenge for democracies around the world, and we wonder when investors might take more notice of this.\u201d He added, \u201cSocial cohesion is essential for those who have capital to invest.\u201dThe circulation of his letter is likely to add to the hand-wringing that typically takes place in Davos during a week of panels and conversation over Champagne and canap\u00e9s.For one thing, he details the way virtually every developed country has taken on mounting debt since the financial crisis in 2008, a trend that he says could lead to a financial panic. He cites the increasing ratio of government debt to gross domestic product from 2008 to 2017, to a point exceeding 100 percent in the United States and nearing that figure in France, Canada, Britain and Spain.\u201cThe seeds of the next major financial crisis (or the one after that) may well be found in today\u2019s sovereign debt levels,\u201d he said.Mr. Klarman is especially worried about debt load in the United States, what it could mean to the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency and how it could ultimately affect the country\u2019s economy.\u201cThere is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.\u201dMr. Klarman believes that the public, almost irrationally, has become too blas\u00e9 about all these risks and that investors have been lulled into taking on even more risk.\u201cIndividuals, professional investors and financiers are prone to project their own recent experiences into the future,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo when adversity is absent, investors become complacent. They assume good times will continue, and they grow careless about risk, perceiving it through rose-colored lenses.\u201dIn 2017, Mr. Klarman returned some of his fund to his investors, saying he didn\u2019t see enough good investment opportunities. Yet he also acknowledged in his letter that even if he expected an eventual crisis, \u201csince the worst does not frequently happen, you cannot let the fear of a monster storm completely paralyze you.\u201d He seems to wrestle in his letter with how to continue investing profitably while protecting himself and his firm against his fatalistic expectations.\u201cThis post-truth moment is quite dangerous,\u201d Mr. Klarman wrote. \u201cImagine an incident that threatens national security. Will Americans see eye to eye on the seriousness of the threat? If our leaders are truth-challenged, will Americans believe the official explanation of the threat and the wisdom of the proposed response? Should they?\u201dThe many technology companies in Davos \u2014 Facebook, Google and Amazon among them \u2014 may also want to take note of Mr. Klarman\u2019s anxiety that \u201cmore and more people are choosing to only seek out information from those who share their views\u201d and his blame that \u201ctechnology and social media have made it increasingly easy to do so.\u201dWhether a crisis is around the corner or still years away, Mr. Klarman seems relatively convinced that it is coming and that it will manifest itself not just in a market downturn but potentially in more violence as well.\u201cIt is not hard to imagine worsening social unrest among a generation,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat is falling behind economically and feels betrayed by a massive national debt that was incurred without any obvious benefit to them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Powell Says a \u2018Patient\u2019 Fed Is Watching for Signs of Economic Weakness", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Friday that low inflation would allow the Fed to be \u201cpatient\u201d in deciding whether to continue raising interest rates, a message welcomed by jittery investors.\u201cWith the muted inflation readings that we\u2019ve seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,\u201d Mr. Powell said. The Fed predicted in December that it would raise rates twice in 2019, but Mr. Powell said the central bank was ready to change course \u201csignificantly if necessary.\u201dThe S&P 500 rose 84.05 points to close at 2,531.94; the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 0.11 points to close at 2.668 percent.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic advisers, alarmed by his inquiries as to whether he has the power to fire Mr. Powell, want to arrange a meeting between the two men. Mr. Powell, under questioning by Neil Irwin, an economics writer at The New York Times, said that he was open to meeting with Mr. Trump, as Fed chairs have done with past presidents, but that no meeting had been scheduled.He also said the Fed would make policy without regard to Mr. Trump\u2019s views. \u201cI want the public to be assured that we have a strong culture, it\u2019s not a fragile one, it\u2019s not being disrupted,\u201d he said.Asked if he would resign if Mr. Trump asked him to do so, Mr. Powell replied directly: \u201cNo.\u201dMr. Powell was joined onstage at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association by his immediate predecessors at the Fed, Janet L. Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke. Both of them criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks as potentially damaging to the central bank, and therefore to the economy.Fed officials say the continued strength of the economy validates their management of monetary policy. \u201cI think we\u2019re actually in a good spot,\u201d Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, noting that job growth is strong and inflation is under control.But critics, including Mr. Trump, have said the economy still needs the Fed\u2019s help. Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as optimal, suggesting that the economy has room to grow, and workers are only beginning to reap the benefits of an expansion now in its 10th year.Mr. Powell began his remarks by reiterating his view that the markets\u2019 concerns are overstated. He said that 2018 had been \u201ca good year for the United States economy\u201d and that the latest economic data suggested \u201congoing momentum heading into 2019.\u201d Wall Street\u2019s pessimism, he said, is \u201cwell ahead of the data.\u201dBut the Fed chairman offered a different kind of relief to financial markets by emphasizing that the slow pace of inflation allows the Fed to postpone judgments about the resilience of the economic expansion.Inflation was 1.8 percent during the 12 months that ended in November, the most recent available data. It is likely that inflation remained soft in December, marking the seventh straight year that prices rose by less than 2 percent.Job growth has remained strong, and wage growth has increased in recent months, but Mr. Powell said the Fed was on guard against rising prices, not rising wages. He said the strength of the labor market \u201cdoes not raise concerns about too high inflation.\u201dMichael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, said Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks convinced him that the Fed would move more slowly in 2019. Mr. Feroli previously predicted three rate increases in 2019; he said he now expected the Fed to raise rates twice, in July and December.\u201cPowell\u2019s message was unmistakable,\u201d Mr. Feroli wrote in a note to clients.Mr. Powell also sought to ease concerns in financial markets about the Fed\u2019s gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds, which it bought in large quantities during the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. Some analysts have argued that the Fed\u2019s retreat is exacerbating the current volatility in financial markets.Mr. Powell said that the Fed disagreed but, returning to his theme for the day, that it was watching closely and willing to change its mind.\u201cIf we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans was somehow interfering with our attainment of our statutory goals, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate to change it,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Nothing", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. But you do not.Millions of investors will receive year-end statements from their brokerages and retirement plan managers in the coming weeks, and the great majority of them will have unpleasant news: losses.The S&P 500 finished the year down 6.2 percent, with the steepest declines recorded in the fourth quarter. If it all makes you want to flee \u2014 or at least shift your 401(k) into cash \u2014 that\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s also a bad idea.The sensible response to this unnerving series of developments is to do pretty much anything else. Read a book. Go for a walk. Take up knitting. Or just do nothing at all, like take a nap. If you are a long-term investor (and any money you have tied up in the stock market should be intended for the long term to begin with), tumult like that of the last few months isn\u2019t something that should cause panic. Rather, it\u2019s the price you pay for enjoying returns that, over long time horizons, are likely to be substantially higher than those for cash or bonds.That\u2019s true if this episode turns out to be a false alarm for the overall economy, as is a distinct possibility. But it\u2019s also true even if this does turn out to be the start of a prolonged period of economic and market distress \u2014 especially if you are still in the phase of your life of contributing to a retirement plan or otherwise accumulating savings.The recent pessimistic tone in markets is getting way ahead of the evidence. Nothing so far in either the economic data or the market indicators that most reliably predict economic swings suggests there will be anything worse than a modest slowdown in economic growth in 2019.Businesses are still expanding and adding jobs. The yield on two-year Treasury bonds has fallen in the last three months, but it would have fallen a lot more if the bond market \u2014 which tends to be closely tied to the direction of the overall economy \u2014 had been predicting an imminent recession.Moreover, an investor who moved money into cash now would be doing so just as the valuation of stocks was becoming more favorable \u2014 buying high and selling low, not the way great fortunes are made. That\u2019s especially true when you factor in the drop in longer-term interest rates, which makes shares particularly appealing relative to bonds.In early November, investing $100 in stocks would buy you about $4.64 worth of corporate earnings, versus the $3.21 in interest you would could receive by investing in 10-year Treasury bonds. Now, stocks offer $5.25, while bonds offer only $2.61.But most important, even if the economic road ahead really is as bumpy as some in markets seem to fear, you\u2019re probably not going to be successful at timing those swings just right.Of course, if you had a perfect ability to predict how far the market would fall and when it would bottom out, it would make sense to move money in and out. You do not.Even if you turned out to be right about a continuing tumble in 2019, the great risk would be that whenever the rebound began, you would be caught out of position, unable to take advantage.Suppose you were clever enough to recognize at the start of December 2007 that a major recession was about to take place, and you moved your money out of stocks.Yes, you would have saved yourself from steep losses in 2008 and early 2009. But you have to ask yourself: Would I have also had the courage to put money back in while the economy was still in horrendous shape in 2009, with double-digit unemployment and a banking system in tatters?If not then, when would you have moved money back in? People who simply left their savings fully invested in the stock market in December 2007 have now made a 134 percent return on that money. Would you have done better than that, or would you have missed out on a big chunk of those gains out of the same caution that led you to pull money out of stocks to begin with?People who did not panic in the fall of 2008 \u2014 the most panic-worthy time in most of our lifetimes \u2014 and kept putting their retirement funds into stocks did indeed incur steep losses over the ensuing months. But their newly invested funds were being put into stocks at the most favorable valuations in a generation, and thus enjoyed the full benefit of the rebound when it eventually came. This equation changes, of course, if we\u2019re talking about money needed imminently as opposed to longer-term savings, such as for retirement. The economy looks stable now, but that could change \u2014 it\u2019s still possible that markets and C.E.O.s know something about the future that isn\u2019t clear in the data yet.But that\u2019s more of a fundamental argument about how your assets should be allocated. If an 18 percent drop in stocks is enough to cause you to change your entire investment strategy, that money shouldn\u2019t have been in stocks to begin with.The entire point of investing in stocks is that you get greater long-term expected returns in exchange for tolerating bigger ups and downs. Episodes like those of the last few weeks are, in effect, the price you pay for returns that are substantially higher than bonds or cash over longer periods. Just as there are no free lunches, there are no excess returns without some volatility and risk.As individual investors, we cannot control volatility. What we can control is our own mind-set and reaction, and the more level your head, the better your long-term results are likely to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "PG&E Is Cleared in Deadly Tubbs Fire of 2017", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of California\u2019s most destructive wildfires devastated a neighborhood north of Santa Rosa in October 2017.LOS ANGELES \u2014 Pacific Gas and Electric Company, with billions of dollars of potential wildfire liabilities pushing it toward bankruptcy, has been cleared of responsibility for one giant 2017 fire in Northern California, brightening its financial outlook.After the department made the announcement, PG&E\u2019s stock soared, closing up 75 percent on Thursday at $13.95. Even so, the shares remain much lower than where they were before last November, when a new wave of devastating fires swept through the utility\u2019s vast service territory.PG&E, facing an estimated $30 billion of liability for fires in 2017 and 2018, said last week that it planned to seek bankruptcy protection by the end of the month. California officials say the company\u2019s equipment caused at least 17 of 21 major 2017 wildfires in the state.Investors and government officials have cast doubt on the company\u2019s rationale for a bankruptcy filing. PG&E has enough money on hand to meet day-to-day expenses and its wildfire liability has not been definitively established, these people have said.Financial analysts scrambled on Thursday to figure out the change in PG&E\u2019s liability as a result of the state\u2019s determination about the Tubbs Fire. That overall liability could now be about $8 billion lower, according to one financial research firm, CreditSights.Yet it was not clear whether the news changed the company\u2019s bankruptcy calculations.Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he was surprised by the findings of the state\u2019s fire investigators and that he had spoken to PG&E officials about them. But he said he was not sure whether the news would prompt the company to shift gears.\u201cThis obviously begs the question, now what?\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201cDo we anticipate that PG&E will move forward as they have previewed? That is an open-ended question. That is a question for PG&E.\u201dFor its part, PG&E said it still faced untold financial exposure without making clear whether it would still file for bankruptcy.\u201cThe devastating and unprecedented wildfires of 2017 and 2018 have had a profound impact on our customers, employees and communities,\u201d the utility said. \u201cRegardless of today\u2019s announcement, PG&E still faces extensive litigation, significant potential liabilities and a deteriorating financial situation, which was further impaired by the recent credit agency downgrades to below investment grade.\u201d\u201cThe news from CalFire that PG&E did not cause the devastating 2017 Tubbs Fire is yet another example of why the company shouldn\u2019t be rushing to file for bankruptcy, which would be totally unnecessary and bad for all stakeholders,\u201d Omar Vaishnavi, head of fundamental credit at BlueMountain Capital, said in a statement.Investors and analysts who are skeptical that the company needs bankruptcy argue that PG&E has access to plenty of assets it could borrow against or sell to meet its wildfire liabilities, including its headquarters building in San Francisco and its gas business. Selling such assets would still leave the company as the primary electricity utility to much of Northern and Central California.Stocks of companies that are on the verge of filing for bankruptcy often trade for pennies because investors believe that shareholders will get wiped out in a court-ordered reorganization. The Thursday rally in PG&E\u2019s stock could further undermine the case for a bankruptcy. The company\u2019s stock outstanding was worth more than $7 billion at Thursday\u2019s closing price.But PG&E\u2019s board might still decide to seek bankruptcy because it could conclude that is the most expedient way to resolve the thousands of wildfire claims against the utility. A filing could also protect the company in case its liabilities turn out to be much higher than current estimates.California officials have not yet determined the cause of the November 2018 Camp Fire, the state\u2019s most devastating. That wildfire killed at least 86 people and destroyed the town of Paradise. It could be months more before investigators reach a conclusion about its cause. Mr. Newsom said the state expected to determine the cause of the Camp Fire within the first half of the year.Some legal experts said the Tubbs Fire decision probably would not stop the company from filing for bankruptcy.\u201cThis should not change much,\u201d G. Marcus Cole, a law professor at Stanford, wrote in an email. \u201cIf PG&E files for bankruptcy, it is not because of the crushing weight of liability. Instead, it will be for administrative efficiency reasons. They still face hundreds of claims from hundreds of plaintiffs.\u201dInvestors also have to consider the possibility that PG&E still faces large, hard-to-quantify liabilities. Measures to reduce the risks of wildfires, like trimming trees around power lines and installing insulated wiring, could end up costing the company billions.\u201cPG&E\u2019s numerous regulatory, legislative and credit challenges are largely unchanged and we still expect them to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the next few days,\u201d Jeff Cassella, a vice president and senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s, said in a statement.For wildfire victims, PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy plans could cut both ways. Legal experts say newer claims against the utility could be processed more quickly through one bankruptcy court than through several state courts. But claims related to 2017 fires that are further along in the legal process, especially those that are set to go to trial in September, could be delayed by a bankruptcy filing.Ivan Penn reported from Los Angeles and Peter Eavis reported from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Real Estate Funds Have Been a Balm in a Stinging Market", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter years of being overshadowed by the likes of Apple and Alphabet, real estate funds have lately edged ahead of the overall stock market by betting mainly on old-fashioned assets like office buildings, malls and warehouses.In the fourth quarter, when the stock market really started to jitter and slide, the S&P 500 sank 13.52 percent, including dividends, but the FTSE Nareit All Equity R.E.I.T.s Index, a leading index composed of publicly traded real estate investment trusts, lost only 6.1 percent. For all of 2018, as the S&P 500 lost 4.4 percent, including dividends, the FTSE Nareit index lost only 4 percent.So it goes for this stalwart, if stodgy, sector: Real estate can often chug along when other sectors start to sputter. For that reason, a real estate mutual fund or exchange-traded fund may help buffer an otherwise diversified portfolio from some of the stock market\u2019s swings. In addition, it\u2019s an entree to investing in commercial real estate for someone who can\u2019t afford the Empire State Building (which is owned by a R.E.I.T. named Empire State Realty Trust).A share in a real-estate mutual fund or E.T.F. is \u201ceffectively a hybrid of debt and equity,\u201d said Michael J. Acton, managing director and head of research for AEW Capital Management in Boston. \u201cThe debt feature is lease payments you get from the underlying properties, and the equity feature is the right to re-lease or sell those properties.\u201d The lease payments can provide predictability like bonds, while the property values offer upside potential like stocks.Morningstar, the investment-analysis company, found that from 1972 through 2018, R.E.I.T.s provided a compound average annual return of 11.5 percent, compared to 10.2 percent for United States stocks. Morningstar has also found that real-estate stocks are slightly more volatile, on average, than other stocks. During the global financial crisis, real estate crashed with other stock market sectors, with the FTSE Nareit index falling 37.7 percent.Still, real estate funds and E.T.F.s often can provide additional diversification to an investment portfolio because commercial property markets don\u2019t usually move in lock step with stocks, Mr. Acton said. \u201cThere are leases in place, and the cash flows from those leases are already locked in.\u201dHow much of a fund investor\u2019s overall portfolio should be allocated to real estate is a question, like so many in the investment world, that\u2019s a matter of philosophical dispute.Matthew C. Brancato, a principal and head of the portfolio review department at Vanguard, said investors who own well-diversified index funds, like those built upon the S&P 500, may already have all the real estate they need. The S&P index includes 32 R.E.I.T.s, and together they account for about 3 percent of the index\u2019s market capitalization.Layering a dedicated real estate fund or E.T.F. atop a broad-based core holding would imply that an investor wanted to \u201cexpress a view about real estate\u201d \u2014 either believing that it will outperform the rest of the market or just liking the sector, Mr. Brancato said.But portfolio managers of real estate funds say reasons beyond a fascination with bricks and blueprints might persuade investors to nudge their real estate allocations above that of broad-based index funds.\u201cCommercial real estate is a very large market,\u201d he said.Conventional wisdom says rising rates hurt real estate. The logic behind this is simple, said Jennifer Cookke, a lecturer in the Center for Real Estate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cYou typically have debt on a property,\u201d she said. \u201cSo when interest rates rise, costs are higher, and that reduces profit.\u201dThe managers of the Neuberger Berman Real Estate Fund delved into whether rates really do damp R.E.I.T.s and learned that the effect was often temporary, said Brian Jones, who manages the fund with Mr. Shigekawa. \u201cWhat we found is, in periods where interest rates were spiking, the performance of R.E.I.T.s suffered,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cBut if you go six and 12 months beyond a rate spike, R.E.I.T.s shares typically recover and do very well.\u201dE-commerce\u2019s effects won\u2019t be sloughed off so easily. They can be summarized in a single name: Amazon. The online giant (and other e-commerce companies) is changing how people shop and raising questions about the need for physical storefronts.This country has 1,200 shopping malls alone, Mr. Buller said. \u201cThere are 400 class-A malls, and I think those will survive. The other 800? I don\u2019t know.\u201d Mr. Buller has allocated about 20 percent of his fund to retail holdings, and the Simon Property Group, the country\u2019s largest mall R.E.I.T., is among his top stakes.An investor who wants to bet on real estate must make the usual choice between actively managed funds, like those offered by Neuberger Berman, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity, and passively managed indexed offerings.A misconception of some investors is that they\u2019ve already diversified their portfolio with real estate because they own a house and perhaps a vacation rental, said Mr. Jones, of the Neuberger Berman fund. That sort of ownership is a narrow bet on one or two markets, comparable to owning one or two stocks instead of, say, an S&P 500 index fund. \u201cYou don\u2019t derive the same diversification benefit that you can get from a R.E.I.T. fund,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Here are some of his tips.Here are some of Mr. Bogle\u2019s investment tips: \u201cWise investors won\u2019t try to outsmart the market,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll buy index funds for the long term, and they\u2019ll diversify.\u201d Investors should weather any storms, he told The Wall Street Journal in 2016.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have lower returns, well, the worst thing you can do is reach for more yield. You just have to save more.\u201d \u201cHow could so many highly skilled, highly paid securities analysts and researchers have failed to question the toxic-filled, leveraged balance sheets of Citigroup and other leading banks and investment banks?\u201dIn 2017, he waved younger investors away from financial advisers and gave his approval to robo-advisers. Vanguard\u2019s fund shareholders own it collectively, so there is no parent company or private owner to siphon profit, allowing the firm to keep costs down. Mr. Bogle became a harsh critic in his later years of the mutual fund industry and the high fees charged to investors for stock-picking expertise. \u201cEliminate emotion from your investment program. Have rational expectations for future returns and avoid changing those expectations in response to the ephemeral noise coming from Wall Street.\u201d Mr. Bogle was the leading proponent of structuring an investment portfolio to mirror the performance of a market yardstick, like the S&P 500 stock index.

{"Headline": "The Trump Tax Cut: Even Worse Than You\u2019ve Heard", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkeptical reporting has still been too favorable.Opinion ColumnistThe 2017 tax cut has received pretty bad press, and rightly so. Its proponents made big promises about soaring investment and wages, and also assured everyone that it would pay for itself; none of that has happened.Yet coverage actually hasn\u2019t been negative enough. The story you mostly read runs something like this: The tax cut has caused corporations to bring some money home, but they\u2019ve used it for stock buybacks rather than to raise wages, and the boost to growth has been modest. That doesn\u2019t sound great, but it\u2019s still better than the reality: No money has, in fact, been brought home, and the tax cut has probably reduced national income. Indeed, at least 90 percent of Americans will end up poorer thanks to that cut.Let me explain each point in turn.First, when people say that U.S. corporations have \u201cbrought money home\u201d they\u2019re referring to dividends overseas subsidiaries have paid to their parent corporations. These did indeed surge briefly in 2018, as the tax law made it advantageous to transfer some assets from the books of those subsidiaries to the home companies; these transactions also showed up as a reduction in the measured stake of the parents in the subsidiaries, i.e., as negative direct investment (Figure 1).But these transactions are simply rearrangements of companies\u2019 books for tax purposes; they don\u2019t necessarily correspond to anything real. Suppose that Multinational Megacorp USA decides to have its subsidiary, Multinational Mega Ireland, transfer some assets to the home company. This will produce the kind of simultaneous and opposite movement in dividends and direct investment you see in Figure 1. But the company\u2019s overall balance sheet \u2013 which always included the assets of MM Ireland \u2013 hasn\u2019t changed at all. No real resources have been transferred; MM USA has neither gained nor lost the ability to invest here.If you want to know whether investable funds are really being transferred to the U.S., you need to look at the overall balance on financial account \u2013 or, what should be the same (and is more accurately measured), the inverse of the balance on current account. Figure 2 shows that balance as a share of GDP \u2013 and as you can see, basically nothing has happened.So the tax cut induced some accounting maneuvers, but did nothing to promote capital flows to America.The tax cut did, however, have one important international effect: We\u2019re now paying more money to foreigners.Bear in mind that the one clear, overwhelming result of the tax cut is a big break for corporations: Federal tax receipts on corporate income have plunged (Figure 3).The key point to realize is that in today\u2019s globalized corporate system, a lot of any country\u2019s corporate sector, our own very much included, is actually owned by foreigners, either directly because corporations here are foreign subsidiaries, or indirectly because foreigners own American stocks. Indeed, roughly a third of U.S. corporate profits basically flow to foreign nationals \u2013 which means that a third of the tax cut flowed abroad, rather than staying at home. This probably outweighs any positive effect on GDP growth. So the tax cut probably made America poorer, not richer.Meanwhile, since the tax cut isn\u2019t paying for itself, it will eventually have to be paid for some other way \u2013 either by raising other taxes, or by cutting spending on programs people value. The cost of these hikes or cuts will be much less concentrated on the top 10 percent than the benefit of the original tax cut. So it\u2019s a near-certainty that the vast majority of Americans will be worse off thanks to Trump\u2019s only major legislative success.As I said, even the mainly negative reporting doesn\u2019t convey how bad a deal this whole thing is turning out to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Things John Bogle Taught Us: Humility, Ethics and Simplicity", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "Personal finance luminaries and everyday investors share lessons from the late Vanguard founder. Supported bySo many people have John Bogle stories.For some, it is a chance encounter at a conference and a whispered word of advice. For others, it is a formal meeting. In one case, it was an airplane day trip and train ride just to meet the man. These are the stories of those who learned from Mr. Bogle, a man so many knew simply as Jack \u2014 no last name required.We may never know how many people were able to leave the full-time work force early after following Mr. Bogle\u2019s instructions, but Christopher DeMers was one of them.Having worked in technology as that industry\u2019s stocks climbed skyward in the 1990s, Mr. DeMers could have easily talked himself into the delusion that he had some special insight. But he resisted the urge, as Mr. Bogle counseled investors who thought they could outsmart Wall Street. \u201cIf I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Mr. DeMers, 63, said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to beat the market in the long run.\u201dThen Mr. Rogers hit Mr. Bogle with his opening line: He really wanted Ms. Hobson to meet a legend like Mr. Bogle because she was going to be president of Ariel by the time she was 30. She was taken aback \u2014 it was the first she\u2019d heard such a forecast. (It actually took her until she was 31.) As they chugged through New Jersey, Ms. Hobson came face to face with a financial legend \u2014 if nominal competitor \u2014 who didn\u2019t care about his own bottom line. That philosophy leads to interesting conversations.\u201cOccasionally, an investor will say, \u2018I need X percent return to meet my goals,\u2019\u201d Mr. Evensky said. \u201cWhile that may be a true statement, market returns will be what they are, not what an investor may believe they need. Jack always reminded us that we needed to be realistic in our expectations.\u201dMr. Evensky, who met Mr. Bogle several times over the years, spoke to us via email because he was on a cruise ship between Los Angeles and Honolulu. He could afford the trip, he said, in part because of the long-term planning that Mr. Bogle helped inspire.Jonathan Clements, who spent two decades at The Wall Street Journal preaching the virtues of low-cost investing, said that it was easy to forget Vanguard\u2019s innovation came in two parts.\u201cIt was a competitive advantage that nobody else could match,\u201d said Mr. Clements, who met Mr. Bogle perhaps 20 times over the years.And those low fees added up to bigger gains. True Confidence \u201cThere has been thinly veiled resentment toward Bogle from other mutual fund leaders over the years because of his focus on reducing costs, which was a direct threat to their bottom line,\u201d said Ms. Roper, who met him once, when she was seated next to him at a dinner. \u201cHe always cared more about that vision \u2014 how the industry should be run \u2014 than making friends in the industry. Of course, he was rewarded with a following that was cultlike in its devotion.\u201d\u201cHis consistent belief that all investors deserve a fair shake was a core principle that I incorporated into my work and shaped my career path,\u201d she said. \u201cYou listen to Jack Bogle and you think, \u2018I want to be on this guy\u2019s team.\u2019 Whatever he is talking about, this is the right thing to do for people.\u201dSo strong was Mr. Bogle\u2019s belief, she said, that it remained firmly instilled in Vanguard long after he had given up control. And once investors convert to his ethos of simplicity and thrift, it\u2019s for life. \u201cInvestors come around to Vanguard, and then they never leave,\u201d she said.Mr. Bogle was on campus to promote a book, and Mr. Stein stood in line for 20 minutes to have his copy signed. Mr. Stein seized the chance to share his best pitch for Betterment, which, in his eyes, would augment Mr. Bogle\u2019s favored index investments with low-cost, automated portfolio advice.Mr. Bogle listened and told Mr. Stein he would help a lot of people. Inside the book, Mr. Bogle wrote, \u201cStay the course!\u201d\u201cHe could have written that in everyone\u2019s book,\u201d said Mr. Stein, chief executive of Betterment, which opened to customers in 2010. \u201cBut when he wrote it to me, it meant that we were onto something.\u201dThey met again years later at Mr. Bogle\u2019s invitation. Mr. Stein arrived at what looked like a professorial grandparent\u2019s study, and was shocked at how much Mr. Bogle had prepared for their meeting, marking up a stack of materials about Betterment.\u201cWe are standing on the shoulders of Jack,\u201d Mr. Stein said. \u201cWe would not be here, Betterment would not exist, without his example with the business he started.\u201dWhen Ramit Sethi won a pile of scholarship money for college, he invested some of it in the stock market. He lost big, so he began to learn.\u201cGoing through Wall Street is like playing a video game on the hardest level,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone is out to get you, and you don\u2019t even understand it.\u201dHe soon stumbled on the writings and speeches of Mr. Bogle. \u201cHe spoke in a very plain way,\u201d Mr. Sethi said. \u201cAnd it was heresy what he was saying, while having the courage to go up against a multibillion-dollar industry.\u201d\u201cI came out swinging,\u201d he said. It was a New York Times best-seller. And on his book tour, Mr. Bogle received him in his office.Making something simple sounds easy. Turns out it\u2019s not.You consider your options. Listen to counterarguments. Push some edges.She called indexing the financial manifestation of the idea. \u201cIt\u2019s the notion that accepting your fair share of the market\u2019s return over the long run will do you just fine,\u201d she said.But \u201cenough\u201d was also the mark of man who worked for the benefit of others, rather than himself. \u201cWhat is often missed when speaking about Jack\u2019s legacy,\u201d she said, \u201cis the way in which this concept of \u2018enough\u2019 also shaped his outlook on the way to live a life of meaning, rooted in character.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Led by Cult Bourbons, Distillers Dream of a \u2018Napa-fication\u2019 of Kentucky", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn September 2014, a bourbon brand called Kentucky Owl began to appear on liquor-store shelves around Louisville. The American whiskey market was booming, and dozens of new bourbons were showing up each year. But Kentucky Owl was different. Released exclusively within the state in tiny quantities and produced by the scion of an old Kentucky whiskey family, it had an undeniable mystique \u2014 and a price tag of $170.To skeptics, Kentucky Owl was proof that the whiskey trend had reached its Tulip Mania moment. At the time, few bourbons commanded even $50 at retail. Plus, the man behind the brand, Dixon Dedman, didn\u2019t even make the whiskey himself; he bought barrels from other distilleries, then blended them. Surely the bubble was about to pop.It didn\u2019t. Within a few weeks, nearly every bottle of Kentucky Owl had sold out. On the secondary market, flippers were asking \u2014 and getting \u2014 five times what they had paid in stores. \u201cBefore you knew it, before anybody had reviewed it, you had people camping out to buy a bottle of Kentucky Owl,\u201d said Fred Minnick, the editor of Bourbon+ magazine and the author of \u201cBourbon: The Rise, Fall and Rebirth of an American Whiskey.\u201dSeveral factors gave Kentucky Owl a boost. It had heritage: Mr. Dedman, whose family runs a century-old inn popular with bourbon fans, named it after a long-defunct brand created by his great-great-grandfather. Early hype by retailers, along with rumors about the source of the whiskey, also built early interest.Above all, Kentucky Owl debuted at a moment when whiskey fans, flush with money from a surging heartland economy, were willing to pay extra to get the next hot thing in bourbon. Soon, Kentucky Owl had achieved cult status \u2014 and signaled a fundamental change in the American whiskey market.\u201cPeople have called us the Screaming Eagle of bourbon,\u201d Mr. Dedman said in August, referring to the $3,000-per-bottle cabernet sauvignon whose debut, in 1995, represented a shift toward stratospheric luxury in the Napa Valley wine industry.Not that he\u2019s complaining. In January 2017, less than three years after introducing Kentucky Owl, Mr. Dedman and his business partner sold the brand to SPI Group, the Luxembourg-based company best known for making Stolichnaya vodka, for an undisclosed sum rumored to be in the high seven figures. Six months later, the new owners revealed plans for a $150 million \u201cKentucky Owl Park\u201d in Bardstown, an hour southeast of Louisville, featuring not just a distillery but a convention center, two lakes and, eventually, a luxury hotel. The company broke ground in November 2017, at an event attended by Governor Matt Bevin, and it plans to open the first phase of the site in 2020.The brand\u2019s rapid ascent took Mr. Dedman by surprise. \u201cI never had a vision for how fast this thing would grow,\u201d he said.You could say the same thing about the Kentucky whiskey industry itself. Although the bourbon market has been growing for almost two decades, a transformation has taken place in the last five years, a reshaping of the industry\u2019s potential that most people didn\u2019t see coming and are only now starting to grapple with.Between 2012 and 2017, sales of bourbon whiskey \u2014 95 percent of which is made in Kentucky \u2014 soared by more than 50 percent, to $3.3 billion. To keep up with demand, nearly two dozen new distilleries have opened in Kentucky in the last five years, including three around Bardstown, a town of 13,000 that sits in the center of bourbon country. Established companies like Beam Suntory and Brown-Forman are undertaking hundred-million-dollar capital projects, while scores of new rickhouses \u2014 the enormous warehouses used to age whiskey \u2014 dot the rolling hills around Louisville.But the changes are about more than money and investment. Americans aren\u2019t just buying more whiskey, and paying more for each bottle. They\u2019re buying into an entire \u201cbourbon experience,\u201d from whiskey-themed boutique hotels in downtown Louisville to trendy restaurants with \u201ccurated\u201d whiskey lists to fleets of tour buses carting bachelorette parties and corporate retreats from distillery to distillery.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Trey Zoeller, the founder of Jefferson\u2019s, a bourbon brand based in Louisville that just built a sprawling visitors center and has plans to quintuple the size of its distillery. \u201cTruly, you build it and they will come.\u201dThe most ambitious people in the industry talk about the \u201cNapa-fication\u201d of bourbon, doing for American whiskey what Napa Valley did for American wine: not just make it in huge volumes, but elevate it to a world-class luxury status, built around a region and an image designed to generate billions of dollars in tourism, retail sales and investment. The sort of place where a $170 bottle of Kentucky Owl is actually a pretty good deal, and a far cry from the rural simplicity that bourbon was built on.\u201cThis region has matured with the rise of the bourbon industry the way a stupid underage kid grows up to be a sophisticated adult,\u201d Mr. Dedman said. \u201cI would never in my wildest dreams have imagined that we\u2019d be where we are today.\u201dDixon Dedman is Kentucky royalty. His great-great-grandfather Charles Dedman founded one of the state\u2019s largest distilleries in the late 19th century, and his family has owned the award-winning, 31-room Beaumont Inn in Harrodsburg, Ky., for over a century. Tall, sandy-haired and soft-spoken at 37, Mr. Dedman exudes the image of a down-home goober \u2014 his word \u2014 that barely papers over a sharp, analytical mind.\u201cHe plays dumb really well,\u201d said Mr. Minnick, \u201cbut he\u2019s really smart.\u201d (Disclosure: I\u2019ve written for Mr. Minnick\u2019s magazine.)There was never a question that Mr. Dedman would go into the family business. During college, in the early 2000s, he worked at the Beaumont Inn during the summer, and less than a week after graduation he was back washing dishes. Revenues were down, though, and major improvements were being pushed back for lack of money. The inn shut down for four months every winter for lack of visitors. With Mr. Dedman\u2019s father easing into retirement, it was suddenly up to him to save the family legacy.Part of the problem was location. Even though it is in the middle of bourbon country, just east of Bardstown, Harrodsburg sits in a dry county \u2014 which meant the inn couldn\u2019t cater to thirsty tourists visiting nearby distilleries.\u201cWe\u2019d get people coming through after seeing a distillery, and the strongest thing I could serve them in the restaurant was black coffee,\u201d Mr. Dedman said.That changed in 2003, when the county voted to allow restaurants in Harrodsburg to sell liquor by the glass. Mr. Dedman pounced: He started selling drinks in the Beaumont\u2019s main dining room, and he opened two adjacent taverns, both of which became overnight successes in a town that was dying for a drink. (In 2015, the James Beard Foundation gave the inn an America\u2019s Classics award, which it bestows on distinguished regional restaurants.)The decision to relax Harrodsburg\u2019s dry laws, and Mr. Dedman\u2019s push to sell liquor, came just as the bourbon industry was beginning to recover from a decades-long slump in consumer demand. In 1969 distillers produced 1.9 million barrels of whiskey, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association; in 1999, the industry\u2019s low point, it made just 455,000.But in the mid-2000s, a younger generation of drinkers shifted back toward bourbon, drawn as much by its flavors as by its story as an authentic American craft. Like locally sourced food and artisanal furniture, bourbon appealed to consumers tired of flashy luxury and looking for simple, recognizable products. Between 2000 and 2010, revenues for American whiskey distilleries grew by 46 percent, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, and tourists began pouring into Kentucky to see where all that whiskey was made.That was especially good news for a place like the Beaumont Inn. Not only were locals flocking to its bars, but a mounting number of whiskey tourists, arriving to visit nearby distilleries like Four Roses and Maker\u2019s Mark, were lining up to stay in its guest rooms. By 2005, it was operating year-round.Mr. Dedman had more on his mind than rescuing the Beaumont Inn. His great-great-grandfather\u2019s distillery, which opened on the banks of the Kentucky River in 1879, had grown rapidly, thanks to the success of its flagship whiskey, Kentucky Owl. Charles Dedman gave it the slogan \u201cthe wise man\u2019s bourbon.\u201dThe C.M. Dedman Distillery was forced to close during Prohibition, though, and it never reopened. Mr. Dedman\u2019s father and grandfather had often talked about restarting the brand, but it was idle chatter. In 2008, with the inn back to financial stability despite the looming recession, Mr. Dedman set out to realize their dream.Instead of opening his own distillery \u2014 a costly and time-intensive project \u2014 Mr. Dedman decided to \u201csource\u201d whiskey distilled elsewhere, then bottle it under his own label. But sourcing decent whiskey presents its own challenges: Acquiring stocks of bourbon is largely a matter of knowing the right people to open the right doors. Fortunately, Mr. Dedman knew people: Generations of traveling whiskey businessmen had stayed at his family\u2019s hotel.Among them was Jim Rutledge, the master distiller at Four Roses. Mr. Rutledge, who recently retired after 49 years with the distillery, is widely regarded as one of the greatest whiskey makers of his generation. Starting in 2010, Mr. Dedman would buy barrels of whiskey, then bring samples to Mr. Rutledge\u2019s home for him to assess.Unfailingly polite but highly opinionated, Mr. Rutledge was not impressed. It turned out that even with access to good barrels, Mr. Dedman had something to learn about picking the right ones. \u201cOne day he had five samples, and we met over breakfast,\u201d Mr. Rutledge recalled. \u201cI tried them and thought, \u2018How do I tell him not to ever put these in a bottle?\u2019 I told him he might have to blend them\u201d \u2014 a laborious process that involves taste-testing endless combinations of barrels.Undeterred, that\u2019s what Mr. Dedman did. After closing up the inn at night, he would set up dozens of barrel samples at a table in the back of the restaurant and methodically mix them, paying close attention to their age, alcohol level, even where they had been sitting in the warehouse (temperature affects how a whiskey ages, and temperatures vary widely in an unheated warehouse).It took nearly four years, but he finally settled on a blend he liked. He combined the barrels, paid someone to bottle and label them, and then took them around to local liquor distributors.Mr. Dedman insists that making a commercially successful whiskey was never his plan. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I thought it out, like I said here\u2019s what I\u2019ll do year one, and then what I\u2019ll do year five,\u201d he said. \u201cI never thought, we should do this because bourbon is on the move.\u201d Looking back, he cringes at how amateur the whole operation was \u2014 he didn\u2019t have a sales plan, or a marketing strategy.None of that mattered. By almost all accounts, that first batch of Kentucky Owl was a transcendently beautiful bourbon, reminiscent of whiskey made in the mid-20th century, often considered a golden age of distilling. \u201cWhen you pick up that bottle, Kentucky Owl just feels like Kentucky,\u201d Mr. Minnick said. \u201cAnd when you taste the early releases of Owl, it just tastes like old Kentucky bourbon from the 1950s.\u201dKentucky Owl got an added boost from social media. Rumors, spread through bourbon chat rooms on Reddit and other sites, claimed that Mr. Dedman had worked closely with Julian Van Winkle III, the owner of the legendary Old Rip Van Winkle whiskey company. The information was false, but it supercharged the hype.\u201cPeople just went nuts,\u201d Mr. Minnick said. \u201cKentucky Owl just has that cool factor you cannot teach.\u201dOther whiskey brands have begun asking three-figure prices too: A rye whiskey from Kentucky Peerless, a new distillery in Louisville, goes for an average of $120. Chicken Cock, another sourced and \u201crevived\u201d 19th-century brand, sells for $250. Even once-proletarian brands like Wild Turkey and Four Roses now offer limited-edition expressions at $200 or more.Whiskey fans and writers talk about Kentucky Owl as the next Pappy Van Winkle, Mr. Van Winkle\u2019s flagship brand, bottles of which often fetch $5,000 or more. Others, betting on Mr. Dedman\u2019s blending skills and the global growth of American whiskey, see it going even higher, to sit in the same category as the Macallan single malt or Ch\u00e2teau Latour Bordeaux.\u201cIt has the potential to get up and stay among the world-class, luxury brands \u2014 it has that kind of cachet,\u201d said Jeff Hopmayer, a strategic adviser in Nashville who has worked closely with several bourbon producers, including Kentucky Owl. \u201cWhen I bring a bottle to a party, everyone freaks out.\u201dIn early 2017, Mr. Dedman got a call from the office of Yuri Shefler, a Russian businessman. Mr. Shefler, who lives in London, is the sole owner of SPI Group, a global drinks company best known for Stolichnaya vodka, which Mr. Shefler acquired in 1999, two years after the Russian government sold it off.Moscow, perhaps sensing that it had made a mistake in letting go of such a valuable brand, has sued to win Stolichnaya back. So far SPI Group has defended its most valuable property, but in recent years it has also diversified, buying or starting wineries in Spain and Argentina, a tequila distillery in Mexico and a rum distillery in Louisiana. Now, Mr. Shefler wanted a piece of the bourbon boom.He wasn\u2019t alone. As American whiskey has demonstrated its staying power, it has attracted investors from around the world. In early 2017 R\u00e9my Cointreau, the French drinks company, bought Westland, a craft distillery in Seattle; a few months later LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought the Woodinville Whiskey Company, in Woodinville, Wash. And in September 2018 Edrington, the owner of the Macallan single malt, bought a minority stake in Wyoming Whiskey, based near Jackson Hole.But Mr. Shefler and SPI Group wanted more than just an investment in a bourbon company \u2014 they wanted to control a chunk of the bourbon experience. Kentucky Owl offered a unique opportunity: a prestigious brand with almost no footprint, a blank slate on which SPI Group could write its own bourbon story.Mr. Dedman and his partner, Mark Carter, closed the deal in early 2017, for an undisclosed sum. (Mr. Carter and his wife, Sherri, who own an inn and a winery in California, left the company; last year they introduced their own whiskey brand, Old Carter, at $250 a bottle.)As part of the deal, Mr. Dedman is staying on as a corporate ambassador and blender for Kentucky Owl, which will remain the company\u2019s premier brand. Mr. Dedman\u2019s operation will sit within a much larger project, also called Kentucky Owl, which will generate a range of whiskeys at different prices, all produced at a sprawling facility in Bardstown.That facility, Kentucky Owl Park, represents the full expression of where American whiskey is headed. Built on a 450-acre limestone quarry, the park will be about much more than making whiskey: A visitor might get a distillery tour in the morning, eat a lakeside lunch, see a live-music show in the afternoon and sleep in a boutique hotel room that night, all without leaving the property.\u201cIt\u2019s about creating that overall experience,\u201d said Rudy Costello, the chief executive of Stoli Group USA, which oversees Mr. Shefler\u2019s American holdings. \u201cWe see the tourism in that area already, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve even scratched the surface.\u201dRight now, the site of the future Kentucky Owl Park is, literally, a hole in the ground; it takes some imagination to picture it as a nirvana of whiskey. But the plan also fits neatly within the overall trajectory of the Kentucky bourbon industry \u2014 a half-dozen distilleries lie within a few minutes\u2019 drive, and all of them are building amenities like restaurants, visitors centers, parks and hotels to cater to a new class of whiskey tourist.The typical distillery was once a utilitarian industrial plant; now it\u2019s a boozy theme park. The recently opened Castle and Key Distillery outside Frankfort, Ky., which took over a defunct distillery site modeled after a medieval castle, sports a botanical trail and a manicured garden. The centerpiece of the new Bardstown Bourbon Company distillery is Bottle & Bond, a minimalist-chic restaurant run by the former chef at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia. Upping the ante, SPI Group hired Shigeru Ban, a Pritzker Prize-winning architect, to design the main buildings at Kentucky Owl Park.For local business leaders, such changes promise to turn the region into something like a Napa Valley of whiskey, a place that combines high-end retailing, resort hotels, fine dining and, flowing through it all, an unending river of tourist dollars.\u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be just an industry; we want it to be a destination,\u201d said Kim Huston, the president of the Bardstown Industrial Development Corporation. Ms. Huston takes the Napa comparison seriously: She travels frequently to Northern California to study how its most famous wine region went from a sleepy agricultural community in the 1980s to being a synonym for high-end living.\u201cWe\u2019re probably where they were 20 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is for Bardstown to play on the world stage of luxury tourism.\u201dNot everyone in the region is on board with these plans. Kentucky is significantly more traditional and rural than a place like Napa, and even deep-pocketed companies like Beam Suntory can\u2019t easily push around social conservatives who bristle at the thought of turning their towns over to tourists, no matter how much money the visitors bring in.But the skeptics might not be able to hold out for long. Bourbon fans are already streaming into the state \u2014 1.2 million people visited its distilleries in 2017, a 20 percent jump from 2016 and almost double the number in 2014, according to the Kentucky Distillers Association.And after years of speculation about a bourbon bubble, distilleries and investors are confident that the expansion is here to stay.\u201cIf you look at the total amount of bourbon sales today, it\u2019s still less than it was in the 1970s, adjusted for inflation,\u201d said Mr. Costello, the Stoli Group USA chief executive. \u201cAnd there is still tremendous opportunity outside the United States, with some big emerging markets starting to tune into American whiskey.\u201dFor Kentucky, the bourbon industry\u2019s rapid change in fortune \u2014 and its transformative effects on the state economy \u2014 is something many still find overwhelming, Mr. Dedman included.For all his business savvy and financial success, he\u2019s still a guy who grew up thinking he\u2019d spend his life running a small hotel in rural Kentucky. \u201cI know what we\u2019re doing is going to have a big footprint and make us a major player,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cBut it\u2019s something I can\u2019t get my head around.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the location of an SPI Group winery.

{"Headline": "\u2018Bear Market\u2019 Is an Arbitrary Label, but Using It Can Hurt", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks came very close to entering a bear market on Christmas Eve, which was a very bad thing. Just about everybody said so.Yet the bear-market label is based on a dangerously unscientific understanding of stock markets. It is dangerous because the designation itself can set off a negative popular narrative that may, in itself, help to fuel a bigger market decline.What happened in December? By Dec. 24, the S&P 500 had fallen 19.8 percent from its peak of September 2018.That was just short of the \u201ctraditional\u201d 20 percent slide that many say defines a bear market. It has been strongly up since then, but still remains down substantially from that peak.This tradition doesn\u2019t amount to much, though. I discovered, through digital search, that the practice of using precise definitions for down markets \u2014 denoting a \u201ccorrection\u201d as a 10 percent decline from a peak and a \u201cbear market\u201d as a 20 percent decline \u2014 is only a little over 30 years old. It dates back to the mid-1980s.People have spoken loosely of bear markets for more than a hundred years, but they didn\u2019t generally attach a 20 percent definition to them.You might think that the precise identification of a bear market occurred because that 20 percent threshold is intrinsically important \u2014 because, for example, there are many times when stock market declines stop at around 20 percent.But, actually, that is not a frequent occurrence. In this century, since 2000, there have been exactly two S&P 500 declines of 20 percent from the market peak \u2014 and both of them continued much further, for a net decline of around 50 percent.The first such decline started in 2000. The S&P 500 peaked on March 24 of that year but by March 12, 2001, it had declined 20 percent, and newspapers duly called the situation a bear market.Sometimes the wording suggested that the market was nearing its bottom. Writers didn\u2019t know the decline was over, but evidently felt comfortable joking about it: \u201cBear Country Good Territory for Stock Hunting,\u201d one headline said.That lighthearted approach was unfortunate because the S&P 500 turned out to be less than halfway through its decline. Ultimately, from its 2000 peak it dropped 49.1 percent through Oct. 9, 2002, before turning up. In real terms, correcting for inflation, that was more than a 50 percent price drop from peak to trough.Then there was the stock market of the Great Recession. The S&P 500 peaked on Oct. 9, 2007. It became a bear market, having declined over 20 percent, on July 11, 2008.Those two episodes tell us something important: The start of a bear market doesn\u2019t mean much. From a historical perspective, it is clear that a 20 percent decline does not predict further market movements with any certainty.That may not have been obvious between 1980 and 1990, when the 20 percent definition of a bear market first became established, because there were then two fairly recent 20 percent declines from S&P 500 peaks that did not precede sharper falls.On March 3, 1982, after dropping 21.1 percent from a Nov. 28, 1980, peak and entering what we would now call bear market territory, the S&P 500 fell only 6 percent further. And after a one-day S&P 500 decline of 20.5 percent on Oct. 19, 1987, the index fell only 0.4 percent further to a trough on Dec. 4, 1987.In short, the mere diagnosis of a bear market doesn\u2019t seem to carry much weight for forecasting future price drops.Yet let\u2019s not dismiss the effects of a bear market declaration too soon. Simply by announcing that we have entered a bear market and repeating that claim in the echo chamber of social media, the designation itself might create psychological unease that could make for market volatility.Popular labels carry emotional content. If the declarations of bear markets are charged with negativity, bull markets are fraught with symbolic and patriotic feelings.Consider the \u201cCharging Bull\u201d sculpture, symbolizing the bull market vigor of the financial markets, by Arturo Di Modica. It was first installed in 1989 in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, in Bowling Green in the financial district of New York.The initial installation of the bull statue caught the popular imagination. It was the second time, according to Google Ngrams, that \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d were really widely used (the first time being in the boom of the 1920s and the 1929 crash).By the same token, the notion that a bear market may be around the corner can be profoundly disruptive. The near-miss diagnosis of a \u201cbear market\u201d on Christmas Eve 2018 seemed to have struck fear and disorientation in many investors, like an inconclusive lab test for a dread disease, making people vulnerable to more pessimistic feelings.Of course, some people may have interpreted the near miss as a clean bill of health, perhaps even a buying opportunity, depending on circumstances and on the narratives they choose to believe.Narratives matter in the stock market, which is, in many ways, a social-psychological barometer. Whether people are exulting about a bull market or running from a bear, volatile emotions are involved. In the next round in the stock market, we will see who outnumbers whom.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Expert Called the Market Plunge. Here\u2019s What He Sees in 2019.", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseA year ago, in the wake of President Trump\u2019s tax cut, euphoric investors pushed the Dow Jones industrial average past 25,000, a record. The Dow had just gained 25 percent in 2017, and the Nasdaq had leapt 28 percent. Volatility was so low that there wasn\u2019t a single day in 2017 when the S&P 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent.Not everyone was celebrating.Mr. Stack turned out to be right. He lowered his recommended asset allocation for United States stocks from 82 percent last January to 72 percent in September, when stocks hit new all-time highs. He urged investors to raise cash in October, and at the end of November he recommended an even more defensive posture \u2014 including putting money in a fund whose value would rise when stock prices dropped. That brought his recommended net exposure to stocks to just 55 percent, the lowest since the depths of the last bear market in early 2009.Yet most economic indicators are benign. Unemployment is an exceptionally low 3.7 percent. Wages are rising. Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target. The Fed raised rates a quarter point in December, citing \u201ca very healthy economy.\u201dGiven Mr. Stack\u2019s track record last year, I reached out to him this week for his current views. Even though valuations have come down and macroeconomic indicators \u201chave remained remarkably strong,\u201d he said, he\u2019s still defensive and hasn\u2019t changed his bearish allocation. He believes that the worst isn\u2019t over and that the Dow and S&P 500 will soon be down 20 percent from their peaks, retreating into a bear market. (The Nasdaq Composite and the Wilshire 2000 index of small-cap stocks are already there.)\u201cA lesson from history is that the market leads the economy by a lot longer than investors realize,\u201d Mr. Stack said. If the economy is headed toward recession, as the latest stock market declines suggest it may be, \u201cwe won\u2019t see the first economic warning signs until the first three to five months\u201d of 2019. Among the leading indicators he\u2019s watching for signs of weakness are consumer confidence, housing starts and unemployment claims.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index, a leading indicator of industrial activity, fell sharply. That suggests that \u201cserious cracks\u201d are starting to appear in the economy, Mr. Stack said.That\u2019s when bear markets are, in fact, followed by recessions, which often isn\u2019t the case. As the economist Paul Samuelson famously said, \u201cThe stock market has forecast nine of the last five recessions.\u201dSince World War II, there have been 13 bear markets. They were followed within a year by a recession just seven times. As a predictor of recessions with just 54 percent accuracy, bear markets are little better than flipping a coin.Indeed, Mr. Stack\u2019s data show that two or more down years in a row are quite rare: There have been only four instances since 1928, suggesting that stocks may well be in positive territory by the end of 2019, even if a bear market does materialize in the meantime.Which is one reason the Wharton economist Jeremy Siegel told me that he\u2019s bullish on the stock market this year. He predicts it could rise between 5 percent and 15 percent, even if there is an economic slowdown.Stocks are much cheaper now than they were before the December sell-off. The ratio between stock prices and projected earnings for companies in the S&P 500 is about 17, down from over 19 a year ago and the lowest in the past five years.Mr. Stack, however, argued that in the event of an economic downturn \u2014 or even a significant slowdown \u2014 \u201cthose projected earnings will go out the window.\u201d\u201cI would not call today\u2019s market undervalued,\u201d he added.Mr. Siegel bases his forecast of a market rally on the belief that the Fed will stop raising short-term interest rates. \u201cI think the Fed got the message from the markets that it should not have hiked in December,\u201d he said.Mr. Stack, too, said he was surprised the Fed raised rates in December. \u201cI think the Fed will stand down and put future rate increases on hold,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich could stabilize the market, at least for the time being.\u201dBut Mr. Stack\u2019s technical indicators are still pointing toward a bear market. He\u2019s also worried about the shaky housing market, with price drops and slowing sales showing up in major cities.\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to time the market, but we\u2019re very comfortable with our defensive allocation,\u201d he said. Although he predicted higher volatility a year ago, he was nonetheless surprised by the extremes reached in December, without even \u201ca single hard warning sign of recession on the horizon.\u201d\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d he asked, \u201chow volatile it will be when we do have those warnings?\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the name of a research firm. It is InvesTech Research, not InvestTech. The error was repeated in a picture caption. The column also misstated what has happened since 1928 with regard to the stock market, according to James Stack\u2019s data. There have been four instances when stocks have been two or more years in a row, not four instances when they have been down just two years in a row.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Some Funds Win When Others Lose. But When the Others Win \u2026", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a shaky stock market, you may be enticed by funds that promise to make money whenever stocks fall.There is a group of funds that actually fulfill this claim. Yet most people should beware: They are definitely not recommended for the casual investor.They are called inverse exchange-traded funds, and as their name implies, their value moves in the opposite direction of their benchmarks. When the stock market rises, they fall; when the market falls, they rise.In addition, some of these funds are leveraged, which means that they bet against their benchmarks by a factor of, say, two to one or three to one.Take the ProShares UltraPro Short S&P 500, an inverse fund that shorts the S&P 500-stock index at three-to-one leverage. On Dec. 17, the E.T.F. closed up $2.63 for a gain of 6.10 percent for the day while the S&P 500 fell 2.08 percent. (Because of fees and other issues, index funds, inverse or not, typically don\u2019t track indexes exactly.)But those impressive results don\u2019t come easy. Inverse E.T.F.s aren\u2019t designed for the average do-it-yourself investor. You aren\u2019t likely to find them offered in your 401(k) for a good reason: Inverse E.T.F.s can quickly destroy the value in a portfolio.Instead, inverse E.T.F.s are designed to function as a very short-term trading strategy for extremely knowledgeable investors.\u201cThese funds are built for short-term speculation. They\u2019re designed to be outliers,\u201d said Paul Justice, director of data methodology for Morningstar. \u201cIndividual investors find their way into these products, and if they\u2019re not careful about their holding periods, they can be in for an unpleasant surprise. And the more leveraged the fund is, the more unpleasant the surprise will be.\u201dAt first blush, an E.T.F. that gains when the market falls may sound like an easy way to hedge a portfolio without resorting to more complicated strategies involving options and short-selling. Leveraged E.T.F.s offer the potential for greater rewards (and, naturally, risks) without the need to open a margin account and run the chance that, if the market moves in the opposite direction, the investor could be forced to raise cash by liquidating profitable holdings, triggering taxes on any gains, as well as possible fees.The benefits of an inverse E.T.F. can be valuable \u2014 but only for a day at a time, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com.\u201cThis is trading, not investing,\u201d he said. \u201cInverse E.T.F.s are designed to track daily movements, not long-term movements.\u201dMr. McBride added: \u201cIf you have an inverse S&P 500 E.T.F., it\u2019s designed to rise 1 percent today if the S&P 500 falls 1 percent today. But if the S&P is down 5 percent over the next 12 months, don\u2019t expect the inverse to be up 5 percent.\u201dConsider that while the S&P 500 was down about 5 percent for the year as of mid-December, the ProShares UltraPro Short S&P 500 had a year-to-date loss of 18 percent. By the close of trading for the year, however, the UltraPro ETF was up 2.3 percent for the year, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s loss of 6.2 percent. Although the fund did finish up, it was well off its three-to-one short ratio for the year.That\u2019s because inverse funds are rebalanced at the end of each trading day to restore the targeted risk exposure. Over more than a day or two, that daily reset can compound the fund\u2019s exposure to a dangerous degree. Yet the fund\u2019s benchmark simply continues to make daily gains or losses with no rebalancing, said John Swolfs, chief executive of Inside E.T.F.s, a four-day, 200-speaker annual conference on E.T.F.s organized by Informa Exhibitions USA.\u201cIf you can pick and choose your days right, you can do well,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you think you\u2019ll buy this on Monday and sell it on Friday, your returns won\u2019t be good.\u201dPro Shares offers 62 inverse E.T.F.s, said Michael Sapir, the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThey\u2019ve been tested through the tech boom and the financial crisis, and they all acted to do what they advertise,\u201d he said.Even so, for individual investors looking to protect themselves from market reversals, better strategies probably include conservative asset allocation with holdings of bonds and even cash.\u201cIf you\u2019re sitting on the trading desk at one of the big Wall Street banks, this is probably something you\u2019re very familiar with and it\u2019s not your first rodeo,\u201d Mr. McBride of Bankrate.com said. \u201cBut for the individual investor, short-term strategies are just a fancy way of saying \u2018market timing.\u2019 And the biggest danger individual investors have is themselves.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consider Firing Your Male Broker", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYears of research show female investors outperform men. But only about 1 in 5 brokers are women.Ms. duQuesnay is an investment adviser.When people picture a financial adviser, they typically think of a gray-haired guy who looks like Bernie Madoff, or perhaps a younger man like Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character in \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d The imagined portrait rarely resembles someone like me, a woman. And that underlying perception is fairly accurate.Roughly less than 20 percent of financial advisers are women, a number that has barely budged for the past two decades despite rising gender equity in other fields. But what has this overwhelmingly male work force accomplished?Clare Francis, a director at Barclays Smart Investor, agreed with the researchers, who attributed the difference in performance to women\u2019s judiciousness. \u201cThe stock market is often portrayed as a high-energy, risky environment,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this analysis shows that taking a more long-term view about what to invest in, rather than picking eye-catching and potentially more volatile shares, is actually likely to provide a better return on your money.\u201dAs a result, finance in general, and the financial advice field in particular, continues to be viewed as an industry plagued with slick con artists. And it\u2019s a shame because as much as we may trust our best friends and close relatives, we rarely disclose to them that most private and sensitive aspect of our personal information: the state of our money. That discretion is instead placed with your financial adviser, who ideally is one of the good guys (or gals) in your life.He listens first. You can calculate to the penny how much you paid for his services last year. His company adheres to the fiduciary standard of putting clients\u2019 interests first. Your financial plan does not conveniently lean on products that happen to pay him a hefty sales commission. Usually, you\u2019re the one calling back, because he\u2019s anticipating your needs before they arise.While gendering any ability or trait can make people uncomfortable in these forward-thinking times, which sex seems better equipped to help families nurture and protect their nest egg?The gender gap in finance looks increasingly like not only an ethical quandary but also a financial blow to millions of households. And its persistence stems from both explicit historical exclusion and a self-selecting process, in which the crowd most attracted to finance\u2019s clubby reputation pushes hardest to get in, then feels most at ease once there, perpetuating the reality.Two generations ago, when newspapers still ran gender-segregated ads, there were virtually no women on Wall Street aside from the secretaries. But once women were grudgingly welcomed to the business world, Wall Street was not their first choice. Male brokers largely worked for commissions alone \u2014 an \u201ceat what you kill\u201d mentality that did not appeal to women. Instead, professional women gravitated to stable sources of income in fields like law, education or medicine.The public doesn\u2019t perceive brokers as loyal stewards of their clients and neither do enough young women considering career options. First, they\u2019ll need to see it to believe it.Informal mentorship is great, but women need institutional advocacy, not just someone who is willing to grab a cup of coffee and chat. Firms should also take a look at their investment committee members and client-facing advisers. If they\u2019re mainly men, there\u2019s a problem.Advertisement"}

Late Wednesday it reduced its revenue forecast for its most recent quarter because of a significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China.Apple\u2019s stock fell 10 percent on Thursday, its worst one-day slide in six years. But the warning also rippled across its many suppliers.The chip makers Micron Technology and Advanced Micro Devices fell 5 percent and 9 percent.

Even before Apple\u2019s warning \u2014 its first in 16 years \u2014 investors had started to grow worried about the company\u2019s ability to sell more phones.That\u2019s partly because Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Lumentum and AMS had all already cut their revenue forecasts for the most recent quarter late last year.

Over a three-day period in mid-November, Apple\u2019s stock fell 9 percent after the warnings of Qorvo, Lumentum and AMS.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Tech May Look Troubled, but It\u2019s Just Getting Started", "Date": "2019-01-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled.In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash \u2014 Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank \u2014 to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.That is not the path the companies are taking.\u201cThe tech companies are not flinching,\u201d said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. \u201cNothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They\u2019re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.\u201dTo accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn\u2019t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.In total, Google\u2019s employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook\u2019s work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.\u201cFor all intents and purposes, we\u2019re only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. \u201cThe image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.\u201dThat\u2019s evident in how robust Big Tech\u2019s businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone \u2014 up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.\u201cMuch as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have a good clue,\u201d said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. \u201cThey\u2019re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.\u201dWhich leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech\u2019s favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon\u2019s North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.\u201cThey\u2019re in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,\u201d said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. \u201cThere is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Wants a Market Downturn? These Investors Actually Do", "Date": "2019-01-06", "News": "Some venture capitalists are rooting for a market dip to calm Silicon Valley\u2019s overheated start-up scene.Supported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Vini Letteri, a managing director at KKR who invests in tech companies, had a slow 2018.Mr. Letteri, a venture capitalist who manages a $714 million fund, tried to put some of that money into 12 tech start-ups last year \u2014 but failed when they demanded too rich a price. In some cases, he said, his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 percent. The only investment he led in 2018 was a $360 million deal in OutSystems, a software company in Atlanta.So here\u2019s what Mr. Letteri is not-so-secretly hoping for in 2019: a downturn in the private start-up market.\u201cWhen the market turns, we\u2019re prepared to be more aggressive,\u201d he said. He added that he had sketched out a \u201cdownturn list\u201d of 150 targets \u2014 including financial tech, cybersecurity, and consumer internet companies \u2014 in case they become cheaper.Mr. Letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated start-up scene. For the past few years, Silicon Valley tech start-ups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations. Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists, who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later.While it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the start-up market, many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn. Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee. And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year.\u201cWe definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn,\u201d said Sandy Miller, a venture capitalist at IVP who projects that start-up valuations will fall by 10 percent to 40 percent this year. He said his Silicon Valley venture firm has set aside \u201cmeaningful reserves\u201d to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in, though he declined to specify an amount.\u201cThere\u2019s too much heat around good, not necessarily great, companies\u201d that are older, said Mamoon Hamid, a partner at the venture firm Kleiner Perkins. Even one \u201cgood, not great\u201d company he recently met with had 13 investment offers, he said. The upshot: Kleiner did not invest.Greg Sands, a managing partner at Costanoa Ventures, said his venture firm walked away from three investments in 2018 where the price was 30 percent higher than he was willing to pay, an increase from past years. He also screened out numerous companies that were asking for more money than seemed reasonable \u2014 yet some of those companies then went on to raise triple that amount from other investors.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now isn\u2019t sustainable and it won\u2019t go on forever. It can\u2019t,\u201d he said. Costanoa raised a $75 million \u201copportunity fund,\u201d, which Mr. Sands said would give it the ability to do more deals when the market cools down.Many other venture capital firms are also in a position to become more aggressive in case of a market downturn. Venture funds raised $30.2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, on track to surpass 2017\u2019s total of $35.3 billion, according to PitchBook, a data provider.Start-up founders also appear to be preparing for a potential shift in fortunes. In a survey conducted late last year by First Round Capital, a venture capital firm, just under half of 529 entrepreneurs said they expected fund-raising to become more difficult in 2019. A third said they believed the tech bubble was close to popping, a 10-point increase over 2017.Some start-ups are raising more money to weather the uncertainty, according to Kirsten Green, a managing partner at Forerunner Ventures. Others are creating backup plans to cut costs so their survival won\u2019t depend on new funding.\u201cYou always want a better market,\u201d said Micah Rosenbloom, a managing partner at Founder Collective, which was an early investor in Uber. \u201cIn a crisis, everything gets hard. You\u2019d rather have your companies in good times for everything from hiring to sales.\u201dStill, Mr. Rosenbloom said he also saw opportunity in a downturn. His firm\u2019s two most successful investments \u2014 Uber and the Trade Desk, a digital advertising company \u2014 were created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.In previous downturns, the less serious entrepreneurs disappeared, leaving the most committed ones, said David Pakman, a partner at venture firm Venrock. \u201cDuring those periods, some incredible companies were founded by highly determined entrepreneurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cream rose to the top.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.T.F.s Try to Lure Investors Into Ever Narrower Niches", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExchange-traded funds became the next big thing in portfolio management a couple of decades ago by being cheaper and easier to trade than mutual funds.These days, some managers are offering E.T.F.s as tools for specialization at the expense of diversification, carving up the stock market into ever thinner slices for investors eager to find other next big things.E.T.F.s have evolved from covering only broad indexes, such as the S&P 500, to sectors like energy and health care, industries like homebuilding and gold mining, and lately to subsets of industries \u2014 niches within niches \u2014 often in ultracool areas like robotics, cybersecurity and video gaming that capture investors\u2019 imaginations and then their money.While investment advisers occasionally use thematic funds when managing assets for their clients, they typically encourage small investors to avoid the practice, no matter how enticing it might be to try to find the next Amazon, Netflix or Google before it becomes a technological colossus.\u201cWe would prefer that someone build a portfolio around more diversified funds,\u201d said Jason Browne, chief investment strategist of the FundX Investment Group, a firm that manages fund portfolios for high-net-worth individuals. He warned: \u201cIf you\u2019re an average investor, you will probably look back and think this is something you were sold and not something thoughtfully invested in that\u2019s aligned with your long-term goals.\u201dLike Mr. Browne, Christopher Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, a Morristown, N.J., financial-planning firm, said he sees more fund marketing than fund management at work with narrowly focused E.T.F.s.\u201cIt sort of reminds me of \u2018The Graduate,\u2019 when the guy takes Benjamin aside and says, \u2018I\u2019ve got one word: plastics,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. Providers of these funds \u201care looking for things that sound good to people, then they give them an itch they\u2019ll want to scratch.\u201dSam Masucci, chief executive of the ETF Managers Group, which manages about $3 billion across 12 thematic portfolios, said funds dedicated to such narrow market segments are especially dependent on investor demand and are introduced in areas experiencing a surge in popularity.His company\u2019s thematic funds are a mix of actively managed and passively managed portfolios. In addition to cybersecurity and gaming funds, they cover some highly focused, even obscure, industries, including mobile payments and drone technology. And for anyone worried that all that cutting-edge technology will make human beings too efficient and productive, the company also offers the Alternative Harvest fund, which invests in companies involved in marijuana production.Anyone interested in these areas, despite admonitions like Mr. Browne\u2019s, has several alternatives to choose from.A recent report on thematic E.T.F.s by Todd Rosenbluth, director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA Research, highlighted two gaming funds \u2014 VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports, and ETFMG Video Game Tech \u2014 and two that invest in cybersecurity: ETFMG Prime Cyber Security and First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity.The report also mentioned four that cover the burgeoning field of robotics: ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index, Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence.The performance of many of them last year illustrates the perils of owning an idea that would seem to have a lot of promise but so far has not delivered on it. The S&P 500 fell 6.2 percent last year, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, a benchmark for technology stocks, lost 3.9 percent. The ETFMG gaming fund lagged both indexes badly, losing 18.8 percent, while the VanEck gaming fund was down 12.6 percent just since its introduction in mid-October.The cybersecurity funds did much better. ETFMG Prime Security rose 6.5 percent in 2018, and the First Trust fund eked out a 1.3 percent gain.As for the robotics portfolios, their returns have been awful. None of the four came close to matching the Nasdaq index. Losses last year ranged between 14 percent and 29 percent.Because interest in these areas tends to come and go, Mr. Browne uses thematic E.T.F.s to carry out short-term asset allocation decisions. Haim Israel, head of thematic investing at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, by contrast, views several technologies covered by the E.T.F.s as long-term opportunities.The business and investment prospects associated with themes like Big Data, artificial intelligence, privacy and cyberthreats, the report said, will be helped by a \u201ctechceleration\u201d resulting from the introduction of so-called 5G technology featuring much faster data transmission rates. The rollout of 5G \u201cwill bring about the fastest transformation in human history,\u201d Mr. Israel predicted. The reduced time it will take to transmit data will help the spread of all sorts of technologies, like gaming or self-driving cars, he said.Mr. Israel\u2019s analysis and outlook are plausible \u2014 for the world as it is today and for various technologies as they have developed so far. As for five years from now, who knows? Change, often radical and unforeseeable, is a hallmark of the sector, making most forecasts speculative at best. That is one of the main complaints that investment advisers have with thematic E.T.F.s.\u201cWe\u2019ve been around long enough to see a lot of the \u2018next big thing,\u2019 said Leon LaBrecque, chief executive of LJPR Financial Advisors in Troy, Mich. \u201cRemember Blockbuster or Boston Chicken? Anyone remember the first search engine? New tech becomes old tech.\u201dFor investors interested in taking a shot with thematic E.T.F.s, advisers suggest using risk capital, and then only small amounts of it.Mr. Masucci views thematic E.T.F.s as superior alternatives to buying individual stocks. These E.T.F.s \u201care a tax efficient, liquid, transparent way to give that exposure without relying on advisers\u2019 ability to pick stocks,\u201d he said.But Mr. Cordaro pointed to a conundrum that anyone contemplating investing in thematic E.T.F.s faces: \u201cBecause they can be riskier, you wouldn\u2019t want them to be too much of your portfolio,\u201d no more than 5 percent, he said. \u201cThe paradox is that\u2019s not going to move the needle that much. You\u2019re not going to make much money on it.\u201dIf you still want to try to move the needle, he advises doing it with funds that emphasize smaller, younger businesses that are pure plays in a particular niche and that don\u2019t fill their portfolios with established companies that only dabble in fledgling technology.Mr. Rosenbluth noted in his report, for instance, that the VanEck and ETFMG gaming funds both hold the gaming stocks Activision and Electronic Arts, but only the ETFMG fund owns the larger, more diversified tech stocks Apple and Microsoft. By contrast, the ETFMG cybersecurity portfolio is more skewed toward smaller software companies than First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity, while the latter holds more in big defense companies like Raytheon than the ETFMG fund does.As for the robotics funds, the two with portfolios published on third-party sites like Morningstar\u2019s, ROBO Global Robotics and Global X Robotics, each own big companies like Nvidia and Intuitive Surgical, and smaller ones like Helix Energy Solutions.In the end, the most effective way to invest in the next big thing may be to avoid trying to do it through thematic E.T.F.s at all.\u201cWhy even go for that ride is the question,\u201d Mr. Browne said. When you own a diversified fund, \u201cwhatever drives the economy is going to be in your portfolio. It doesn\u2019t rely on your or my predictions of what that\u2019s going to be.\u201dMr. LaBrecque recommended a similarly broad, simple approach.\u201cWe can buy the S&P 500 and get the new FANGs,\u201d a reference to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, \u201cand the next acronym of choice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we can get the companies that make all the stuff people buy on Amazon, and the cars people drive to the store to buy the food to eat while they watch Netflix. And when the next thing comes along, we can own that, as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the risk is that the plunge, the worst annual decline in a decade, could be the start of something more sinister.The forces that pushed the S&P 500 down 6.2 percent in 2018 are still in place. The economy is still doing well, but it does not appear to be as strong as it once was. President Trump is lashing out at the Federal Reserve and the central bank\u2019s interest-rate increases pose a risk to corporate profits and investors\u2019 appetite for stocks. America\u2019s trade war with China continues, and the technology giants that dominate the stock market face heightened scrutiny about their business practices.As investors try to gauge the seriousness of these risks, stocks could lurch in different directions at each new event. A meeting of the Fed later this month, an earnings report in February or a trade-negotiation deadline in March could all prove to be catalysts for a big rise or fall.But Wall Street\u2019s top stock pickers are still expecting gains this year, even if they\u2019re not quite as boisterous in their predictions as they once were.\u201cIt could get more frightening before it gets better,\u201d said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the research firm Leuthold Group. \u201cBut I think we survive for another run.\u201dLast year was a reminder of how unpredictable stock markets can be. In January, with corporate tax cuts in place, the outlook for the market in the United States was great. And stocks did hit a record high in September, with Apple and Amazon becoming the first publicly traded American companies to be valued at more than $1 trillion. But 2018 was also turbulent, with markets falling sharply in February and again at the end of the year.The S&P 500 narrowly avoided one grim milestone: a 20 percent drop from its high, a decline that would signal the start of a bear market. The index ended 2018 down 14.5 percent from its high point, and a bear market could yet be in store should stocks experience another decline similar to what they went through in early December. If that happens, the pessimism that has hovered over the stock market could leach into the rest of the economy, as companies grow wary of taking risks, expanding or adding more workers.Here are the factors that will help determine whether that happens this year.Interest rates in 20183.5%10-year Treasury note yield3.02.52.01.51.00.50Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.Interest rates in 20183.5%10-year treasury note yield3.02.52.01.51.00.50JFMAMJJASONDInterest rates in 20183.5%10-year Treasury note yield3.02.52.01.51.00.50Jan.Feb.Mar.Apr.MayJun.Jul.Aug.Sep.Oct.Nov.Dec.Rising interest rates, and expectations about where those rates are headed, may have weighed on stock prices more than anything else in 2018.With the United States\u2019s economy humming, the Fed increased its target rate four times in 2018, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which is the basis for debt like home mortgages and corporate loans, climbed to its highest level since 2011 before falling back. When borrowing costs rise too much, they can be restrictive. Companies and consumers pull back, and the economy suffers.In the worst case, a recession could occur.Stocks tumbled as investors became increasingly concerned that the Fed, under a new chairman, Jerome H. Powell, would raise interest rates too far and send a chill through the American economy.Only more data on the state of the economy will ease the concerns about growth. If investors see the economy growing steadily, jitters over the Fed\u2019s intentions and the recession fears that gripped stocks could fade.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see if the market was wildly hysterical about a recession,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research.If not, then investors could hang on the Fed\u2019s every move, and monetary policy meeting, in 2019.Heading into 2018, in the days after Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts were enacted, investors were mostly buoyant about his presidency and tolerant of his unpredictable declarations on Twitter.That bullishness persisted even after it became clear that Mr. Trump was serious about imposing restrictions on trading partners as a way of gaining concessions from them. But as the trade war continued, unresolved tensions with China started to become a concern, and Mr. Trump\u2019s proclamations started to make investors jumpy.When Mr. Trump referred to himself on Twitter as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d the message helped spur a drop of more than 3 percent in the S&P 500.....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAINIt wasn\u2019t just the tweets about China that began to bother investors. Mr. Trump also roiled the markets with criticism of the Fed, which he blamed for the stock market turmoil.This is a change for the market. When the investment bank RBC Capital Markets surveyed big investors in December about what kept them up at night, Mr. Trump topped the list (interest rates and the trade war ranked second and third).The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch - he can\u2019t putt!When it comes to Mr. Trump, investors have a lot to consider. They will have to weigh whether a partial government shutdown will dampen the economy; what a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats or staff turnover at the White House could mean; and what might happen if the United States and China can\u2019t reach a trade deal by a March 2 deadline.Commodity prices in 2018PRICE OF OILPRICE OF COPPER$100a barrel$4.00per poundBrent crude futures contractsGeneric futures contracts$3.28803.00$66.8760$2.682.00$54.15401.002000JFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJASONDCommodity prices in 2018PRICE OF OIL$100a barrel80$66.8760Brent crudefutures contracts$54.1540JFMAMJJASONDPRICE OF COPPER3.50per pound$$3.283.00$2.682.50Genericfutures contracts2.00JFMAMJJASONDCommodity prices in 2018PRICE OF OILPRICE OF COPPER$100a barrel$4.00per poundBrent crude futures contractsGeneric futures contracts$3.28803.00$66.8760$2.682.00$54.15401.002000JFMAMJJASONDJFMAMJJASONDThe trade war\u2019s most evident impact so far has been in large overseas economies, which appear to be taking a turn for the worse.China, Japan and the European Union showed signs of slowing down late in 2018, and reliable indicators of global growth like the price of oil and copper are flashing warnings.The European economy could also be hit hard if Britain crashes out of the European Union without an agreement that keeps trade flowing freely. That could be avoided if Parliament approves a withdrawal deal Prime Minister Theresa May has struck with the union. But that is no sure thing. Mrs. May, lacking the necessary support, was forced to delay a vote originally set for last month until mid-January. She has been trying, so far unsuccessfully, to extract changes from European officials in hopes of improving the chances of passage when that vote comes.If Parliament ultimately rejects Mrs. May\u2019s proposal, investors will probably remain nervous. And support may grow among lawmakers for a second referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union. If that happens, stocks \u2014 including those in the United States \u2014 may rise on the hope that Britons vote to stay.Technology stocks versus the S&P 500 in 2018+100%Netflix+75Amazon+50Microsoft+25AppleGoogleS&P 5000Facebook\u201325+25%0S&P 500\u201325\u201350Technology stocks versus the S&P 500 in 2018+100%Netflix+75Amazon+50Microsoft+25AppleGoogleS&P 5000Facebook\u201325+25%0S&P 500\u201325\u201350Technology stocks versus theS&P 500 in 2018PERCENT CHANGE FROM+100%Netflix+75Amazon+50Microsoft+25AppleGoogleS&P 5000Facebook\u201325+25%0S&P 500\u201325\u201350The market\u2019s fate also depends on whether investors fall back in love with large technology companies. Last year, companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix helped push key stock benchmarks like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to records, and then dragged those indexes down when the companies went into free-fall.The tech giants\u2019 shares plunged in part because they were deemed to be too expensive. Put another way, investors went from being optimistic that the companies\u2019 future earnings would be terrific, to worried that they wouldn\u2019t.Some of the large tech firms also face substantial problems in their own operations that could take time to resolve. Apple, for example, counts on China as both a market where it sells iPhones and a manufacturing hub.Facebook is spending large sums of money to try to protect its network from interference. Any sign that its systems have been abused with the goal of swinging an election could subject it to regulation.Facebook is not alone in facing this concern. Some analysts say that large tech companies are now in a position to similar to what big banks confronted after the financial crisis of 2008.\u201cThe tech companies are a heck of a lot better run than the financial companies were in 2007,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, \u201cbut their incentives may not be aligned with the best interests of employees and shareholders.\u201dThe United States economy has to grow at a strong enough pace to deliver the corporate earnings that investors are hoping for.

{"Headline": "Washington State Bans Sale of Semiautomatic Assault Rifles to Those Under 21", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople under 21 are no longer able to buy semiautomatic assault rifles in Washington as of Jan 1. It is the first of several new state measures intended to reduce gun violence. The National Rifle Association has already filed suit.Previously, state law barred the assault weapons\u2019 sale to those under 18. The new rules, approved by voters in a ballot initiative in November, come alongside dozens of moves by other states to strengthen gun control regulations in the absence of federal action.\u201cIt is a meaningful step in the right direction,\u201d said Christian Heyne, legislative director at the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, on Washington\u2019s initiative. \u201cGun violence on the whole is such a complex problem. We need to have complex solutions, comprehensive solutions. This is a part of that conversation.\u201dIn addition to the age restrictions, Washington\u2019s new rules state that gun dealers must wait 10 days before delivering semiautomatic assault rifles they sell. That is designed, in part, to prevent impulsive action. The rules also require anyone buying a semiautomatic assault rifle to have completed a gun safety training in the last five years. The measure also imposes criminal penalties for unsafe gun storage, and requires more extensive background checks for purchases of the assault weapons.Most of the new rules take effect in July.\u201cEvery component is extremely important,\u201d said Renee Hopkins, chief executive of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, the group that sponsored the ballot initiative. \u201cThis package really looks to reduce suicide, reduce accidental shootings and also reduce everyday gun violence, interpersonal gun violence, that we see playing out.\u201dMr. Heyne said Washington\u2019s move, while not unique, is a \u201cbellwether\u201d for what could happen in the rest of the country.Ms. Hopkins said that existing laws already ban the sale of handguns to those under 21, and that the age change for semiautomatic assault rifles seeks to make the law consistent for the different type of firearms.Gun control figured heavily in the 2018 election, as gun control groups outspent the N.R.A. Congress has generally failed to pass any meaningful legislation. A federal ban on the manufacture of certain \u201cassault weapons\u201d took effect in 1994. It expired in 2004.Gun rights organizations have succeeded in blocking other proposals at the federal level. And they are vowing to fight the states as well.The N.R.A. did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday after the law took effect.\u201cThe gun lobby is trying to thwart the will of nearly 60 percent of Washingtonian voters who supported common-sense gun reform in our state,\u201d Bob Ferguson, the state attorney general, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cWe were not surprised the gun lobby filed a lawsuit. I look forward to representing the people of the State of Washington in court against the N.R.A.\u201dFollow Mihir Zaveri on Twitter: @MihirZaveri.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The $238 Million Penthouse, and the Hedge Fund Billionaire Who May Rarely Live There", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Manhattan, where multimillion-dollar real estate sales are downright routine, a hedge fund tycoon has managed to set a new standard for conspicuous consumption by paying a fortune for an unfinished piece of property in the sky.With a net worth estimated at $10 billion, Mr. Griffin, founder and chief executive of the global investment firm Citadel, is among the richest people in the world. And in recent years, Mr. Griffin has become increasingly willing to flaunt his wealth, spending lavishly on modern art, philanthropy and trophy real estate, even as income inequality is roiling the national political debate.Twice divorced, Mr. Griffin, 50, has three children and is primarily based in Chicago, where Citadel is headquartered. Through a spokesman, Mr. Griffin declined to comment for this story.He is a globe-trotting home buyer, leaving a trail of his pricey purchases, from a $60 million penthouse in Miami to a $122 million mansion in London.All told, according to a person familiar with Mr. Griffin\u2019s spending, he has spent approximately $700 million on real estate and nearly as much on art.But Mr. Griffin has given away about $700 million, according to the person familiar with his finances.Mr. Griffin has also donated huge sums to educational institutions.In 2014 he gave $150 million to Harvard University, at the time, the largest gift in the school\u2019s history. In 2017 Mr. Griffin\u2019s charity said it would donate $125 million to the University of Chicago, which would rename its influential department of economics after him. More recently, Mr. Griffin has turned his acquisitive eye toward real estate.Fellow financiers said Mr. Griffin should be applauded for his philanthropy, rather than vilified for his spending. John W. Rogers Jr., the chief executive of Ariel Investments, who serves on the board of the University of Chicago with Mr. Griffin (as well as on the board of The New York Times Company), declined to comment on his real estate spending. \u201cThe key thing is that he\u2019s decided to be generous now,\u201d Mr. Rogers said. \u201cKen is a role model for the next generation of hedge fund managers.\u201dMr. Griffin has cited his maternal grandparents as inspiration for his philanthropy. They ran a fuel oil business in Illinois, and when some customers could not pay their bills during the winter, his grandparents would extend them credit.The Harvard graduate made his fortune through finance. As a sophomore in 1987, Mr. Griffin began trading out of his dorm room using a fax machine, an early personal computer and the phone. Just three years later, he founded Citadel in Chicago.The firm grew rapidly, and today Citadel, which is privately held, manages some $28 billion, trading stocks, fixed income, commodities and more.Wall Street\u2019s compensations have made New York look like a Monopoly board come to life; there are so many ultraluxury residential buildings along the southern edge of Central Park that it has been nicknamed \u201cBillionaire\u2019s Row.\u201dThat Mr. Griffin is spending so freely at a moment when populist movements are gaining momentum around the globe struck some critics as especially tone deaf.\u201cThe plutocrats continue brazenly flaunting the excesses that have enraged much of humanity,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, author of \u201cWinners Take All,\u201d and a critic of wealthy philanthropists. \u201cThey\u2019re displaying very little awareness of the moment that we are in.\u201dMr. de Blasio, who has promoted himself as a national voice against income inequality, has struggled to address the issue, which is acute in a city with a housing crisis, poverty and extreme wealth. About 79,000 people, most trapped by out-of-reach rents and low wages, are homeless, a record number, and the most of any city in the United States, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\u201cYou look at these massive purchases. Does anyone think that these rich individuals can\u2019t afford more in taxes? They have been getting tax break, after tax break, after tax break. Before the Trump tax bill they were already experiencing unprecedented wealth and had a whole system of tax policy that was favoring them in every conceivable way,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \u201cThe Trump tax cuts put that on steroids.\u201dMr. Griffin questioned the Trump tax cuts in 2017, suggesting that they were more aggressive than what was needed to stimulate the economy. Mr. Griffin \u2014 who in 2012 said that the wealthy have \u201cinsufficient influence\u201d in politics \u2014 has given to both Democrats and Republicans over the years, though his fiscal policies appear more closely aligned with those usually promoted by conservative lawmakers. He has called for fewer regulations and lower taxes, arguing that such moves would help the economy.He was well-known in wealthy, philanthropic and financial communities. But Mr. Griffin is now known more widely as the man who bought the penthouse for the outrageous price.There was nothing ostentatious about the old building, the one that was mostly demolished by 2013, save for the sought-after address and the spectacular leafy views of Central Park. It first opened in 1954.A state law gives landlords the right to remove tenants from rent-stabilized apartments if they plan to demolish a building and erect a new one, showing proof of financing to do so. Residents received their first eviction notices in 2006. A group of tenants, calling themselves the \u201cSave Our Homes\u201d Association, held on for as long as possible, suing to stay, but eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.Connie Collins, a former TV journalist who worked at WNBC, was one of the holdouts. She recalled being able to see the July 4 fireworks displays from her 12th-floor terrace. \u201cI just hope one of his terraces doesn\u2019t get burnt from a spark because it\u2019s so far up,\u201d said Ms. Collins, 71. She said her monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment was a little over $2,000 when she moved in 2008. \u201cIt was a great time and an affordable time,\u201d she said.Cathy Marshall was also one of the tenants in the old building who stayed as long as possible; she lived there for 36 years. She was in a rear apartment on the eighth floor, so she missed out on the scenic views, but she enjoyed being on the route of the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade and the New York City Marathon. \u201cPeople on your floor, if you were sick, they went down and got you soup,\u201d she said.\u201cI was very happy there. But change happens.\u201dAn earlier version of this article described incorrectly the gift Kenneth Griffin gave to Harvard. It was the largest ever given in 2014, it was not the largest ever as of today.Jeffery C. Mays and Matt Phillips contributed reporting. Susan C. Beachy contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Tariffs Stained the Washing Machine Market", "Date": "2019-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA year after the Trump administration tried to help American manufacturers of laundry equipment, prices are up, sales have fallen and stock prices are down. You may not have appreciated it at the time \u2014 golden eras have a habit of coming and going like that \u2014 but a five-year stretch that started in 2013 was a pretty great time to buy a washing machine. Inflation for home laundry equipment, as measured by the Labor Department, fell steadily during that time, which meant you could buy the same washer your neighbor bought last year for less money. Or you could buy a better one at the same price. Great news for your clothes, though maybe bad news for your friendship, if your neighbor was the covetous type. Then things went bad.Many manufacturers passed those higher costs on to consumers. Once stores worked their way through models that had been imported before tariffs hit, deflation gave way to sharp price increases. A basic rule of economics is that when the price of something goes up, people buy less of it. That\u2019s just what happened to washing machines.Data from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers shows that shipments of washing machines increased by an average of 5 percent a year from 2015 to 2017. Last year, shipments fell 3 percent.Retailers saw that reaction in real time. \u201cWe have seen, as you mentioned, tariffs\u2019 impact in laundry,\u201d Craig Menear, the chairman and chief executive of the Home Depot, told analysts on an earnings call in November.The three-month average for laundry equipment inflation peaked in July, at 20 percent. In December, that increase was just 1.6 percent. This makes sense, economically: Tariffs jolted prices upward, but the overall trend in the appliance industry remains downward. If your neighbor bought a new washer last June and you buy the same one this June, there\u2019s a decent chance it will be cheaper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bond Market Comes to Its Senses ", "Date": "2019-01-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors are wising up to the bubble in risky corporate bonds. But it may be too late for companies that took on more debt than they can handle.Mr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.Smart investors are now turning the tables. For issuers of risky debt securities, the past few months have been very difficult. They haven\u2019t been able to sell new debt at the low interest rates they have been enjoying for nearly a decade. For a hypothetical company issuing $1 billion of high-yield debt, the annual interest expense would be $25 million higher today than it was two and a half years ago.What\u2019s bad news for issuers of high-yield debt is good news for investors, who are finally waking up to the fact that they have been taking risks on companies with poor credit quality for years without being properly compensated. They are no longer so willing to take on that risk. That\u2019s in large part why there was no high-yield debt issued in December and why leveraged loans have been trading down. It\u2019s a sign of a healthy debt market, not of a damaged one.Sadly, all sorts of people get addicted to the euphoria of low interest rates. There are hedge fund managers, private-equity moguls and big banks that have been using the debt markets to borrow money extremely cheaply. They have been raking in the profits in recent years, in part by piling too much debt onto companies and then paying themselves a huge dividend with the proceeds of the debt offerings. Politicians, too, seem to get hypnotized by the perceived benefits of low interest rates. President Trump has been publicly criticizing Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who has been carefully ending the era of super-low interest rates in a measured and responsible way, with small rate increases that have so far caused minimal disruption to the economy, although the perceived pace of the increases seemed to rattle investors late last year. After the fifth straight quarterly rate increase, Mr. Trump, worried that the hikes might slow growth or even tip the economy into recession, complained that Mr. Powell would \u201cturn me into Hoover.\u201d On Jan. 3, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said the Fed should assess the economic outlook before raising short-term interest rates again, a signal that the Fed has hit pause on the rate hikes. Even Mr. Powell has signaled he may be turning more cautious.William D.

{"Headline": "The Economy Won\u2019t Rescue Trump", "Date": "2019-01-21", "News": "OpinionSorry, Donald, no morning in America for you.Supported byOpinion ColumnistOn the other hand, that president was Ronald Reagan, who went on to win re-election in a landslide. So some Trump boosters are suggesting their champion can repeat that performance. Can he?No, he can\u2019t. And it\u2019s worth understanding why, both to assess current political prospects and to debunk the Reagan mythology still infesting U.S. conservatism.Let\u2019s talk first about the Reagan story.How does this story compare with Trump\u2019s prospects now?First of all, where Reagan was unpopular because of a weak economy, Trump is unpopular despite a strong economy. That is, he starts from a much lower baseline.And there is no chance of a \u201cmorning in America\u201d-type boom over the next two years.Also, a housing boom driven by dramatic interest rate reductions was central to the rapid growth of Reagan\u2019s third and fourth year in office. (No, it wasn\u2019t all about the miraculous effects of tax cuts.) But today\u2019s Fed can\u2019t \u2014 literally can\u2019t \u2014 deliver the kind of boost it did back then by bringing double-digit interest rates down to single-digit levels, because rates are already quite low. And with housing prices looking rather high, it\u2019s hard to imagine a huge surge looking forward.So Donald Trump is no Ronald Reagan.Actually, even Ronald Reagan was no Ronald Reagan. Although right-wing legend portrays his experience as proof of the magical power of tax cuts, the economy actually performed somewhat better under Bill Clinton, who raised taxes. (Although, to be fair, almost all Republicans seem to have managed to expunge that fact from their memories.)Most of Reagan\u2019s political success reflected not fundamental economic achievement but good luck with the timing of the business cycle. And Trump almost certainly won\u2019t experience comparable luck.Combine this lack of a strong economic upside over the next two years with Trump\u2019s extreme current unpopularity, and his chances for re-election \u2014 if he even makes it to the end of his first term \u2014 don\u2019t look too good. Which raises the question of what he and his party will do if defeat is staring them in the face.I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, and if you aren\u2019t scared about how a cornered Trump might lash out, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.What\u2019s clear, however, is that Trump and his allies are in a deep hole right now \u2014 and the economy isn\u2019t going to dig them out of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Were Spooked About Profits. Now Come the Facts.", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the worst year for stocks in a decade, investors are eager to hear what executives expect in 2019 as companies report fourth-quarter earnings.It\u2019s time to see the numbers. Investors are about to get a read on the health of corporate America, as businesses begin releasing quarterly profit reports and laying out expectations for the coming year.The results may resolve a roaring debate on Wall Street that has pitted economists, who have argued that the economy remains healthy, against investors, who pushed stocks to the brink of a bear market over concerns that growth is waning. \u201cAs we hear from more companies about how the year ended, we\u2019ll get more color on which side has a better feel, the economics community or the equity community,\u201d said Lori Calvasina, head of United States equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. On the whole, the numbers are expected to be solid. Analysts estimate that, when all the results are in for S&P 500 companies, fourth-quarter profits will have risen 15 percent over a year earlier. That would be the fifth-straight period of double-digit profit growth, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. It doesn\u2019t guarantee investors will be happy. The last round of results, which began to arrive in October, showed even faster growth but did little to stem the stock market\u2019s rapid sell-off at the end of the year.That\u2019s in part because Wall Street is looking ahead: how factors like a global slowdown and rising interest rates will affect future profits. Next week will bring results from banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, as well as companies like Delta and Netflix. On Thursday, cautionary statements from Macy\u2019s and American Airlines weighed on their shares and those of other department stores and airlines.Here are some of the questions investors will be seeking answers to as they weigh whether they went too far with the sell-off. For much of 2018, investors were surprisingly willing to shrug off risks posed by the trade war that erupted between China and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest economies.But as the dispute has dragged on, and stretched from its original focus on America\u2019s yawning trade deficit with China to seemingly intractable questions over technological and geopolitical dominance, it\u2019s starting to take a toll.China\u2019s economy is showing signs of weakness, and that\u2019s bad news for companies that count the country as a major market. Furthermore, it isn\u2019t just China. The slowdown is rippling through other economies. Germany\u2019s industrial engine, which exports high-end autos and industrial equipment to China, is sputtering and dragging on European growth, and Japan\u2019s economy \u2014 the world\u2019s third largest \u2014 contracted in the third quarter. For companies that aren\u2019t heavily exposed to foreign markets, the outlook for domestic consumption, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of America\u2019s economic activity, is what matters. On that front, the news is still mostly good.Last year consumer sentiment measures showed Americans to be largely inured to a noisy political and economic climate. There are good reasons this resilience could continue. Wages are rising, gas prices have fallen, and Americans who stand to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s tax overhaul could start to see higher tax refunds roll in over the coming months. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to again have a recession when consumers are getting more money from tax refunds and oil prices are lower,\u201d said Keith Parker, head of United States equity strategy at UBS. Companies have confirmed that view. In its earnings report last month, Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, noted that consumers were splurging, adding to their entrees and \u201cbuying up.\u201d \u201cRight now, we think the consumer is in a really good place,\u201d Eugene Lee, Darden\u2019s chief executive, said on a conference call after the company\u2019s earnings release. Still, stock market moves typically lead consumer sentiment, meaning December\u2019s sharp sell-off could take some of the fizz out of the mood of American shoppers. Even after a recovery in the early days of 2019, the S&P 500 remains more than 10 percent below its September peak. For large employers, rising wages will cut into profits unless they find a way to get customers to pay higher prices. A plan by Amazon to pay a $15 hourly wage to its 250,000 employees in the United States \u2014 as well as roughly 100,000 seasonal workers \u2014 is expected to take a significant chunk out of its profits. Wages aren\u2019t the only things rising. Increasing commodity prices, transportation costs and interest rates are typical conundrums for corporations in latter stages of an economic expansion. The emergence of those pressures on corporate profits is one reason investors have grown increasingly worried about stocks.Executives don\u2019t mind paying more for wages, raw materials and shipping if sales keep rising as the economy continues to grow. But if the outlook darkens, executives will be quick to snap their wallets shut. The American economy still looks strong. More than 300,000 jobs were created in December. Unemployment remains below 4 percent. Through the third quarter, the economy was on track for its best annual performance since 2005. Still, uncertainty about what\u2019s to come could dissuade some decision-makers from pulling the trigger on new investments in real estate, plants and equipment. Such capital spending is crucial to keeping the economic expansion on track, making any broad pause in spending a potential pitfall for growth. There are signs that the outlook is becoming increasingly murky. While reporting earnings on Wednesday, the homebuilder Lennar said it couldn\u2019t offer investors a forecast for 2019 because of \u201ccontinued softness and uncertainty\u201d in the housing market, which has been squeezed by rising mortgage rates. Such comments, as well as any mentions of plans to delay production or expansion plans, will be of intense interest to investors this earnings season both for the individual companies involved and for the possible impact of those decisions on the American economy.

Would they get a traditional pro-business Republican who promised tax cuts, or an unpredictable populist who would disrupt trade? So far, they\u2019ve gotten both in President Trump, who sees the stock market as a barometer of his success. Stocks are up 25 percent in the two years since his election, but it has not always been a smooth ride.Change in the S&P 500 since Nov. 8, 2016Stocks around the world tumbled overnight after Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. But by the start of trading in the United States on Nov. 9, investors had begun to embrace the idea of a Republican-controlled White House and Congress.The chaotic first year of the Trump presidency would feature policy missteps, White House firings, tensions with North Korea and developments in the Russia investigation. But investors focused on the promise of tax cuts and deregulation, pushing markets up and up, and Mr. Trump spent much of 2017 crowing about the market\u2019s gains.Mr. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States.Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as director of the F.B.I.In November, Republican lawmakers unveiled a sweeping rewrite of the tax code that would deliver a significant tax cut for corporations.Mr. Trump signed a $1.5 trillion tax cut into law on Dec. 22. By the end of the year, the S&P 500 had risen 19.4 percent and logged its 14th straight month of gains, the longest such streak in history.It became clear that Mr. Trump was serious about pursuing bellicose trade actions against many of the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners.

Much of the drive came from large technology companies.

In a tweet, Mr. Trump congratulated America.Tensions with China and comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, about rising borrowing costs helped crater stocks, which suffered their steepest declines since the February rout. Mr. Trump lashed out at the Fed: \u201cThey are raising interest rates and it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dRepublicans lost control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections.So far this year, fears have ebbed.

{"Headline": "The Shutdown, According to Trump ", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFact Check During a news conference on Friday, President Trump insisted that most furloughed federal employees supported his wall, that Mexico is paying for it and that it would stop a horde of terrorists from crossing the border. None of that was true. Most federal workers, even those with rent owed and bills due, would gladly forgo their paycheck as a measure of support for his $5.6 billion border wall, President Trump said on Friday.He also noted that Mexico would actually be paying for the wall through a new trade agreement, which at the very least raised the question of why the government had to be shut down over a funding dispute involving American tax dollars if the funding was coming from another country. And then there was a Plan C: He said he could use \u201cemergency powers\u201d to build the wall. The wall was needed for many reasons, Mr. Trump said. Stopping drug and human trafficking, and a nonspecific reference to a torrent of terrorists and coyotes easily flowing in over the southern border. \u201cThey drive right in, and they make a left,\u201d he said.But there also was sunshine amid the gloom. Mr. Trump spoke of a stunningly positive jobs report and a stock market that soared, at least for a day. Lower gas prices? One person to thank.The purpose of the president\u2019s hastily arranged, hourlong news conference in the Rose Garden was to give his side of the negotiations over a partial government shutdown that stretches into its third week on Saturday. And, for the record, Mr. Trump is not calling the partial closing of the government \u201ca shutdown.\u201dThe news conference was freewheeling, and the president seemed in high spirits, even with the government shuttered in many places. \u201cShould we keep this going or not?\u201d he said.Here are some takeaways and fact-checks. \u201cAll of the border things that we\u2019ll be building will be done right here in the good old USA by steel companies that were practically out of business when I came into office as president. And now, they\u2019re thriving.\u201d Later, he said, \u201cthe steel industry was almost dead.\u201dIn his first meeting about a shutdown with Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office last month, the president forcefully said that he alone would own the shutdown. On Friday, he was selling shares in it. \u201cYou can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make any difference to me. It\u2019s just words.\u201dThe president said that the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada will yield billions of dollars for this country. \u201cThat is paying for the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cMany, many times over. In fact, what we save on the U.S.M.C.A., the new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada, what we save on that just with Mexico will pay for the wall many times over, just in a period of a year, two years and three years. So I view that as absolutely Mexico is paying for the wall.\u201d Mr. Trump said that the government would have to use its powers of eminent domain to take private land to build the wall when owners would not agree to sell. He said that\u2019s how interstates, schools and other public buildings have been constructed.Many in his base disagree, especially in Texas where private property rights are often paramount.Mr. Trump said, mostly in jest, that he had raised the matter of impeachment with Ms. Pelosi, asking her why she did not use the border security issue as grounds. \u201cAnd Nancy said we\u2019re not looking to impeach you. I said that\u2019s good, Nancy, that\u2019s good.\u201dHe added, \u201cYou can\u2019t impeach somebody that is doing a great job. That\u2019s the way I view it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Book Says You Can Retire Early. But It Doesn\u2019t Really Say How.", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfTanja Hester, a communications consultant who quit working at age 38, says you can. Ms. Hester had a big head start, but her logic is sound, even if she makes it seem simpler than it is for most of us.Retiring early and successfully requires two things, she argues: knowing what you will do with your life without a paying job, and a lot of money to live on.Ms. Hester is terrific in explaining the first part; so-so on the second.She says your extended retirement will be far more enjoyable if you have a specific plan, one that flows from a sense of purpose.\u201cPurpose just means you know why you are getting out of bed each morning or what you want your life to add up to ultimately,\u201d she says.But how are you going to be able to fund that purpose? That brings us to the flaws in the book.My biggest objection is Ms. Hester makes the ability to retire early sound too easy, and one of the reasons it does is she repeatedly draws from her experience with the implicit message: \u201cIf I can do it, anyone can.\u201dBut her situation is not representative.She doesn\u2019t provide specific numbers from her life \u2014 which feels like a cheat \u2014 but we learn a few important facts. She and her husband had each been earning more than $100,000 annually for several years when they retired; had bought a home in Lake Tahoe, Calif., at the bottom of the real estate market, giving them a substantial equity cushion; and had acquired a rental property as well. In addition, they have no children \u2014 kids are expensive (duh) and hinder your ability to save for an early retirement. And, oh, yes, while they were working, their investments were growing during the longest bull market in history, so last year\u2019s decline probably didn\u2019t hurt too much.Not everyone thinking of retiring early will have those advantages.Then there is her limited financial advice. Ms. Hester devotes only about a third of her 260 pages to the financing of an early retirement. And while she provides ideas \u2014 such as overachieve at work to save whatever raises you get before you quit \u2014 she doesn\u2019t go into any great depth.Two quick examples show the problem.A novice, she says, might be \u201cuncomfortable\u201d investing heavily in stocks, so that person should consider an initial mix of 33 percent cash, 33 percent bonds and 34 percent stocks.There are other omissions. Take the matter of how much money you can withdraw from your investments. Ms. Hester cites the well-known research that contends you should be able to take out 3 to 4 percent of your savings annually and probably not outlive your money.But the key word there is probably.The following example, which I\u2019ve constructed, shows the gap between probably and definitely.To be fair, in talking about withdrawals, Ms. Hester does write: \u201cAt a minimum enter your numbers into an online Monte Carlo simulator\u201d to see what the odds are of \u201cyou having enough saved.\u201d But she does not play out any examples. Nor does she spend a lot of time on situations more complicated than the one I created.Ms. Hester seemingly anticipated my carping when she wrote: \u201cI wanted the conversation about early retirement to be about life, not just about money.\u201dStill, I wish she had focused more on the money.Experienced investors know there are only two ways you can end up with more money.\u25a0 Earn more \u2014 by doing things like increasing your work income, getting higher yields on your investments or finding additional revenue from things like rental properties or royalties.\u25a0 Spend less.While I wish Ms. Hester had given much more specific financial advice, simply getting you to think about how you might retire early forces you to ponder how you could cut current spending and increase your income, savings and the rates they earn. That\u2019s good.But when you do, you may find you have a long way to go before you can chuck it all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Handle a Painfully Unpredictable Market ", "Date": "2019-01-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bull market has suffered some dizzying blows. In our quarterly report on investing, you will find insights, analysis and even some humor that may help you cope with it all.After the wrenching swings of late 2018 and early January, it was difficult to harbor many illusions about the stock market. Counting only prices at the market close, however, the Dow Jones industrial average didn\u2019t quite fall into that dismal territory. Still, despite a market rise in January, losses have been severe, especially in sectors that had been highfliers, like technology. What\u2019s an investor to do? Our quarterly survey contains some lessons and suggestions. Recession fears have emerged despite strong job growth, making some investors wary of stocks and looking for havens. But many strategists urge caution, saying it isn\u2019t wise to pile on risk until the status of the market and the economy are clearer. Real estate funds fared reasonably well through much of the autumn downturn. While headline-grabbing sectors like technology plunged, funds that invested in commercial real estate \u2014 office buildings, malls and warehouses \u2014 were fairly steady. What are their prospects in a really rocky market?The problem is that index funds tend to be cheap and difficult to beat consistently. In the longer term, it\u2019s hard to make a strong case for the human touch.Social media companies have made a big mistake, our columnist John Schwartz says. They have apologized for what they say are errors. But he has a plan: He will proudly do bad things, evil things and, with total transparency, become obscenely rich.Several top-performing funds outpaced their peers. They took different routes, like betting on Latin American companies, real estate investment trusts and dividend-paying stocks.So-called inverse funds that move against the market offer a way to hedge that can be splendid when most stocks fall. But these funds drop rapidly when the overall market rises, and they can quickly cause major damage to a portfolio.By carving the stock market into specialized slices, these funds take investors into interesting places. Yet they may tempt shareholders to take imprudent risks in the quest for the next big thing.Despite a history of performing well in down markets, investments in the health care industry have looked vulnerable amid uncertainty about American health insurance.The author of a new book argues that you probably can retire far sooner than you think, but she leaves out a lot of details.After a long stretch of market woes, investors have many choices for protecting their portfolios, from complicated maneuvers to a classic response: doing nothing.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pessimism Looms Over Prospect of a Sweeping China Trade Deal", "Date": "2019-01-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a critical round of talks with China kicks off next week, the Trump administration is increasingly pessimistic that Beijing will make the kind of deep structural changes to its economy that the United States wants as part of a comprehensive trade agreement, according to officials involved with the talks.The United States is now weighing whether large Chinese purchases of American goods and more modest economic changes will be enough for a deal to end a damaging trade war between the two nations and help calm volatile markets.A Chinese delegation led by Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier, will meet with Robert Lighthizer, the Trump administration\u2019s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, on Jan. 30 and 31. The two countries are racing to strike an agreement by March 2, a deadline set by President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.If no deal is reached by that date, Mr. Trump has said the United States will raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.Mr. Trump has focused on narrowing the trade gap between what the United States imports from China and what it exports, but the administration is also pressuring Beijing to scale back subsidies of state-owned enterprises, drastically open its markets to foreign investment and end its longstanding practice of forcing American companies to hand over trade secrets.For years, American companies, including technology firms and automakers, have been clamoring for such changes as they try to gain access to China\u2019s growing market. But many are beginning to fear that if the continuing brinkmanship between the world\u2019s two largest economies is not resolved, American companies will be left in an even worse position.\u201cI would have a hard time, especially considering what\u2019s happening in Washington, believing that this will be wrapped up in a little bow by March,\u201d said Charles Freeman, senior vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Markets have been particularly sensitive to the state of the talks, with stocks gyrating as whispers of progress or setbacks trickle out.Stock prices in the United States spiked last week after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended the removal of some tariffs to hasten a deal. They jumped again after Bloomberg News reported that China had offered to buy $1 trillion of American goods over the next six years.Over the weekend, Mr. Trump expressed hope that a deal could be reached but dismissed suggestions that the United States would roll back tariffs in advance of concessions from China.\u201cWe have taken in tremendous amounts of money in the United States because of the sanctions,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday, apparently confusing sanctions and tariffs. \u201cIf we make a deal, certainly we wouldn\u2019t have sanctions.\u201dIn a tweet on Monday evening, Mr. Trump once again suggested that the United States had the upper hand in negotiations, saying China\u2019s slowing economy should hasten a trade deal.\u201cChina posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies,\u201d the president said. \u201cMakes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s optimism about reaching a deal, others in the administration and on Capitol Hill have been more circumspect.\u201cThis is an ongoing process with the Chinese that is nowhere near completion,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said, rebutting the suggestion that Mr. Mnuchin had recommended rolling back tariffs.Last week, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Mr. Lighthizer, who is leading the talks, had told him there had been no progress on the \u201cstructural\u201d changes that the administration sought from China.Mr. Lighthizer, a longtime China hawk, has been pushing to ensure that China fulfills promises that Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump during a meeting in Buenos Aires last year. Mr. Lighthizer has expressed concern to colleagues and business groups that Mr. Trump could accept a watered-down deal that reduces the trade deficit but offers only symbolic structural changes to help end the trade war and lift the stock market.In an interview on the Fox Business Network on Friday, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said he was hopeful that a deal would be reached but acknowledged that many details still needed to be determined.\u201cThe technology stuff has not been dealt with, the enforcement stuff has not been dealt with,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cThe commodity stuff and the tariff rates, we\u2019re moving on the right track.\u201dTo those who see the negotiations as the best opportunity to rebalance the trade relationship between Washington and Beijing, the prospect of rolling back tariffs without sweeping concessions by China would fail to achieve Mr. Trump\u2019s goal of ending what he has deemed its unfair trade practices.\u201cHe wants to brag about what he got, not stop tariffs and be able to brag about nothing,\u201d said Derek Scissors, a China expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.A slimmed-down deal could also open Mr. Trump up to criticism from Democrats, who in some cases are more aligned with the president\u2019s aggressive approach to pressuring China than many Republicans.\u201cAnything less than a full effort to secure a fundamental reset of the U.S.-China trade relationship is a betrayal of the American economy and the future of American workers, industry, consumers and innovators,\u201d said Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \u201cThe Trump administration needs to stiffen its spine and get tough in these China talks.\u201dTrump administration officials have been debating whether they can push more tariffs on China without facing significant repercussions. China\u2019s economy is already slowing, in part because of the tariffs, and any further weakening could hurt global economic growth and the United States economy, which is itself showing signs of cooling.Mr. Mnuchin has been particularly interested in how big a role America\u2019s trade actions are playing in China\u2019s recent economic weakness.Trump administration officials have debated whether they should follow through with plans to raise tariffs to 25 percent, from 10 percent, on March 2 if China does not maintain the promises Mr. Xi made to Mr. Trump, like accelerating purchases of American goods and making structural changes to its economy.Progress over the next six weeks could result in an extension of the March 2 deadline, even if a final deal is not reached, or some tariff relief as a reward for initial changes that China says it is willing to make. But the decision will ultimately rest with Mr. Trump.One question bedeviling the talks is how to enforce any trade agreement with China, given its opaque business environment and largely managed economy. One option that administration officials have considered is \u201csnapback\u201d tariffs, which would be reimposed if China appears to be reneging on its commitments.Mr. Trump has pointed to China\u2019s economic weakness as a reason it should acquiesce to his country\u2019s trade demands. But the trade war is also taking a toll on the United States economy, and the monthlong shutdown could lead to an economic contraction if it continues to drag on.While business are hoping for greater access to China\u2019s markets, the strategy of using tariffs as a negotiating tool has dented business confidence. According to a survey of 277 American companies by S&P Global this month, 43 percent said they had postponed investment because of the China tariffs.Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the administration, said that there were several important unknowns about the trade discussions that suggested a comprehensive deal was not near.It remains unclear if there is a working text of a deal that the two countries are using to hash out an agreement. And it is unclear whether China will pressure the Trump administration to drop its efforts to extradite the chief financial officer of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications company. The executive was arrested in Canada last year as part of a broader agreement. The complicated internal debates taking place within China\u2019s government also make it difficult to predict its willingness to make concessions.\u201cWe are a long way to a deal,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said. \u201cMuch work remains to be done, especially untangling the debate in China and pressure on Xi Jinping.\u201dBut Mr. Trump is also under pressure and the window for him to use market-rattling tariffs as leverage is likely to shrink as his re-election campaign heats up next year.\u201cThe damage to U.S. business, consumers and exporters is real and ongoing,\u201d Scott Lincicome, a trade lawyer and scholar at the Cato Institute, said, noting that the risks of this approach only increased if negotiations with China dragged into 2020. \u201cIf you\u2019re the Chinese, delay is your best friend.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But since the Fed\u2019s change in tone, stocks have been rising again.Mr. Powell emphasized again on Thursday that the Fed was not taking cues from the White House.He also said that he had not received an invitation to meet with Mr. Trump, a plan hatched by White House advisers in December that might have lost its purpose.The earnings come mostly from the Fed\u2019s holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. The 2018 total was less than the $80.2 billion that the Fed transferred in 2017. The Fed has reduced the size of its balance sheet. It also pays interest on the reserves that commercial banks keep at the central bank, and the rise in interest rates increased those payments, which totaled $38.5 billion last year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Takes Reins of Italian Bank to Prevent Wider Crisis", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank took control of a troubled Italian bank Wednesday, an unprecedented step that spotlighted the risks to the eurozone\u2019s financial system from political chaos in Rome and a sputtering economy.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bank large enough to cause systemic crisis,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, a former chief economist at Italy\u2019s treasury who operates LC Macro Advisors, a consultancy in London. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe have seen that even small banks can cause huge problems.\u201d\u201cThe current government is not prepared for a full-fledged banking crisis,\u201d Mr. Codogno said.The action by Europe\u2019s central bank on Wednesday reassured investors so far that the vulnerabilities of Banca Carige, the 10th-largest lender in Italy, would not provoke a broader crisis.The central bank\u2019s intervention was absorbed with relative calm by financial markets. The Euro Stoxx Banks index fell about 2 percent on a day when most stocks were down.But the question of who will buy Banca Carige \u2014 and whether shareholders will be responsible for some of its debt \u2014 is likely to heighten tensions between the central bank and Italy\u2019s coalition government.Finding a buyer will be difficult. If the bank\u2019s troubles deepen, the central bank, under European rules, would be obliged to make shareholders and creditors bear some of the losses.That could put the central bank at odds with the government in Rome. The coalition of the far-right League and the populist Five Star Movement has so far tried to defend the interests of shareholders and bondholders, who are often middle-class Italians.Banca Carige could also create political conflict in Brussels. Sven Giegold, a member of the European Parliament who speaks for the Green faction on financial issues, called for an investigation of whether earlier attempts to rescue Banca Carige violated European Union rules on state aid.Mr. Giegold said in a statement Wednesday that other Italian banks last year were strong-armed into providing Banca Carige with fresh capital, which proved to be inadequate.\u201cThe coordinated rescue now looks like a waste of money by the already weakened Italian banking system,\u201d Mr. Giegold said.The challenges facing the banks \u2014 and Italy\u2019s economy \u2014 have increased since the populist government took power in June.Plans in Rome to reverse cuts in pensions and give cash to poor people undercut investors\u2019 confidence in the government\u2019s ability to repay the national debt. As a result, investors have demanded higher interest rates on Italian government bonds.The instability has been poison for Italian banks because the rates on government bonds act as a benchmark for all types of credit. Banks have had to borrow at far higher rates than banks in other European countries.Banca Carige, which has roots going back to the time of Christopher Columbus, is paying an astronomical 16 percent annual interest on recently issued bonds.The yields on Italian bonds have tempered since last month when the government backed down in a confrontation with the European Commission over its spending plan, which would have broken European Union rules on debt limits. That has eased the pressure on banks.But the Italian economy has never fully recovered from 2008. Businesses went bankrupt then, and many borrowers lost their jobs or are earning far less.For Banca Carige, that meant borrowers were behind in payments or not making payments at all. More than a quarter of Banca Carige\u2019s outstanding loans are considered nonperforming.Confidence about the future was at its lowest in six years, the survey found. \u201cThe outlook for 2019 is not encouraging,\u201d Rosie Colthorpe, an analyst at Oxford Economics, said in a note to clients Wednesday.The central bank\u2019s intervention was prompted by the resignation Wednesday of a majority of Banca Carige\u2019s board of directors. They quit after the bank\u2019s largest shareholders, members of the wealthy Malacalza family, declined last month to support plans to raise more capital.The temporary administrators appointed by the central bank Wednesday include the existing chief executive, Fabio Innocenzi, and the chairman, Pietro Modiano. Both had joined the bank recently. They will have more powers as central bank appointees than they would as regular managers, including the right to set the agenda for shareholders\u2019 meetings.\u201cThe decision to impose temporary administration is an early intervention measure aimed at ensuring continuity and pursuing the objectives of a strategic plan,\u201d the European Central Bank said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Double Dose of Optimism", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the start of a new year, after all. So here\u2019s to hope, both economic and political.Opinion ColumnistIn the spirit of a new year, I give you a double dose of optimism this morning. First, some political optimism, via a few of the wiser writers about democracy:I\u2019ll echo the last part of Mounk\u2019s tweet: Let\u2019s fight. Democracy remains more threatened than I ever expected it to be in my lifetime. And there is indeed plenty of bad news, like the inauguration this week of a militaristic potential autocrat in Brazil. But like the writers quoted here, I see more reason for hope than at the start of either of the previous two years.The main reason is that people have started to become more politically engaged and speak up for democracy. I hope it continues.The short answer is no.In truth, he wrote, academic research pointed to a different conclusion: \u201cExpansions don\u2019t die of old age. They die because something specific killed them. It can be a wrong-footed central bank, the popping of a financial bubble or a shock from overseas. But age itself isn\u2019t the problem.\u201dBut don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that a recession is inevitable this year. The best rule about predicting recessions is that virtually no one can reliably do so.To see where the economy is headed, keep an eye on the major indicators \u2014 like stocks, bonds and the job market \u2014 and don\u2019t rely too much on short-term movements. The next data I\u2019ll be watching will be the monthly jobs report that comes out on Friday.And the most important indicator in that report is the number of jobs that the economy created in December. (The unemployment rate, though better known, is based on a much smaller survey and is less meaningful.) Recently, the American economy has been adding roughly 200,000 jobs a month. If that number starts falling over multiple months, it\u2019s a bad sign.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Call to Arms at the Supreme Court", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservative judges worry that the Second Amendment has become \u201ca second-class right.\u201dContributing Opinion Writer If you are unaware of these outlandish claims, then you haven\u2019t tuned into the rising chorus of judicial voices demanding more from the Supreme Court than gun fanciers already won in that intensely disputed 5-to-4 decision a decade ago, District of Columbia v. Heller.But it is Justice Thomas who has taken up the phrase as a weapon, using it in a series of opinions over the past four years to accuse his colleagues of failing in their duty to keep pushing back against limitations on gun ownership and use. The opinions were all dissents from the court\u2019s decisions not to hear particular gun-rights appeals.\u201cFor those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous. But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a state denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.\u201dBy calling attention to Justice Thomas\u2019s Second Amendment crusade, I want to make four points.First, he\u2019s simply wrong. The court decided Heller to vindicate what the majority described as a \u201ccore\u201d Second Amendment right \u2014 the right of an individual to keep a handgun at home for self-defense. That\u2019s all. Whatever else the Second Amendment enables people to do with their guns was left open. As Justice Antonin Scalia observed in his majority opinion, \u201cIt is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201dMy second point is to underscore the role Justice Thomas plays in creating this rhetorical tidal wave. He is a Federalist Society icon and a hero to many young conservative lawyers, including the 10 former Thomas law clerks whom President Trump has already appointed to federal judgeships. (A dozen other former Thomas clerks hold important nonjudicial positions in the administration.) They and their colleagues among the new Trump judges, many of whom clerked for other conservative justices, are the ones who are making the \u201csecond-class right\u201d mantra a standard feature of any Second Amendment dissent \u2014 in other words, not only that a particular majority opinion is incorrect, but that it is part of a dangerous trend that the Supreme Court, by implication if not explicitly, needs to address right now.His dissent included a subtle dig at Chief Justice John Roberts, who notably has not joined Justice Thomas\u2019s Second Amendment choir. The government rationale for the ban on interstate handgun sales is that while federally licensed firearm dealers can be expected to know the laws of their own state, they may not be familiar with laws of other states and so may not know whether an out-of-state purchaser is legally entitled to own a gun.Another new judge, Stephanos Bibas, dissented last month from a decision by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that upheld a New Jersey law limiting a firearm magazine to 10 rounds of ammunition. He said the state had failed to provide sufficient evidence that \u201cspecifically links large magazines to mass-shooting deaths.\u201d Acknowledging that five other federal circuit courts have also upheld limits on magazine sizes, Judge Bibas observed that while judges were understandably concerned about gun violence, \u201cthey err in subjecting the Second Amendment to different, watered-down rules and demanding little if any proof.\u201dCalling the majority\u2019s analytical approach to the case \u201cespecially inappropriate,\u201d then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: \u201cA ban on a class of arms is not an \u2018incidental\u2019 regulation. It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech.\u201d As a matter of constitutional doctrine, I understand his argument: that a right deemed by the Supreme Court to be fundamental, whether under the First Amendment or the Second, is entitled to the highest level of judicial protection. Nonetheless, to analogize possession of assault rifles to the right to free speech is a provocative move.The two conservative judges who made up the majority on the three-judge panel, Douglas Ginsburg and Karen LeCraft Henderson, were sufficiently provoked by Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s 52-page dissent that they added to their own opinion an unusual six-page \u201cappendix\u201d for the specific purpose of contesting his arguments. \u201cThe dissent mischaracterizes the question before us,\u201d Judge Ginsburg wrote for himself and Judge Henderson. \u201cWe simply do not read Heller as foreclosing every ban on every possible sub-class of handguns or, for that matter, a ban on a sub-class of rifles.\u201dJustice Thomas himself has cited Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s dissenting opinion favorably. It would hardly be surprising for Justice Kavanaugh to return the favor and join the crusade.Even the Trump administration has caught the trend, with its announcement last month of a ban on bump stocks, the cheap attachments that turn ordinary rifles into something close to machine guns and that the Las Vegas killer used to commit mass murder a year ago. The ban, to take effect in March, has already drawn at least two lawsuits. Perhaps these lawsuits will be a step too far even for the Second Amendment newbies on the federal bench. Or maybe not.Does it matter if the public and the Supreme Court are running in opposite directions? It\u2019s good news to anyone who would like to accelerate the collapse of public confidence in the one organ of government that at the moment seems to stand between us and disaster. For the rest of us, it\u2019s one more thing to worry about as the new year begins.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sum of Some Global Fears", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySetting the table for a smorgasbord recession.Opinion ColumnistThe last global economic crisis, for all its complex detail, had one big, simple cause: A huge housing and debt bubble had emerged in both the United States and Europe, and it took the world economy down when it deflated.The best guess is that the next downturn will similarly involve a mix of troubles, rather than one big thing. And over the past few months we\u2019ve started to see how it could happen. It\u2019s by no means certain that a recession is looming, but some of our fears are beginning to come true.Right now, I see four distinct threats to the world economy. (I may be missing others.)And trouble in China would have worldwide repercussions. We tend to think of China only as an export juggernaut, but it\u2019s also a huge buyer of goods, especially commodities like soybeans and oil; U.S. farmers and energy producers will be very unhappy if the Chinese economy stalls.And like China, Europe is a big player in the world economy, so its stumbles will spill over to everyone, the U.S. very much included.As in the case of a trade war, business leaders reportedly believe that the shutdown will soon be resolved. But what will happen to investment and hiring if and when corporate America concludes that Trump has boxed himself in, and that this could go on for many months?So there are multiple things going wrong, all of which threaten the economy. How bad will it be?The good news is that even taking all these negatives together, they don\u2019t come close to the body blow the world economy took from the 2008 financial crisis. The bad news is that it\u2019s not clear what policymakers can or will do to respond when things go wrong.Monetary policy \u00ad\u2014 that is, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and its counterparts abroad \u2014 is normally the first line of defense against recession. But the Fed has very limited room to cut, because interest rates are already low, and in Europe, where rates are negative, there\u2019s no room at all.Finally, dealing effectively with any kind of global slump requires a lot of international cooperation. How plausible is that given who\u2019s currently in charge?Again, I\u2019m not saying that a global recession is necessarily about to happen. But the risks are clearly rising: The conditions for such a slump are now in place, in a way they weren\u2019t even a few months ago.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For a While, Bond Funds Were an Exception to the Indexing Rule", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA December rally in bonds as stocks were plummeting turned a really bad year into something a little less painful for investors in core bond funds that are the centerpiece of many portfolios.According to Morningstar Direct, the average core index bond fund lost just 0.14 percent in 2018, and actively managed core bond funds slid 0.39 percent on average.Until late fall, active fund managers, on average, were actually outperforming their index fund counterparts, and had been doing so for quite some time.Yet when you widen your gaze toward even longer-term performance, the case for active management becomes less clear.The Spiva scorecard adjusts for \u201csurvivorship bias\u201d by including the performance of funds that have been merged or shut down, typically because of poor performance. Fewer than half the actively managed core bond funds from 15 years ago were still in business in June. S&P Dow Jones Indices calculated that fewer than 30 percent of actively managed core bond funds survived the entire 15 years and beat their target index over that stretch.Morningstar found that active management is typically \u201cpriced to fail\u201d as the cost of annual fees typically wipes out gross excess returns. Active core funds charge an average annual expense fee of 0.6 percent, compared with 0.2 percent for core index funds, according to Morningstar Direct. Fewer than 40 percent of active core bond funds in the study had a median return, net of fees, over all those periods that was higher than the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index.Sure, that\u2019s more than a fighting chance, yet when active funds beat index funds in the United States, it typically wasn\u2019t by much. Morningstar found that if it generously assumed an investor had the ability to invest in top-performing funds in each rolling three-year period since 2012, the median net excess return was 0.25 percent \u2014 or 25 basis points \u2014 above the index, and 0.3 percent ahead of the return of the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond E.T.F.\u201cIf you are willing to spend the time and effort and do the due diligence of active managers in hopes of generating a few extra basis points of excess return, there is some room to do that,\u201d said one of the authors of the study, Mara Dobrescu, associate director of fixed income strategies at Morningstar France.But because the potential payoff is typically close to peanuts, Ms. Dobrescu\u2019s message for D.I.Y. investors is \u201cit\u2019s not worth expending all that time and effort.\u201d Finding an active fund that persistently outperforms is no small hurdle, and today\u2019s low-rate environment makes it tough to generate outsize excess returns without piling on a lot of risk.\u201cIf your point is to own bonds for defensive purposes and your aim is to hold long term and to minimize cost, then definitely passive is the way to go,\u201d Ms. Dobrescu said.\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with people wanting to index their bond portfolio,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you have the resources to research and understand what an active manager is doing, bonds is one area where active can work.\u201dThat said, it\u2019s important to understand what has been driving the recent outperformance for fund managers: avoidance of low-yielding but, in some ways, ultrasafe United States Treasury issues.Core index bond funds typically track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate index. This index owns a mix of Treasuries, agency bonds (mortgage-backed securities) and high-quality corporate bonds in proportion to each bond segment\u2019s share of the American market.The average active core manager has 17 percent invested in Treasuries, according to Morningstar Direct. Among the largest actively managed funds, MetWest Total Return has the biggest stake, at 19 percent. Pimco Total Return and Dodge & Cox Income have less than 15 percent invested in Treasuries. DoubleLine Total Return\u2019s stake is below 5 percent.Snubbing low-yielding Treasuries and investing in higher-yielding corporate and securitized bonds \u2014 and, in some instances, international and emerging market bonds \u2014 has paid off during the extended economic recovery. Moreover, Treasuries often take the biggest hit when interest rates rise. And that has been the script lately; the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen from 1.6 percent in the summer of 2016 to 2.7 recently.\u201cTreasuries are exactly what bond investors should want to own,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen stocks get hammered, Treasuries tend to go up in value, in the flight to quality. Other bonds don\u2019t.\u201dBecause active managers typically are light on Treasuries and own other types of bonds that don\u2019t provide as much counterweight to stocks, they tend to underperform just when you need them most.In 2008, when stocks were cratering, the average active core bond fund lost 2.3 percent. The average core index fund gained 4 percent.Mr. Huber said he was willing to absorb periods of underperformance like that because some actively managed bond funds beat bond index funds over longer periods.\u201cThere may be too much focus on trying to avoid a repeat of 2008,\u201d he said.Still, consider the performance of the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index fund during the financial crisis, when it seemed that nearly all assets were losing value. In 2008, the Vanguard bond index fund did just what it was intended to do: It gained more than 5 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Companies Like Apple Sprinkle Secrets in Earnings Reports", "Date": "2019-01-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesDon\u2019t blame Wall Street analysts, rank-and-file investors and journalists for failing to read corporate earnings reports from beginning to end.For another, their prose is often dreary and repetitious. Filled with legal language aimed at satisfying securities regulators without alarming investors and driving down share prices, many earnings reports seem designed to be mind-numbingly boring.It\u2019s the financial figures within these pages that are critically important. Is a company generating profits and cash, is it growing, is it borrowing too much or investing too little? Answers to these questions are often revealed in the numbers, but I\u2019ve always thought it best to avoid spending much time on the words.There is evidence that most other people have made the same judgment, yet it turns out that we\u2019ve been making a mistake. The turgid language in these dull corporate reports is actually sprinkled with important clues about major problems \u2014 and there is a way to get an inkling about them without actually having to read every word.They then sifted through thousands of reports, using a text analysis program. \u201cWe filtered out the reports that made a lot of wording changes over the previous year\u2019s version,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview. \u201cIt turned out that when there are a lot of changes, there\u2019s a good chance that something important is going on, and most of the time, it\u2019s negative.\u201dAmong the reports that included many such changes, the researchers found a high probability that the companies\u2019 share prices would decline several months after the reports appeared.Textual changes in the \u201crisk factors\u201d section were most likely to predict subsequent moves in share prices. (Corporate earnings reports are rigidly formatted to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements and are divided into predictable sections.) When the researchers refined the analysis further, differentiating between textual changes that were positive and negative, the results were even more striking.The overwhelming majority \u2014 86 percent \u2014 of reports with substantial wording changes were primarily negative in tone. But the minority that contained primarily positive language generally correlated with increases in share prices later.That brings up another important point: The stock market rarely responded to the subtle hints in the reports immediately. In fact, it typically took several months for whatever good or bad news was embedded in the reports to be widely understood \u2014 and to move the stock market.This delay means that there is a profit opportunity for those able to exploit it, the researchers said.When they constructed a hypothetical portfolio that shorted \u2014 or bet against \u2014 the companies with primarily negative word changes in the reports, while buying shares of the companies with positive changes, the portfolio outperformed the stock market by 22 percentage points per year.What is perhaps most remarkable is that they selected these investments without actually reading any of the reports or analyzing the stocks or the companies.\u201cChanges to the 10-Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm-level bankruptcies,\u201d the researchers said. That was the case even when the corporate reports contained no outright announcements about such matters.As a result, they said: \u201cWe find no announcement effect associated with these changes \u2014 with returns only accruing when the information is later revealed through news, events, or earnings \u2014 suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms.\u201dIn other words, word changes in corporate reports still appear to be signaling subsequent changes in stock prices and few, if any people, have noticed. That suggests that scarcely anyone has been reading corporate reports thoroughly \u2014 and that scarcely anyone has read the \u201cLazy Prices\u201d paper, either.To be fair, the clues unearthed by the researchers\u2019 approach are fuzzy and imprecise at best.In November, for example, I asked Professor Cohen how I might make practical use of his insights.He suggested two things: \u201cFirst, always download the previous version of a corporate report as well as the current version, so you can compare the language. Focus on the differences from year to year. Second, focus on one section, the \u2018risk factors section.\u2019\u201dThese risks included the possibility of an economic slowdown in a place like China, the possibility of slowing iPhone sales, the threat of a trade war and the potential impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. All of these risks have actually materialized and Apple shares have sunk, pulling down the overall stock market.But based on the language changes in the corporate report alone, was there a specific reason for investors to bid down Apple stock, or for a journalist to conclude that Apple was in serious trouble?I didn\u2019t think so at the time, and I still don\u2019t. The linguistic clues were another piece of evidence that needed to be evaluated and, perhaps, bolstered, by other research.Clues like that have real value, though. The \u201cLazy Prices\u201d research will, at the very least, lead me to read these reports a little differently, in the hope of using them to unearth deeper truths. What\u2019s more, until the \u201cLazy Prices\u201d research is widely understood, it may be possible for some investors to profit from it.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Market Swoon, Investors Are Seeking Safety", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter rising for nine years in a so-so economy in the belief that prosperity was just around the corner, stocks swooned, even as growth picked up.That left many investors wondering whether the economy is turning another corner into a place where danger, maybe even a recession and a prolonged bear market, lurk.The S&P 500 dropped 13.5 percent during the fourth quarter, including dividends, giving the index a 4.4 percent loss for the year by that measure. It was the worst performance since 2008, despite strong corporate earnings and the best readings in several decades in unemployment and consumer confidence.As 2019 unfolds and the economic picture becomes clearer, it is possible that stocks will have a sustained, orderly recovery, investment advisers say. But achieving that clarity will take time, so they encourage investors to demand a lot of evidence that a recession will be avoided before they commit money to stocks or other risky assets.\u201cA lot of the derating that happened in the second half of 2018 started off being driven by political risk, but in the last few weeks, it has been driven by concerns about growth and stability,\u201d said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist at BlackRock, referring to the decline in stocks. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to go on in the first few weeks of 2019. Everyone\u2019s focused on economic data.\u201dMs. Moore highlighted surveys showing weaker-than-expected business conditions and added: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for that to work itself through the market. I would expect more volatility as we take in new data points.\u201dJust how weak those data points are likely to be is hard to predict.\u201cThe underlying fundamentals of the economy certainly have deteriorated,\u201d said Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. He noted that the five monthly regional business surveys conducted by Federal Reserve districts \u201cwere all extremely weak in December.\u201d\u201cWe have a very mixed economic picture right now,\u201d Mr. Yardeni said. \u201cIt all adds up to an economy that\u2019s slowing but probably still growing.\u201d If that\u2019s true, then 2019 may not be so bad for the market.\u201cStocks are very cheap, with one important qualification,\u201d he said: \u201cYou have to believe the economy is not going to wind up in recession.\u201dHe then offered another qualification, about forthcoming corporate earnings reports: \u201cWe still have to curb our enthusiasm because we can\u2019t get too excited about the earnings outlook.\u201dThe tax cuts that took effect in 2018 sent earnings up so much for the year \u2014 the latest estimate for the S&P 500 was 20.2 percent, according to FactSet Research \u2014 that a 5 percent rise in earnings in 2019, aided by corporate buybacks, is about as much as Wall Street can expect, Mr. Yardeni said. FactSet\u2019s latest forecast is for a 7.3 percent increase.Despite some good days for the market in January that may have been prompted by signs of flexibility from the Federal Reserve, the way stocks tumbled late in the year hardly inspires confidence. With anything like a repeat performance, investors will have to hope that other assets provide better protection than in 2018, when there were few places to hide.\u201cCash was the only major asset class that posted positive returns in \u201918,\u201d according to a Bank of America report. Even the reed-thin 1.9 percent return on cash in money market funds was less than the 2.2 percent consumer inflation rate, the report said, but at least it was a positive number. Long-term government bonds, corporate bonds and gold all lost ground, although they beat the return of the S&P 500. Oil and foreign stocks were among the investments that did worse.The average domestic stock fund lost 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter, with specialists in natural resources, technology and financial services leading the way down. These funds dropped 6.8 percent during the year, according to Morningstar. International stock funds outperformed during the quarter, losing 10.9 percent, but trailed badly for the full year, down 13.2 percent.Bond funds lost 0.9 percent in the quarter and 1 percent for all of 2018. High-yield portfolios were particularly weak, off 4.6 percent for the quarter and 2.8 percent for the year.Such across-the-board weakness is rare \u201cbecause what tends to be bad for one asset tends to be good for some other asset somewhere,\u201d said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation for the investment firm GMO. \u201cThe basic exception is when there is a combination of rising rates and slowing growth. Risky assets don\u2019t like slowing growth, and fixed income doesn\u2019t like rising rates.\u201dMr. Inker, like many, is worried that the Fed could push a fragile economy into recession. That would be \u201cfairly ugly for valuations\u201d of American stocks, he said, and he would avoid them even if he were confident that a recession could be skirted. He prefers stocks and bonds in emerging markets, which are much cheaper than their counterparts in mature economies.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the fourth quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.12 MONTHS4TH QTR.LEADERS12 MONTHS4TH QTR.+\u2013\u2013\u20131.21.013.26.7%+\u2013\u2013\u20130.90.910.914.5%Municipal bondsAmerican FundsCollege 2024\u2013\u2013+\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20130.63.515.72.82.52.02.0n.a.%\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u20131.32.32.72.72.73.33.33.4%Taxable bondsRussell Inv.

Cap ValueHodges RetailBy The New York Times | Source: Morningstar\u201cWe\u2019re reasonably bullish on our ability to make money in 2019, just not in the assets most people have most of their money in,\u201d he said.One reason for the poor returns on stocks, especially in December, is that the Fed initially had not seemed to share the fear felt on Wall Street. When the Fed raised its target for short-term interest rates last month, the move was almost universally anticipated, but the statement about economic conditions and monetary policy made after the increase \u201cwas not as dovish as the market was hoping for,\u201d said Steve Kane, a bond fund manager at TCW.Recent data \u201csignals an economic slowdown,\u201d and not just in the United States, Mr. Kane said. Surveys \u201cconfirm a significant drop in manufacturing activity. There are also signals that growth in China is slowing dramatically and significantly,\u201d he said.If rates are priced for a slowdown, some corporate bonds are not, Mr. Kane said. At least not yet. Spreads in yields between corporate and government debt have widened, taking bond prices down. Medium-term investment-grade corporate issues yielded 1.76 percentage points more than equivalent Treasury paper, as of Tuesday, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and an index of high-yield debt yielded 4.65 points more. A two-point cushion is roughly where investment-grade spreads tend to peak during a slowdown, but high-yield spreads typically soar to 10 points.\u201cOne should look at the fixed-income market as being more attractive to invest in 2019 than 2018, but one must still invest with some degree of caution, especially in the high-yield market,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be better opportunities later in the year\u201d in high yield, while \u201cthere is not too much downside to investment-grade credit at this point.\u201d He called it \u201ca fairly good asset class if we\u2019re in the midst of a bear market in equities.\u201dStocks that Ms. Moore at BlackRock thinks would do comparatively well against such a backdrop are of companies that are financially strong and able to grow, even when economic growth is modest at best. Health care is her top sector because it has those defensive qualities, as well as pockets of innovation, such as in medical technology, that support high profit margins.She said she is \u201cnot throwing in the towel on tech\u201d in general, despite plunging share prices in big names like Apple and Facebook, and she said she particularly likes Asian tech companies. Ms. Moore also is \u201cmodestly encouraged\u201d about emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, most notably Brazil and India.Brian Singer, head of dynamic allocation strategies at William Blair & Company, has been investing \u201cwith a greater emphasis on risk management,\u201d he said. He finds American stocks \u201cfundamentally less attractive\u201d than others, such as emerging markets, including the two that Ms. Moore mentioned.Among mature economies, Mr. Singer likes Britain, although he would rather wait until the question of its departure from the European Union, Brexit, is settled before stepping in, and Spain. Markets he is shunning, aside from the United States, are Japan, Canada, Mexico and South Africa. As for bonds, he is avoiding the high-yield market, and he talked up the virtues of another asset class that is often overlooked.\u201cIn this environment, cash will be a relatively good alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a great return generator, but being cautious and holding cash is not a bad idea. It really is a time to remain defensive and have dry powder on hand.\u201dWith so much up in the air, Mr. Yardeni recommends not getting carried away. Investors should be selective about stocks and avoid index-tracking exchange-traded funds.\u201cThis is probably a year for stock pickers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a year for E.T.F.s.\u201dHe would emphasize domestic stocks and limit exposure to emerging markets, which may suffer from soft commodity prices, and to Europe, which is dealing with thorny issues like Brexit and Italy\u2019s recalcitrance in reining in government spending. The aging population bodes ill for long-term growth in Europe, too, Mr. Yardeni said, something that also applies in China.He favors industries like technology, communications and media, which he expects to benefit over the long haul from the impending introduction of 5G, the fifth generation of mobile communications technology. Big banks and health care companies should do well, too, he said.With investors focused on what\u2019s going wrong, Mr. Kane recommends that they also keep in mind what\u2019s going right, in particular the strong job market, although he noted that employment is often the last indicator to deteriorate as the economic cycle turns.\u201cIf that part of the economy holds up, then this may not be a recession,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could get a very nice return for stocks if that turns out to be the environment.\u201d But he acknowledged that it\u2019s a big if.A crucial question for him is whether the decline will be fairly mild by the time it\u2019s over, or something more severe, as in the 2008 financial crisis. For all the talk of recession, the losses so far have appeared calm and orderly, suggesting to him that too few investors have been asking the same question.\u201cWhether it\u2019s a garden-variety or end-of-days bear market,\u201d he said, \u201cthere\u2019s going to be panic, and we haven\u2019t gotten quite there yet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Tumble as China Trade-Deal Concerns Resurface", "Date": "2019-01-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market\u2019s strong start to the year stalled on Tuesday, amid growing pessimism about the prospects for a deal to defuse trade tensions between China and the United States.Stocks slumped from the outset, and the selling worsened through the day after The Financial Times reported that the Trump administration had rejected an offer from China to hold preparatory talks ahead of high-level trade meetings in Washington later this month.Such advance discussions are thought to be an important step toward cementing an agreement between the world\u2019s two largest economies before March 1. After that date, tariffs on some $200 billion of Chinese goods are scheduled to rise sharply, which would send the trade war into a new and more serious phase.Trade-sensitive tech and industrial shares were the worst performers. Microsoft, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, all slumped. Semiconductor makers \u2014 much of whose revenue comes from sales in China \u2014 tumbled, with Nvidia and Micron dropping more than 5 percent.The major industrial exporters Caterpillar and Boeing fell 3.2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively.The tone from industrial firms that reported earnings on Tuesday did little to improve the mood. Shares of the tool manufacturer Stanley Black & Decker tumbled more than 15 percent after the company offered a disappointing outlook for 2019.\u201cWe tried to make it very clear that the economic backdrop is one of slowing growth,\u201d James M. Loree, chief executive of Stanley Black & Decker, said on a conference call with analysts.The trade war seems to be a growing source of weakness for the global economy. On Monday, China reported that its economy grew at its slowest rate, 6.6 percent, since 1990, amid a slowdown of its export sector.The report came the same day as the International Monetary Fund trimmed its forecast for global growth in 2019 to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent, citing, in part, slowing worldwide trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A California Chef Learns to Swim in Changed Waters", "Date": "2019-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookTejal Rao reviews the San Francisco restaurant Angler, where the chef Joshua Skenes is showing how a seafood-rich menu can adapt to the forces of climate change.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It was late fall, the start of Dungeness crab season, but too soon to melt the butter. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by algae and linked to warming ocean waters, had recently been found in such high levels in local crabs that the commercial fishing season in parts of Northern California had been delayed.Some fishermen waited for the go-ahead. Others, good to go, worried that the catch would be scarce. What happens when a region\u2019s culinary identity is closely tied to an animal, and that animal is threatened by the mercurial forces of climate change? At the kind of restaurants that aim to be impenetrable bubbles of infinite pleasure, the answer used to be: Nothing. The same luxury ingredients were brought in from wherever they were available, and the illusion was maintained. At Angler, a seafood-focused restaurant that opened in September, close to the water on the Embarcadero, the chef Joshua Skenes is redefining the San Francisco fish house with a tightly edited menu. His kitchen, which exults in the seafood of the Pacific Coast, also points to the ways in which many California restaurants are adapting in the face of environmental concerns, directing diners away from predictable pleasures.But over the last few years, Mr. Skenes has built relationships with local fishermen and farmers, and now the bulk of his ingredients come directly from people who work along the California coastline. \u201cI asked fishermen to bring me anything alive, anything sustainable, as long as the quality was really high,\u201d he said.His menu is now a better reflection of his region, though he and his cooks find themselves with the kind of ingredients they might not have picked off an order form: sausage-shaped sea cucumbers and translucent bells of moon jellyfish.\u201cSomeone\u2019s got to push this stuff,\u201d said Mr. Skenes. It helps that jellyfish and sea cucumber taste good, and that blueprints for preparing it have existed for hundreds of years in other cuisines. The kitchen has learned to dice the raw jellyfish, with its clean flavor of the ocean, and serve it simply, with a dipping sauce. Cooks separate the sea cucumber skin from its muscle for cooking, then serve it grilled with Meyer lemon. The fish is beautiful at Angler, presented on a platter, its delicate, almost jellied fillets firmed up over fire and lacquered with butter sauce at the table. The executive chef, Nicolas Ferreira, cooks all the food with precision, over fire in an open kitchen adorned with flowers and plants. The gentle, teasing flavor of fire and smoke finds its way beyond grilled local spot prawns and spiny lobsters \u2014 into salt, into fruit, into salads.Desserts, like most dishes, zoom in on just one or two ingredients. A rich coconut sorbet, served in the shell. A plain ice cream sundae, covered, at the table, in as much dark, salty caramel as you like. A raw radicchio, served whole, is drenched in an extraordinary, messy dressing so that when you carve into it, it looks like something fresh and bloody and still alive. In its layers, between its burgundy leaves, are pieces of charred radicchio mixed with aged garlic and shallots, which deepen the leaves\u2019 bitterness and lends them an almost dank, animal quality as they crunch and splatter. Servers are likely to bring out a bib, but don\u2019t be offended.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Is Raising Prices. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2019-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNetflix is raising prices.Given how much it has been spending on content, the move isn\u2019t surprising, but the latest jump \u2014 anywhere from 13 to 18 percent depending on the subscription plan \u2014 is the biggest increase since Netflix started its streaming service a dozen years ago. That\u2019s going to hurt some consumers.The company\u2019s appetite for content means it has to spend big, resulting in what\u2019s known as negative free cash flow. More money is going out the door than coming in, a difference that Netflix covers by borrowing even more.\u201cWe change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience,\u201d the company said in a statement announcing the changes, which apply just to United States customers.Netflix\u2019s most popular plan, which gives a customer two simultaneous streams, will get the largest increase, to $13 a month from $11. Still, it\u2019s cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service costs about $15 a month. The $8 a month plan will now cost $9, and the high-end version, which allows for four simultaneous streams, jumps to $16 from $14. (The new prices took effect Tuesday for new subscribers. For existing customers, the increases will start in about three months.)It also includes content that\u2019s currently playing, like \u201cFriends,\u201d which ran on NBC from 1994 through 2004 and is owned by AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia. The show is wildly popular on the service. Worries that it would leave Netflix prompted an outcry on social media. \u201cThe only reason I have an account with Netflix is to rewatch \u2018Friends,\u2019\u201d one customer said.Original shows owned by Netflix are also expensive. \u201cStranger Things,\u201d whose new season will become available this summer, costs as much as $8 million per episode. Netflix has to pay for all of that up front.Multiply that by the hundreds of hours of original content that Netflix produces every year, and the cash starts to bleed out. The company had negative free cash flow of $2 billion last year. It expects that figure to rise to about $3 billion this year and about the same next year. That has added to the company\u2019s debt: up to $12 billion before it proposed borrowing another $2 billion in October through a bond offering.Spending big on content while keeping prices modest has helped Netflix expand its customer base, about 58 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide. Those figures will be updated Thursday as part of its earnings report.But Netflix technically isn\u2019t losing any money. In fact, it claims a profit every quarter since accounting rules allow entertainment companies to record most of their production or licensing costs later on.Not to be left out, Amazon offers a streaming service as part of its Prime shipping program for $13 a month, or $120 a year. Hulu sells an ad-free service for $12 per month. (Disney will take control of Hulu once it completes its acquisition of the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox business, sometime around the middle of the year.)There is also Apple, which has spent well over $1 billion to create original TV shows. The boom in streaming has increased costs throughout Hollywood, where competition for talent and property has intensified.As Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, said in October: \u201cThere\u2019s never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Warren\u2019s Plan Is Latest Push by Democrats to Raise Taxes on the Rich", "Date": "2019-01-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic candidate for president, is expected to unveil a plan that would impose a new annual tax on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the United States.Her plan is the latest sign of how Democrats, with an eye toward 2020, are looking to tax the rich to pay for expanded social programs and distribute wealth more evenly. In recent weeks other Democrats have called for increasing marginal income tax rates for the very rich, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman from New York who has proposed a 70 percent top rate on income exceeding $10 million a year.Ms. Warren\u2019s so-called ultramillionaire tax would levy a 2 percent annual tax on a household\u2019s assets \u2014 including stocks, real estate and retirement funds, held either in the United States or abroad \u2014 above $50 million. It would add an additional 1 percent \u201cbillionaire surtax\u201d on households with net worth exceeding $1 billion, a group that includes President Trump.No assets would be exempt. The plan also calls for increased spending at the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that Americans are not evading the tax. And it would impose an \u201cexit tax\u201d on those seeking to avoid the wealth tax by renouncing their American citizenship.The proposal would raise $2.75 trillion in tax revenue over a decade, according to calculations by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two University of California-Berkeley economists whose work documents the growing concentration of wealth in the United States. Ms. Warren and her team consulted with Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman in drafting the proposal, which seeks to establish a new measure of \u201cprogressivity\u201d in taxation, based on what Americans own, not just what they earn.\u201cIt\u2019s time to fundamentally transform our tax code so that we tax the wealth of the ultrarich, not just their income,\u201d Ms. Warren said on Thursday. \u201cBy asking our top 75,000 households to pay their fair share, my proposal will help address runaway wealth concentration and at the same time accelerate badly needed investments in rebuilding our middle class.\u201dMs. Warren cited the economists\u2019 finding that the richest 0.1 percent of Americans pay a lower percentage of their taxes, as a share of net worth, than the bottom 99 percent.\u201cWe tax the very wealthiest less than everyone else because we tax income from capital and inheritances at much lower rates than income from good, old-fashioned hard work,\u201d said Lily Batchelder, a New York University tax professor and former deputy director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama.Democrats have long focused on income inequality and the rising concentration of wealth, but they have grown more vocal about the issue after the passage of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, which delivered the bulk of their benefits to the highest-earning Americans.The bottom 90 percent of Americans by net worth hold 25 percent of all wealth, combined, according to Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman\u2019s work. That is down from nearly 40 percent of all wealth in 1985.While the idea of taxing wealthy Americans is resurgent, it is not unique: The top marginal income tax rate in the United States was as high as 91 percent in the early 1960s. Today, the top marginal income tax rate is 37 percent, down from 39.6 percent during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term.In a sign of the idea\u2019s rising currency with the Democratic establishment, Ms. Batchelder and another former economic adviser to Mr. Obama both praised the plan on Thursday. \u201cThe incidence of extreme wealth inequality \u2014 as well as the magnitude of never-taxed wealth \u2014 is just so obscene at this point in our nation that I think there is simply no choice but to explore a wealth tax like this,\u201d said Gene Sperling, who directed Mr. Obama\u2019s National Economic Council.The projected revenue from Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal would be enough to pay for several policy initiatives that she and other Democrats have proposed, including universal prekindergarten, a $1 trillion federal infrastructure spending push and widespread debt relief for student loans. But increasingly, liberal activists see taxing the incomes and the wealth of the rich as a policy goal in and of itself \u2014 in order to combat what they see as dangerous levels of inequality.\u201cDemocracies become oligarchies when wealth is too concentrated,\u201d Mr. Saez said in praising the plan. \u201cA progressive wealth tax is the most direct policy tool to curb the growing concentration of wealth in the United States.\u201dConservative groups, business leaders and some other high-earning Americans have criticized Democrats\u2019 calls for increased taxes on high incomes, saying they would dampen economic growth. Some of those same groups were quick to criticize Ms. Warren\u2019s wealth-tax proposal on Thursday.Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank that often promotes the economic benefits of tax cuts, said that a wealth tax would prove difficult to assess and enforce, and that it would disproportionately hit investments with normal returns, which are more sensitive to taxation \u2014 as opposed to returns that are outsize largely because of luck.\u201cI think it is a poorly targeted tax on capital,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal for a new tax on wealthy Americans. The proposal would levy a 2 percent annual tax on a household\u2019s assets above $50 million, not on all assets owned by a household with a net worth of $50 million or more.

{"Headline": "Benno, Proudly Out of Step With the Age", "Date": "2019-01-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review9 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, t\u00eate de veau, b\u00e9arnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and pur\u00e9es and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags.The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and \u2014 excuse me, what was your name again? \u2014 I started to pay attention.It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item.Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a pur\u00e9e or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn\u2019t matter at all.The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn\u2019t appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig\u2019s trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability.Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision.Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe.Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes.

{"Headline": "Apple Cuts Revenue Forecast Because of Slow iPhone Sales in China", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday because of poor iPhone sales in China, an unexpected development that underscored the slowing of China\u2019s economy and raised fears of further turmoil in global markets.\u201cApple is a bellwether,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe iPhone is something that everyone knows and buys, and if people aren\u2019t buying it, then that\u2019s a pretty good sign they\u2019re having a hard time.\u201dIt is not clear whether this is a problem particular to Apple or whether China\u2019s slowing economy will affect other American companies, especially the tech giants and Detroit automakers. Either way, investors are bound to grow nervous, especially after the stock market\u2019s recent gyrations. Tech stocks, which drove much of the bull market of the past few years, have become a drag on it.With more than 40 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, few American companies have been as successful as Apple in China \u2014 or have as much to lose. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, with nearly $52 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year, mostly from iPhone sales.The company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a nearly 5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago.Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the sales decline in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan would exceed the $4.3 billion overall drop in revenue.\u201cWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a letter to investors. \u201cWe believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.\u201dIts declining share pricehad a ripple effect. Asian markets fell Thursday, and Wall Street opened lower. Apple\u2019s shares dropped by more than 9 percent to start trading Thursday.The iPhone was exempt from the first round of tariffs on products built in China. But Mr. Cook said Wednesday that trade tensions and accompanying volatility in global markets had weighed on Chinese consumers and Apple\u2019s profits.The company\u2019s other revenue sources, including iPad, Mac and software sales, together increased nearly 19 percent in the quarter. In the United States and other developed markets like Germany and South Korea, Apple said, it actually had record revenues. The company recently said it would end a longtime custom and no longer break out unit sales of iPhones, a change that rattled investors.While Apple posted roughly flat global sales growth of the iPhone in the third quarter, Chinese rival Huawei jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. The figures helped Huawei maintain its status as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, which posted a 13 percent fall in sales in the same quarter.Huawei has grown despite the China slowdown, as the company has looked to other markets. In the third quarter, its sales rose 13 percent in China but 60 percent outside the country.Finding signs of nervousness about spending in China is not hard, especially among the high-end consumers who dominate the purchase of Apple\u2019s costly phones and laptops, which are far more expensive than local brands.Many expensive restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai seemed almost empty in early December. Room rates at five-star hotels in both cities, which oscillate continuously in internet pricing these days based on demand, suddenly tumbled in early December, and executive lounges emptied.Car sales fell in September, October and November by record percentages from a year earlier, with each month worse than the last. Car executives say early information shows December was a terrible month for sales as well. Automakers like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen all rely heavily on the Chinese market and have reported nose-dives in their sales in recent months.There are broader signs of economic worry. Government and private surveys that were released in the past week show that purchasing managers in China expect the economy to worsen considerably. New orders are down, and exports are faltering.\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d Mizuho Securities said in a research report on Monday.The Beijing leadership has not tried to fan anti-American sentiment in the trade war with the Trump administration. Indeed, ever since President Xi Jinping of China reached a temporary truce with President Trump on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Chinese state media has gone out of its way to avoid criticizing the United States.But tensions continue to grow. Canada\u2019s recent detention of the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant has led to fears of retaliation against American companies or executives. Ms. Meng is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder.The Trump administration has so far avoided imposing tariffs on smartphones from China. But if that happens, Apple, with its almost complete dependence on factories in mainland China, could find itself at a disadvantage to its global archrival, Samsung, which makes its phones in a wider variety of countries.\u201cIf people aren\u2019t buying iPhones, they\u2019re probably not buying everything else,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt symbolizes how deep China\u2019s economic problems are, and we can connect the dots right back to the trade war.\u201dJack Nicas reported from San Francisco, and Keith Bradsher from Washington.

{"Headline": "Volatility Continues as Rising Oil Prices Help Wall St. Erase Early Losses", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe new year began with another round of choppy trading on Wall Street, as stocks opened sharply lower but recouped their losses after a rise in oil prices lifted shares of energy producers.Volatility has been a defining characteristic of the stock market lately. Investors are trying to gauge the odds of an economic slowdown in the United States, and how such an event might be affected by rising interest rates, uncertainty in American politics and a trade war with China.The tone on Wednesday was initially set by fresh evidence that the Chinese economy, the world\u2019s second largest, is slowing. Factory activity in the country fell last month, according to government and private data released this week, an indication that the trade war is beginning to weigh on Chinese manufacturing.But a spike in crude oil futures helped Wall Street overcome the slump after Bloomberg released data that indicated exports from Saudi Arabia had slowed. The American crude benchmark rose as high as $47.78 a barrel before ending the day at $46.54, up 2.5 percent. In 2018, oil prices experienced their first decline in three years, amid worries about excess supply and softer demand.After falling more than 1.5 percent in early trading, the S & P 500 ended slightly higher for the day. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fared better, rising 0.5 percent.Shares in oil companies like Exxon Mobil tracked the gains in crude oil, rising more than 2 percent. Other standouts in Wednesday trading included gaming companies like Wynn Resorts, which rose 5.6 percent after the authorities in Macau reported that gaming revenue there rose more than 16 percent in December. Wynn and other American casino operators have a large presence in the territory, which is a destination for wealthy Chinese gamblers.Shares in Asia were broadly lower after the weaker factory data from China. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite index fell 1.2 percent and the Shenzhen Composite index 0.9 percent.The Taiex index in Taiwan fell 1.8 percent, while the Kospi in South Korea was down 1.5 percent.

{"Headline": "Stocks Surge as Powell Signals Fed Flexibility and Jobs Data Eases Worries", "Date": "2019-01-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks surged on Friday after the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the central bank\u2019s approach to monetary policy would remain flexible in the face of market turbulence and signs that the global economy is slowing.The S&P 500 rose 3.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite ended up 4.3 percent. Stocks were already higher before Mr. Powell\u2019s comments, rising off Labor Department figures that showed robust gains in hiring, but the rally picked up speed after he spoke Friday morning.The Fed\u2019s plans for future interest rate increases have become a concern for investors as stocks have stumbled in recent months. Markets slumped last month after the central bank raised rates and policymakers suggested it would continue on a course of tightening its monetary policy. Mr. Powell, acknowledging the market\u2019s concerns that rising interest rates would dampen the economy, said the central bank could adjust its plans if conditions warrant.Stock investors have been looking for fresh evidence about the state of the economy, and on Friday they got a sign that it remains in good health. Employers in the United States added 312,000 jobs last month, well above Wall Street\u2019s expectations and the biggest monthly gain since February.The faint prospect that China and the United States were inching toward a resolution of their trade war also helped lift markets. China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said on Friday that Jeffrey Gerrish, the deputy United States trade representative, would lead a delegation to Beijing for trade talks next week.One of the biggest concerns for investors is how much the trade dispute between China and the United States will dent global growth. The meeting next week would be the first between the two sides since President Trump and President Xi Jinping called a 90-day truce in December.Reflecting Friday\u2019s optimistic tone, crude oil prices also rose. The American benchmark for oil prices climbed above $48 a barrel.And shares in Europe and parts of Asia were higher. One notable exception among global markets was Japan, where shares fell in the first trading day of the new year.The wealth management units of several global banks began circulating notes encouraging clients not to panic and highlighting \u201csilver linings\u201d and buying opportunities amid a rout that dragged markets around the world into negative territory last year.\u201cThere are plenty of looming concerns for investors, from the U.S. government shutdown and vexed trade talks with China, to the potential impact on consumer and business confidence from the recent market volatility,\u201d analysts at the Swiss bank UBS wrote in a note.\u201cHowever,\u201d the note continued, \u201cwe think markets can rebound and hold an overweight to global stocks.\u201dIn Europe, London\u2019s FTSE 100 gained 2.2 percent.

{"Headline": "Last Month, Investors Seemed Too Pessimistic. Now, They Seem Prescient.", "Date": "2019-01-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaybe the markets were not overreacting.With the United States economy posting solid numbers last year, the alarming signals coming out of stock and bond markets seemed out of whack with the real world. President Trump\u2019s bellicose trade actions were a concern, but hiring was strong and corporate earnings were surging.In the coming weeks, scores of companies will report their fourth-quarter results. A senior White House economics official acknowledged that there could be a torrent of bad news from corporate America.\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cThere are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\u201dHe seemed to suggest that was not necessarily bad, because it could help the Trump administration achieve its goal of getting China to make trade concessions to the United States.Those comments did little to assuage the fears of investors. The S&P 500 stock index closed down about 2.5 percent, leaving it more than 16 percent below the high it hit in September. But perhaps the most notable move was in the market for government bonds, where investors park their money in times of stress or when they expect the economy to slow. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 2.56 percent, well below the level it reached in early November, when investors were more optimistic about the economy.\u201cOn days like today people say, \u2018Crud, I\u2019ve got to buy tons of bonds,\u2019\u201d said Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s driven by a large change in sentiment.\u201dImportant indicators still show the American economy is growing at a decent clip. A measure of employment in the private sector in December, released Thursday, was higher than expected. And ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report on Friday, analysts estimated that employers added about 180,000 jobs in December.Despite this, companies and consumers are facing challenges that could make them more cautious about spending money. If they pull back, the economy will suffer. Apple\u2019s warning provides strong evidence that the trade tensions with China are taking a toll. And if more indicators show the American economy stumbling, investors will become more convinced that the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate increases are dampening activity.Corporate profits \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 are highly sensitive to global economic weakness. Foreign sales accounted for 45 percent of the revenues of companies in the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.There are signs of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies beginning to weigh on domestic demand, too. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its index of manufacturing activity fell sharply in December, the largest one-month drop since the last recession.The manufacturing index fell to what is still considered a healthy level, consistent with other data generally showing that the economy remains in good shape. But the downward trend contributed to a growing sense of unease on Wall Street about how soon the current expansion might end.\u201cWhen it has seeped into the survey it probably means it\u2019s three to five weeks old,\u201d Mr. Vogel said.Indeed, investors are so convinced trouble is coming that they are betting the Federal Reserve will abandon its plans to raise interest rates in 2019.Fed officials predicted in mid-December that the central bank would raise its benchmark rate twice this year, moving the rate into a \u201cneutral\u201d range that neither stimulates nor discourages economic activity. By the end of trading Thursday, the odds of an interest-rate cut in 2019 had climbed above 50 percent.Robert Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reinforced those expectations, telling Bloomberg Television that the Fed should wait at least a few months before considering any additional increases.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be taking any further action until some of these uncertainties resolve themselves, and I think that could take several months,\u201d he said on Thursday.Mr. Kaplan, however, is not a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee this year. The committee comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and a rotating selection of five of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks.An indication of the Fed\u2019s views could come Friday morning, when the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a public appearance with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.\u201cThere\u2019s a belief he\u2019s willing to back off, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said, referring to Mr. Powell. \u201cIf the Fed hikes rates in March, it\u2019ll be a mess.\u201dAnd on Thursday an ominous event occurred in the government bond market. The yield on the 5-year Treasury note fell below that of the 3-month Treasury bill. Yields are generally higher on longer-term debt. An inversion of that pattern signals a loss of confidence in longer-term economic prospects and has often served as an early warning of a recession.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have raised prices on a wide range of Chinese components used by American manufacturers. Roughly half of the companies in the I.S.M. survey said tariffs were weighing on profits, or raising costs.Linton Crystal Technologies, a firm based in Rochester, makes specialized furnaces used to grow silicon tubes, which are cut into wafers for semiconductors and solar panels that are sold to customers all over the world. The work was once performed entirely in the United States. But even though they are still designed, assembled and customized in the United States, the machines\u2019 components now are built in China.Mr. Trump has said the goal of his trade policies was to convince companies like Linton to bring back jobs from China. Mr. Hassett emphasized on Thursday that the Trump administration expected the domestic economy to remain strong, and that companies focused on the United States would benefit.But Todd Barnum, Linton Crystal\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cost of making furnaces entirely in the United States was prohibitive. And as a result of the tariffs, the company is also moving design work to China \u2014 a move Mr. Barnum said would save hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs by reducing the need for prototypes to be shipped to the United States.\u201cOur customers don\u2019t care if it was manufactured in the United States,\u201d Mr. Barnum said. \u201cThey care about the highest quality at the lowest dollar.\u201dCarlos Tejada, Amie Tsang and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Governments Malfunction and the Markets Place Their Bets", "Date": "2019-01-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThe colossal disarray over the British government\u2019s plans to leave the European Union comes at an awkward moment for global financial markets.Yet financial markets put a price on just about anything, and they don\u2019t stop functioning when governments do. Even when a projected outcome is gruesome or improbable, some traders will try to make a wager on it. Bets on \u201cBrexit\u201d \u2014 Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union \u2014 and the effects of the government shutdown in this country are well underway.Whether these bets are humane or prudent is another question. But the shifting odds on Brexit have moved stock, bond and foreign exchange markets, especially in the past two weeks, as the government of Prime Minister Theresa May has flirted with disaster.Events in London have grabbed strategists\u2019 attention. In a note to clients on Jan. 16, Capital Economics, a research group in London, said it placed a 70 percent probability on this broad outcome: that Britain finds a way to \u201cfudge and delay\u201d its exit from the European Union past the current March 29 deadline.If that delay becomes certain, or just more likely than it seems now, Capital Economics said, the value of the British pound could be expected to rise. At the same time, British stocks, which have generally lagged behind the S&P 500 since the Brexit referendum in 2016, would probably surge, Capital Economics said.March 29 remains a meaningful deadline. One way or another, Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union then. Yet lawmakers and Mrs. May\u2019s government have been unable to agree on a course of action. To continue deliberating about what to do, they would need to ask the bloc for an extension, like a team of unruly students who cannot even agree on a topic as a term-paper deadline approaches.Yet a delay is what most betting people think will happen, according to Capital Economics, which believes a negotiated settlement will, eventually, mitigate much of the harm that could be inflicted by an abrupt exit. This expectation is reflected in current stock, bond and currency prices, Capital Economics said.Bettors have not ruled out a much more disruptive scenario that is viewed as a low-probability event \u2014 somewhere below 20 percent but above zero. That is Britain\u2019s exit on March 29 without any negotiated agreement at all.Unemployment would soar, inflation would rise and Britain would fall into a serious recession, the central bank said. While the sun set on the British Empire long ago, the fallout of a calamity in Britain for the European Union, the global markets and the worldwide economy, would be significant, if less easily measured.Goldman Sachs is less sanguine than rank-and-file bettors: In a report this month, it placed the odds that Brexit would be delayed at only 50-50. And, it said, \u201cthe distribution of risks around Brexit outcomes is widening.\u201dGoldman placed a 40 percent probability on the chance that Britain, in the end, would not leave the European Union at all, which would be accomplished through another referendum repudiating the original vote. The bank assigned a 10 percent probability to a no-deal Brexit on March 29, with potentially calamitous consequences.For investors in the United States, Goldman produced a list of companies in the S&P 500 that derive considerable revenue from Britain. Buying shares of these stocks, or betting against them by shorting them, might be a handy way of using the American stock market to place a Brexit wager. The companies include Newmont Mining; PPL, a utility; and three financial services companies: Affiliated Managers; Willis, Towers, Watson; and Invesco.Corporations active in Britain have been hedging against Brexit for months, of course, by shifting parts of their operations to places deemed more stable.Whatever his reasons, most British residents can\u2019t hedge against Brexit by relocating part of their households to another country. Instead, if the probability of a wrenching separation from Europe appeared to be rising, prudent people might take the steps that anyone does when a possible disaster looms: hoarding necessities like food, water and medicine; stocking up on cash and fuel; retreating to safer ground, if any can be found.Such measures may be individual lifesavers, but when many people take them at once, they may make a crisis more severe, especially when confidence in government is ebbing.Global markets shudder when panics start, which is why bets on potential crises are risky. And if this is true for Brexit, what can we say about the longest government shutdown in United States history?Financial markets have largely taken the shutdown, and the news Friday of a deal to re-open the government for three weeks, in stride. Despite the pain inflicted on government workers and those who depend on them, economists have generally concluded that the effects will be transitory.But even if a permanent funding agreement is reached, political tensions in the United States remain high, amid a series of simmering crises that could easily unnerve markets. These include the trade conflict between the United States and China and America\u2019s fraying relations with allies like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and Mexico.Market calculations shift swiftly, and hedging against losses on multiple fronts could quickly become the order of the day.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Trade Talks Begin, Trump Sees China\u2019s Economic Weakness as U.S. Strength", "Date": "2019-01-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists, insisting that the United States has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning on Monday in Beijing.It helps his case that the Labor Department published a jobs report for December that soared past expectations. \u201cChina\u2019s not doing very well now,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a news conference at the White House, hours after the report came out on Friday. \u201cIt puts us in a very strong position. We are doing very well.\u201dChinese officials appear set to offer a mix of concessions, including reducing some tariffs on American goods, as they try to defuse trade tensions ahead of a March 2 deadline, when tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports will increase to 25 percent from 10 percent. An American delegation of midlevel trade officials will begin two days of talks with their counterparts on Monday in Beijing, led by Jeffrey Gerrish, the deputy United States trade representative, and David Malpass, the Treasury Department\u2019s under secretary for international affairs.If the talks are constructive, a senior-level delegation of Chinese officials is expected to travel to Washington within a few weeks to meet with Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary.Top administration officials are confident they are in a strong enough position to win significant changes, including an end to China\u2019s practice of forcing American companies to hand over intellectual property and an agreement to buy more agricultural and energy products from the United States.While such concessions are possible, China trade experts say they are not likely to happen easily or quickly, given the structural and legal changes they would require. That could ultimately set the stage for a protracted fight that goes beyond March 2 and hurts consumer spending, corporate profits and economic growth in America.\u201cThe balance of leverage appeared to have shifted in favor of the U.S., with signs that China\u2019s economy was slowing down, but the stock market rout and concerns about a U.S. growth slowdown have restored a more even balance between the two sides,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade expert at Cornell University. \u201cStill, it will be tough sledding for the U.S. and China to reach a deal that is acceptable to both sides.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe best that can be hoped for is a cessation of further trade hostilities, with the trade sanctions already implemented by both sides likely to remain in place.\u201dMichael Pillsbury, a China expert at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration, warned that the negotiations would not be easy. He predicted that the Chinese would most likely try to make an offer that divides White House officials, satisfying the more moderate advisers like Mr. Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, while frustrating Mr. Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, another senior adviser.\u201cIf they are true to past history of negotiations, they will make a credible but minimal offer,\u201d Mr. Pillsbury said of Chinese leaders.Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged as much on Thursday, when he told CNN that there are \u201ca heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\u201dFarmers who have been relying on an Agriculture Department program to mitigate the impact of the trade war through a special $12 billion subsidy fund are now being left in the lurch. According to a U.S.D.A. spokesman, farmers who have already certified their 2018 production will receive payments under the Market Facilitation Program, despite the lapse in federal funding. But farmers who have not done so must wait to certify until Farm Service Agency offices reopen when funding is restored.Tax refunds will also not be issued during the shutdown, and taxpayers trying to determine their bill for 2018 will not be able to ask questions of the Internal Revenue Service.\u201cI understand that the I.R.S. furloughed nearly 70,000 I.R.S. employees (87.5 percent of the work force), ceased needed taxpayer services, and stopped issuing tax refunds during the government shutdown,\u201d Representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, wrote in a letter to Mr. Mnuchin on Friday. \u201cThese actions are causing undue hardship to American taxpayers and the I.R.S. civil servants.\u201dAnalysts also view the gridlock between the White House and Democrats who now control the House of Representatives as a bad omen for other challenges that the government will face this year, such as lifting the government\u2019s borrowing limit.\u201cThe ongoing shutdown suggests that the current arrangement of political forces, following November\u2019s midterm elections that resulted in a divided Congress, limits policy consistency,\u201d said Charles Seville, a senior director at Fitch, another credit rating firm.American businesses are already beginning to struggle with the effects of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s first moves as president: his withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multination trade agreement that includes several Asian countries. That agreement is finally taking effect \u2014 without the United States \u2014 and the other 11 remaining countries are beginning to see the benefits of lower tariffs.This is putting American businesses, such as the beef industry, at a competitive disadvantage to other countries, like Australia and Canada, when trying to sell beef in Japan. Beef exports to Japan currently face a 38.5 percent tariff, while tariffs for other countries that remained in the agreement have fallen to 27.5 percent and will continue to decline in the coming years.\u201cWe\u2019re going to start to see more incentives to buy from our competitors,\u201d said Kent Bacus, director of international trade and market access at the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to delay the talks, we need them to move as quickly as possible.\u201dInvestors would love to see a quick resolution to the trade tensions as well. Stocks have gyrated as the trade war has escalated and the S&P 500 is down more than 8 percent from a year ago, its largest annual drop since the 2008 financial crisis. It is down more than 13 percent since the end of October.Further drops could increase pressure on Mr. Trump \u2014 who famously bragged that trade wars are \u201ceasy to win\u201d but who views the stock market as a barometer of his economic success \u2014 to settle for a quicker deal than he wants.Still, Mr. Trump showed no sign of pressure on Sunday. \u201cI think good things are going to happen\u201d on a trade deal, Mr. Trump told reporters before boarding Marine One on his way to Camp David, where staff officials will discuss the shutdown, China and immigration.He also celebrated the December jobs numbers, and mocked Wall Street analysts for being surprised by them. \u201cIt didn\u2019t shock me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI know what\u2019s going on.\u201dAlan Rappeport reported from Washington and Jim Tankersley from Atlanta.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Companies Flocked to U.S. Markets in 2018. The Trade War May Have Had a Role.", "Date": "2019-01-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe trade war didn\u2019t seem to discourage Chinese companies from listing their shares on American exchanges last year. In fact, it might have brought more Chinese companies to Wall Street.Tencent Music\u2019s trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange in December capped a wave of Chinese companies going public in the United States. In total, 33 Chinese firms raised $9.2 billion through initial public offerings on American exchanges \u2014 up 140 percent from 2017 and the highest level since 2014, according to Dealogic.Of course, 2014 comes with an asterisk of sorts. Alibaba went public in September that year, raising $25 billion. Subtract the value of Alibaba\u2019s offering and Chinese firms raised just $3 billion that year.Last year, however, offerings from Chinese firms dominated the United States market for initial public offerings. The three largest I.P.O.s by market value were Chinese companies. And Chinese firms accounted for four of the 10 largest such offerings in 2018 ranked by amount raised on American exchanges, the most of any country, including the United States, according to Dealogic.Why list in America?American exchanges offer prestige and a broader investor base that Chinese entrepreneurs can find attractive. The United States also offers a quicker route to the public markets. While Chinese regulators have taken steps to reduce the long wait, it still takes 18 months or longer for shares to begin trading from the time a company files to go public. That compares with just 42 days to list in the United States, according to Dealogic.But the trade war may also have been a factor.A slowing Chinese economy and escalating trade tensions dragged down markets in Hong Kong and China before stocks in the United States turned seriously wobbly. At their lows in late October, the Hang Seng stock index and the benchmark stock indexes in Shenzhen and Shanghai were down 15 percent to 35 percent for the year. By comparison, the S & P 500 was still up 2.5 percent at that point, making it far more attractive for offerings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Effects of the 2013 \u2018Taper Tantrum\u2019 Linger Over Fed Policy", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, says he still carries the scars of the Fed\u2019s missteps in the spring of 2013.That June, Mr. Powell, then a relatively new member of the Fed\u2019s board, joined colleagues in urging Chairman Ben S. Bernanke to announce that the Fed finally planned to gradually reduce its economic stimulus campaign.Mr. Powell said earlier this month that the episode continued to exert a significant influence on his management of monetary policy.But the lesson Mr. Powell took from the episode, that the Fed should strive to be clear and predictable as it retreated from its stimulus campaign, is now itself causing angst in financial markets. Some investors argue the Fed is showing too little flexibility in reducing its bond holdings, by sticking to a plan that it announced more than a year ago.Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed\u2019s board in May 2012, expressed doubts from the outset about the Fed\u2019s purchases of several trillion dollars in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, part of its broader campaign in the wake of the financial crisis to reignite economic growth by holding down borrowing costs. The Fed ultimately amassed a $4.2 trillion portfolio of United States Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities as part of a strategy known as quantitative easing.The 2013 transcripts, which the Fed released after a standard five-year delay, show that Mr. Powell\u2019s concerns remained strong enough at the Fed\u2019s first meeting of the year, in January, that he argued for an end to the program in 2013, even if unemployment remained high.\u201cI believe we should adjust our purchases downward, with a view to ending them before year-end, whether or not we see a substantial improvement in the labor market,\u201d Mr. Powell said.During the first half of 2013, Mr. Powell and two fellow governors, Elizabeth Duke and Jeremy Stein, continued to raise their concerns with Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Powell, in particular, argued there was little evidence continued bond-buying was delivering significant economic benefits.At the Fed\u2019s March meeting, Mr. Powell quoted an estimate that every $500 billion of bond purchases might create 200,000 jobs \u2014 \u201cenough to move the recovery forward by about a month,\u201d he said.On the other side of the ledger, Mr. Powell said the Fed was encouraging financial speculation by holding down interest rates and by removing safer assets from the market, pushing investors into riskier investments. \u201cWe have put in place strong incentives for risk-taking,\u201d he cautioned colleagues at the March meeting. \u201cWe should expect that dealers and investors will take more and more risk as time passes.\u201dMr. Powell and the other governors were particularly concerned the Fed had set no limit on the bond purchases, instead declaring it would continue until labor market conditions improved substantially. The Fed also said that it would adjust its bond-buying in response to economic conditions. Officials conceived of the bond-buying program as similar to the Fed\u2019s management of interest rates.In May, as the economy gained strength, Mr. Bernanke agreed to acknowledge that progress by telling Congress that the Fed might reduce its bond purchases in the coming months.At the Fed\u2019s June meeting, Mr. Powell and his allies pressed Mr. Bernanke to reinforce the message.\u201cIt will be very important to leave the markets feeling much more certain about the Committee\u2019s intentions,\u201d Mr. Powell said, according to the transcripts. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the Committee, by which I really mean the Chairman, assert strong leadership to the markets on this issue at this time.\u201dMr. Powell acknowledged that the Fed was facing a challenge in explaining its plans. Economic growth had repeatedly fallen short of the Fed\u2019s expectations and millions of Americans remained out of work. Mr. Bernanke would need to explain why the Fed thought the economy needed less help.But he expressed confidence in Mr. Bernanke. \u201cMuch rests on the shoulders of the Great Communicator,\u201d he said, referring to the chairman. Then he compared Mr. Bernanke to LeBron James.The taper tantrum, Mr. Powell said in Atlanta, is \u201cone of the reasons why the balance sheet is supposed to be in the background, gradual and predictable, paint drying, as opposed to an active tool.\u201dBut investors increasingly are divided on the wisdom of that approach. Some see little evidence the Fed\u2019s plodding approach is disrupting financial markets. Others say the Fed, despite moving slowly and predictably, is still making waves.\u201cWe believe balance sheet normalization played an important role in the late 2018 market volatility,\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s economics team wrote in a research note on Friday. Just as Mr. Powell argued that the Fed\u2019s bond-buying encouraged investors to take risks in 2013, Morgan Stanley said that the Fed\u2019s retreat was now discouraging risk-taking.Mr. Powell and other Fed officials have said they see no evidence that the Fed\u2019s balance sheet retreat is contributing to volatility in financial markets. At the same time, they have emphasized in recent appearances that the Fed \u201cwould not hesitate\u201d to adjust the pace of its retreat if it reached the conclusion that changes were necessary.But the history of the taper tantrum suggests that, for Mr. Powell, that is likely to be a high bar.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Turmoil Hurt Citi\u2019s Revenue as \u201918 Ended, Signaling Possible Trouble", "Date": "2019-01-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economic uncertainty that roiled the stock market at the end of 2018 hurt Citigroup\u2019s trading business, the bank said on Monday, as a busy week of quarterly earnings reports by the country\u2019s largest banks got off to a shaky start.Citi said it had almost a half-billion dollars less in revenue in the year\u2019s fourth quarter than analysts had expected. The cause of the drop, the bank said, was an unexpectedly sharp decline in revenue from trading in government bonds, foreign currencies and other fixed income products as falling stock prices spooked investors.Investors have fretted for the past several months over the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves and President Trump\u2019s unpredictable trade tariff announcements. Those concerns are not likely to dissipate, and Citi\u2019s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said they could eventually be more of a drag on the economy than actual policy changes.\u201cRight now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession,\u201d Mr. Corbat said in a conference call with analysts.Still, Citi warned that monetary and trade policies could affect its performance in the future.The bank\u2019s chief financial officer, John Gerspach, said in a call with reporters that continuing uncertainty about how various countries\u2019 central banks will carry out plans to drain excess cash from the global financial system and about the Trump administration\u2019s protracted trade war with China risked hurting the American economy in the second half of this year or early in 2020.Citi recorded $17.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared with the $17.6 billion expected by analysts. The deficit did not indicate major problems for the bank, but it showed that, however vague, investors\u2019 worries about the future can have a measurable impact on a big corporation\u2019s results.Furious activity in the financial markets can sometimes help companies that are close to Wall Street by generating more business for them, but Citi\u2019s clients opted to hold tight as stocks began to drop in September, Mr. Gerspach said.\u201cClients \u2014 investors and corporate clients \u2014 waited on the sidelines,\u201d he said.Citi customers, Mr. Gerspach said, did not ask the bank to make many trades on their behalf because they were \u201cwaiting for clearer market conditions\u201d that never came.\u201cIn December, they got worse,\u201d he said.As a result, Citi\u2019s fixed income trading revenue for the fourth quarter was down 21 percent from the same period a year earlier and 39 percent below the results for the third quarter of 2018.The bank\u2019s performance in other areas was solid. Loans and deposits ticked up again, and Citi said the administration\u2019s corporate tax cuts had been slightly better for its balance sheet than originally estimated. Citi shares were up nearly 4 percent in trading Monday.Citigroup was the first of the country\u2019s major banks to report fourth-quarter results. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo will issue their reports on Tuesday, with Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley set to do so on Wednesday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market Is Making a Comeback. Was It Something the Fed Said?", "Date": "2019-01-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks have staged a remarkable turnaround in the early days of 2019, rebounding after an end-of-the-year tailspin that was fomented by fears of recession in the United States.Three straight weeks of gains in the new year on Wall Street have erased nearly all of 2018\u2019s losses. It\u2019s the best start to a year since 1987.Even so, many factors behind last year\u2019s troubling decline remain unresolved. American companies and consumers are less optimistic about the future, and large economies like Germany and China are signaling a global slowdown driven by the trade war. Britain is in turmoil over leaving the European Union. And a new concern, the longest federal government shutdown in history, also poses a risk to the domestic economy.A month ago, any one of those elements might have fueled a steep decline in stocks. In December, waves of panic-driven selling left the S&P 500 dangling almost 20 percent below its high. Now, it\u2019s all being taken in stride.The difference is an abrupt change in tone from the Federal Reserve. This year began with repeated public assurances from Fed officials that they were sensitive to concerns about the economy and would be patient and flexible as they decided whether to raise interest rates.\u201cThey\u2019re trying their best to be a source of stability in markets,\u201d said Samantha Azzarello, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cWhat happened last year really shook people and their confidence in investing in equities.\u201dThe Fed has always held sway over the financial markets, but that influence tends to grow in the later stages of an expansion, when every interest rate increase is seen as the one that might trip up the economy.The United States economy is still strong: The unemployment rate is near 50-year lows, wages are starting to rise and growth in corporate profits remains robust. To the Fed, these are reasons to keep raising borrowing costs and stave off potential inflation. It did so four times in 2018.But after 10 years of economic growth, many investors are worried that a turning point is near, and that higher interest rates might bring on a slowdown faster than they expect. And the recent stock market gains may not stick without proof that corporate profits can keep growing.\u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a \u2018show me\u2019 moment for skeptical and uncertain investors,\u201d said Kate Moore, chief equity strategist for BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment firm. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be backed up with earnings and the confidence that those earnings are going to be sustainable.\u201dThis past week, American companies began disclosing their sales and profits for the fourth quarter. With about 10 percent of companies in the S&P 500 posting results, the reports have been strong.After the S&P 500 rose 2.9 percent in the week through Friday, it is up 13.6 percent from its Dec. 24 low. The stock index ended trading on Friday just below its 2018 starting point.However, earnings reports reflect only what happened in the past. When it comes to how they will do in 2019, some large businesses have cautioned that they don\u2019t have a clear view.Ford recently warned that the trade war and Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union made it impossible to offer investors a forecast. The homebuilder Lennar did the same, blaming weakness and uncertainty in the housing market.The shutdown is affecting some large businesses already. On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines cautioned that reduced travel by government officials and contractors would hurt its sales growth, at a rate of about $25 million a month. JPMorgan Chase executives noted that if the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 currently closed except for emergency matters \u2014 was not able to give approvals for stock market share offerings, and mergers went unapproved by other government agencies, it could cut fee revenue for its investment banking operations.Profits at American companies may be hurt by the United States\u2019 trade war with China. Evidence that it is slowing global growth mounted this past week, with Germany reporting its slowest annual growth rate since 2013 and China saying that exports fell last month.Companies in the S&P 500 generate 37 percent of their sales, on average, from markets outside the United States, according to the data provider FactSet, and businesses that have increased their exposure to global economies now look vulnerable.But for the most part, stock investors have shrugged off these concerns in January, now that they see the Fed as less eager to raise rates.The Fed had spooked investors as recently as Dec. 19, when it raised interest rates, and its chairman, Mr. Powell, said he didn\u2019t see a need for the central bank to change the way it has been slowly selling off the bonds it bought to bolster the economy over the last decade. The stock market slid 6 percent in the days afterward.\u201cClearly the market was skittish about, primarily, the Fed,\u201d said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. \u201cIt sounded like the Fed was on autopilot.\u201dBy Jan. 4, Mr. Powell\u2019s comments had a different tone. Speaking at a public panel discussion, he made a point of emphasizing the Fed\u2019s ability to be patient with further interest rate increases, given that inflation remains low.\u201cWe\u2019re listening with, you know, sensitively to the message that \u2014 that markets are sending,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward.\u201dWithin days, other central bank officials repeated the sentiment, and the Fed published the details of its December meeting, which showed that many of its policymakers had already reached that conclusion. Stocks had already bounced off their Christmas Eve low when Mr. Powell spoke, but have gained 9.1 percent since.\u201cTheir commentary has really done a 180 in a really short period of time,\u201d said David Giroux, chief investment officer of United States equity at asset manager T. Rowe Price.Over the last 30 years, investors have grown accustomed to looking to the Fed for help when the market found itself in a sticky spot. Some trace the phenomenon to the October 1987 market crash. The morning after stocks tumbled roughly 20 percent in a single day, the Fed, under the recently appointed Alan Greenspan, issued a statement indicating that it was ready to support the economic and financial system.Stocks rebounded sharply, helping to embed an expectation into the markets that continues today. And, in the past decade, as stocks have climbed in their longest run of gains ever, the Fed\u2019s decisions to back away from plans to raise interest rates or withdraw economic stimulus have helped keep the bull market alive.Mr. Powell and the Fed seem to have done that again.\u201cI think his comments on Jan. 4 were critical to getting excitement and willingness to invest back into the market,\u201d Ms. Levine said.Peter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How 3 Funds Sidestepped a Market Thumping", "Date": "2019-01-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor mutual-fund investors, the fourth quarter of 2018 was a hailstorm \u2014 a stinging deluge in which nearly every sort of investment seemed to get plunked.Yet several top-performing funds managed to find refuge in far-flung corners of the market, like Latin American companies, real estate investment trusts and dividend-paying stocks.Brazil accounted for much of that gain. It endured a severe recession in 2015 and 2016 and anemic growth in 2017. But a stronger recovery began last year, and the Brazilian Bovespa stock index gained 15 percent in 2018.Brazil is Latin America\u2019s biggest economy, and its stocks account for more than 60 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Latin America index, so Ms. Wachnitz keeps a big chunk of her shareholders\u2019 money there.The banks, two of Brazil\u2019s heftiest, are profiting as consumers start to borrow and spend more with the recovery, Ms. Wachnitz said.Lojas Renner likewise stands to gain from a surge in consumer spending. \u201cThey\u2019re really going into the digital age, and the consumer experience improves every year,\u201d she said. \u201cNow you can check out directly with employees who have hand-held devices.\u201dMs. Wachnitz has also benefited from where she chose not to invest: She shied from Mexico, because of concerns about how the policies of its new government might affect the profitability of its companies. Mexican shares make up only 14.6 percent of her fund, compared with 21.6 percent of the index. The S&P BMV IPC, a leading Mexico stock index, lost 15.27 percent last quarter.\u201cI\u2019m not that worried about trade and Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cThe new trade agreement is moving forward. But policymaking is deteriorating in Mexico, with a more populist, left-wing type of government.\u201dMs. Wachnitz\u2019s fund, with a net expense ratio of 1.29 percent, returned 6.01 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of 13.52 percent, including dividends, for the S&P 500. The quarter\u2019s punishments weren\u2019t limited to the S&P 500 and Mexico: Nearly every stock-market sector tracked by Morningstar recorded a loss.How three of the better performers of the last quarter of 2018 fared against the market \u2014 and against their peer groups of funds.T.

He then tweaks the precise weight of each by consulting with MFS\u2019s other portfolio managers and its analysts. \u201cIn the fourth quarter, we were overweight emerging-market debt and R.E.I.T.s and underweight high-yield debt and global dividend-paying stocks,\u201d he said.Those emerging-markets bonds represent a wager that the finances of some of the developing world\u2019s governments are safer than the markets may appreciate. Mr. Almeida said many investors fixate on the economic trouble spots in the emerging world, like recently Venezuela and Turkey.\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t get talked about is Chile and Peru, which are fundamentally strong countries. I don\u2019t think of them as high risk. High-yield debt is risk. There, you\u2019re lending to the lower-quality end of the U.S. corporate market, which is going to have to refinance a lot of debt at higher rates over the next two to three years.\u201dAmong R.E.I.T.s, Mr. Almeida said, MFS prefers those \u201cwith properties that are really hard to replicate.\u201d His fund\u2019s top real estate holdings include the Simon Property Group, the United States\u2019 largest shopping-mall owner, and AvalonBay Communities, an apartment owner that is strong in coastal urban markets.The college funds are investment options in CollegeAmerica, a 529 college-savings plan sponsored by the state of Virginia. (That \u201c529\u201d refers to a provision of the United States Internal Revenue Code, and anyone can invest in the funds, not just Virginians, though the tax benefits may differ for people in other states.) The 2024 fund lost 1.27 percent in the fourth quarter, while the 2027 fund lost 3.26 percent. The 2024 fund has an expense ratio of 0.73 percent, while the 2027 has one of 0.8 percent.Wesley K.-S. Phoa, principal investment officer for American Funds\u2019 target-date college funds series, said the funds\u2019 bond investments didn\u2019t carry excessive credit risk or unexpected correlations with the stock market, while the stock investments emphasized sturdiness, not sizzle. \u201cWe\u2019ve picked stock funds that focus on solid blue-chip dividend payers, and that has delivered the resilience we hoped it would,\u201d he said.Mr. Phoa said college funds present an unusual asset-allocation challenge in that investors \u2014 often parents \u2014 are seeking the savings growth that stocks can bring but they typically have only about 15 years to achieve that. That gives them less time to ride out down markets, like the fourth quarter\u2019s thumping.\u201cMost parents make steady modest contributions, and a lot start when their kids are 6 or 7,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting in modest amounts, you want to get as much growth as you can. So we\u2019re pretty growth oriented for a young beneficiary. But once you get within a couple of years in college enrollment, that\u2019s the last thing you want. So at this stage, we\u2019re invested very conservatively.\u201dFor the 2024 fund, whose intended beneficiaries are now 13 to 15 years old, that translates to about 68 percent bonds, 26 percent stocks and 6 percent cash. For the 2027 fund, whose intended beneficiaries are now 10 to 12, that translates to 54 percent bonds, 41 percent stocks and 5 percent cash.Mr. Phoa said he has recently gained a new appreciation of the stresses his clients face, because his own daughter is 16 and thinking about college. \u201cOnce you get within a couple of years in college enrollment, the last thing you want to discuss is what\u2019s happening in the 529 account.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the process for allocating the assets of the MFS Diversified Income Fund. The fund starts with allocations of 25 percent of assets to high-yield bonds and 15 percent to emerging-markets bonds, not with allocations of 20 percent to both of those categories.Advertisement"}
