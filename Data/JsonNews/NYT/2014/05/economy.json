{"Headline": "The Campaign for Junk Food", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorTo achieve this goal, we have adhered to one clear standard: what works. The initiatives we undertake are evidence-based, and we rely on the most current science. Research indicated that kids needed less sugar, salt and fat in their diets, so we revamped school lunch menus accordingly. When data showed that the lack of nearby grocery stores negatively affected people\u2019s eating habits, we worked to get more fresh-food retailers into underserved areas. Studies on habit formation in young children drove our efforts to get healthier food and more physical activity into child care centers.So we know that when we rely on sound science, we can actually begin to turn the tide on childhood obesity.But unfortunately, we\u2019re now seeing attempts in Congress to undo so much of what we\u2019ve accomplished on behalf of our children. Take, for example, what\u2019s going on now with the Women, Infants and Children program, known as WIC. This is a federal program designed to provide supplemental nutrition to low-income women and their babies and toddlers. The idea is to fill in the gaps in their diets \u2014 to help them buy items like fresh produce that they can\u2019t afford on their own \u2014 and give them the nutrition they\u2019re missing.Right now, the House of Representatives is considering a bill to override science by mandating that white potatoes be included on the list of foods that women can purchase using WIC dollars. Now, there is nothing wrong with potatoes. The problem is that many women and children already consume enough potatoes and not enough of the nutrient-dense fruits and vegetables they need. That\u2019s why the Institute of Medicine \u2014 the nonpartisan, scientific body that advises on the standards for WIC \u2014 has said that potatoes should not be part of the WIC program.This is a big win for parents who are working hard to serve their kids balanced meals at home and don\u2019t want their efforts undermined during the day at school. And it\u2019s a big win for all of us since we spend more than $10 billion a year on school lunches and should not be spending those hard-earned taxpayer dollars on junk food for our children.Yet some members of the House of Representatives are now threatening to roll back these new standards and lower the quality of food our kids get in school. They want to make it optional, not mandatory, for schools to serve fruits and vegetables to our kids. They also want to allow more sodium and fewer whole grains than recommended into school lunches. These issues will be considered when the House Appropriations Committee takes up the annual spending bill for the Agriculture Department on Thursday.Remember a few years ago when Congress declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches? You don\u2019t have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn\u2019t make much sense. Yet we\u2019re seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools.Our children deserve so much better than this. Even with the progress we have made, one in three children in this country is still overweight or obese. One in three is expected to develop diabetes in his or her lifetime. And this isn\u2019t just about our children\u2019s health; it\u2019s about the health of our economy as well. We already spend an estimated $190 billion a year treating obesity-related conditions. Just think about what those numbers will look like in a decade or two if we don\u2019t start solving this problem now.The bottom line is very simple: As parents, we always put our children\u2019s interests first. We wake up every morning and go to bed every night worrying about their well-being and their futures. And when we make decisions about our kids\u2019 health, we rely on doctors and experts who can give us accurate information based on sound science. Our leaders in Washington should do the same.Michelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Climbs for 4th Straight Session", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market rose on Tuesday as Wall Street saw more promising signs that the economy was strengthening after its winter slowdown.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose for the fourth straight trading session and ended at another nominal high. It closed above 1,900 for the first time on Friday. Small-company stocks and other riskier parts of the market, like Internet and biotechnology companies, also gained after being beaten down over the last few months.The government reported that orders to factories for long-lasting manufactured goods rose unexpectedly in April, powered by an increase in demand for military aircraft. Also, the Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence index rose in May to the second-highest level since January 2008, just after the start of the Great Recession.\u201cEveryone\u2019s been continuing to look for signs about whether the economy is picking up some speed,\u201d said Kate Warne, an investment strategist at Edward Jones. The report on manufactured goods \u201cis one more piece of evidence suggesting that it really was weather and not something else slowing growth in the winter time.\u201dThe S.&P. 500 rose 11.38 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,911.91. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 69.23 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,675.50. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 51.26 points, or 1.2 percent, to 4,237.07.Stocks rose from the opening bell after the durable goods report. Eight of the 10 sectors that make up the S.&P. 500 rose, led by financial and technology companies.Small-company stocks also made big gains, suggesting that investors were more comfortable making riskier investments. The Russell 2000 rose 1.4 percent, its biggest gain in two weeks.Hillshire Brands, the maker of Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and other products, was among the biggest gainers on Tuesday. Its stock jumped $8.17, or 22.1 percent, to $45.19 after the poultry producer Pilgrim\u2019s Pride offered to acquire the company in a deal valued at about $6.4 billion. Pilgrim\u2019s Pride said the deal was better than Hillshire\u2019s plan, announced earlier this month, to buy Pinnacle Foods for $4.3 billion. Pinnacle\u2019s stock fell $1.79, or 5.4 percent, to $31.48.Despite the positive economic news, bond prices rose. Typically, bond prices fall and their yields rise when economic data improves as traders anticipate that interest rates will rise in the future. Instead, the price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 99 27/32, late Monday, while its yield fell to 2.52 percent from 2.54 percent late Friday. The yield on the note is trading close to its lowest in 10 months. The recent surge in bonds is one of the reasons behind the uptick in stocks, said Jeffrey Knight, head of global asset allocation at Columbia Management, an asset management company. Although stocks are no longer cheap on an absolute level after the S.&P. 500 rose almost 30 percent last year, they still look like a good value compared with bonds.Among the stocks on the move, Bank of America rose 50 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $15.22 after it said it was resubmitting a review of its operations to the Federal Reserve a month after discovering errors in its initial report. That forced the bank to suspend a dividend increase and a plan to buy back more of its own shares.Staples fell 23 cents, or 2 percent, to $11.42 after Goldman Sachs cut its earnings outlook for the office supplies retailer. Analysts at the bank expect profit margins at Staples to fall because of its continuing program of investment and diversification.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Financial Crisis, Over and Already Forgotten", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceMichael S. Barr, a law professor at the University of Michigan who was an assistant Treasury secretary when the financial crisis was at its worst, is working on a book titled \u201cFive Ways the Financial System Will Fail Next Time.\u201dThe first of them, he says, is \u201camnesia, willful and otherwise,\u201d regarding the causes and consequences of the crisis. My request for an interview with Mr. Hensarling was turned down. I would have asked him about Long-Term Capital Management and the American International Group. The first, a money manager, caused a crisis when it failed in 1998; the other, an insurance company, had to be bailed out in 2008.So far the council has identified three such institutions, A.I.G., GE Capital and Prudential. The Fed has yet to actually impose regulations on them, so we really don\u2019t know much about the effect of such designations, but that has not kept both the mutual fund industry and the insurance industry from lobbying heavily. They do their best to leave us with the impression that the only asset managers around are plain-vanilla mutual fund companies. Hedge funds, like Long-Term Capital, are studiously ignored.FSOC also has the authority to suggest that one of its regulatory members act on an issue it sees as systemically important. It has done so on money market mutual funds, but so far the Securities and Exchange Commission has not acted.It is far from clear that FSOC is going to try to impose any regulation on large mutual fund companies, but the council is gathering information on them and asking questions of them. That seems to have outraged the industry and its friends in Congress.The campaign against FSOC has been innovative in its arguments. The mutual fund industry says that designating a fund manager as systemically important could raise its costs. Those costs could be passed on to fund investors, who are taxpayers, and so would amount to a taxpayer bailout.At the committee hearing the next day, Mr. Hensarling made it clear he was not reassured. He said FSOC should \u201ccease and desist\u201d any consideration of further designations \u201cuntil Congress can review the entire matter.\u201dSheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who now heads the Systemic Risk Council, a group that pushes for effective financial regulation, says she has seen this show before.\u201cIt\u2019s just like Brooksley Born and the derivatives industry,\u201d she told me. Ms. Born, as chairwoman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in the Clinton administration, had the temerity to suggest that the C.F.T.C. should look into regulating over-the-counter derivatives. The industry went crazy, and she received no support from the White House or from fellow regulators at the Treasury, the Fed or the S.E.C. Congress responded by passing legislation to bar the C.F.T.C. \u2014 or any other regulator \u2014 from doing anything about derivatives.At the time, the argument was that there was no need to regulate the derivatives markets because the main players in them \u2014 banks and brokerage firms \u2014 were already regulated.Had a regulator been paying attention to the derivatives markets, would we have gotten such amazing financial instruments as synthetic collateralized debt obligations, which put together the worst parts of bad mortgage derivatives? Would someone have noticed the gambling in credit-default swaps that almost destroyed A.I.G.? We don\u2019t know, of course, but what we do know is that Wall Street felt free to invent and exploit any product it wished. If financial engineers called a product a swap, that made it a derivative and exempted it from regulation.Ms. Bair says she thinks the attacks on FSOC are intended to intimidate it, both from designating any more firms as systemically important and from acting again on money market funds if the S.E.C., as expected, fails to pass any meaningful regulation. She sees the very existence of such funds as a regulatory failure, arguing that they should either have floating net asset values, as normal mutual funds do, or be required to maintain reserves, as banks are.Money market funds often lend money to financial institutions, and a number of them were damaged when Lehman Brothers failed in 2008. Some fund sponsors stepped in to bail out their funds, fearing damage to reputations, but one did not. The Reserve Fund \u201cbroke the buck,\u201d meaning investors could not withdraw their money without losses. The money market fund industry was saved from a run by the prompt action of the Treasury Department, which guaranteed its assets. Congress later barred regulators from ever mounting a similar bailout.Now, amnesia, or perhaps we should call it, as Ms. Bair does, \u201crevisionist history,\u201d has persuaded some people that there is no threat of anything similar happening.The hearing this week was on a bill proposed by Representative Scott Garrett, a New Jersey Republican and chairman of the capital markets subcommittee, that would change the way FSOC operates. No longer would the heads of the agencies be voting based on what they thought was wise, as the law now requires. Instead, they would be voting as representatives of their agencies, and no vote at FSOC could be taken until the issue was debated and voted on at each agency, including the S.E.C., the C.F.T.C. and the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors. Each agency head would have to vote as his or her members directed. In addition, at any FSOC meeting, members of all of the agencies could take part in the discussion. Even if the meeting was being held in private, it could be attended by up to 83 legislators \u2014 the 61 members of the House Financial Services Committee and the 22 members of the Senate Banking Committee. If staff members from the FSOC member agencies assembled for a meeting, the Financial Services and Banking Committee staffs would also have to be invited. That would seem to be a recipe to hamstring FSOC, but members of the committee see it as a matter of openness and fairness. \u201cI\u2019m discouraged by the council\u2019s lack of bipartisan voices and think that FSOC would be well served by a more inclusionary and collaborative operating model,\u201d Representative Ed Royce, a California Republican, said after the hearing. Mr. Hensarling has other concerns. He fears we have \u201cceded U.S. sovereignty over financial regulatory matters to a secretive, unaccountable coalition of European bureaucrats.\u201d One part of the campaign against FSOC has been the contention that designating financial companies as systemically important would, in the words of Mr. Hensarling, \u201cmove institutions from the nonbailout economy to the bailout economy.\u201d In his testimony, Mr. Barr argued that the reverse was true. \u201cRegulating systemically important firms reduces the risk that failure of such a firm could destabilize the financial system and harm the real economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt provides for robust supervision and capital requirements in advance, to reduce the risks of failure. And it provides for a mechanism to wind down such a firm in the event of crisis, without exposing taxpayers or the real economy to the risks of their failure.\u201d An earlier version of this column omitted one institution among those that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated \u201csystemically important.\u201d GE Capital, in addition to A.I.G. and Prudential, has been so designated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Tells N.Y.U. Graduates to Expect Failure and Learn From It", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJanet L. Yellen has long occupied a front-row seat as Washington grappled with the financial crisis and the weak economy that has plagued the nation. Standing over second base at Yankee Stadium, where she delivered a commencement speech on Wednesday, Ms. Yellen suggested that playing the game is a lot harder than it looks from the stands.Ms. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, told a swirl of thousands of purple-robed New York University graduates that finding the right path in life involves missteps. Even Yankees legends such as Babe Ruth failed most of the time when stepping up to bat, she said.The Fed can relate to that, Ms. Yellen said.\u201cWe brainstormed and designed a host of programs to unclog the plumbing of the financial system and to keep credit flowing,\u201d said Ms. Yellen, who has served on the central bank in various positions since 2004, taking over as its leader in February. \u201cNot everything worked, but we kept at it, and we remained focused on the task at hand. I learned the lesson during this period that one\u2019s response to the inevitable setbacks matters as much as the balance of victories and defeats.\u201dWhile avoiding any detailed discussion of monetary policy, Ms. Yellen heaped praise on her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, saying his grit and courage helped him manage the financial crisis in difficult times.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s actions were \u201cunprecedented in ambition and scope,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.\u201cHe faced relentless criticism, personal threats and the certainty that history would judge him harshly if he were wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he stood up for what he believed was right and necessary. Ben Bernanke\u2019s intelligence and knowledge served him well as chairman.\u201dThe speech on the infield was a departure from Ms. Yellen\u2019s typical days, which she often spends surrounded by economists in the Fed\u2019s cloistered headquarters and meeting with business executives, politicians and officials.Wednesday morning, she shared the stage in the Bronx with a baseball legend, Mariano Rivera, a former Yankees player and top relief pitcher who played on five winning World Series teams; with Elena Kagan, the Supreme Court justice; and with Aretha Franklin, the queen of soul. All received honorary degrees.Listen carefully, she advised the graduates, even to detractors. Success based on ability alone is a myth, Ms. Yellen said. Instead, she advised them to show grit, which she described as \u201can abiding commitment to work hard toward long-range goals and to persevere through the setbacks that come along the way.\u201dThe ceremony represented a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Yellen, who spent her childhood in Brooklyn and attended Fort Hamilton High School in Bay Ridge. Ms. Yellen, who studied economics as an undergraduate at Brown University, went on to receive a doctorate from Yale. She later became an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley and served for a time as President Bill Clinton\u2019s chief economic adviser. Her husband and son are also economists.The state of the economy was definitely on the minds of graduates and parents at the ceremony. Angela Bountouvas of Queens said that when she sent her son, Anastasios, to college four years ago, she had hoped the job market would be brighter by the time he graduated. He is a math major and is about to join the ranks of the unemployed.\u201cIt\u2019s opening up a little, but it might not be enough,\u201d she said.For Ms. Yellen, any wrong move could spook Wall Street and rock the nation\u2019s economy. Her every word and action is examined for deeper meaning by legions of analysts and economic forecasters. As the first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, she is under the microscope.The other women honored at Wednesday\u2019s ceremony also are known for breaking gender barriers. Ms. Kagan is the fourth woman to serve as a United States Supreme Court justice; Ms. Franklin was the first woman to be named to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her song \u201cRespect\u201d was often seen as an anthem of the women\u2019s movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.Those three were on the stage at a time when several other prominent women have taken a beating in the news media. New York tabloids published headlines this week suggesting the wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was a reluctant mother to the couple\u2019s daughter. Media pundits have debated whether gender played a role in the ouster of Jill Abramson, who until last week was the executive editor of The New York Times. In recent months, Republicans have called Wendy Davis, a Democratic candidate for Texas governor, \u201cAbortion Barbie.\u201dAt Wednesday morning\u2019s ceremony Josh Lipowsky, 32, said he was impressed by the slate of honorees, particularly Ms. Yellen. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful woman in the country,\u201d he said.Sarah McGowan, a 22-year-old music and Spanish major, was also happy to see successful women honored. Ms. McGowan called Ms. Yellen \u201ca strong female figure,\u201d and said that while her speech did not mention gender at all, just by showing up \u201cshe\u2019s telling women they should not be afraid to go for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once Allies, Ex-Obama Aides Face Off in British Campaign", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 David Axelrod stood on a stage in the Buckingham Room of the Labour Party headquarters this month, rallying British progressives who are hoping, and paying, for Barack Obama\u2019s message maven to help lead them back into power.Mr. Axelrod is not the only top Obama operative at work here. A week earlier, Jim Messina, Mr. Obama\u2019s lanky 2012 campaign manager, met at Downing Street with his client, Prime Minister David Cameron of the Conservative Party, who argues that years of austerity have corrected the profligate years of Labour rule and that tough immigration laws are protecting British values and jobs.The British elections in 2015 will be waged over these competing economic visions, the country\u2019s stomach for hard-right anti-immigrant appeals, and the candidates\u2019 abilities to manage coalition partners. But the contest is also shaping into a proxy competition between two titans of the \u201cNo Drama Obama\u201d campaigns who are acting out their ideological and personal conflicts on a faraway stage. As more former aides turn their affiliation with the president into lucrative consulting arrangements, the Battle of Britain crystallizes a concern among some Democrats over whether those most central to Mr. Obama\u2019s rise should be expected in their private business to stand for his public policies and values. And if they are not, some of the president\u2019s supporters wonder what exactly it means to work for Mr. Obama in the first place.The anxiety centers on Mr. Messina, 44, who not only helped lead Mr. Obama to victory with his expertise in digital technology and data-driven organizing, but also looms in the party\u2019s future as the head of Priorities USA, the pro-Obama turned pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton \u201csuper PAC.\u201d That role has only intensified the sense among some Obama campaign and administration veterans that Mr. Messina\u2019s work for the Tories has crossed an ideological threshold that his consulting for casinos and corporations only approached; some of his former associates have spurned his offers to join in the campaign effort in London.Mr. Messina rejects the premise.\u201cLook, I feel very comfortable with my decision to go to work for David Cameron,\u201d said Mr. Messina, who flies back to London on Thursday. He said he found Mr. Cameron\u2019s support of same-sex marriage in the face of his party\u2019s opposition \u201cheroic,\u201d and called him a \u201creal leader\u201d on health care and climate change. He noted that Anita Dunn, Mr. Obama\u2019s first communications director \u2014 who, like him, has been criticized by liberals for her lucrative ideological elasticity \u2014 worked for Mr. Cameron in 2010. \u201cEnglish politics is not analogous to U.S. in their political positions,\u201d Mr. Messina argued, adding, \u201cThe conservatives are not Republicans in the United States.\u201dMr. Messina\u2019s defenders point out that Mr. Miliband\u2019s politics are considerably further left than those of American Democrats and his Labour predecessor Tony Blair, for whom several Clinton strategists worked. But critics counter that the David Cameron of 2014 is far more conservative than the one who campaigned in 2010. Progressives argue that Mr. Cameron has long since abandoned the moderate ground from which he once called the hard-right U.K. Independence Party \u201cfruitcakes and loonies and closet racists.\u201d Now he is courting that party\u2019s Euro-skeptic voters and once sent vans carrying \u201cgo home or face arrest\u201d billboards to immigrant neighborhoods. And they believe Mr. Cameron\u2019s support for economic austerity, as well as his tax cuts for the highest earners, put him in diametrical opposition to Mr. Obama.\u201cI\u2019m drawn to this fight because it very much reminds me of the two campaigns I was involved in here with Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said in an April 17 web video that announced Labour\u2019s hiring of his firm, AKPD. And Mr. Axelrod opened his meeting last Thursday with Mr. Miliband and his closest advisers by saying: \u201cI\u2019m not here on business. If I were doing this for business reasons I\u2019d be doing something else,\u201d according to Michael Dugher, a Labour lawmaker who sat across from him. People close to Mr. Axelrod, a 59-year-old Chicago-based strategist who is much more liberal on economic issues than Mr. Messina, say that Mr. Messina\u2019s involvement played a role in his taking the job.\u201cAxelrod is trying to balance out the brand damage with what Messina is doing,\u201d said the American pollster Stanley B. Greenberg, who has been working with Labour since the 1990s. \u201cHe seemed to enjoy that Messina would find it uncomfortable that they were doing this.\u201dMr. Messina protests any suggestion of tension in his relationship with Mr. Axelrod, with whom he clashed bitterly in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.\u201cNooo. That\u2019s silly. Noo. We\u2019re brothers. Noo,\u201d Mr. Messina said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through two campaigns and two years in the White House together. No, he is my brother, and I love him.\u201d He added that he had spoken with Mr. Axelrod on the phone just that morning about Senate races and Mr. Messina\u2019s wedding, which he said he hoped Mr. Axelrod would attend. \u201cHe will be as much my friend after this as he is today.\u201dMr. Axelrod declined to comment.The warring-Americans angle has not been lost on the British news media (\u201cAn Axel to Grind?\u201d read a headline in The Sun), but the day before Mr. Axelrod arrived in London, those papers were also filled with bad news for Labour. For the first time in years, the conservatives had taken a lead in national polls, prompting questions about Mr. Miliband\u2019s mettle and the strategic chops of his advisers.On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Labour lawmakers entered Parliament through Peer\u2019s Gate, where Lord Michael Dobbs, a conservative member and the author of the original \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d complained about all the speeches he had to give. They walked upstairs, under portraits of Henry VIII and his wives, and carried out pints of dark ale (and, inexplicably, Coors Light) to the House of Commons Terrace Pavilion, Parliament\u2019s watering hole overlooking the Thames. There, several Labour leaders approached a key adviser to Mr. Miliband, Lord Stewart Wood of Anfield, asking if there remained room at the next day\u2019s meetings with Mr. Axelrod.\u201cHaving winners on your side is really important,\u201d Mr. Wood explained. \u201cAxelrod won twice.\u201dThe next day, Mr. Axelrod watched the prime minister being questioned by Parliament on the television in Mr. Miliband\u2019s offices, as Mr. Cameron, polished with perfectly parted hair, hailed \u201ca broad-based recovery\u201d in the British economy. When the prime minister sat down, Mr. Miliband, more skittish and with his dark hair spotted with a white patch, bounced up and accused the prime minister of being beholden to \u201cthe old idea that the market always knows best and doesn\u2019t need rules.\u201dDuring the prior week\u2019s match of wits in the House of Commons, Mr. Axelrod became the subject of conversation when Mr. Cameron mocked his hiring by Mr. Miliband.\u201cHe\u2019s got a new adviser from America, yes, he has Mr. Axelrod,\u201d Mr. Cameron said on April 30, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are paying him.\u201dThe speaker shouted \u201corder\u201d and cut him off.Mr. Cameron\u2019s top political adviser, Lynton Crosby \u2014 an Australian known here as the Wizard of Oz \u2014 characterized Mr. Axelrod\u2019s hiring as a political stunt.\u201cJim came on board and I think that rattled Labour\u2019s cage,\u201d he said, characterizing Mr. Miliband\u2019s thinking as: \u201cHow come this Jim Messina guy is going to the Conservatives? Why can\u2019t we get someone?\u201dMr. Messina auditioned for the job \u2014 which pays in the six figures according to Tory officials \u2014 after the 2012 election by shepherding a group of Conservative officials through Washington to meet senior Obama campaign officials. \u201cI don\u2019t know who would have gone into that meeting not thinking that there was something going on between Messina and the Tories,\u201d said one such official, who considered the meeting a favor to Mr. Messina.But while Mr. Messina found former associates generous with their time, Democratic analytics firms have been less so. Several turned down offers to work with him on Mr. Cameron\u2019s race. Mr. Messina said the Conservatives \u201care doing amazing things in-house.\u201dSeveral current and former administration officials said in interviews that they had no issue with Mr. Messina\u2019s working for a valued ally such as Mr. Cameron. Others, including Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, had some reservations about Mr. Messina\u2019s taking on the Conservative Party as a client, according to several people with knowledge of the situation who asked to remain anonymous because they did not want to be seen betraying a confidence.Mr. McDonough declined to comment, but after this article was published online, Joshua Earnest, a White House spokesman, wrote that Mr. McDonough had no opinion \u201cabout a former colleague\u2019s roster of political clients.\u201dMr. Greenberg argued that taking the Tories on as clients \u201cought to be disqualifying\u201d for Mr. Messina\u2019s working on a potential Clinton presidential campaign. \u201cThis is \u2018make as much money as you can,\u2019 not the ideological side of the Obama project,\u201d he said.Several people close to Mrs. Clinton said the more immediate concern about Mr. Messina was that he had stretched himself too thin by taking on so many clients, but that it was better to keep him involved in the Clinton-focused super PAC than risk him working for someone else\u2019s.Mr. Messina said he had heard no such complaints. As much as Labour has sought to make an issue out of Mr. Messina, the struggling party, itself debating an outreach to U.K. Independence Party voters after a disappointing showing in European parliamentary elections, has also sought to turn Mr. Axelrod into a positive talking point.That has not always worked out so smoothly. As he prepared to leave London, Mr. Axelrod incorrectly spelled the Labour leader\u2019s name on Twitter, accidentally linking to a spoof account.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the river that is overlooked by the House of Commons Terrace Pavilion, a bar in Parliament. It is the Thames, not the Themes.Advertisement"}

Addressing the New America Foundation, a public policy group, Mrs. Clinton \u2014 a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, and a possible 2016 presidential candidate \u2014 appealed to the progressive wing of her party, calling for policies that would promote broad-based economic growth and help everyone from the so-called millennial generation to women gain the skills they need to succeed in a global economy.\u201cThe dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cand many Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry.\u201dShe added that the Clinton Global Initiative, for its conference in Denver next month, is assembling a network of businesses that are committed to \u201cexpanding hiring, training, mentoring \u2014 hopefully to create a virtuous ripple throughout the economy.\u201dMrs. Clinton drew on personal accounts as well, talking about the belief of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, in what Mrs. Clinton called \u201cthe basic bargain of America.\u201d Mrs. Clinton described that view as, \u201cNo matter who you are or where you come from, if you work hard and play by the rules, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to build a good life for yourself and your family.\u201dBut, she continued: \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s no secret that for too many families in America today, that isn\u2019t the way it works anymore. Instead of getting ahead, they\u2019re finding it harder than ever to get their footing in our changing economy.\u201dHer speech, which was laced with statistics and details from economic and social studies, seemed to tap into a populist moment in the country, one that has been embraced in different dimensions: on the right by the Tea Party movement that sprang up during the financial crisis, and on the left by the prescriptions of Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City.Mrs. Clinton said that some are calling the current climate \u201ca throwback to the Gilded Age of the robber barons.\u201dReferring to the struggle of a generic single mother \u2014 one of \u201csome 10 million single moms trying hard to make it in America today\u201d \u2014 Mrs. Clinton painted a bleak picture: \u201cReligious and community organizations are weaker, the schools never seem good enough, there are few quality affordable child care options. She doesn\u2019t just face ceilings on her aspirations and opportunities. Sometimes it feels as is the floor has collapsed beneath her.\u201cNow,\u201d she added, \u201cthese are the kinds of daily struggles of millions and millions of Americans, those fighting to get into the middle class and those fighting to stay there.\u201dBut Mrs. Clinton also took a detour to reminisce about the sunnier economic times during the presidency of her husband.\u201cThe 1990s taught us that even in the face of difficult long-term economic trends, it\u2019s possible through smart policies and sound investments to enjoy broad-based growth and shared prosperity,\u201d she said.\u201cYes, a rising tide really did lift all boats,\u201d she said. She briefly praised President Obama for his \u201cyears of painstaking work and strong leadership\u201d to \u201cget our economy growing again,\u201d and implicitly criticized the administration of the former President George W. Bush, without mentioning his name.Following her time as first lady, Mrs. Clinton recalled watching from a perch on the Senate Budget Committee, as New York\u2019s junior senator, how the \u201cnew administration\u201d made \u201cdifferent choices\u201d from her husband\u2019s.\u201cThe next eight years taught us different lessons about how by policy choices we can turn surpluses into debt, we can return to rising deficits,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when your only policy prescription is to cut taxes for the wealthy, and then to deal with the aftermath of a terrible terrorist attack and two wars without paying for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Polio\u2019s Return After Near Eradication Prompts a Global Health Warning", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust two years ago \u2014 after a 25-year campaign that vaccinated billions of children \u2014 the paralyzing virus was near eradication; now health officials say that goal could evaporate if swift action is not taken.Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon have recently allowed the virus to spread \u2014 to Afghanistan, Iraq and Equatorial Guinea, respectively \u2014 and should take extraordinary measures to stop it, the health organization said.\u201cThings are going in the wrong direction and have to get back on track before something terrible happens,\u201d said Gregory Hartl, a W.H.O. spokesman. \u201cSo we\u2019re saying to the Pakistanis, the Syrians and the Cameroonians, \u2018You\u2019ve really got to get your acts together.' \u201dDo you have a question about the polio vaccine? Ask Well. Your question may be answered by our reporter, Donald G. McNeil, Jr.The declaration, which effectively imposes travel restrictions on the three countries, represented a newly aggressive stance by the health organization. In the past, it has often bent to pressure from member states demanding no consequences even as epidemics raged inside their borders and sometimes slipped over them.\u201cThis is a fundamental shift in the program,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Aylward, the organization\u2019s chief of polio eradication. \u201cThis is the countries of the world signaling that they will no longer tolerate the spread of the virus from the countries that aren\u2019t finished.\u201dThe emergency was declared though the total number of known cases this year is still relatively small: 68 as of April 30, compared with 24 by that date last year.What most alarmed experts, Mr. Hartl said, was that the virus was on the move during what is normally the low transmission season from January to April.Fighting the virus normally includes several rounds of vaccination of all young children in a target country. But, in an unusual step, the agency also said that all residents of Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon, of all ages, should be vaccinated before traveling abroad, and that this restriction should be retained until one year after the last \u201cexported case.\u201dIt also said another seven countries should \u201cencourage\u201d all their would-be travelers to get vaccinated. Those are Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Nigeria and Somalia.Israel has had no confirmed human cases of the disease, but a Pakistan strain of the virus has been detected in sewage in Tel Aviv and elsewhere.While the W.H.O. has no enforcement power, the regulations are part of a 2007 global health treaty saying all parties \u201cshould ensure\u201d that steps it recommends are taken. That applies to Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon. The other seven only need to \u201cencourage\u201d those steps.But countries could use the document to refuse to admit migrants, visitors or even business travelers who lack vaccination cards.Polio, short for poliomyelitis, is a highly contagious virus spread in feces; although only one case in 200 causes symptoms, the hardest-hit victims can be paralyzed or killed. With so many silent carriers, even one confirmed case is considered a serious outbreak. There is no cure.Unlike influenza or other winter viruses, polio thrives in hot weather. Cases start rising in the summer and often explode when the monsoon rains break the summer heat, flooding sewage-choked gutters and bathing the feet of romping children with virus, which they pick up by touching their feet or a ball and then putting a finger in a mouth.Though the disease primarily strikes children, evidence has mounted that it also crosses borders in adult carriers, such as traders, smugglers and migrant workers.With 54 of this year\u2019s 68 new infections, Pakistan is by far the riskiest country, Dr. Aylward said. Polio has never been eliminated there, Taliban factions have forbidden vaccinations in North Waziristan for years, and those elsewhere have murdered vaccine teams.Syria has had only one confirmed case of polio this year, but it had 13 cases last October, the first in the country since 1999.The Syrian cases from last year were of the Pakistan strain, which was found in Egypt last year, then moved into Israel, first in a largely Bedouin desert town, then elsewhere. How it reached Syria is unclear, but in April it was found in a Syrian refugee camp in Iraq, despite extensive vaccination campaigns in camps in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and elsewhere.\u201cFortunately, it\u2019s pretty easy to do in refugee camps,\u201d Mr. Hartl said.With Syrians fleeing massacres and bombings, it seems absurd to make them stop and produce vaccination cards, critics said.Cameroon\u2019s outbreak is of a strain from Nigeria, which previously had more cases than any country in the world but which has had only two so far this year. As in Pakistan, Islamic terrorist groups in Nigeria have killed vaccinators. Nonetheless, multiple vaccination rounds have reduced the problem.Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and other African countries are all vulnerable because their routine immunization rates are so low; in Equatorial Guinea, only 26 percent of all children are protected, Dr. Martin saidIt is unclear whether the new travel restrictions will hurt the economies of the affected countries. Pakistan already has vaccination booths where its highways enter Afghanistan, China and Iran.Pakistan\u2019s health minister, Saira Afzal Tarar, said her office had recommended vaccinating travelers at the country\u2019s five international airports before they board. (The W.H.O. calls for vaccination at least four weeks before traveling, except in emergencies.)She expressed her disappointment at the restrictions, saying, \u201cWe have been doing whatever we can, but due to the law and order situation in our country, especially in the two tribal regions, we are facing extraordinary challenges.\u201dUntil 2012, the world was making enormous progress toward eliminating polio. India, which once had millions of cases, had its last three years ago. Monday\u2019s emergency was declared both to alert donors and to pressure the affected countries to organize vaccination drives, Mr. Hartl said.That means recruiting and training hundreds of thousands of vaccinators, and sending them into the field with millions of doses of vaccine, which must be kept cold, usually by packing them on ice in a foam plastic box each vaccinator carries on a shoulder strap.It is a huge logistical undertaking. Vaccinators go door to door in villages and cities, approach passengers at railway stations and on buses, and walk up to cars at toll plazas and in traffic circles. The ideal is to vaccinate every child in the country several times, with a month or so between each round.It also entails many conflicts. Even when there is no local opposition, there are struggles over issues including who gets the vaccinator jobs, which usually pay $2 to $5 a day, and who controls the gas money for minibuses taking teams to villages.Reporting was contributed by Anne Barnard, Dan Bilefsky, Rick Gladstone and Salman Masood.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How to Fix the Mortgage Market", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialImportantly, it includes a new financing provision, essentially a fee on government-guaranteed securities, to generate money for affordable housing. At its most basic, the bill would end Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 with their implicit government guarantees and confusing ownership status \u2014 but would continue vital federal support for mortgages through a new entity, the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation. The idea is to ensure that mortgage loans are broadly available, while giving taxpayers a housing market that serves the long-term interests of families and the broader economy.For all of its positive attributes, however, the Senate bill is fatally marred by two provisions buried in the text. One, named the \u201cinvestor immunity\u201d provision, is ostensibly aimed at protecting mortgage investors from legal liability for transgressions by lenders, guarantors or other participants in the mortgage process. But it is so broadly worded that it could shield most mortgage-market participants from liability for a broad range of transgressions, including violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act and of new laws, enacted after the crisis, requiring lenders to verify a borrower\u2019s ability to repay before making a loan and to treat delinquent borrowers fairly. Another section of the bill, dubbed the \u201cbusiness judgment\u201d rule, is ostensibly aimed at preventing the government from meddling in the decisions of mortgage-market participants as to which loans to include in various mortgage securities. In practice, however, a lack of supervision is an invitation to lending discrimination on racial, geographic and other grounds because lenders may tend to make loans that are easiest to sell to investors \u2014 that is, loans in high-priced communities rather than loans that reach all communities. Both of those provisions need to be struck from the bill before it is worthy of a yes vote by banking committee members. The Obama administration, which has supported the Senate effort, should tell the committee\u2019s Democratic members that the provisions are unacceptable and that deleting them is imperative.

{"Headline": "Envisioning the End of Employer-Provided Health Plans", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHealth Policy PerspectiveThe days of Americans getting health insurance through their employers may be numbered \u2014 and the change could be just as profound as the shift of employers forcing employees to manage their own retirement savings.As the Affordable Care Act goes from thousands of pages of legalese to actual, real-life public policy, the future of employer-provided health insurance is one of the most fascinating questions. Will employers call for \u2014 and their workers accept \u2014 the practice of buying health insurance through government exchanges? How much will companies save, and will they pass those savings on to employees? Will it make workers more mobile and ready to shift jobs, or will employer-paid health insurance become a sought-after perk?The answers go to the heart of how things work in a sector that is one-eighth of the American economy. A new report gives some hints of how large the impact might be.By 2020, about 90 percent of American workers who now receive health insurance through their employers will be shifted to government exchanges created by the health law, according to a projection by S&P Capital IQ, a research firm serving the financial industry.But the scope and speed of the shift is surprising. So is the amount of money that companies could save. The S&P researchers tried to estimate what it would save the biggest American companies. Their answer: $700 billion between 2016 and 2025, or about 4 percent of the total value of those companies. The total could reach $3.25 trillion for all companies with more than 50 employees.They assume those savings will accrue to companies\u2019 bottom lines, though there are also compelling reasons to think that some of those savings would end up in the pockets of American workers in the form of higher wages or other benefits.The idea is this: Now that federal and state exchanges exist where anyone, even those with pre-existing illnesses, can gain coverage, employers might decide to give their workers a stipend to pay for health insurance on the exchanges rather than sponsor a plan themselves.In truth, the American system of health care \u2014 in which most people get their private health insurance through their employer \u2014 has always been rather odd. Why should quitting a job also mean you have to get a new health insurance plan? Why should your boss get to decide what options you have and negotiate the cost of them? Employers don\u2019t get to select our auto insurance or mortgage company, so why should health insurance be any different?Michael G. Thompson, managing director at S&P Capital IQ, argues that the parallel with defined-benefit pension plans is an apt one. For decades, those plans were a major benefit offered by large employers. But as other options became available that allowed employers to more cheaply provide retirement benefits with fewer administrative headaches, which 401(k)s provided, employers shifted to 401(k)s en masse.\u201cWe still expect some companies to hold on to their health care plans, just as some private companies still have pensions,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cBut we think that the tax incentives for employer-driven insurance are not enough to offset the incentives for companies to transition people over to exchanges and have them be more autonomous around management of their own health care.\u201dThe advantages are particularly clear for companies with lower-paid workers, who may be eligible for federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act aimed at those employees making up to 400 percent of the poverty line.Not everyone is so sure. Employers may not love the administrative challenges of administering a health plan, but they have been offering these plans voluntarily for decades, because employees value the perk. An employer who backs away from offering a health insurance plan directly, instead sending workers to the exchanges, may lose a competitive advantage in hiring. (Yet companies\u2019 experience with substituting 401(k)s for pensions may have taught them that employees had little choice in the transition, and just accepted it.)There is another strong reason that employers might not rush for the exits. When an employer subsidizes a worker\u2019s health insurance plan directly, the subsidy is tax free to the employee. So the employer is effectively getting more bang for the buck in its total compensation. If an employer gives its workers extra pay to help them buy health insurance on an exchange, that money is taxable income.Add to that a $2,000 per-worker annual penalty that the Affordable Care Act charges large employers that do not provide insurance, and the pathway toward employers dropping coverage may not be as short and direct as the S&P researchers suggest.\u201cFor most firms, there isn\u2019t a net gain to dropping coverage for active workers,\u201d said David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard who advised the Obama administration in writing the law. \u201cThe subsidies are more than offset by the higher taxes workers will pay.\u201dThe story may be different, Mr. Cutler added, for retirees. Where now many employers pay for health insurance for retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, that may change.Even if the billions of dollars in savings don\u2019t materialize, it could get them out of the messy business of deciding what type of health care their employees might have.\u201cWe think that this process can ultimately yield some big savings for companies and take the responsibility and burden for health care out of their hands,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. Not what business lobbyists were pushing for in 2010, perhaps, but one more step away from work as a social service agency.The Upshot, a New York Times venture, presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.

{"Headline": "Competing Visions for Russia\u2019s Economic Future", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 A panel at an annual economic forum here was deeply divided over the direction of the Russian economy. The isolationists in the group favored relying on state banks for its financing needs. Others called for Russia to deepen its ties with China, while a different contingent said global trade and commerce remain critical. A question projected on a wall loomed large in the debate: \u201cWhat is to be done?\u201dOn the verge of recession, Russia stands at a critical crossroads. Most years, Russian officials use the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, held in the country\u2019s second largest city, to woo foreign investment, with the city\u2019s eerily beautiful period of white nights, or around the clock sunshine, acting as a selling point for delegates. The event usually attracts the global business elite from a variety of industries: energy, finance, manufacturing, media and aerospace.This year is different. The Obama administration dissuaded many chief executives of American companies like PepsiCo, Alcoa and ConocoPhillips from attending. Even many German chief executives stayed home, in spite of Germany\u2019s extensive trade ties to Russia. Olaf Koch, director of the hypermarket chain Metro, was the only major head of a German company to attend, saying he felt responsible for the well-being of Metro\u2019s 22,000 employees in Russia.Instead, the meeting was largely dominated by officials, policy wonks and executives from Russia, as well as Chinese investors.Organizers put a brave light on the snubs. About 6,500 people attended, including 609 foreign and Russian chief executives, organizers said. Robert Dudley, the American head of British energy giant BP, planned to be there. The focus at the event has shifted, too. In the past, Russia has been trumpeted as a resource-rich country with strong potential. Discussion turned on the subtleties of stimulus policies, or whether emerging markets should have more of a voice in global economic decision-making. This year, the debate centered on whether Russia even needs Western finance, hinting at the return of a heavily state-dominated economic system.In recent weeks, the investment mood in the country has improved somewhat. Signs of a de-escalation of the conflict in Ukraine mean wider sanctions are less likely. As risk of a Russian invasion faded, the yield on Russia\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bond dropped to 8.7 percent, from a peak of 9.5 percent at the end of April.\u201cThe market is a little less stressed,\u201d Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist for Citigroup in Russia, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe key question now is whether we will see a permanent downward shift in the economic growth.\u201d With the markets settling down, attention has turned to the economic situation \u2014 and how to fill the investment void. Outflows rose to $50.6 billion in the first quarter, compared to $27.5 billion in the year before, according to the Russian central bank.As Western interests lie low, Russia has been courting other deep-pocketed investors and companies. The Russia state-owned energy giant Gazprom on Wednesday agreed to sell the China National Petroleum Corporation natural gas for 30 years. China also has held talks to invest $5 billion in a Siberian electrical grid. And Chinese infrastructure companies have cut deals to build apartment blocks and retirement homes in Russia.At high levels, discussions are even emerging over a state-centered investment model and limited financial interaction with the West.\u201cNow we\u2019re back in a situation where the wild cards in the deck are really wild,\u201d said Bernard Sucher, a member of the board of directors of Aton, a Russian investment bank. \u201cRussia has decided to pursue a third way, which I consider an illusion. It is a fortress mentality that believes in a largely self-sufficient Russia that believes in its own path, and it is dangerous.\u201dAt the forum\u2019s public debate, Sergei Y. Glazyev \u2014 an economist best-known for advocating a go-slow approach to reforming the Soviet Union\u2019s economy \u2014 said Russian businesses should shift from reliance on international capital markets to internal \u201csources of credit,\u201d a reference to state banks or oil-windfall funds. Vladimir I. Yakunin, the head of the state railroad and a longtime close aide to Mr. Putin, said government infrastructure investment could supplant lost private sector funding as a stimulus for the economy. But some attendees pushed back, saying that such restrictions could have serious repercussions for the economy.Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former minister of finance who is close to Mr. Putin, said that foreign investors played only a woefully tiny role in improving Russia\u2019s roads, factories and buildings; as such, he said he believed that any policy to entrench this current state of affairs would be disastrous. \u00a0Mr. Kudrin added that mere talk of new controls on the flow of capital was putting a damper on foreign investment. If companies think they will not be able to move profits out of Russia, they will not risk investing in the first place. Russia now has one of the freest policies on capital flows of any emerging market. \u201cSuddenly, everything is unpredictable,\u201d Mr. Kudrin said. \u201cWe are waiting for the government, or more specifically, the president,\u201d to provide clarification on Russia\u2019s intended policies, he said. He suggested capping budget outlays on the military and pensions to avoid raising taxes that will tamp down business activity. Western investors, in particular, are waiting to see what that government does.Alexis Rodzianko, president\u00a0of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said in a telephone interview that American companies operating in Russia are already deeply worried by the stronger ties with Asia.\u00a0\u201cThe main concern I hear from members is that the U.S. is out ahead on sanctions, and this is harming competitiveness of U.S. companies vis-\u00e0-vis European and Asian companies,\u201d he said.Peter Mandelson, a British Labour party politician and chairman of Global Counsel, a policy consultancy, who attended the discussion, said the government\u2019s choice between the emerging strains in Russian economic policy \u2014 one favoring a pivot to Asia and reliance on state banks at home, the other continued integration with global finance \u2014 would have long-ranging ramifications. \u201cRussia has not only forfeited political trust, but, as seriously, and perhaps more seriously, Russia has forfeited market confidence, and Russia could be frozen out of international markets, and that could have serious consequences,\u201d Mr. Mandelson said. The annexation of Crimea is for Russia \u201ca self-inflicted economic wound,\u201d he added.Anatoly Chubais, who oversaw the 1990s privatizations of Soviet industry, setting the stage for Russia\u2019s economic growth of the past decade, also viewed the debate. He now heads a government-backed company investing in nanotechnology start-ups. The discussion of whether the Russian economy should be more or less open to the world, Mr. Chubais said glumly, reminded him of what was talked about 30 years ago in the late Soviet period. After the gap started closing for a decade, Russians\u2019 standards of living, he said, were again falling behind those of residents in developed economies. \u201cFor 10 years, Russia approached the standard of living of the advanced countries; for the past three years, we are falling behind,\u201d Mr. Chubais said. Of substituting state bank investment for foreign direct investment, he said, \u201cI am categorically opposed. This is suicide. Does anybody in Russia really believe we need more state control?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Go Big, Get Crazy", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUp to now, Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, has been playing a weak hand in Ukraine very well. I mean, how strong are you when your allies insist on wearing masks? But Putin thinks he knows his adversaries better than they know themselves. He thinks the Americans will never be serious about energy, that the Europeans will never be serious about sanctions, that the Ukrainian reformers will never be serious about governance, and that he can control the separatist forces he\u2019s unleashed in eastern Ukraine and dial them up or down as he pleases.The outcome of the Ukraine crisis rides primarily on whether he is right about all this. How\u2019s his bet going so far?There has been much talk about President Obama\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d of late. All I know is that, if Obama wants it, Ukraine provides him an ideal legacy leadership opportunity. With one initiative he could simultaneously make America stronger, Putin weaker, the planet healthier and our grandchildren safer.Since we\u2019ve ruled out sending troops, our short-term ability to influence Putin has to rely on targeted sanctions. But the serious way to weaken Putin, whose economy and government budget is hugely dependent on $100-plus-a-barrel-oil, is with an American domestic grand bargain on energy that unleashes forces that, over time, begin to impact the global price and availability of oil and gas.Obama should summon the congressional leadership to Camp David and put his own plan on the table: Offer the Republicans the Keystone XL pipeline, expanded oil drilling and fracking (but only at the highest environmental standards) and, in return, demand a revenue-neutral carbon tax, a national renewable portfolio standard that would require every utility in America to gradually introduce more renewable power, and a national California-level home building code for energy efficiency. I would also toss in incentives for expanding the share of nuclear power in our energy mix.I hate Keystone, which brings disgusting tar sands oil from Canada, and I worry about fracking at low environmental standards, but I\u2019d take this deal in a second because, soon enough, a proper carbon tax would make oil from tar sands uneconomical, and fracking that is paired with a renewable portfolio standard would ensure that natural gas replaces coal not solar, wind and other renewables.The White House just released a study that found the effects of human-induced climate change impacting every corner of our country, not to mention the world. So such a grand bargain could not be a more timely and necessary win-win-win strategy. It would simultaneously increase our leverage against Putin\u00a0and Mother Nature. And it would drive a suite of technologies down their cost-curves so we can deploy them at scale and ensure that America is the leader in the next great global industry: clean technology. Obama should throw caution to the wind and go big. If Republicans won\u2019t meet him even halfway on this (yes, I know, unlikely) it would expose them as unwilling to do the things that would meaningfully deter Putin, not to mention buy some insurance against climate change with policies that would make us stronger and healthier even if climate change turns out to be milder.Go big, Mr. President. Get crazy.But, as I said, Putin thinks he knows us better than we know ourselves, that we are all hat and no cattle. He is not without reason: for decades, both parties in America have failed to develop an energy strategy, and we\u2019ve paid for it \u2014 with oil price shocks, wars, pollution and climate change. Are we forever condemned to be takers, not makers, of energy policy?The Ukrainian reformers, too, have a huge role to play. They must find a way to conduct free and fair elections in as much of Ukraine as possible on May 25 and then quickly move to parliamentary elections and constitutional reform to put in place the basis for decent governance. The last thing Putin wants is a fairly elected reformist government in Kiev that would have the legitimacy to associate Ukraine with the European Union. Therefore, it\u2019s the first thing Ukrainians must do.But Putin needs to beware. The separatist allies he ginned up with his agents and Goebbels-scale propaganda campaign in eastern Ukraine could spin out of control. The Putin-inspired separatists could persuade western Ukraine that there is no future with the East, and Kiev might just let them all fall into Putin\u2019s lap \u2014 and economic responsibility.Putin may think he\u2019s Superman, but, the fact is, America, Europe and the Ukrainian reformers collectively have the ability to generate the Kryptonite that would render him powerless: European unity, Ukrainian government legitimacy and U.S. energy. Those are the things of which he is most afraid. What they all have in common, though, is that they\u2019re hard, entail serious choices and will require extraordinary leadership to achieve. So watch all these fronts. I can assure you that Putin is.Advertisement"}

Depends on What You Mean by \u2018Believe\u2019", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJobs ReportSo what about the April numbers? Was the 288,000 gain in payroll employment reported Friday morning dramatic enough that we should interpret it as a meaningful move? Or should a wise, levelheaded economic observer apply a grain of salt and move on with the day?To answer the question, it\u2019s best to pull back a little bit and look at a bigger set of data than just the one monthly payroll gain number that most excites markets. Forget 288,000 in April. What is the broader trend?After positive revisions to the February and March data, the average employment gain over the last three months is 238,000, which is the highest since the first three months of 2012 and beats the 194,000 average for all of 2013. That\u2019s good news!Under the Wolfers Weighting system, the health of the job market actually fell a bit in April, because the number of people reporting themselves as having a job in the household survey dropped by 73,000. But if you take a three-month average of the Wolfers Weighting number, you see a pretty healthy 220,000 monthly job creation rate, which is a step up from the average of 182,000 over the last three years.Combine some simple analytical tools like those with the general thrust of economic data lately \u2014 solid readings on incomes and spending, improvement in industry surveys, low levels of unemployment insurance claims, and so on \u2014 and the best guess is this:Yes, the job market is expanding nicely, and probably a little better than it was last year. But it\u2019s probably not growing at the kind of gangbusters rate suggested by the blockbuster 288,000 figure in the April jobs report.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jump in Payrolls Is Seen as a Sign of New Optimism", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a frustrating series of false starts since the economic recovery began five years ago, American businesses appear to be increasingly confident about hiring new workers. Despite the big jump in payrolls, wages did not grow at all in April, illustrating why so many Americans remain doubtful that they will benefit from what both the Federal Reserve and the White House see as evidence of a resurgent economy.\u201cThe payroll numbers suggest that the economy is recovering from a weather-induced slowdown,\u201d said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But, he said, \u201cwe still have not reached the point where workers have negotiating power.\u201dEven a sharp drop in the nation\u2019s unemployment rate, to 6.3 percent from March\u2019s 6.7 percent, provided little cause for celebration, since it was primarily because of a large decline in the number of people participating in the labor force rather than an increase in the number of Americans telling government survey workers that they had found a new job. As a result, even as President Obama sought to seize on the upswing in the job market as evidence that his policies are working, he continues to struggle to capitalize politically on the improving economy.Although the unemployment rate is at the lowest level of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, his job approval rating is also near a record low. Economists had anticipated a jump in hiring in April, as the bitterly cold winter faded into memory and consumer and business activity rose in tandem with temperatures, but the increase was much better than had been expected and cut across both white-collar and blue-collar sectors of the economy. Professional and business services was the single biggest gainer, adding 75,000 positions, while the number of construction jobs jumped by 32,000.In addition, government statisticians also revised upward the number of jobs added in February and March, suggesting the economy was stronger than first assumed.Month-to-month swings in hiring represent a snapshot of the economy, rather than a portrait, and frequently blur. But April\u2019s 288,000 increase, which was adjusted to take account of normal seasonal variations and is itself subject to further revision, was well above the average monthly gain of 194,000 in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s as good as I could have expected,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cIt was either a post-winter catch up, or the start of a stronger trend. There\u2019s no way to know yet, but I\u2019m happy either way.\u201dAt big companies like YRC Worldwide, a trucking firm based in Overland Park, Kan., April was something of a turning point. For the first time in several years, the company\u2019s chief executive, James L. Welch, said, YRC has hired full-time recruiters to find more drivers and is also advertising open positions and participating in career fairs again.So far this year, YRC has hired 600 people, mostly hourly workers like truckers, mechanics and dock workers, with the bulk of them coming aboard in April. If business remains brisk in May and June and the growth trajectory seems more certain, Mr. Welch said, YRC will add another 1,000 employees to its total work force of 32,000 by the end of the year. Positions like these are especially important if the recovery is to benefit all Americans, especially since a majority of workers lack a college degree. Hourly workers at YRC earn roughly $21 an hour, and benefits are fully covered by the company.But Mr. Welch is not prepared to open the doors wide just yet. \u201cI\u2019m very curious to see how freight levels are in May and June,\u201d Mr. Welch said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out if this is an overhang from the winter, or is it the economy getting better. I don\u2019t have the answer yet.\u201d The uncertainty faced by companies like YRC is echoed by the conflicting signals evident in Friday\u2019s report. While most observers agreed the surge in hiring that companies reported in April reflected more confidence among executives as profits soar and stock prices rise, Washington officials as well as professional economists were divided on the deeper significance of the contraction in the labor force. Unlike the payroll data, the figures on the labor force come from a separate survey of households that is used to determine the unemployment rate. In an interview, Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, suggested the big drop in the number of workers in the household survey was caused by fewer new entrants coming into the job market, rather than a sudden exodus out of it. One explanation, he said, could be that last month\u2019s survey was taken a week earlier than usual to accommodate Easter, reducing the number of seasonal workers and high school graduates who otherwise might have been counted as part of the work force. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge Rorschach test for everyone who is reading it,\u201d said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS. \u201cPeople expecting a spring rebound are zeroing in on the payroll advance, while pessimists are looking at the household survey and the decline in the participation rate.\u201d The pivot point in the debate, Mr. Berger added, is the course of inflation in the months ahead and how that might affect the Fed\u2019s decisions on when to begin raising short-term interest rates. A falling unemployment rate and big payroll gains might normally suggest that wage pressures could begin to rise, but the lack of salary increases for ordinary workers and the lackluster participation rate portend otherwise.Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, and her immediate predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, have both emphasized that other yardsticks besides the traditional unemployment rate are needed to gauge the economy after the financial crisis and the Great Recession. \u201cYellen can hang her hat on the participation rate to argue inflation is not a threat,\u201d Mr. Berger said.The feeble participation rate, which reflects the share of all working-age adults with a job or actively looking for one, suggests a sizable amount of slack remains in the labor force, helping keep wage gains modest because employers know they can appeal to a wide range of applicants when they have new jobs to offer. But many companies draw from a relatively specialized pool, which is good for those with appropriate skills but limits the possibilities for those who are out of work.Take the case of Synchronoss Technologies, a maker of software for cloud computing and mobile communication. The company, based in Bridgewater, N.J., is looking to hire roughly 150 workers in the next few months, many of them in positions like software development and engineering that start at $75,000 to $100,000. More senior positions pay $150,000 to $200,000.Most of those jobs require specialized skills and usually go to people with extensive experience who are nearly all currently employed or to college students and former interns. \u201cWe could get 50 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for a position and two to four of those people will be brought in for interviews,\u201d said Stephen Waldis, Synchronoss\u2019s founder and chief executive. \u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, that might yield one hire.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Incumbent\u2019s Party Loses Presidency in Panama", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Panamanians, enjoying one of the fastest-growing economies in the hemisphere but wary of corruption and growing executive power, rejected the governing party\u2019s choice for president on Sunday \u2014 on a ticket with the president\u2019s wife for vice president \u2014 and instead hewed to tradition by electing an opposition candidate.Panama\u2019s election commission declared the president-elect to be Juan Carlos Varela, who is vice president but broke with the governing party in a rancorous falling-out and was stripped of many of his duties. He captured 39 percent of the vote, with more than three-quarters of the ballots counted.Mr. Varela, who takes office on July 1 for a five-year term, campaigned against growing fears of corruption and the president\u2019s iron fist-style of leadership. He promised a more transparent government that would maintain growth and popular social programs and fight inequality.\u201cToday democracy won, today Panama won,\u201d Mr. Varela told supporters at a Panama City hotel, later adding, \u201cWe will not tolerate corruption in any way.\u201dMr. Varela\u2019s victory was a rebuke to President Ricardo Martinelli, who oversaw years of rapid growth and defied electoral law by campaigning openly for Mr. Arias on a ticket that included his wife, Marta Linares de Martinelli, as the vice-presidential candidate. Opponents seized on the move as a thinly veiled attempt to hold on to and concentrate power. It seemed Mr. Martinelli\u2019s Democratic Change party had much to give it a sharp advantage: A newly opened subway line in Panama City, the first in Central America, and plans for an expansion. A new, if controversial, highway bypassing the city\u2019s old quarter. A skyscraper forest in the capital reflecting the cash pouring in from corporations and wealthy immigrants. And a strong economy, with a $5.2 billion expansion of the Panama Canal that could accelerate it more.But while Mr. Martinelli had approval ratings around 60 percent, the final round of polls showed Mr. Arias in a close race, with Mr. Varela in third place.Voters formed long lines all day on Sunday, and there were few irregularities, said Jennifer L. McCoy, Americas director of the Carter Center, who observed the balloting. In one last-minute dirty trick she cited, fake editions of a major newspaper claimed that two candidates had withdrawn.It was typical of the mudslinging in what political analysts had once expected would be the closest of the four presidential contests there since the United States invasion in 1989 toppled Manuel Noriega\u2019s dictatorship. The Panama America newspaper reported that even Mr. Noriega had voted in the Panamanian prison where he is serving time for crimes during his reign.Mr. Martinelli, 62, a supermarket magnate who shook up the political establishment five years ago as an outsider with a commanding win, could not seek another term. The choice of Mr. Arias, 50, led opponents to doubt that Mr. Martinelli would give up power if his party won.Mr. Arias had sought to ride Mr. Martinelli\u2019s popularity with promises to continue big public works and social programs, but he lacked the president\u2019s flair for the dramatic and the blunt talk that endeared supporters and turned off opponents.His wife\u2019s presence on the ticket also had been questioned, as Panamanian law prohibits the sitting president\u2019s blood relatives from seeking the country\u2019s top two offices. It is unclear if the prohibition also applies to spouses.\u201cHer nomination,\u201d said Orlando J. P\u00e9rez, a political scientist at Central Michigan University who studies Panamanian politics, \u201cevidences a desire by Martinelli to remain powerful after the elections.\u201d .Mr. P\u00e9rez, who was in Panama City for the election, said her candidacy could backfire, as Panamanian voters tend to fret over concentrations of power. The opposition has run strongly despite improvements in the country, including social programs aimed at helping older people, the poor and schoolchildren, because \u201cthe historic tendency in Panama is to vote for the opposition,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery one of the previous four presidential elections since 1990 has been won by the opposition,\u201d Mr. P\u00e9rez said. Of Mr. Varela\u2019s victory, he said, \u201cthis represents \u2018Martinellismo\u2019 without Martinelli \u2014 support for government programs while punishing Martinelli.\u201dAnalysts said signs that the economy\u2019s surge is slowing \u2014 it grew 8.4 percent last year after consecutive years of double-digit expansion \u2014 could have worried voters, who also are paying more for goods as inflation rises. Panama has wide income inequality, with more than a quarter of its four million people living in poverty. Crime remains a serious problem. Infrastructure problems, including traffic congestion, chronic urban flooding and power shortages, could also have worked against Mr. Arias.Mr. Arias\u2019s opponents had thrown sharp elbows \u2014 mainly at Mr. Martinelli.Ruben Blades, the Panamanian salsa star and actor who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1994, posted a statement on his website declining to endorse any candidate but warning that electing Mr. Arias would constitute a re-election of Mr. Martinelli. He called that a \u201cdangerous risk for Panamanian democracy.\u201dMr. Arias, in turn, accused Mr. Varela of being close to drug traffickers, a provocative charge in a country where Mr. Noriega was deposed to face charges in the United States of drug trafficking and money laundering. On Saturday, Mr. Varela found himself denying rumors that his American visa had been suspended, with a statement by the American Embassy backing him up.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Offering Brighter Outlook, Japan\u2019s Central Bank Holds on Stimulus", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 The Bank of Japan kept policy steady and raised its assessment on capital expenditure on Wednesday, reassured by growing evidence that the economy can withstand the pain from a sales tax increase without additional monetary stimulus.Haruhiko Kuroda, the governor of the Bank of Japan, the country\u2019s central bank, reiterated his optimism that Japan was on course to meet the bank\u2019s 2 percent inflation target in about a year, dampening already diminishing market expectations of near-term monetary easing.\u201cOur quantitative-easing policy is exerting its intended effects,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said at a news conference after the unanimous decision. \u201cThe Bank of Japan will continue with this policy until the 2 percent target is achieved in a sustained manner.\u201dThe central bank removed a phrase describing Japan as being in deflation, underscoring its confidence about meeting its price target without additional stimulus.Such comments may further strengthen the yen, which held near a 3\u00bd-month high against the dollar as hopes of further action by the central bank faded, analysts say.But Mr. Kuroda was also expected to remind markets that the central bank was ready to act if risks threatened the achievement of the price target, given continued weakness in exports.Exports rose for the 14th straight month in April but shipments to the United States slowed, data showed earlier on Wednesday, underlining concerns that Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, remained vulnerable to any fall in external demand.\u201cThe B.O.J. has judged that gains in capital expenditure are sustainable because more companies are facing capacity constraints,\u201d said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo.\u201cThe last time demand for labor and capacity was this high was around 2008, and inflation went above 2 percent. This will give the B.O.J. confidence that it can reach its target, so expectations for more easing will have to be scaled back,\u201d he said.As widely expected, the central bank maintained its monetary policy framework put in place last April, under which it pledged to increase base money by 60 trillion to 70 trillion yen ($593 billion to $691 billion) a year via aggressive asset purchases.\u201cCapital expenditure has increased moderately as corporate profits have improved,\u201d the bank said in its statement after the policy decision. That was more upbeat than the view last month that corporate spending was showing clearer signs of a pickup.While few market players expected Mr. Kuroda to diverge from his generally optimistic stance on the economy at his post-meeting news conference, any hint the central bank may be ready to ease in the next few months could hit the yen, traders say.\u201cThe yen would be sold if he raises expectations for near-term easing,\u201d said Shinichiro Kadota, a strategist with Barclays in Tokyo.Japan\u2019s economy clocked its fastest pace of growth in more than two years in the first quarter as consumer spending jumped and business investment turned surprisingly strong before a sales tax increase last month to 8 percent, from 5 percent.Some economists and politicians have argued that the tax increase could dent the success achieved so far under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe through aggressive monetary easing and big fiscal spending.There has been growing evidence that any damage will be limited. A Reuters survey showed that companies expected sales to bounce back and were more willing to raise wages.Businesses also raised machinery orders in March by the most ever, underscoring the central bank\u2019s view that firms, many of which had profits rise because of a weak yen and robust domestic demand, would finally ramp up spending to replace old facilities.But exports, which hold the key to whether Japan can sustain its recovery, have failed to pick up to the disappointment of the Bank of Japan, which kept its view unchanged to say shipments have recently \u201cleveled off more or less.\u201dExports rose 5.1 percent in the year to April, exceeding a median market forecast and a 1.8 percent increase in March. But they rose a meager 0.6 percent in April from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.With export growth below last year\u2019s levels as the effect of a weak yen wears off, policy makers are becoming less confident of a lasting export upturn that would cushion a drop in domestic spending after the sales tax increase.Analysts say the central bank may act if the trade performance falls short \u2014 a side effect of many firms\u2019 moving production facilities offshore to escape years of the yen\u2019s strength.Private-sector economists also remain deeply skeptical about the Bank of Japan\u2019s rosy projection on prices, arguing that consumer inflation will not accelerate as quickly as the central bank expects in a country long mired in deflation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Square People, Part 1", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 I think I\u2019ll plan to go from Kiev to Hanoi more often. It\u2019s only when you go to two seemingly disconnected places that you see the big trends, and one of the big ones I\u2019ve noticed is the emergence of \u201cThe Square People.\u201dIn 2004, the Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington wrote about an emerging global \u201csuperclass\u201d of \u201cDavos Men\u201d \u2014 alluding to attendees of the Davos World Economic Forum \u2014 a transnational, cosmopolitan elite drawn from high-tech, finance, multinationals, academics and NGOs. The Davos Men had \u201clittle need for national loyalty\u201d and more in common with each other than their fellow citizens, Huntington argued. They also had the skills to disproportionately benefit from the new globalization of markets and information technologies.Well, a decade later, as the I.T. revolution and globalization have been democratized and diffused \u2014 as we\u2019ve gone from laptops for elites to smartphones for everyone, from networking for the lucky few at Davos to Facebook for all and from only the rich heard in the halls of power to everyone being able to talk back to their leaders on Twitter \u2014 a new global political force is aborning, bigger and more important than Davos Men. I call them The Square People.They are mostly young, aspiring to a higher standard of living and more liberty, seeking either reform or revolution (depending on their existing government), connected to one another either by massing in squares or through virtual squares or both, and united less by a common program and more by a shared direction they want their societies to go. We\u2019ve seen them now in the squares of Tunis, Cairo, Istanbul, New Delhi, Damascus, Tripoli, Beirut, Sana, Tehran, Moscow, Rio, Tel Aviv and Kiev, as well as in the virtual squares of Saudi Arabia, China and Vietnam.The latter three countries all have unusually large numbers of Facebook, Twitter or YouTube users, or their Chinese equivalents, which together constitute a virtual square where they connect, promote change and challenge authority. The most popular Vietnamese blogger, Nguyen Quang Lap, has more followers than any government newspaper here. In Saudi Arabia, one of the most popular Twitter hash tags is \u201c#If I met the King I would tell him.\u201dAnd The Square People are only getting more numerous and empowered. \u201cOur goal is that, in three years, every Vietnamese will own a smartphone,\u201d Nguyen Manh Hung, who leads the Viettel Group, a Vietnamese telecom, told me. \u201cWe are now manufacturing a smartphone for less than $40 and our goal is $35. We charge $2 a month for Internet connection for a P.C. and $2.50 for voice from a smartphone.\u201d Because the Vietnamese media is tightly censored, it is no accident that 22 million of Vietnam\u2019s 90 million people are on Facebook. Just two years ago there were only 8 million. Vietnam has about 100,000 students studying abroad; a decade ago it was a tenth of that. All future Square People.To be sure, The Square People represent a diverse politics, including the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and ultranationalists in Kiev. But the dominant trend running through them all is this: \u201cWe now have the tools to see how everyone is living, including opportunities abroad and corrupt leaders at home, and we will not tolerate indefinitely living in a context where we can\u2019t realize our full potential. And also we now have the tools to collaborate to do something about it.\u201dAs a Vietnamese foreign policy expert put it, the Square People one way or another \u201care demanding a new social contract\u201d with the old guards who\u2019ve dominated politics. \u201cThe people want their voice to be heard in every major debate,\u201d not to mention better schools, roads and rule of law. And they are quick to compare with others: \u201c \u2018Why do those Thai get to go demonstrate and we can\u2019t?\u2019 \u201dUkraine\u2019s Square People want to associate with the European Union \u2014 not only because they think that\u2019s the key to prosperity, but because they think European rules, judicial norms, standards and transparency requirements will force the changes they want at home but cannot generate from above or below. Vietnamese reformers want to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership for the same reasons. Unlike Davos Men, The Square People want to use the global economy to reform their countries, not rise above them.I gave a talk on globalization at the National University in Hanoi. Afterward I chatted with a young woman, Anh Nguyen, 19, a student who had asked several good questions. Her conversation was peppered with Square talk: \u201cI feel empowered. ... I think Vietnam can change. ... Please tell the world about the big embezzlement case [at a state-owned shipping company] that was uncovered here. Before people would have been silent, but the verdict came out and they sentenced the [bosses] to death. ... It really surprised people. ... Now not every big boss is protected by the government. ... We get many different sources of information from the world. It opens eyes.\u201d\u00a0She has a much greater chance to achieve her potential than her parents, she added, \u201cbut not as much as I want.\u201dMove over Davos Man, the Square People are coming.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Grocery Deliveries in Sharing Economy", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the Art\u201cI hope you realize that you are about to witness a remarkable display in ineptitude,\u201d the technology investor Michael J. Moritz said as he entered a Whole Foods store in San Francisco one recent afternoon.Mr. Moritz, the chairman of the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and a recipient of a British knighthood last year, was wearing a bright green T-shirt bearing a logo for Instacart, a two-year-old grocery delivery start-up that Sequoia has invested in. He was here to show me what it\u2019s like to work for the start-up \u2014 in particular, how unexpectedly difficult it is to quickly and accurately buy and deliver an assortment of groceries for a stranger.When you buy groceries from Instacart, the company summons a green-shirted \u201cpersonal shopper\u201d through the firm\u2019s smartphone app. The shopper receives your list, scurries through a grocery store to pick up your items and then heads across town in his own car to deliver your stuff.Still, Instacart\u2019s success suggests that rather than simply automate workers out of their jobs, technology might create new labor opportunities for people who haven\u2019t acquired formal credentials or skills in an economy where low- and medium-skilled workers face a bleak outlook. Like the ride-sharing service Uber, Instacart creates work by connecting affluent customers who have more money than time with part-time workers who have the opposite problem \u2014 lots of time, not enough money.\u201cWhen you ask what kind of niches we\u2019ll see for people who used to be in traditional middle-class jobs, this is the kind of labor that could fit into that,\u201d said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University whose book \u201cAverage Is Over\u201d contemplates how technology is altering labor markets. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to suggest people will become grocery-delivery millionaires,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you don\u2019t have a college education but you\u2019re smart and responsible, could you make a living doing this and maybe piecing it together with some of these other kinds of jobs? Absolutely.\u201dInstacart was founded in 2012 by Apoorva Mehta, now 27, an engineer who spent two years working at Amazon.com. \u201cI had this problem of never having groceries in my fridge and never having the motivation and energy to go to the store,\u201d Mr. Mehta said. But he found most grocery services, including AmazonFresh, too cumbersome. They required him to submit his order many hours in advance of delivery, and they sometimes didn\u2019t offer the merchandise he was used to getting at his local store.What\u2019s more, traditional grocery delivery services are costly to set up, requiring warehouses to store perishable food, a fleet of custom-painted trucks for delivery and a staff of full- or part-time workers to package and deliver the orders. \u201cWe were the clowns who invested in WebVan, and we are only just getting out of therapy from that,\u201d Mr. Moritz said, referring to the first boom\u2019s spectacular grocery flameout.Instacart does not maintain warehouses or trucks. Instead, the service is assembled out of found parts \u2014 existing supermarkets, willing part-time workers and their cars. The model has many advantages. It creates vast selection for customers by allowing them to shop at many different stores, from large chains to specialty shops like San Francisco\u2019s worker-owned, vegan-friendly Rainbow Co-Op. It allows for extremely quick delivery too, including an option that will deliver your groceries in under an hour.Though he declined to provide specifics, Mr. Mehta also said the firm had turned a profit in certain markets. Instacart now operates in ten cities, including New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Austin, Seattle and Los Angeles, and plans to be in 17 by the end of the year. It has 50 full-time employees and more than 1,000 independent shoppers under contract, many of whom fall into two demographic groups: college students and middle-aged mothers looking for flexible work.Despite its low-cost business model, Instacart isn\u2019t cheap. The service charges a delivery fee of $3.99 for most orders, and it also makes money by marking up store prices. The amounts vary depending on the item, but I noticed Instacart\u2019s prices coming in at about 20 percent more than I could find at my local store.The markup explains in part how Instacart can afford to pay shoppers such high wages. But as I discovered as I shopped with Mr. Moritz, there\u2019s another factor behind high pay: Shopping is a skill, and Instacart pays handsomely to get people who are very good at it.Though he could talk at length about the virtues of Instacart\u2019s business, Mr. Moritz is a billionaire investor, but he turned out to be a poor shopper. As we walked through Whole Foods, he often needed my help to locate a customer\u2019s items. I had to show him where to find grapes, bananas and Perrier; neither of us had any luck finding Babybel cheese.A few days later, I went on another delivery with Sharon Schedler, a 43-year-old mother who has been working for Instacart for about a year. She was a pro. Despite my peppering her with questions, she completed an 11-item order in under 10 minutes, including giving the customer a call to suggest substituting chicken breasts for chicken tenders, which were out of stock. Ms. Schedler was also meticulous about picking produce. \u201cI try to be pickier than I would be for myself,\u201d she said as she studied zucchinis for nicks.Lawrence F. Katz, an economist at Harvard who studies technology and labor, offered a few reasons to stifle excessive optimism about Instacart\u2019s model. First, technology may yet one day render Instacart\u2019s shoppers obsolete. Drones could pick our groceries, after all.Another possibility, he said, is that wages will be bid down as more people compete to become Instacart shoppers. Or, as the company\u2019s software becomes more sophisticated, it could squeeze more efficiency out of workers; they may end up doing more work and not earn any more money for it.A third problem is the lack of job security and benefits, which were once considered standard features of middle-class jobs. But Mr. Mehta says he doesn\u2019t see that shifting. \u201cThe advantage to this model is that you choose your own hours,\u201d he said. More corporate control over work habits \u201cis something that would drive a lot of people away. The independent contractor model \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to change.\u201dAn earlier version of this column provided an outdated number of cities in which Instacart, a grocery delivery start-up, operates. It now operates in 10 cities, not eight.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rising Sun", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree years ago this March, a 9-\u00admagnitude earthquake, the strongest ever known to hit Japan, created a tsunami that killed more than 15,000 people outright, displaced hundreds of thousands more and removed entire villages from the map. By triggering the failure of the Fukushima nuclear plant, it also left the landscape contaminated and led to Japan\u2019s curtailing of its nuclear-power system.I was living in Beijing when the quake hit, and I saw Chinese coverage shift from its normal churlish outlook on Japan to growing respect for the stoic discipline with which its people bore hardship. One photo ran on TV and front pages across China. It was an aerial shot of the Japanese, very young to very old, forming a long, snaking but always orderly line for disaster supplies. The amazed Chinese reaction was: Imagine a society in which people would patiently wait their turn for hours rather than rushing pell-mell to the front.David Pilling, who from 2002 through 2008 was The Financial Times\u2019s bureau chief in Tokyo, also learned of the earthquake in Beijing, his new post. He quickly returned to Japan to report on the disaster and its consequences. He conceived of this book, whose ambition, he says, is \u201cto create a portrait of a stubbornly resistant nation with a history of overcoming successive waves of adversity.\u201dThe ground-zero disaster reporting will command the attention of any reader. \u00adPilling vividly recreates the waves of \u00addifferent sorts of destruction. First the earthquake itself, which \u201cwent on for a time-stopping six minutes.\u201d Then the tsunami, which was not the single cresting \u201cGreat Wave\u201d famous from Hokusai prints but a rise in sea level of as much as 130 feet in some \u00adareas. Pilling describes a multistory gymnasium where towns\u00adpeople were waiting out the tsunami. Water filled the building, and more than 60 people were trapped and drowned. Pilling arrived in Tohoku in time to witness the next stage, in which survivors walked across a flattened landscape searching for any sign of the people, belongings, entire neighborhoods that had disappeared. For me, these scenes powerfully recall John Hersey\u2019s \u201cHiroshima\u201d \u2014 and although the causes were obviously different, in each case the longest-lasting source of damage came from radiation.At the end of the book, Pilling returns to Tohoku and, of course, finds people defying hardship and persevering. They include a photographer friend who \u00addaringly makes repeated trips into the \u201cexclusion zone\u201d around the failed nuclear plant, to document what has happened there.The analytical chapters between these opening and closing sections include some dutiful survey history of Japan\u2019s long record of warily attempting to embrace, and then fearfully or resentfully backing away from, a series of outside powers. The first was China; then the colonial-era, industrialized West that had brought the rest of Asia under its control; then through the past 60-plus years, Japan\u2019s conqueror and ally, the United States; and recently its neighbors in Asia. Most of the themes and illustrations here are familiar, from Japan\u2019s fetish for its uniqueness \u2014 \u201cBritish rain and Japanese rain are quite \u00addifferent,\u201d a professor in Tokyo tells Pilling \u2014 to the consequences of its post-World War II strategy of \u201cembracing defeat,\u201d which was the title of John W. Dower\u2019s celebrated 1999 book on that subject.Pilling\u2019s accounts of the 2000s, based on his own reporting there, are for me more enlightening. He spends much of his time on Junichiro Koizumi, a flamboyant and long-serving prime minister whom Pilling calls the \u201csamurai with a quiff,\u201d referring to his big floppy hairdo. These chapters, and an analysis of the \u201cAbenomics\u201d strategy of current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, explain several points very useful in gauging news from Japan.The first, and probably the most surprising for American readers, is that after its decades of \u201cfailure\u201d and stagnation, modern Japan is a rich, creature-comfortable, economic and technological powerhouse. China has recently passed it in total output, but with a 10-times-larger population. Japan\u2019s economy is the third-largest in the world, the size of Britain\u2019s and France\u2019s economies combined. Japan\u2019s car companies, Pilling reminds us, are \u201cnow considered the best in the world.\u201d In almost any advanced industry, from biotechnology to electronics to aerospace, crucial components come from Japanese firms. \u201cThey talk about Japan\u2019s decline,\u201d a Japanese friend tells Pilling. \u201cBut there\u2019s no potholes on the street, there\u2019s good quality cars, no violence, clean air. It\u2019s O.K.\u201dPilling also usefully follows the evolution of Japan\u2019s contradictory impulses to integrate itself with the rest of Asia, \u00adespecially China, and to hold itself apart. Nearly 70 years after Japanese troops were driven from China, ill will between the two countries is only rising. A long-term source of tension is the anti-\u00adJapanese agitprop the Chinese government promotes, presumably to deflect dissatisfaction away from itself. The immediate irritant, foreshadowed in this book, has been a series of assertively nationalistic moves by the Abe administration. Japan, China and the United States are all countries whose economies are more robust and modern than their political systems are. Japan\u2019s version of this problem, as famously described by Karel van Wolferen in \u201cThe Enigma of Japanese Power\u201d (1989), is the lack of any center of political accountability, or buck-stops-here person able to make decisions about Japan\u2019s course. Pilling explains how circumstances have changed since then but why the judgment is still largely true.When he is writing from his own observation, especially about the people and places transformed by the recent calamities, Pilling is eloquent and direct. When he is summing up political, economic and social questions, his instinct seems to be to hyper-hedge, as if the criticism he feared most was any claim of overstatement. \u201cIt would be foolish to suggest that rapid aging doesn\u2019t present big challenges.\u201d \u201cIt would be rash to claim that a single event, even one as traumatic as the March 2011 tsunami, could change society overnight.\u201d \u201cWe should be wary, though, of looking only at the surface.\u201dI agree on all points. Life is complex and contradictory, more so in Japan than other places. But the story Pilling is telling in this worthwhile book is clearer than such tics suggest. As he puts it, \u201cTwo \u2018lost decades\u2019 and its manifold problems notwithstanding, reports of Japan\u2019s demise are exaggerated.\u201dBENDING ADVERSITYJapan and the Art of SurvivalBy David PillingIllustrated. 382 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.James Fallows, a national correspondent for The Atlantic, is the author of four books about Asia, most recently \u201cChina Airborne.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Last, Recovery Heads Where the Fed Wants It", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve finally seems to be getting what it wants.Two indicators of economic health that the Fed and its chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have identified as keys to a stronger recovery \u2014 modestly higher inflation and a more robust job market \u2014 finally seem to be moving in the right direction, according to new data released by the government on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the C.P.I.,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cWe\u2019ve had loads more data showing the same thing, and it\u2019s good news because the fear at this time last year was excessively low inflation or even deflation.\u201d These nascent signs of a rebound in the United States stand in stark contrast to the economic landscape in Europe, where many countries are struggling to grow at all, and stagnation, deflation and high unemployment remain menaces. Although preventing higher inflation has long been the traditional concern for central bankers, and many remember it as a serious problem from the 1970s, the Fed has been more worried in recent years about the risk of stagnant prices, which reflect an economy struggling to recover from the financial crisis and recession. As recently as last month, in a speech in New York, Ms. Yellen warned that the danger of too little inflation still outweighed the risks posed by too much. But even as the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge remains contained, the new data from the Labor Department Thursday, including a 12-month rise in consumer prices of 2 percent, suggests inflation is moving within shouting distance of the Fed\u2019s target. A separate Labor Department report on Thursday put new claims for unemployment insurance last week at their lowest level since May 2007, the latest in a series of indicators suggesting a healthier labor market, including the upswing in payrolls reported by employers last month.The American economy is still emerging from a very slow patch. The first estimate for the growth rate of the economy last quarter showed that output expanded at a rate of just 0.1 percent, and that number may even drop into negative territory when the Commerce Department revises the figure later this month. Other data this week on industrial production and housing has also been underwhelming, and even some relative optimists like Mr. Shepherdson foresee more headwinds for the housing market as rates rise.Still, many private experts, as well as the policy makers at the Fed, argue that a substantial part of the weakness last quarter was caused by frigid temperatures and wintry conditions that delayed business activity in many part of the country, rather than a fundamental slowdown. Private economists forecast overall growth in the United States could rise at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent in the second quarter, the period of April, May and June. The advance on the price front was widespread. \u201cVirtually anywhere you look in this report, you see inflation is turning somewhat higher,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cPrices for services have risen at a solid pace for some time, but what\u2019s changed as of late is that goods prices have started to firm up after actually dropping.\u201dFor example, he pointed to increases in prices for new and used vehicles, airline tickets and prescription drugs, as well as for apartment and house rentals. \u201cIt\u2019s not where you\u2019d say there was an inflation problem, but the Fed is starting to get their wish for a move up in the inflation rate,\u201d Mr. Maki added.The less volatile core rate of the Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy prices, increased by 0.2 percent in April, compared with the 0.1 percent gain economists had expected.Energy and food prices also rose sharply, lifting the total increase for consumer prices to 0.3 percent. Meat prices rose by 2.9 percent, the biggest monthly jump in more than a decade.One reason that the Fed worries about persistently low inflation and the threat of deflation is that they discourage consumer spending and hold back investment. They are also difficult to overcome, as Japan\u2019s experience in recent years has shown. Mr. Maki noted that while the Fed still possessed tools to combat inflation, it had few options in reversing deflation, with short-term interest rates near zero.With inflation now showing signs of picking up, and a gradual improvement in the labor market bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.3 percent in April, the Fed is now on a glide path that could lead to the first increase in short-term rates, starting in the second half of 2015.\u201cIf inflation continues to rise as we expect it to, and the unemployment rate keeps falling, it could potentially change the timing of the first rate hike and move it up slightly,\u201d Mr. Maki said.Advertisement"}

The total investment amounts to about 82 billion Australian dollars.\u201cWe are laying a plan for the biggest increase in road expenditure in Australian history,\u201d Mr. Hockey told the Channel Nine Network. \u201cThat is tens of thousands of new jobs, but most importantly, it is going to address the significant drop-off in investment in construction in Australia associated with mining investment coming off.\u201d He called the economic blueprint his government will deliver on Tuesday a \u201ccontribute and build\u201d budget. Australia\u2019s $1.4 trillion economy sailed through the global financial crisis, but a slump in mining investment and a sluggish response to record-low interest rates have cut into government tax income as expenditures have grown.Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his government have been preparing voters for big spending cuts before the Tuesday budget to deal with deficits forecast at $44 billion this year and totaling $115 billion over the next four years.Mr. Abbott swept to power last September promising to bring the budget back under control and aiming to become known as \u201cthe infrastructure prime minister.\u201d Mr. Hockey declined to comment on wide speculation about an increase in the gasoline tax, but he said revenue from any such increase would be invested in road projects. \u201cIf we are going to make any changes to fuel excise it will go into roads,\u201d he said.In the lead-up to the budget the government has proposed a temporary income tax levy on those with higher incomes, a compulsory new fee for visiting a doctor and an increase in the retirement age to 70.The government has said that all sections of society must contribute to lowering costs and reducing the deficit. It has proposed that the salaries of politicians and senior public servants be frozen, Mr. Hockey said. \u201cI think we have got to send a clear message to the electorate that whatever we are asking the electorate to contribute to the budget repair task, we are going to contribute ourselves as well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I, Too, Will Stand Up for Tiananmen", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 On May 6 three of my friends were arrested in Beijing on suspicion of \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble.\u201d They are Xu Youyu, a scholar and former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Prof. Hao Jian of the Beijing Film Academy, and Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights attorney. Three days earlier my three friends and a dozen other people had gathered at Hao Jian\u2019s home to discuss the Tiananmen Square crackdown 25 years ago, when a huge number of students and other protesters took to the streets calling for democracy and an end to dictatorial rule and official corruption. The peaceful protests lasted nearly two months, but in the end the government sent troops and tanks, killing several hundred \u2014 possibly several thousand \u2014 unarmed citizens. Hao Jian\u2019s cousin was among the dead. I wanted to attend the gathering, but I had to travel to Australia, where I am a writer in residence at Sydney University. One of those present read out an essay I wrote about the Tiananmen crackdown. Hard as it may seem to believe \u2014 I have a law degree, and I myself can hardly believe it \u2014 reciting such an essay at a private gathering can violate China\u2019s laws. By the government\u2019s logic, I too have committed the crime of \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble.\u201dI am going to turn myself in.For me, the Tiananmen crackdown was the beginning of a gradual awakening. I was only 15 in 1989, a middle school student in a remote mountain hamlet in China\u2019s far northeastern province of Jilin. Everything I knew about the events of that year came entirely from China\u2019s state-run television station, CCTV: The demonstrators were counter-revolutionary rioters. The People\u2019s Liberation Army exercised great restraint and did not open fire, whereas some rioters burned soldiers alive. I believed it all. I was even grateful to the government and the army for rescuing the nation.Gradually, the events of 1989 receded from center stage. Everyone was busy earning university degrees or getting rich, as if nothing had ever happened. Even today, the Tiananmen crackdown remains one of the biggest taboos in modern China. Beijing has been attempting to expunge our collective memory through the worship of a soaring economy. But this most traumatic of memories has never truly faded. It continues to live among the people, despite Beijing\u2019s determined efforts to suppress its history.Soon after I entered university in 1992, a senior student came to our dormitory, sat down and demanded a cigarette. He then asked if we knew what had happened at the school in 1989. We said we didn\u2019t know. He took a deep drag, then told us solemnly that during the Tiananmen incident students from our school, the China University of Political Science and Law, were the first to take to the streets. They were, he said, the first to coordinate links with protesters from other universities. The first president of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation was from our school. Our university, he told us, had \u201c19 firsts.\u201dSince then, I came to understand what really happened in 1989 and its significance to China and the world. The government may have condemned the participants as \u201ccriminals,\u201d but we students considered it a glorious moment. We regard it as a great honor to have had even the slightest connection with the democracy movement. My university\u2019s \u201c19 firsts\u201d may not have been entirely accurate, but they became a legend, passed down from one student body to the next. In 1994, when I was the wise senior who visited the new students\u2019 dormitory, I too drew deeply on my cigarette and solemnly intoned: \u201cDuring the Tiananmen incident of 1989 this university had 19 firsts ... \u201dBy then, all traces of blood on Tiananmen Square had been scrubbed clean and the bullet holes cemented over, but in the nooks and crannies of the city the story passed from person to person. Around 2003, a friend bought a documentary about the crackdown in Hong Kong. In no time we all made copies. One day I watched it with some friends in a bar in the southern city of Guangzhou. One scene in particular struck me. A youth lay prone on a broad avenue amid the sound of intermittent gunfire. We thought he was dead, but then he suddenly began crawling in a circle. He did not dare stand up, but he didn\u2019t want to stay where he was, pretending to be dead. Crawling was better than doing nothing. \u201cIf I were there,\u201d said a migrant worker from Sichuan Province who was standing behind us, \u201cI\u2019d have carried him to safety.\u201d Whenever I\u2019m asked about China\u2019s future I recount this anecdote of the migrant worker from Sichuan. Now, in the age of the Internet, the government cannot possibly control all information. More and more people hold their own commemorations for the Tiananmen victims. Every year on the 4th of June virtual candles are lit. Photos are circulated online. Government censors put in a lot of overtime as they delete any combination of the numbers 6 and 4, as well as any reference to Tiananmen, the \u201cGate of Heavenly Peace.\u201d Despite censorship, hundreds of thousands of people persist. If they are unable to include \u201c6/4\u201d in a post they try \u201c5/35.\u201d If the censors block a post with the number \u201c1989,\u201d they change it to \u201cthe last year of the 1980s\u201d or \u201cthe year before 1990.\u201d Can\u2019t mention \u201ctanks\u201d? Then try \u201ctractors.\u201d Beijing has been in denial for 25 years, and now President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration appears more paranoid than its predecessors. The gathering in Hao Jian\u2019s home was merely a \u201cJune 4th commemoration.\u201d A similar gathering was held five years ago during President Hu Jintao\u2019s reign, but no one was arrested. On the surface the government appears to be stronger than ever, with over 80 million Communist Party members, millions of soldiers, and nearly $4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves \u2014 yet it is actually so fragile that its leaders lose sleep when a few scholars meet and talk in a private home.After my friends were arrested I announced on the Internet that I would turn myself over to the authorities as soon as I return from Australia in July because I too had participated in \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble.\u201d Most of my friends have warned me to lay low for a while, but I have thought it through: If the situation in China continues to deteriorate, I cannot stand idly by. If I too am arrested, perhaps more Chinese people will awaken to the realities of their situation. My arrest will be my contribution to resisting government efforts to erase the nation\u2019s memory. I have seen China change. I have seen the Internet awaken its people. In 1989 one person was brave enough to stand before a column of tanks rolling through Beijing. If the same thing happens again, I am certain hundreds of ordinary citizens will defy the tanks, and if they come under fire, there will be thousands of other citizens with the courage to face the guns and say, \u201cI will carry them to safety.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Junta Targets Scholars for New Detentions as Thai Forces Are Sent to Protests ", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Thailand\u2019s military junta on Saturday ordered two dozen professors and writers to turn themselves over to the military authorities, broadening a sweep in which nearly 200 political officials have already been detained, and sent more troops into the streets of Bangkok and other cities to discourage protests.The Pentagon, responding to Thursday\u2019s military coup, announced Saturday that it was halting a military exercise with Thai armed forces that was already underway and canceling the visit here of a top American admiral. The Obama administration, which suspended military aid to Thailand last week, called off other projects for police and military cooperation.The junta continued to consolidate power, \u201cterminating\u201d the upper house of Parliament and purging the bureaucracy of senior officials who were seen as allies of the deposed government.The military said Saturday that the detained politicians, including former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and other leaders of the former governing party, were being held to give them \u201ctime to think.\u201d A spokesman for the junta declined to say when they would be freed. The two dozen scholars and writers who were summoned Saturday also appeared to be supporters of the former government; most were advocates of elections, which a protest movement led by the Bangkok establishment had blocked.The commander of Thailand\u2019s army overthrew the country\u2019s elected government on Thursday, a move applauded by members of the Bangkok establishment but one that risks a violent backlash from voters in northern Thailand who supported the overthrown government.The junta said Saturday that it had discovered a cache of weapons in the northeastern city of Khon Kaen and had arrested members of a group it said was planning acts of sabotage.The military also faced a spike of violence in Thailand\u2019s troubled deep south, where an insurgency has raged for a decade. At least two people were reported killed in more than a dozen explosions at convenience stores and gas stations in the city of Pattani on Saturday night, according to Thai news media reports.In Bangkok, several hundred protesters who confronted troops in Bangkok on Saturday held up a large banner that read, \u201cWe want an election.\u201dThe army chief, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, outlined the junta\u2019s plans in a meeting with foreign diplomats on Friday, saying that elections would be held only when there was a \u201cconducive\u201d environment, according to an account by a meeting participant.According to the same participant, General Prayuth said he would appoint reform councils that would draft a new constitution and study unspecified \u201csocial\u201d changes. The military on Thursday voided the Constitution, which it had helped write after a previous coup in 2006.In Washington, officials said about 700 sailors and Marines were participating in the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training exercise when it was cut short. The annual exercise, which started on Tuesday, was scheduled to run through May 28 as the first of nine bilateral exercises the Navy conducts with maritime forces in Southeast Asia. The Pentagon also announced that it was canceling a visit to Thailand by Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the commander of the Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet. In addition, the Defense Department rescinded an invitation for a senior Thai commander to visit the military\u2019s Pacific Command in Hawaii next month. \u201cAs we have made clear, it is important that the Royal Thai armed forces end this coup and restore to the people of Thailand both the principles and the process of democratic rule, including a clear path forward to elections,\u201d Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. In addition, the State Department announced Saturday that it was canceling a firearms training program for the Royal Thai police that was to start here on Monday, as well as a trip next month by senior Royal Thai police officials to the United States to visit F.B.I. facilities and meet with American law enforcement officials. The steps taken Saturday are the Obama administration\u2019s latest rebukes to the Thai coup leaders. On Friday, the State Department said it had suspended $3.5 million in financing for military sales and military training, and was reviewing the rest of the $10.5 million in assistance it was providing Thailand. \u201cWe again call on the military to release those detained for political reasons, end restrictions on the media, and move to restore civilian rule and democracy through elections,\u201d Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement.The department also issued a warning to American citizens to \u201creconsider any nonessential travel to Thailand.\u201dThe coup has been cheered in social media messages by some Thais who see it as a way to purge the influence of the governing party and its de facto leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, who lives in exile and was himself ousted in the 2006 coup when he was prime minister.Members of the Bangkok establishment who helped lead protests that led to Thursday\u2019s coup are in favor of a suspension of democracy.Thailand\u2019s king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, who is 86 years old and ailing, has been silent on the country\u2019s crisis.He has not been seen in public since the coup. A television announcement by the junta on Saturday featured a letter from the king\u2019s principal private secretary, Krit Kanchanakunchorn, saying only that the king had been \u201cinformed.\u201d The British news media have reported that Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn is in Britain.As Thais adjusted to life under military rule, questions grew about the army\u2019s ability to handle the complexities of governing a modern economy, especially if there were a protracted period without a Parliament and an elected government. After the 2006 coup a military-appointed government was largely seen as a failure.\u201cIt boggles the mind that they think they can run so many government departments,\u201d said Nattakorn Devakula, a television host whose station was ordered off the air by the military. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the expertise.\u201dThe junta, which blocked all television stations after the coup, allowed most channels back on the air on Friday.For a country with a traditionally freewheeling news media, sweeping guidelines banning unfavorable coverage of the coup were surprising.A prominent Thai reporter for the newspaper The Nation, Pravit Rojanaphruk, was summoned to an army base by the junta on Saturday, and the Thai news media reported that editors from the country\u2019s largest newspapers were also asked to attend a meeting with the military rulers.Mr. Nattakorn, the television presenter, predicted a backlash.\u201cI don\u2019t think the media will be as subservient as they think,\u201d he said.The junta has also struggled to respond to criticism on the Internet.In talks with diplomats on Friday, General Prayuth said the army could block social media but had shown leniency.On Saturday, the junta said on Twitter that it had ordered the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology to \u201csearch websites with agitating content aimed at causing confusion.\u201dThe army was ready to \u201ctake action immediately,\u201d message said.Thomas Fuller reported from Bangkok, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Deal\u2019s Done. But Not the Fees.", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere was joy on Park Avenue as the news arrived from Warsaw, a small Indiana city.Back in New York, in the Midtown headquarters of the Blackstone Group, the tie-up meant a handsome payday for Blackstone and a handful of other private equity specialists. Together, they had bought one of the Warsaw companies, Biomet, in 2007. Now they had agreed to sell it for $13.4 billion, or $2 billion more than they paid.But for Blackstone and the other private-equity partnerships in the deal \u2014 overseen by Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital \u2014 this deal will be a gift that keeps giving. That\u2019s because, beyond the profits they share with their clients, they will be paid millions more in fees \u2014 for work that they are never going to do. In addition to a 20 percent share of gains from the sale, as well as management fees of 1.5 percent to 2 percent charged to investors, the private equity firms will also share in an estimated $30 million in \u201cmonitoring fees.\u201d These fees were to be charged through 2017, but given that the deal is expected to close early next year, Blackstone, Goldman Sachs, K.K.R. and TPG will be paid for two years of services that Biomet isn\u2019t receiving. Private equity is huge. It is now a $3.5 trillion corner of the $64 trillion asset management industry. There are 2,700 of these firms nationwide that use borrowed money to acquire companies that they hope to sell later at a profit. Once called leveraged-buyout firms, private equity firms have changed American business in the 21st century. By buying companies, getting them into shape and selling them \u2014 or taking them public \u2014 they have brought a focus on efficiency to many companies and generated sizable gains for their investors.That wealth comes largely from the firms\u2019 often-extraordinary profits; Blackstone\u2019s revenue rose 65 percent last year, and Apollo reported a profit increase of 19 percent over 2012. But it also comes from fees \u2014 those big fat management fees, and the less obvious pile-on of smaller fees that investors might notice only if they scoured regulatory filings. Private equity firms say they are completely transparent in their fee disclosures. But that is not the view of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is taking an increasing interest in private equity \u2014 and especially in their fees. The S.E.C., as is its custom, declined to identify any firms that it was investigating, and there is no indication that the Biomet deal is among the transactions of interest to the S.E.C.Until the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, private equity firms were relatively free of regulation. The law required that firms with at least $150 million in assets under management register as investment advisers; it also instructed the S.E.C. to take a close look at them. So, over the last year and a half, S.E.C. officials have visited approximately 150 firms and say they have found serious deficiencies in both practice and disclosure at many of them.Private equity firms also raise money from \u201caccredited\u201d individual investors \u2014 those the S.E.C. considers wealthy enough \u2014 and the firms argue that their investors are savvy enough to understand and agree to the fees they are paying. The Biomet monitoring fees, for example, were stated in a contract, said a representative for all four private equity firms. \u201cThe monitoring-fee agreements were put in place when Biomet was acquired by its current owners,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cOnce the sale to Zimmer goes through, the annual payment of monitoring fees ends, and the monitoring fee agreement provides that a lump-sum present value of future monitoring fees is payable in the form of a termination payment.\u201d Translation: The contract says Biomet must pay up. And, ultimately, that means less return for the investors.Money from individuals would also feed growth for private equity \u2014 with few regulatory safeguards for those investors. Even the institutions that now invest in private equity might be unaware that they are paying steep fees, Mr. Bowden said. \u201cOn money moving from the portfolio company to the adviser,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is not a level of transparency sufficient to allow investors to protect themselves, no matter how smart they are.\u201dReimbursed, in PartWhen Mr. Bowden and his group started visiting private equity firms in October 2012, they didn\u2019t know what to expect. The firms had never been examined. But as teams of two to 10 examiners embedded themselves in firms across the country and started interviewing portfolio managers and compliance personnel, and reviewing records and emails, they quickly identified some problematic practices.Even before the S.E.C. became involved, private equity investors had become frustrated with the high fees in these deals. The standard structure requires investors to pay the management fee on the assets they park in private equity firms and 20 percent of the gains those funds generate. But private equity firms also charge fees for services like providing merger-and-acquisition advice to the portfolio companies they oversee. Many investors, arguing that they shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything beyond the standard fee structure, began demanding that fund advisers give back a portion of those ancillary fees.In response, fund advisers agreed to fee-sharing arrangements, in which they would reimburse investors for some ancillary fees. These reimbursements effectively offset the 1.5 percent to 2 percent management fees. In the Biomet deal, for example, the private equity firms are sharing some monitoring fees with their investors, though they declined to say how much.There are two problems with these reimbursements. Because they can offset only the amount an investor pays in management fees, ancillary fees in excess of those payments are not shared; they are kept solely by the private equity firm. And some fund advisers have found ways to limit the amount of fees they must give back. One example involves senior advisers hired by private equity firms to help oversee acquired companies. These advisers tend to be corporate executives with experience in a particular industry who work with the acquired companies; a former hotel executive might work with a portfolio of companies in the hospitality business, for instance, to help them run more efficiently.Traditionally, these executives have been employed directly by the private equity firms, meaning that the firms, not their investors or the portfolio companies, have paid the executives\u2019 salaries, which can be substantial. In other cases, they are paid by portfolio companies, which means that the salaries may be considered a fee to be partially reimbursed to the investors. Recently, however, some private equity firms have found a way around this. Salaries of executives hired as unaffiliated contractors are not subject to reimbursements, private equity filings show, and by making these people contractors, rather than employees, firms can avoid reimbursing the investors for their costs. The private equity firms also increase profits by shifting the salary of the contractor to the payroll of portfolio companies.A spokeswoman for Silver Lake declined to comment.Earlier this year, Brazos announced that it would not raise new money from investors and that it was winding down its current portfolio. A spokeswoman for Brazos did not respond to a request for comment.Monitoring fees, like those in the Biomet deal, are a source of particular concern at the S.E.C. because of their ubiquity. Portfolio companies generally agree to monitoring for 10-year increments. But when a company is sold, typically after about five years, the monitoring fees for the remaining years of the contract must still be paid. A TPG spokesman declined to comment. There is no evidence that any of these firms are under the regulatory microscope.S.E.C. officials did describe general practices they find especially troubling, including contracts that renew annually for 10 years. This means that no matter when the contract is terminated by a sale or public offering, there will still be a decade of monitoring fees that must be paid to the private equity firm. Regulators call these evergreen fees. Ultimately, investors are the ones who lose out when companies pay these fees. Each dollar that a portfolio company pays in fees is one less dollar that it can invest in its operations, thereby shrinking its net worth and ultimate resale value. \u201cWe take seriously recent reports regarding the S.E.C.\u2019s investigations,\u201d Mr. Solomon said. \u201cAccordingly, we have directed our consultants and treasury staff to continue to verify that the private equity firms with whom we invest have assessed only those fees allowed by the terms and conditions of their contracts.\u201d \u2018Temptations and Conflicts\u2019It is unclear whether the S.E.C. will refer any cases arising from its 18-month review to its enforcement division. But agency officials like Mr. Bowden suggest that, failing public disclosures and oversight, improper or excessive practices will continue. \u201cA private equity adviser is faced with temptations and conflicts with which most other advisers do not contend,\u201d Mr. Bowden said in the recent New York speech. \u201cWe have seen that these temptations and conflicts are real and significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Fraud Case Offers a Cautionary Tale of Finance", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShortcutsTWO decades. Twenty-six million dollars. Almost 2,000 victims. Seven guilty defendants.Now a final chapter is being written as the second of the two top executives of the Remington Financial Group \u2014 and the only one actually to go to trial \u2014 faces sentencing this month. The firm\u2019s founder, who pleaded guilty along with five others, was sentenced in March to 18 years in prison.The case, hardly prominent by today\u2019s standards, nonetheless resonates at a time when job security has given way to a wave of sometimes desperate entrepreneurship.While the Remington case is extreme in its duration and magnitude, many experts say the shaky economy, job insecurity, tighter loan requirements from banks since the recession and the need to supplement low incomes or pensions create the perfect market for what is known as advance fee fraud.\u201cAs more and more people are trying to make a living, as it gets harder to get loans from banks, they have to turn to brokers,\u201d said Pamela Gilbert, a lawyer and longtime consumer advocate. \u201cThey\u2019re encouraged by everyone, including President Obama, to \u2018go out and create opportunities for yourself \u2014 be entrepreneurial.\u2019 \u201dPeople looking for investors for their businesses \u2014 clothing lines, hotel development, movies \u2014 thought the Remington Financial Group (later renamed Remington Capital) was the answer.Remington led its victims \u2014 scattered around the country and the world \u2014 to believe it would either invest in their businesses or find investors for them. The would-be entrepreneurs just needed to provide upfront fees of $10,000 to $40,000, and Remington would do the rest.But the company took the money and did nothing. Its angry clients, many of whom began to suspect they were being cheated, were told it was their fault the projects never materialized.In the end, the United States attorney\u2019s office in Philadelphia, where part of the company was located, prosecuted seven people associated with Remington. Although the case involved fraud between 2005 and 2011, the swindles most likely had gone on long before that, starting as early as 1994, said David L. Axelrod, the assistant United States attorney who prosecuted the case.Matthew McManus, a co-owner of Remington along with the founder, Andrew Bogdanoff, is expected to receive similar prison time when he is sentenced on May 21. Five others await sentencing; an eighth defendant has not yet made a plea.Victims lived all over: India, Italy, Australia. There was the South Dakota rancher trying to save his family farm. The former acting mayor of San Diego who wanted to build a housing development.Some were na\u00efve; some, like Richard Jank, considered themselves fairly streetwise.Mr. Jank, who had developed other major properties, wanted investors for a multiuse development project in Costa Rica. He needed about $125 million. In 2005, contacts he knew put him in touch with Remington.After some discussions, Remington asked him for $15,000 to do due diligence \u2014 that is, check out the project \u2014 but assured him verbally and in writing that it looked like a surefire hit. \u201cThe documents they asked for were legitimate,\u201d Mr. Jank said, adding that a request for an upfront fee is not that unusual in these kinds of transactions.But things started looking suspicious, even while he was under time pressure to move ahead with the project. While initially Remington told him it would finance the project, he said, he was later told it was looking for investors. \u201cIt came to a point where it was obvious to me that the project was not going to be funded, and I made a request to get my money back,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first they said, \u2018No problem.\u2019 Then suddenly my file is transferred to someone else.\u201dMr. Jank not only never received his deposit but also lost about $1 million in predevelopment costs connected to acquisition of the land, he said. He looked for other lenders, but the recession hit. And he was forced to declare bankruptcy on one of his businesses.\u201cI still haven\u2019t recovered financially,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in the development business, but I will never, ever give an upfront fee. My trust in humanity is gone.\u201dThese cases are extremely hard to prosecute. Companies like Remington skillfully word contracts to make it difficult for victims to sue or for authorities to show fraud. Even if someone wants to sue, the money for court costs and lawyers often outstrips the loss.It\u2019s understandable why many trusted a company like Remington. It did some legitimate business and had received good publicity in the Philadelphia papers over the years.\u201cTheir website was first-class,\u201d said Ingrid Robinson, another victim of the fraud and the prime mover behind pulling the victims together and bringing the case to the attention of officials. \u201cThey had an A-plus rating at the Better Business Bureau. But it was all smoke and mirrors.\u201dIn fact, in 2003, the California Department of Corporations became aware of the fraud and ordered Remington to stop doing business, but it had little effect. The state then asked Pennsylvania for help, but \u201cit wasn\u2019t clear it was under our jurisdiction,\u201d said Daniel D. Kristie, a retired F.B.I. agent and retired lawyer at the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, now the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.The scheme became increasingly sophisticated. In 2010, Remington advertised an antifraud policy on its website and stated \u2014 falsely \u2014 that it had recently provided information to the F.B.I. and local law enforcement authorities about a suspected email fraud. When potential customers searched online for allegations about Remington\u2019s fraud, they were sent directly back to Remington\u2019s site.One way to attack the issue is to make commercial brokers, who for a fee act as the liaison between those seeking investments and would-be investors, be held more accountable. Such brokers introduced many of the victims to Remington. Ms. Robinson is advocating federal legislation that could require a broker to make good on any losses if a client is referred to an investor without adequate research on the company first.Individuals can take precautions. Be wary if anyone is asking for money in advance, said Lois C. Greisman, the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s associate director for the division of marketing practices.Her agency does not address issues like the Remington case but does oversee some advance fee fraud, such as when people are asked to give money upfront to lower their debts or increase their credit lines, she said.Ed Struiksma, the former acting mayor of San Diego, who lost $25,000, suggested meeting potential investors in person, \u201cnot at a coffee shop but at their offices.\u201d\u201cThat way, if you want to go bang on someone\u2019s door, you have a place to go,\u201d he said.Most important, everyone said, was to ask for references of satisfied clients \u2014 clients who have comparable businesses \u2014 and call them. If the company refuses to provide that information, run away.Too often in these kinds of cases, people feel foolish and do not want to come forward.But Ms. Gilbert, who was executive director of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under President Bill Clinton, said that just because they were victims, that does not mean they were gullible.\u201cAny kind of consumer scam sounds that way in hindsight,\u201d she said. \u201cBernie Madoff was a perfect example of that.\u201dEmail: shortcuts@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

Mr. Hollande used the occasion to call the results a signal from the public that Europe needed to change.\u201cWhen there is such a vote in France, a founding member of the European Union \u2014 when one in four vote for the National Front, yes, there is a problem,\u201d Mr. Hollande told reporters in Brussels. \u201cThis is not just a problem for France, but a problem for Europe.\u201dMr. Hollande may now find himself having to change tack on the economy and public finances. He had promised European leaders that he would press forward with policies that would reduce France\u2019s budget deficit and public debt back to euro-zone norms within two years, but economic stagnation and high unemployment in the country have angered voters.Now, the left wing of the Socialist Party, which was already bridling at Mr. Hollande\u2019s plans, will gain new ammunition from the party\u2019s drubbing in two consecutive elections \u2014 the loss of 155 mayorships in March and now the defeat in the European balloting.Mr. Hollande\u2019s prime minister, Manuel Valls, sought to shore up support within Socialist ranks at a meeting Tuesday morning, urging party members \u201cnot to give up\u201d despite exit poll results showing that many voters turned to the far right specifically to protest Mr. Hollande\u2019s performance and policies.Mr. Valls\u2019s remarks were met with \u201cdead silence,\u201d Guy Delacourt, a Socialist representative from northern France, told French news outlets. \u201cThere is a real problem between Hollande and the French,\u201d Mr. Delacourt was quoted as saying. \u201cWe\u2019re doing him a service by telling him.\u201dIn past elections, voters who were unhappy with the Socialists generally turned to the center-right Union for a Popular Movement, or vice versa. But that party has been plagued by scandals lately, and was dealt a new blow on Tuesday when its leader, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, resigned amid a new embezzlement scandal.The mainstream parties \u201care all in a disaster because they have not done their job,\u201d said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, an economics professor at the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques de Paris. \u201cThey have not found a solution to the problem of France, which is to recover, to have employment and growth.\u201dIn France, 37 percent of voters surveyed by Harris Interactive cited immigration, the rallying point for the far right across the Continent, as their central concern. But many also cited declining purchasing power, the crisis in the euro zone or rising unemployment.Mr. Valls took to the airwaves on Tuesday with new pledges for tax cuts, saying that current levels were \u201cnot manageable for the working and middle class,\u201d the main sources of backing for the National Front. And Mr. Hollande said in Brussels on Tuesday that the European Union must do more to fight unemployment and economic insecurity. \u201cIf Europe does not change, there will be more votes like this,\u201d he said.But Mr. Fitoussi said that the public was clearly losing patience: \u201cThey are saying, \u2018Why am I suffering?

{"Headline": "Alarm Over Istanbul\u2019s Building Boom", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetNamed for the year this bicontinental city passed from Christian to Muslim hands, Maslak 1453 has been planned as a vast complex of 24 towers, shopping malls galore and, not least, a 1,453-meter-long (4,767-foot) shopping promenade that celebrates the most consequential date in Turkish history.Upon completion in 2015, it will be the largest real estate development in all of Europe and perhaps the ultimate expression of the pell-mell construction boom that has underpinned Turkey\u2019s decade of rapid growth under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the nation\u2019s Islamist prime minister.But as Turkish interest rates spike and the economy slows, local bankers and real estate experts are becoming increasingly worried that Istanbul\u2019s real estate market may be heading for a fall.And they are reminded of similarities between the situation here and what happened in Spain and Ireland, where alliances among banks, developers and politicians contributed to the creation of real estate bubbles that popped once interest rates began to rise, puncturing the overall economies as well.\u201cThe official numbers are showing signs of risk,\u201d said Hakan Eren, a real estate investment adviser. \u201cThe result could be a bust if this is not well managed.\u201dBut in the first three months of the year, unit sales for new apartments were down about 60 percent compared to the same period last year, according to Emlak Konut, the country\u2019s largest real estate investment company.Moreover, Mr. Eren said, the inventory of unsold housing units has risen to 1.5 million, compared to levels close to zero several years ago, a clear sign that the slowing economy and higher interest rates are cutting into demand.Traditionally a bureaucratic backwater with a mandate to push for more affordable homes, Toki emerged as a housing power center when its bylaws were changed in January 2004 to bring it under the direct control of Mr. Erdogan less than a year after he was elected. Under his sponsorship, Toki amassed choice properties at little or no cost, auctioned them off to developers and took a cut of the profits.\u201cThe rise of Erdogan and the construction industry in Turkey have been one and the same,\u201d Mr. Sonmez said.In light of Istanbul\u2019s extraordinary growth spurt over the last decade, of course, a metamorphosis of the city\u2019s skyline was to be expected, and many of Istanbul\u2019s new development projects have been financially successful. But some of the more recent, highly ambitious real estate schemes are proving more problematic.During a visit late last month, a sales agent was quick to catalog the Mall of Istanbul\u2019s attractions: easy parking, proximity to the airport and, of course, the on-site amusement park.But will wealthy foreigners or aspiring Turkish professionals snap up pricey apartments or flock to yet another opulent shopping mall? Especially one located in an industrial park at the intersection of two major highways more than 10 miles outside central Istanbul?Mr. Sonmez, the author and real estate expert, remains unconvinced.\u201cAll this is problematic,\u201d he said, citing the project\u2019s location. \u201cThe Mall of Istanbul could be the Titanic of shopping malls in Turkey.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the potential for a bubble in Turkish real estate referred incorrectly to Turkey\u2019s housing inventory.

{"Headline": "U.S. Exports Climb 2.1%, and Trade Deficit Narrows", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States trade deficit narrowed in March as exports rebounded to the second-highest level on record, led by strong gains in sales of aircraft, autos and farm goods.American exports rose 2.1 percent to $193.9 billion, with exports to Canada and South Korea hitting highs. Imports also rose, but by a slower 1.1 percent, to $234.3 billion, reflecting increased shipments of cellphones, clothing and other consumer goods, and increased demand for heavy machinery and other capital goods.A smaller trade deficit can bolster growth because it means American companies are earning more on their overseas sales.In 2013, the trade deficit narrowed 11.2 percent to $474.9 billion, which helped to give a small lift to overall economic growth.Analysts are looking for a similar small contribution to growth from a narrowing trade deficit this year. They forecast that an improving global economy will improve demand for United States exports. However, imports are also expected to rise as stronger American activity increases consumer spending on foreign products.For the first three months of this year, trade was a big negative on overall growth, subtracting 0.8 percentage point in the first quarter as exports fell sharply from the final three months of last year.That translated into weak overall growth in the gross domestic product of just 0.1 percent in the January-March quarter. Economists expect gross domestic product growth will rebound in the second quarter to a much stronger rate of 3 percent or better as exports recover from their first-quarter decline and other parts of the economy will gain momentum as warmer weather spurs activity after the harsh winter.While the trade deficit narrowed in March, economists said the improvement would not be enough to keep the government from revising its first-quarter growth estimate down into negative territory.But Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said the important development was that the economy was showing many signs of a rebound in the current quarter.\u201cThe monthly data clearly show a big resurgence in activity and employment over the past couple of months, confirming that the earlier weakness was weather-related,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Global Search for Energy", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether by diplomacy, investment or in extreme cases, force, China is going to great lengths to satisfy its growing hunger for energy to fuel its expanding car fleet and electrify its swelling cities. The Chinese government showed that desire on Wednesday when it reached a 30-year natural gas deal with Russia, even as China was locked in a tense standoff with Vietnam over a Chinese oil rig drilling in the contested South China Sea.The two events involve different political dynamics. The agreement with Russia reflects closer economic ties between the two nations, while the other underscores the growing tension of two on-again, off-again Cold War allies.But both developments demonstrate China\u2019s expansive approach to energy, a political and economic strategy with significant implications for the rest of the world. As its economy has rapidly expanded over the last decade, China\u2019s energy efforts have come to dominate the global markets. Its mushrooming consumption helped prompt the spike in global oil prices in the mid-2000s. China\u2019s demand has also provided life support to coal producers suffering from declining use in the United States and other industrialized countries. Among the fastest-growing importers of natural gas, China has had to cement its ties to Russia to diversify its supplies, as well as to invest in exploration in the United States and liquefied natural gas terminals in Australia. China now has operations, investments or projects across the globe in Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America.\u201cThe dynamic growth of China\u2019s economy and energy growth is reshaping global energy markets, and both the economic and strategic implications are still being developed,\u201d said Mark J. Finley, BP\u2019s general manager for global energy markets and United States economics. The shift has been swift. China used only half as much energy as the United States in 2000. Nine years later, it surpassed the United States as the world\u2019s biggest energy user and last year it leapfrogged the United States as the No. 1 oil importer. China now burns as much coal as the rest of the world combined. The country\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases, linked by scientists to global warming, surged past the United States\u2019 emissions a decade ago and have risen ever higher since then.China has little choice but to look beyond its borders for its energy needs. While it consumed 10.1 million barrels of oil a day last year \u2014 one-ninth of the world\u2019s total \u2014 the country produced only 4.2 million barrels a day, according to a recent OPEC report. China has had mixed results drilling offshore, and it has been slow to develop what many energy experts believe to be vast shale gas resources on land, though Chinese energy executives express optimism.\u201cThe China market feels that the revolution in shale gas will be coming very soon,\u201d Zhang Mi, chairman and president of Honghua Group, an exporter of drilling rigs, said in an interview while at a Houston energy technology conference this month. He added that 100 shale gas land rigs would be put in operation by the end of the year.Most energy experts think it will take another five to 10 years, though, before substantial amounts of gas can be produced \u2014 and even then the quantities may be small compared to China\u2019s enormous needs. The two main shale gas areas are in the west, far from major energy users in the east, and pipelines are few.More important, shale gas in China mainly lies significantly deeper underground than in the United States and is in poorly understood, geologically complex formations. The domestic oil industry is already struggling with safety and environmental concerns, and faces a challenge in drilling extremely deep wells in western Chinese terrain with pockets of compressed natural gas and toxic gases.China\u2019s hunt for natural gas reserves at home has taken it into some of the poorest, most remote mountain valleys of western China, where terraced fields of mustard greens and corn cascade down hillsides from mud-brick farmhouses. While some of the country\u2019s energy giants, like Sinopec, are using modern drilling rigs, smaller Chinese companies are also trying to jump into the industry, although many have minimal experience or technical expertise. China\u2019s reliance on imports poses the same kind of foreign policy challenges that the United States has faced in recent decades. That is, the country must look to unstable areas of the world to meet its needs.China imports much of its oil from the Persian Gulf region and through the Strait of Hormuz, where security is dependent on the United States Navy. China relies on roughly a half-million barrels a day from Iran.But American sanctions on Iran have made that country a less reliable source of oil. At the same time, China has been receiving fewer crude shipments from Libya, Sudan and South Sudan. The Energy Department recently reported that China has nimbly replaced those declining sources with imports from Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Angola, Venezuela, Russia and Iraq.China\u2019s relations with energy-rich countries differs widely. The situation in Vietnam seems extreme, with ships from both countries ramming each other, and the Chinese naval forces using water cannons against the Vietnamese. China\u2019s moves to exert claims to contested Asian waters have drawn protests from its neighbors as well as from the Obama administration.But in Iraq, where China is the biggest oil customer and Chinese oil companies are major investors in some of the biggest oil fields, the Chinese have been scrupulous about staying out of Iraq\u2019s strained sectarian affairs. And they do not seem eager to challenge the United States\u2019 influence in the region.China has also become a major player in an area traditionally dominated by the United States, Latin America. But China is largely forging ties with oil-financed governments that promote a socialist ideology and seek to distance themselves from the United States, namely Ecuador and Venezuela.In Ecuador, China has become effectively the government\u2019s banker, providing roughly 60 percent of Ecuadorean borrowing needs in return for oil shipments. Chinese companies sell the Ecuadorean oil around the world, including to the United States. Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company is repaying China for $40 billion in loans procured over the last six years with a large share of its 600,000 barrels a day in oil shipments.Africa has proved a more difficult place to invest, showing the limits of Chinese influence. Chad last year indefinitely suspended the activities of the state-owned China National Petroleum because of oil spills south of the capital, N\u2019Djamena. Chadian officials claimed that the Chinese forced local workers to clean up the mess without adequate protection. A subsidiary of another Chinese oil company, Sinopec, was forced to pay Gabon $400 million in January to settle what the government said was a breach of contract at an onshore oil field. Premier Li Keqiang this month highlighted China\u2019s enduring interest in Africa by visiting four countries, including oil-rich Angola and Nigeria. The new gas deal with Moscow should strengthen Russia and China, both economically and politically. It will help China ease some of its dependence on insecure transit routes and unstable countries. It will also guarantee an energy market for Russia if Europe seeks to replace Russian energy with imports from other countries.Russia could supply 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually \u2014 or more than 15 percent of current demand \u2014 to China beginning in 2018. Perhaps most important, the deal should enable China to replace some of its dependence on coal for electricity generation with natural gas. \u201cThe Chinese public will appreciate being able to industrialize without billows of toxic smog,\u201d said Jim Krane, an energy expert at Rice University. \u201cAnd the world will appreciate the reduced carbon emissions if cleaner gas can thwart some of the coal consumption in China\u2019s power grid.\u201dClifford Krauss reported from Houston and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jobs Report Isn\u2019t as Good as It Looks", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmployment PictureRarely does a monthly report on the United States job market look so terrific on the surface while being so disappointing underneath.But where the last couple of months have had disappointing top-line numbers with some excellent trends bubbling beneath the surface, this one pairs the excellent surface news with a soft underbelly.The most promising trend in the labor market in the first three months of 2014 had been workers returning to the job market. Some 1.3 million more Americans counted themselves as either having a job or looking for one in March than in December. That represented the strongest three-month gain in the size of the labor force since the boom times of early 2000.A dynamic that seemed \u2014 maybe, possibly \u2014 to be taking shape for 2014 was that of some of the millions of people who had given up on even looking for a job during the recession and the slow recovery were finally returning. That trend might have acted as a floor underneath the overall unemployment rate. People returning to the work force might not find a job immediately, joining the rolls of the unemployed, but it would be good news for the long-term prosperity of the American economy.The details of the April job report, though, threw serious cold water on that proposition. The number of people in the labor force fell by a whopping 806,000, wiping out the February and March gains and a bit of January as well. The labor force participation rate fell by 0.4 percentage points to 62.8 percent, returning to its December level.And the number of people reporting they were unemployed fell by 733,000, which sounds good on its surface, but paired with the similar-sized decline in the labor force points to job seekers giving up looking rather than finding new employment.It\u2019s great that job growth is showing more life after a gloomy winter, and the usual statistical randomness made it look less robust at the start of the year. But it would be a lot more satisfying if an improving job market was coaxing more people into the labor force, rather than leading them to leave it, and if it were accompanied by higher pay for workers who haven\u2019t seen significant raises in the better part of a decade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fast Food Protests Spread Overseas", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven though fast food workers have staged several one-day strikes in the last 18 months, the protests have not swayed McDonald\u2019s or other major restaurant chains to significantly raise their employees\u2019 pay.So on Thursday, the fast food workers\u2019 movement wants to broaden its reach as it pushes for a $15-an-hour wage that restaurant companies say is unrealistic. In addition to one-day strikes in 150 cities across the country, the movement\u2019s leaders hope to take their cause global. They say support protests will take place in 80 cities in more than 30 countries, from Dublin to Venice to Casablanca to Seoul to Panama City.Over the last decade as American labor unions have declined in membership and power, they have increasingly turned to unions in Europe and Asia to help pressure companies overseas to stop battling organizing drives at their United States units. And now the fast food movement, underwritten by the Service Employees International Union, is embracing a similar strategy as it struggles to gain influence with the fast food giants.\u201cIt\u2019s a global economy, so they\u2019re saying, \u2018Why not go overseas to make it into a global fight?\u2019 \u201d said Lowell Turner, a professor of international labor relations at Cornell University. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to create a global protest movement.\u201dThe movement\u2019s organizers say there will be protests in 30 cities in Japan, 20 in Britain, five in Brazil and three in India. The effort\u2019s strategists point to some fast-growing overseas markets as vulnerable targets for corporations like McDonald\u2019s that have begun relying more heavily on foreign revenue now that domestic fast food sales have languished.To help propel the effort, a labor federation with 12 million workers in 126 countries \u2014 the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers\u2019 Associations \u2014 met in New York last week. It brought together union officials from more than two dozen countries, many of them with thriving, powerful labor organizations, to throw their weight behind Thursday\u2019s protests.Massimo Frattini, international coordinator of the federation\u2019s restaurant division, said restaurant workers in Europe, Asia and Latin America were eager to join in \u2014 both to help their own cause and that of their United States allies.\u201cFast food workers in many other parts of the world face the same corporate policies \u2014 low pay, no guaranteed hours and no benefits,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union.Her union has previously teamed up with overseas unions. For instance, it worked with Swedish unions to persuade Securitas, a Swedish security services company, not to oppose many efforts to unionize security guards at its American subsidiaries.But such overseas cooperation does not always guarantee success. The United Automobile Workers have asked unions in Japan and other nations to pressure Nissan to adopt a less hostile stance toward its unionization campaign at Nissan\u2019s plant in Mississippi. So far, those efforts have not changed Nissan\u2019s position.Scott DeFife, an executive vice president for the National Restaurant Association, a trade group, dismissed Thursday\u2019s protests \u2014 however broadened \u2014 as more of the same. \u201cThese are made-for-TV media moments \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d he said.Eddie Foreman, 40, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Opelika, Ala., who makes $7.75 an hour and takes home about $200 a week, said he had persuaded several other workers in his town to walk out Thursday.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m going on strike is I don\u2019t make enough money to take care of my kids,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go on strike and protest \u2014 that\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll get them to improve things.\u201dBusinesses have generally opposed the $15-an-hour proposal, saying it would cut into their profits, reduce hiring and force them to raise prices. Mr. DeFife warned of harmful repercussions if wages climbed to $15 an hour. \u201cIt would have consequences on hiring patterns for Main Street businesses across the country,\u201d he said.For its part, McDonald\u2019s \u2014 which has been one of the biggest targets \u2014 said its restaurants offered competitive pay and benefits, with opportunities for advancement. In a statement, McDonald\u2019s said: \u201cThis is an important discussion that needs to take into account the highly competitive nature of the industries that employ minimum-wage workers, as well as consumers and the thousands of small businesses which own and operate the vast majority of McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\u201dThe one-day strikes have drawn attention to low-wage workers across many industries, including retailing, and have provided fuel for congressional lawmakers backing President Obama\u2019s call for a minimum-wage increase to $10.10.Even with the new overseas protests, Jake Rosenfeld, a labor relations expert at the University of Washington, doubted the movement would achieve its $15 goal unless the employees were unionized. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re any way close to getting there,\u201d he said of the effort.At the moment, the movement seems far from unionizing many restaurants, even though one of its main demands is getting the chains and their franchisees\u2019 to promise not to fight such efforts.Organizers said a total of 200 workers walked out at 60 restaurants in New York City during the first one-day strike in November 2012, adding that thousands went on strike when the walkouts expanded to more than 60 cities last December.But Mr. DeFife disputed those accounts, saying few restaurant workers actually went on strike during the five previous one-day walkouts and that only a handful of restaurants were forced to close, even for a few hours.\u201cThe vast majority of these protesters are not actually restaurant workers, and if they are, they\u2019ve taken the day off in advance,\u201d he said, adding that the efforts did not fit the description of a strike.Ms. Henry said that if workers went on strike in 150 cities on Thursday, with accompanying protests overseas, that would be one of the biggest labor protests in years.She said these mushrooming protests showed \u201cwhy a settlement with the big fast food companies is possible.\u201dGary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University, said Thursday\u2019s protests were an example of \u201cthe labor movement reinventing itself. It\u2019s the most experimental thing labor has done in a long time.\u201dBut he characterized the goal of a $15 hourly minimum as overly ambitious.\u201cThey seem to forget you have to take little steps at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have very much, getting a little can mean a lot. You can\u2019t get it all at once.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Michigan Joins Move to Increase Hourly Wage", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor several years, Republicans in states such as Michigan have steered clear of raising the minimum wage. That shifted this week, as the state\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature approved a gradual increase in the state\u2019s wage, to $9.25 an hour. The change reflects a national conversation about income inequality, worker pay and economic growth that is bumping up against the reality of practical politics, pollsters and economic analysts said. In Michigan, where a coalition of labor and community groups had mounted an effort to put a minimum wage of $10.10 an hour on the ballot in the fall, Republican lawmakers joined with Democrats to pass a more modest measure. After signing the increase in Lansing on Tuesday night, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican who had been noncommittal when asked about an increase a month ago, stood beside legislative leaders from both parties and praised the move as a bipartisan compromise. \u201cI commend my partners in the Legislature for finding common ground on a bill that will help Michigan workers and protect our state\u2019s growing economy,\u201d said a statement from Mr. Snyder, who is seeking a second term in office in November.As lawmakers in at least 34 states and many cities this year have pondered increases to the wage, the efforts have divided largely along partisan lines. After President Obama\u2019s calls for an increase in the federal minimum wage stalled in Congress, Democrats in politically divided states like Maine and New Mexico took up the idea \u2014 seen as a draw for their political bases with midterm elections approaching.Cities like Seattle and San Francisco, where liberal Democrats are firmly in control, went even further, with local minimum wage proposals that could top $15 or more an hour, more than double the federal minimum of $7.25.Democratic-held legislatures in states like Connecticut, Maryland and Minnesota have passed increases in recent months. On Wednesday, the Illinois legislature, controlled by Democrats, sent the governor a bill permitting a nonbinding ballot question about a wage increase there; Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat seeking re-election in November, said he would sign it.Yet Republican politicians find themselves in increasingly thorny political terrain. While polls suggest that a higher wage is broadly popular among Democratic voters, Republican voters are more mixed on the subject. And Republican officeholders find themselves trying to balance the views of traditional allies, including business leaders who oppose increases, against public sentiment and efforts, like the one in Michigan, for ever larger ones. \u201cThe economic case for raising the minimum wage is straightforward,\u201d said David Cooper, an economic analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington. But the political case as suggested by polling data, he added, is mixed, with Democrats overwhelmingly in support of higher minimums, and a only minority of Republican voters in agreement. That creates an easy path for Democrats, he said \u2014 support the higher wage \u2014 and a trickier one for Republicans, with some party leaders like Mitt Romney recently suggesting that minimum wages should go up. The result has sometimes been complicated. Thom Tillis, a Republican candidate for the Senate from North Carolina, said this month that he opposed a federal minimum wage increase, but that state minimum wage decisions were different and \u201cneed to be made by the state.\u201d In Illinois, Bruce Rauner, the Republican nominee for governor, has adjusted his position in various recorded appearances and interviews, suggesting at one point that he favored lowering the state\u2019s minimum wage, then saying he could support an increase.In Alaska, an initiative on the November ballot would raise the wage to $9.75 by 2016 from the current $7.75. But, surprisingly, Republicans who control the State House of Representatives passed a bill in April that would have accelerated the pace of those increases, with a rise to $9 in July and to $10 on Jan. 1, 2016. Republican leaders said their bill was good policy for struggling Alaskan families, but Democrats denounced it and helped defeat it in the Senate. They said it was a Republican ploy to pass a measure that could later be amended or repealed, rather than allowing the ballot measure, which would be binding, to proceed. The tone of mistrust that filtered out from the Capitol in Juneau has since become part of the campaign by backers of the ballot measure. In Michigan on Wednesday, leaders of a coalition of labor and community groups submitted to the state more than 300,000 signatures on petitions seeking to place the question of a minimum-wage increase \u2014 to $10.10 an hour by 2017 \u2014 on the ballot this November.The signatures, gathered over a period of months, were submitted a day after legislators reached their agreement on a smaller increase \u2014 to $9.25 an hour by 2018 \u2014 and Mr. Snyder had promptly signed it. The fate of the ballot measure is uncertain now, officials said, given that the law it aimed to change has since been replaced. \u201cThis issue would have never gotten anywhere in Lansing if not for our ballot initiative,\u201d Ms. Atkinson said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t like our idea, so they were trying to undermine it.\u201dHow the issue may affect elections in the state, if at all, was uncertain. Bill Ballenger, a political analyst in the state, said a major factor in approving an increase had been removing the question come election time. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have to be carrying the burden of opposition to the minimum wage when the polls show the public supports it,\u201d Mr. Ballenger said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: We\u2019re not going to give the Democrats any leverage at all \u2014 no chance to rev up the base.\u201dSomewhat surprisingly, Mr. Snyder and his re-election opponent suddenly find themselves on the same side of this issue. Mark Schauer, a former Democratic congressman who is opposing Mr. Snyder for governor, months ago advocated a wage increase to $9.25, his aides said, and lauded the increase this week. And Mr. Snyder described the increase as one that would help hard-working residents without harming the state\u2019s economy. Last month, in an interview, Mr. Snyder sidestepped questions about his stand on raising the wage. \u201cI spend my time on getting people more than the minimum wage,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cI\u2019m sticking to creating higher-paying jobs.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Ledoux said that commercializing Lib\u00e9\u2019s intellectual reputation would help the owners cut the newspaper\u2019s net loss, which was \u20ac4.5 million, or $6.2 million, in 2013.After the memo surfaced, Lib\u00e9\u2019s staff went on strike and no paper was printed Feb. 8. The next day it published a bold front-page statement declaring fidelity to the paper\u2019s roots under the title \u201cNous sommes un journal,\u201d for \u201cWe are a newspaper.\u201d This was followed by a list of everything Lib\u00e9 was not \u2014 a restaurant, a social network and so on.In interviews, Lib\u00e9\u2019s journalists said they were willing to adapt \u2014 to a point. Tonino Serafini, who sits on Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s works council and covers the real estate market, said that the changes had to make sense and that any diversification had to maintain the backbone of the paper.\u201cThe paper was started with very little capital and has had many crises but never been in such deathly danger,\u201d said Mr. Serafini, who has been at Lib\u00e9ration for 28 years. Given the paper\u2019s history, politics and values, the uneasy reaction from journalists has hardly been surprising. First published on Feb. 3, 1973, Lib\u00e9ration was initially run as a collective, with all staff members receiving the same salary. The paper was founded on left-wing Maoist politics, but its radicalism diminished over time. In the 1980s, during a financial crunch, it began to allow advertising and brought in shareholders. The role of the shareholders has increased in the past decade, causing internal friction. In 2006, after a major rift with \u00c9douard de Rothschild, a shareholder, Sartre\u2019s co-founder, Serge July, was ousted. Soon thereafter, the Lib\u00e9ration journalists Pierre Haski and Pascal Rich\u00e9 left in disgust and founded Rue89, one of several news websites that are gaining in popularity.\u201cThat should have been what Lib\u00e9 became,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Filloux, who worked at Lib\u00e9ration for 14 years before leaving in 2000.Since the strike, Lib\u00e9\u2019s staff members have been living a double life: producing a daily paper while venting their spleen on multiple platforms. A Facebook group, a Tumblr blog and a Twitter handle (@nousjournal) have sprung up around the \u201cNous sommes un journal\u201d theme. During the months following the Feb. 8 cover, the newspaper\u2019s front page carried the motto on the lower right corner of its front page. As many as two full pages of each issue were dedicated to celebrating Lib\u00e9\u2019s legacy and criticizing management, which has not put an end to the articles. \u201cNous sommes un journal\u201d is a somewhat knotty rallying cry. As Vincent Glad pointed out in an article on Slate.fr, Lib\u00e9ration may not want to be a restaurant or a social network but it has long capitalized on its reputation. Its website sells Lib\u00e9ration-branded American Apparel hoodies, iPhone cases and umbrellas, as well as English-language lessons and a \u201cbox gastronomique,\u201d containing lentils, wine and chocolate. To others, the slogan reflects a media vision that is too conservative. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Roussel, a 15-year veteran of Lib\u00e9\u2019s economy desk, said in an email that some readers found \u201cNous sommes un journal\u201d an outdated mantra. \u201cSomeone who reads articles from Lib\u00e9ration through Facebook or Twitter told me they thought it was a negative approach: \u2018You say newspaper rather than media, which is not modern. And you negate everything else,\u201d\u2019 she said.Still, she stands by it, as it was \u201ccourageous, and in opposition to what the shareholders wanted. We took charge of the newspaper.\u201dWhile they may have taken charge, resistance to the move to digital is very possibly what got Lib\u00e9ration into trouble in the first place, former staffers said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough investment in the web,\u201d said Johan Hufnagel, who worked at Lib\u00e9 for 16 years and was involved in the paper\u2019s early digital presence. Although Lib\u00e9ration was the first French newspaper available online in the mid-1990s, the site\u2019s \u201ccannibalization\u201d of the print readership was always feared. The thin attention to digital remained a constant until Mr. Hufnagel\u2019s departure in 2006. He went on to co-found Slate.fr. \u201cBefore the Internet, Lib\u00e9 had a strong voice \u2014 it represented the radical gauche fran\u00e7aise,\u201d Mr. Hufnagel said. Not staying on the cusp of new communication has made it seem less incisive, he said. When asked if he still read Lib\u00e9ration, Mr. Hufnagel replied, \u201cThat is the meanest question you could ask,\u201d and admitted that he no longer does. Mr. Hufnagel is hardly alone; Lib\u00e9ration\u2019s readership has plummeted significantly. Fran\u00e7ois Moulias, a principal shareholder, said Lib\u00e9ration lost \u20ac4.5 million in 2013 alone, a precipitous drop from the years prior, when it did not suffer any financial losses. Bruno Ledoux Media Holding (BLMH) promised to bail out the paper for \u20ac18 million in several installments. Mr. Ledoux had to prove in bankruptcy court that he could keep the paper afloat; the court ratified his plan on April 28th. A \u20ac4 million loan has already been put into effect, \u20ac3.5 million of which went directly to Lib\u00e9ration; the rest paid off a debt to the printers. Without this money, Lib\u00e9ration editors said, the publication would not have lasted through May.The shareholders stated that the promised \u20ac14 million extra would come from a BLMH capital increase, of which \u20ac6.4 million is to be debt protection paid in installments through 2017. How the remaining funds will be used is, to date, unspecified. This lack of clarity is precisely what has kept the Lib\u00e9 staff agitated. In an article published May 5, it was revealed that the identity of an investor behind Mr. Ledoux had been concealed and that the first \u20ac4 million of the paper\u2019s recapitalization was coming through a related company based in the financial haven of Luxembourg. Moreover, the financing deal\u2019s fine print, reviewed by Lib\u00e9 journalists, also included a previously undisclosed reference to a reduction in staff of 50 employees.Mr. Moulias countered that a confidentiality clause prevented the disclosure of the investor\u2019s name until a later date. He has since been revealed as Patrick Drahi, the chairman of the holding company that controls the Numericable cable company. Mr. Moulias also said that the staff reduction would be voluntary. Employees of media outlets are permitted to leave with severance pay when its company changes ownership. Given the vociferous in-house unhappiness about the current state of affairs, \u201cit would have been irresponsible to not anticipate,\u201d Mr. Moulias said.Mr. Moulias defended the diversification plan as first and foremost a means to cover the publication\u2019s losses. As for the internal friction and vocal discontent, he was quick to play down any concern.\u201cIt\u2019ll calm down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine that the journalists express themselves.\u201d He added that \u201cthe money right now is more important than being polemical.\u201dThere are signs that the staff reluctantly understands that drastic transformation is necessary if the publication is to survive. One editor, Herv\u00e9 Marchon, said he had seen Lib\u00e9 struggle for 13 of the 15 years he had worked there \u2014 2011-12 were relative successes because of captivating world events like the Japanese tsunami, the Arab Spring and the Strauss-Kahn scandal, in addition to the French presidential election. Mr. Marchon said he felt that the shareholders had \u201cthe force of funding, we have the force of the work itself: the brains, the imagination, the ideas.\u201d Despite its opposition, he said, for the most part the staff ultimately would \u201crather change than disappear.\u201dIt has been over three months since the \u201cNous sommes un journal\u201d cover, and the future of the paper still hangs in the balance. Jean-Louis Le Touzet, who has been a reporter for Lib\u00e9 for 20 years, laments the paper\u2019s eventual transformation into a \u201cconcept store,\u201d though he admits there is something \u201cparadoxically funny\u201d about it. This wry sense of the absurd is something that the publication has continuously brushed up against. \u201cThere has always been a kind of nostalgia around this paper,\u201d Mr. Hufnagel noted, joking that people have been saying, \u201cLiberation, c\u2019\u00e9tait mieux avant\u201d \u2014 Lib\u00e9ration was better before \u2014 since the very year it was founded.

{"Headline": "Euro Zone Economy Grows More Slowly Than Expected", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European economy maintained its feeble overall growth in the first three months of the year, official data showed on Thursday, as relatively strong performances by Germany and Britain were offset by continued weakness in France and a step backward by Italy.Germany\u2019s economy grew at a relatively robust 0.8 percent from the previous quarter, once again driving the euro zone forward; Britain, which is not a member of the single currency bloc, also grew 0.8 percent. But the French economy stagnated, and Italy\u2019s declined 0.1 percent. That was a reversal for the Italian economy, which in the previous quarter had registered growth of 0.1 percent.The euro zone\u2019s quarterly growth was only half the 0.4 percent that economists had been anticipating.\u201cThere was a huge divergence between the region\u2019s economies,\u201d Jennifer McKeown, an economist in London with Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. But even the German growth figure was slightly misleading, she wrote, as it reflected a rebound from an earlier period when poor weather depressed output.The current pace of growth in Europe \u201cwill do little to erode spare capacity or reduce deflation risks,\u201d she added.Japan, where the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has bet that a vigorous program of monetary expansion and reform will restart the economy, on Thursday reported that first-quarter G.D.P. growth rose 5.9 percent at an annualized rate. A surge in consumer spending before a rise in sales taxes contributed to the gain.Financial markets greeted the news tranquilly, with the euro down slightly at $1.3658 and major European stock indexes little changed.The Eurostat data showed that the economies of Italy, Estonia, the Netherlands and Portugal all contracted again after growing slightly in the final three months of last year.The combination of low inflation \u2014 \u201clowflation,\u201d as some analysts call it \u2014 and weak growth has raised concerns that the euro bloc could tip into outright deflation, further enfeebling the economy and increasing the stress on struggling borrowers and lenders.The data released on Thursday confirmed that six nations \u2014 Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, Portugal and Slovakia \u2014 were already experiencing declining prices.Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING in Brussels, said the data on growth and inflation would complicate life for the European Central Bank, which probably \u201cwould not be unhappy with some downward revisions to growth and inflation\u201d as a means of justifying more aggressive monetary policy.The president of the central bank, Mario Draghi, has \u201cput the E.C.B. into a corner from which it will be very hard to escape without new action,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said.Without signs of a solid improvement in growth and inflation, which would be \u201ca rather unlikely scenario,\u201d Mr. Brzeski said, the central bank at its policy meeting next month would almost certainly have to take steps to stimulate the economy.But the central bank is thought unlikely to reach for the so-called quantitative easing measures \u2014 large-scale purchases of government bonds \u2014 that other central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, have adopted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ousted Thai Premier Faces Impeachment Amid Rising Tension", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 The Election Commission of Thailand on Thursday cast doubt on elections tentatively set for July as proceedings to impeach the ousted prime minister took another step forward, sharpening a political crisis that has already left the country with a hamstrung government.The removal of Yingluck Shinawatra as prime minister on Wednesday on the grounds that she had illegally transferred a civil servant to another post was followed Thursday by separate proceedings to impeach her in connection with a farm subsidy program, a process that could result in Ms. Yingluck being banned from politics. The National Anti-Corruption Commission, which brought the latest proceedings, did not clarify how Ms. Yingluck could be impeached from an office that she no longer holds.The Constitutional Court\u2019s decision to remove Ms. Yingluck and the move to impeach her have emboldened supporters of the opposition, who disrupted elections in February and continue to campaign for a suspension of democracy and for an appointed government.The Election Commission, which has been accused of sympathizing with the protest movement, said Thursday that it was not sure elections could be held on July 20, as it had previously proposed.\u201cWe may have to postpone it,\u201d Phuchong Nutawong, the election commission\u2019s secretary general, told reporters.Backed by the Bangkok establishment, antigovernment protesters are battling to eradicate the influence of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister and the founder of a political movement that has won every election since 2001, drawing its strength from populous agrarian provinces in the north.Thailand\u2019s economy has slowed significantly since the latest crisis began six months ago. Both sides are warning about the prospect of increased violence.Ms. Yingluck\u2019s impeachment case centers on a costly policy to subsidize rice farmers that the anticorruption commission said the government had mismanaged.Like the court decision removing Ms. Yingluck from office, which legal experts have criticized for being a disproportionately harsh punishment for irregularities in the transfer of a civil servant, the decision to begin impeachment proceedings appeared to some to be rushed and based on debatable legal reasoning.Vicha Mahakun, the spokesman of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, said Ms. Yingluck was being held accountable for damage to the country, not for corruption.\u201cEven though at this stage it appears that the evidence is not clear that the accused took part in corruption or whether she allowed corruption or not, the accused did not govern the country as announced in Parliament,\u201d Mr. Vicha said.The policy, which paid farmers twice the market price for rice, had resulted in \u201cdevastating damage to the country\u201d and was an opportunity for fraud, Mr. Vicha said. The government has accumulated debt totaling 695 billion baht, or about $21 billion, to finance the scheme, according to experts, although some of that debt will be recouped when the government sells its rice stocks.Ms. Yingluck\u2019s party has accused the courts and independent agencies such as the anticorruption commission of being part of a conspiracy to remove her government from power.The caretaker government is headed by Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, a former business executive who was hastily named acting prime minister on Wednesday after Ms. Yingluck\u2019s removal. On Thursday, he was also put in charge of the finance ministry. Because of its caretaker status, the government is barred by law from making major funding decisions.While some commentators have said fresh elections are the only way out of the crisis, both the antigovernment protest movement and their allies in the opposition Democrat Party have threatened to block or boycott the elections, which they would likely lose.Chavanond Intarakomalyasut, a spokesman for the Democrat Party, which has lost every election since 1995, warned Wednesday that elections could be \u201cbloody\u201d if they go ahead in July.\u201cMost people are not confident that the July 20 election will be held or if they are held, they will not be accepted,\u201d he said.As it has numerous times during months of antigovernment demonstrations, the Election Commission on Thursday showed no urgency in setting a concrete date for fresh elections.Mr. Phuchong, the election commission\u2019s secretary general, told reporters that the body was unable to agree to the government\u2019s request for a meeting in the coming days because members of the commission planned to attend a plowing ritual on Friday, an annual ceremony that marks the start of the rice growing season.The commission said the earliest that it could meet to discuss who had the legal authority to call elections was next Wednesday.\u201cThe Election Commission is not standing still,\u201d Mr. Phuchong said. \u201cBut we have to invite all sides to deliberate.\u201dThailand has not had a fully functioning government since December, when Ms. Yingluck dissolved Parliament and called for elections. After antigovernment protesters disrupted the February elections, a court ruled that the vote had been unconstitutional because of the problems.The movement seeking to overthrow the government said that it considered Ms. Yingluck\u2019s removal from office on Wednesday only a partial victory and that it planned to continue its campaign for an appointed government that would carry out unspecified reforms.Both the United Nations and Washington have voiced concern over the Thai crisis. Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, said at a briefing that a resolution to the country\u2019s crisis \u201cshould include elections and an elected government.\u201dA spokesman for Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, urged all sides to show \u201cutmost restraint and show full respect for democratic principles.\u201dA senior police official said Thursday that at least 15,000 security officers would be called up to maintain order as supporters and opponents of the government prepare for separate demonstrations in the coming days. The movement vowing to overthrow the government plans a public gathering on Friday, while government supporters said they would hold a demonstration on Saturday.More than 20 people have been killed in political violence during the six months of antigovernment demonstrations. On Wednesday night, after Ms. Yingluck\u2019s removal from office, explosions damaged a bank, a hospital and the home of a Constitutional Court judge who had ruled against Ms. Yingluck.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If Your Bucket List Includes a Taco Truck", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAround the BlockIf there\u2019s a 2014 Ram ProMaster van in the meatpacking district, it\u2019s packed with meat. In the garment district, it\u2019s moving garments. Nothing about this giant box is designed for comfort, style or driving pleasure. But as a commercial vehicle it\u2019s destined to become a familiar sight.The world of full-size vans moves slowly, and then all at once. Dodge sold the same basic B-van \u2014 under the names Sportsman, Tradesman and, finally, Ram Van \u2014 through the 1971-2003 model years. Then the European-designed Mercedes-Benz Sprinter got a Dodge grille and replaced the B-van for a while.Now that the corporate Tilt-A-Whirl has spun Chrysler into Fiat, and recast Dodge trucks as Rams, the rear-drive Sprinter has given way to the front-drive ProMaster. The Sprinter is still around as a Mercedes or a Freightliner or simply as a Sprinter, should you consider the three-pointed star pretentious.Meanwhile, this year Ford is replacing its E-Series Econoline \u2014 only modestly updated since 1975 \u2014 with the European-designed Transit. General Motors sells the last big old-style American van as the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana. Their last full redesign was 18 years ago.The ProMaster is a variation on the Fiat Ducato, which was introduced in its current form in 2006; it is also sold by Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn. The significant differences between the ProMaster and its Euro-market clones is that it\u2019s assembled in Saltillo, Mexico, and is available with Chrysler\u2019s gasoline-burning Pentastar V6. This is the same power plant found in Dodge and Chrysler minivans, and it\u2019s mated to the same 6-speed automatic transmission.Ram also offers the Fiat-made turbo-diesel 4 that\u2019s used in the European versions as $4,000 option on the ProMaster. Rated at 174 horsepower, but making excellent low-end torque, it comes hooked to a 6-speed manual transmission. In the United States, most Promasters, like the one I tested, will be powered by the V6.Everything about how the Promaster looks and drives is at least slightly awkward. Getting in means hauling one\u2019s self around and over the front wheel well, and once inside the driver sits bolt upright, facing an equally upright steering wheel and a giant black plastic dashboard. The instrumentation is simple, the shifter pokes out of the dash and the ventilation controls are the ideal three-knob system: one dial to control fan speed, one to set the air temperature and the third to select where the air should be directed.Whatever distractions occur come from the echoes bouncing through the huge unfinished metal box behind the driver. According to Ram, there\u2019s 530 cubic feet of space in the one-ton long-wheelbase high-roof version that I tested. That\u2019s more than 40 times the capacity of a Dodge Dart\u2019s trunk, and you can\u2019t stand up in the Dart. It\u2019s also more than three times the capacity of the Ram Cargo Van, the commercial version of the Grand Caravan minivan.Given that you sit almost atop the left front tire, the nose of the ProMaster seems to rotate around your tailbone. The steering is well weighted, but uncommunicative. The brakes have a nice progressive feel even when the van is empty. Sitting so high, there\u2019s some sensation of tiptoe cornering, but it\u2019s not terrifying. The V6 never felt strained, even though the ProMaster I drove weighed in at 5,070 pounds. It drives like an overinflated minivan.For some van buyers, the low load floor and foul-weather-capable front drive will be ideal. For others, the height of the load floor won\u2019t matter, and the ruggedness of a front-drive transaxle is suspect.Of course it\u2019s loud, but that\u2019s because an empty ProMaster is a giant steel drum of unrealized potential. What matters is the bottom line.\u00a0And any van that isn\u2019t hauling enough meat or ladies\u2019 wear or whatever to pay for itself isn\u2019t worth buying.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Debt Forges Higher, as Equities Fade", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stocks market edged lower for the first time in five trading sessions on Wednesday, but the real action was in the debt market.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest point in 11 months as investors continued to put money into the bond market, extending a rally that has taken many investors and analysts by surprise. Most market participants had expected yields to climb this year, and bond prices to fall, as the Federal Reserve reduces its multibillion-dollar monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, and the economy improved.Instead, the opposite has happened. While stocks have ground out modest gains this year, pushing major indexes to record levels, bond prices have surged. Even evidence that the economy is strengthening after a winter lull has failed to slow the bond rally.\u201cThe bond market has been incredibly resilient,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock. \u201cEven as stocks have pushed to new highs, and you\u2019ve had generally positive economic data, bonds have remained well-bid.\u201dIn the stock market, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index flirted with a third straight nominal record high before falling 2.13 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 1,909.78. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 42.32 points, or 0.25 percent, to 16,633.18. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.99 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,225.08. As bonds rallied, investors bid up the prices of safe and steady stocks like utilities and phone companies that pay rich dividends, giving a lift to major stock indexes. Utility and phone company stocks were the best performers in the S.&P. 500. The utility sector is the year\u2019s best performer of the 10 sectors that make up the S.&P. 500, gaining 10.7 percent since the start of 2014.The stock market has edged up to record levels against a backdrop of reports that have shown the American economy is gradually strengthening after a winter slump. The S.&P. 500 closed above 1,900 for the first time on Friday.But despite the encouraging economic backdrop, bonds have continued to rally. On Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.45 percent from 2.52 percent late Tuesday, as its price rose 21/32, to 100 16/32. The 10-year Treasury yield started the year near 3 percent.Expectations that the European Central Bank will take further steps to stimulate the euro zone\u2019s economy have increased the appeal of United States Treasury notes compared with bonds issued by European governments. The yield on the 10-year German government bond is 1.34 percent, and French bonds with a similar maturity yield 1.76 percent.\u201cIn terms of safety and yield, the U.S. still is the prettiest girl at the dance,\u201d said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.Some analysts also say the Chinese government is buying United States government debt as a way of weakening its currency to help make its own exports cheaper.Among the stocks on the move on Wednesday, Dollar General led consumer discretionary stocks lower after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut their forecast for the company\u2019s earnings, saying that it faces tough pricing competition from rival retailers, including Walmart and Target. The retailer\u2019s stock dropped $1.70, or 3 percent, to $54.60.Allergan fell even though Valeant Pharmaceuticals added more cash to its offer to buy the company in a deal now valued at about $49 billion. Valeant is now offering $58.30 in cash, $10 more than its previous offer, and a portion of its own stock for each Allergan share. Allergan fell $8.90, or 5.4 percent, to $156.12, making it the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500. Analysts and investors had been expecting a bigger bid.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Exhibit A in G.E.\u2019s Case for Alstom Deal", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVILLAROCHE, France \u2014 In a cavernous factory planted in farmland here south of Paris, workers assemble the best-selling aircraft engine in history, in a feat of trans-Atlantic industrial cooperation that has few parallels.Engineers and technicians in blue overalls carefully marry American-made engine cores \u2014 each containing a combustion chamber and related elements \u2014 to French-made turbofans, turbines and compressors. Combined, they form jet engines weighing two and a half tons each. Every month, up to 65 of these powerful machines are borne by a series of yellow cranes through assembly and testing stations, before being shipped out for mounting on the wings of the world\u2019s most popular passenger jets.The engines\u2019 builder? CFM International, the most successful joint venture you\u2019ve probably never heard of.But one of the partners, the American industrial giant General Electric, has been citing CFM lately as evidence that G.E. knows how to work with France.The CFM aircraft engine partnership is \u201cthe best industrial joint venture in the history of the world,\u201d G.E.'s chief, Jeffrey R. Immelt, declared recently, in arguing that case.Owned 50-50 by G.E. and Snecma, a unit of the French aerospace group Safran, CFM began as a risky niche project 40 years ago but has grown into an aviation juggernaut. Three-quarters of today\u2019s twin-engined single-aisle airliners built by Boeing and Airbus, about 10,000 planes now plying the world\u2019s air routes, are powered by CFM.Far back in second place is Pratt & Whitney, a unit of the American conglomerate United Technologies.CFM\u2019s backlog of nearly 11,000 orders is enough to keep the mechanics here, along with their counterparts at another vast GE Aviation factory near Cincinnati, busy for most of the next decade. Worldwide, the joint venture employs about 30,000 people.Even one of the biggest skeptics of G.E.'s Alstom bid, France\u2019s combative economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, has praised the CFM venture, hinting that Paris might be more inclined to accept a similarly balanced G.E.-Alstom partnership than an outright takeover.\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary, a joint venture that has lasted 40 years,\u201d Mr. Montebourg told journalists in mid-May. \u201cEvery two seconds, a plane takes off or lands with a G.E.-Safran engine.\u201dAt the government\u2019s request, G.E. agreed Thursday to extend its Alstom offer to June 23, to allow further study.If CFM has never been a household name, its success has nonetheless made it a subject for business school case studies, with some citing it as a template for profitable and enduring corporate cooperation.Yves L. Doz, a professor of management at the Insead business school near Paris, said the venture\u2019s success was a result of its structural simplicity. CFM has almost no overhead, staffed by just a few dozen administrative employees.Unlike many such partnerships, there are no cross-shareholdings. G.E. and Snecma evenly split the proceeds of every sale, leaving each company in charge of managing its own operating costs. \u201cThere is a simple beauty to how they collaborate,\u201d Mr. Doz said of G.E. and Safran. \u201cThey kept it simple, but not stupid.\u201dLuck has also played a role.The venture had the good fortune to propose a brand-new engine concept in the mid-1970s, around the time that the United States Air Force was considering a revamp of its entire fleet of aerial refueling tankers. At about the same time, Boeing and Airbus were preparing to develop the generation of short-range single-aisle jets that have become the workhorses of the air travel industry.\u201cFrom an industry standpoint, this was a winning lottery ticket,\u201d said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia.At the time Mr. Neumann and Mr. Ravaud met in 1971, G.E. and Snecma were almost exclusively producers of engines for military jets. The civilian market was still dominated by the likes of Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce. But the two men nonetheless foresaw a burgeoning demand for a new category of twin-engined commercial jets that were smaller and more efficient than the four-engined models like the Douglas DC-8, the Boeing 707 and even the 747, which had only been recently introduced.To serve this potential market, they proposed developing a new engine, the CFM56, that would combine an engine core developed by G.E. for the American B-1 bomber program with Snecma\u2019s own technology to build a simpler, quieter and more efficient machine than what was then the best-selling model, Pratt & Whitney\u2019s JT8D.But the political impediments to a deal were daunting: For one thing, the Pentagon had helped bankroll G.E.'s development costs for the engine core and objected to sharing it with Snecma, which was then wholly owned by the French state.The daily realities of having to construct and service thousands of engines operating across the globe have long since led the partners to dispense with such constraints. \u201cThat is all ancient history,\u201d said C\u00e9dric Goubet, CFM\u2019s executive vice president. \u201cThe success of our partnership has earned us a level of respect and trust.\u201dLately, the partners have started assembling the first test models of a successor engine, known as the Leap, incorporating lightweight carbon fiber and designed to reduce fuel consumption by 15 percent. CFM hopes the Leap will power most of the next generation of Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s, as well as a new single-aisle jet being developed by China, the Comac C919, well into the middle of this century.Just yards away from the CFM56 production line inside Villaroche\u2019s 640,000-square-foot assembly hall, bigger than 11 American football fields, a dozen workers crowded one recent day around the 78-inch-wide fan of a new Leap engine that was sprouting with wires and sensors \u2014 among the first of roughly two dozen test engines that will be assembled here before the end of the year. An equal number are also being built at G.E. sites in Ohio and North Carolina.CFM says it already has advance orders for more than 5,700 Leaps, the first of which will enter service in early 2016.But that would be about nine months later than a rival engine from Pratt & Whitney. Pratt\u2019s engine, known as the PW-1000G, is meant to achieve fuel savings similar to the Leap\u2019s. But it uses a slower-spinning turbofan, an innovation that reduces wear, potentially reducing maintenance costs.While acknowledging the competitive challenge posed by Pratt & Whitney, CFM\u2019s French and American partners remain confident enough in the commercial logic of their partnership that they recently extended the CFM joint venture until at least 2040.Marc Ventre, Safran\u2019s deputy chief executive and chief operating officer, said he believed the principles behind the CFM partnership could also be applied to many other industries.Mr. Ventre declined to comment on G.E.'s overtures to Alstom, citing the political overtones. He noted, though, that not every venture could easily lend itself to the simple division of tasks that had helped CFM to succeed.\u201cLike in any partnership, from time to time there have been problems,\u201d Mr. Ventre said. \u201cBut we have been able to overcome them because we both had in mind the success of the program.\u201dAn earlier version of a summary with this article misidentified the company. It is General Electric, not General Motors.An article on Monday about the engine maker CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and a unit of the French aerospace company Safran, misstated the background of one of CFM\u2019s founders, Gerhard Neumann. Although Mr. Neumann served in World War II with the Flying Tigers in China and then with the United States Army Air Corps, he did so as an airplane mechanic and engineer, not as a fighter pilot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thailand\u2019s Military Stages Coup, Thwarting Populist Movement", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySoldiers in Bangkok on Thursday. The Thai military launched a coup, declaring that it was \u201cnecessary to seize power.\u201dBANGKOK \u2014 The Thai military seized control of the country on Thursday and detained at least 25 leading politicians in a culmination of months of maneuvering by the Bangkok establishment to sideline a populist movement that has won every national election since 2001.It was the second time in a decade that the army had overthrown an elected government, but there were signs that this takeover could be more severe and include sharp curbs on Thailand\u2019s freewheeling news media.The coup was seen as a victory for the elites in Thailand who have grown disillusioned with popular democracy and have sought for years to diminish the electoral power of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister who commands support in the rural north. Unable to win elections, the opposition has instead called for an appointed prime minister, and pleaded with the military for months to step in. As soldiers spread out throughout Bangkok on Thursday, the generals issued a series of announcements, declaring most of the Constitution \u201cterminated,\u201d banning gatherings of more than five people, imposing a curfew and shutting schools. The coup was at least the 12th military takeover since Thailand abandoned the absolute monarchy in 1932. But unlike many previous coups, which involved infighting among generals, Thursday\u2019s military takeover had as a subtext the political awakening among rural Thais who have loyally supported Mr. Thaksin and benefited from patronage and policies such as universal health care and microloans. Critics of Mr. Thaksin, a billionaire tycoon who lives in self-imposed exile abroad, say he also took corruption to a new level.With one of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economies, Thailand has long been attractive to foreign investors and tourists drawn by its reputation as \u201cthe land of smiles.\u201d But in recent months, it has made headlines for the many attempts by antigovernment protesters to suspend democracy, a jarring contrast with its open, cosmopolitan image. The military and Bangkok establishment now face the question of either retaining the power gained from the coup or returning the country to democracy \u2014 with the likelihood that Mr. Thaksin and his proven political machine would again return to power in elections. The coup in 2006 unseated Mr. Thaksin, but his backers came back to win at the polls, leading to his younger sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, becoming prime minister in 2011. Although the leader of the antigovernment movement, Suthep Thaugsuban, was detained Thursday, his supporters praised the coup. \u201cThis is a victory day for the people,\u201d Samdin Lertbutr, an antigovernment protest leader, said in an interview. \u201cThe military has done their job. And we have done our job.\u201dThe Thai military had initially pledged that Thursday would be a day of seeking political compromise, two days after declaring martial law in what it said was an attempt to force a political resolution. The army hosted rival political leaders, including Mr. Suthep, for what was billed as a second round of talks. But after several hours, soldiers detained the participants, including cabinet ministers.The leader of the army, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, then announced the coup on national television, saying he would \u201creform the political structure, the economy and the society.\u201dTelevision stations were ordered to replace their regular programming with messages from the military and patriotic songs. The military also issued a summons for 41 political figures tied to Mr. Thaksin, including Ms. Yingluck, who was removed as prime minister by a court this month and replaced by a deputy.The coup drew immediate rebukes from abroad. Secretary of State John Kerry urged that civilian government be restored immediately.\u201cThere is no justification for this military coup,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhile we value our long friendship with the Thai people, this act will have negative implications for the U.S.-Thai relationship, especially for our relationship with the Thai military.\u201dA spokesman at the Defense Department said the Pentagon was reviewing military cooperation, including planned joint exercises set to start Monday. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, also appealed for a \u201cprompt return to constitutional, civilian, democratic rule.\u201d And like Mr. Kerry, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary and the office of the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, were among those calling for new elections.Six months of debilitating protests in Thailand have centered on whether to hold elections to end the political unrest. Protesters have occupied government buildings, forcing even the prime minister to work elsewhere, and courts and independent government agencies have issued a series of rulings favorable to the protesters, including prohibiting the government from dispersing demonstrators. Some of those rulings have been derided by legal scholars.The antigovernment forces resent Mr. Thaksin not only for his concentration of power but also for intimidation of the news media during his time in office and what they call the mixing of his personal business with affairs of state. But many of them have also become skeptical of the notion of one person, one vote, which they say hands too much power to uneducated provincial voters who support Mr. Thaksin. The opposition proposes a return to democracy, but only after unspecified changes.In December, the governing party dissolved the House of Representatives in an attempt to defuse the crisis and set an election for February. But the opposition Democrat Party, which has not won a national election in two decades, refused to take part. The Constitutional Court later ruled that the election was unconstitutional, one of several rulings against the government by a court perceived by government supporters to be highly political.The military said Thursday that it would be fair to both sides in the continuing political dispute. But it allowed antigovernment demonstrators to remain in their protest site overnight, even as soldiers in black masks dispersed crowds loyal to Mr. Thaksin and the deposed government.After deposing Mr. Thaksin in 2006, the generals put in place an administration that was widely seen as a failure.\u201cThe lesson they learned the last time was that the medicine they prescribed after the coup was not strong enough,\u201d said Thongchai Winichakul, a former student activist in Thailand who is now a professor of Southeast Asian history at the University of Wisconsin. \u201cThere\u2019s a high possibility of very drastic measures and suppression this time.\u201dAt the time, the Constitution was rewritten to strengthen the role of judges, and the popular representation in the Senate was diluted.The initial trigger for the latest political crisis were the attempts by Ms. Yingluck\u2019s party to institute an amnesty program that could have allowed Mr. Thaksin to return from exile. Although Thailand has been burdened with tumultuous politics for decades, it has also been, by many measures, an economic success story and a well-functioning society, consistently outperforming almost all of its neighbors. Close to 100 percent of the population has running water and electricity. The unemployment rate is only around 1 percent. And American and Japanese automotive factories together export more than a million cars a year from the country. Despite those strengths, the economy contracted in the first quarter amid the unrest.In Thailand\u2019s turbulent political history, the king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, has on at least one occasion helped resolve political disputes. But he is 86 years old and ailing. There have been so many coups in Thailand\u2019s history that scholars have not arrived at a definitive number.Nicholas Farrelly, a specialist on Southeast Asia at Australian National University, posted a message this week on a website dedicated to studies on Thailand and its neighboring countries. Mr. Farrelly tallied 11 \u201csuccessful\u201d coups and nine \u201cunsuccessful\u201d ones. But he wrote that he also found \u201cobscure references to aborted military interventions.\u201d\u201cPlease share your knowledge to help us count Thailand\u2019s military coups once-and-for-all,\u201d he wrote.An earlier version of this article misstated the day that martial law was introduced. It was Tuesday, not Thursday.Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.videoAdvertisement"}

Lewinsky 16 years to face the cameras, but for Dominique Strauss-Kahn, three years was already too long a purgatory.\u00a0The man who in all likelihood would be the president of France today \u2014 if a chambermaid had not dared, three years ago this month, to accuse him of sexually assaulting her in his New York Sofitel suite \u2014 is again the talk of the town. Some of it is against his will, and some of it is of his own making; some is linked to the dark side of his life, and some a reminder of more noble endeavors.No, D.S.K. will not go away. Why would he? Political friends are openly saying how much they missed him, a view apparently shared by a good number of his countrymen \u2014 if not countrywomen.Operation Comeback, now in full swing with a leading role this month in a French TV documentary about Europe\u2019s currency crisis, started a year ago. In May 2013, the former International Monetary Fund managing director, sporting a tuxedo, a new girlfriend and a big smile, surprised everyone by showing up at the Cannes Film Festival to see, yes, Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cOnly Lovers Left Alive.\u201d A month later, Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his partner, Myriam L\u2019Aouffir, a blond, 46-year-old P.R. executive, were photographed basking courtside at the French Open.Now 65, the former inmate of Rikers Island has embarked on a new career as an investment banker, creating a firm with the entrepreneur Thierry Leyne, LSK & Partners, which will make good use of the \u201cvery important\u201d D.S.K. brand, as Mr. Leyne put it. Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who has helped the government of South Sudan to set up a bank, now also advises the Serbian government on its debt, sits on the board of two big Russian financial institutions and works the lecture circuit in Asia. The D.S.K. brand may be less marketable in France and the United States, but it has name recognition in the emerging world.D.S.K. didn\u2019t go to Cannes this year, but for a couple of days it was all about him \u2014 or, more exactly, about a new feature film, \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d which was shown off-festival on May 17. Featuring the huge and no less controversial G\u00e9rard Depardieu as Devereaux, a character modeled on D.S.K., and Jacqueline Bisset as Simone, likewise based on Anne Sinclair, D.S.K.\u2019s wife at the time, the movie is built around the Sofitel scandal and portrays both characters in an unforgiving light.Mr. Depardieu makes the most of the orgiastic sex scenes and then admits, in an interview with the magazine T\u00e9l\u00e9rama, that he was \u201ca little disgusted\u201d by the film. What pushed him to take the role, he said, was his curiosity for \u201cthe tragedy of a man at the height of power, trapped by his urges because he never questions them, he is too self-confident. And the intimate tragedy of a couple \u2014 she knows and he knows she knows.\u201dNot true, says Anne Sinclair, in an interview broadcast on public television on April 22. It was the first time she had spoken publicly about the affair and her relationship with the man she stood by in 2011 but left the following year. \u201cBelieve me or not: I did not know,\u201d she answered with aplomb when asked about her ex-husband\u2019s lifestyle.A former TV star-journalist, Ms. Sinclair put on a remarkable, if scripted, performance at the end of a benign program called \u201cA Day, a Destiny\u201d (hers), watched by five million people. That was not quite the 13 million who witnessed the disastrous attempt by Mr. Strauss-Kahn to justify himself on the evening news a few months after the Sofitel incident, but a high enough number for her to be considered rehabilitated, just before \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d came out. Having reclaimed her reputation, Ms. Sinclair condemned the film as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Mr. Strauss-Kahn\u2019s lawyer promptly announced that his client would sue the film\u2019s producers for libel.With D.S.K. back in troubled waters, the moment couldn\u2019t be better to broadcast, again on public television, another reputation-restoring program, this time featuring him. This, we were told, would be his first real interview since 2011. But he would not address such trivial matters as the Sofitel episode or the Lille Carlton saga, for which he was charged with aggravated pimping. No, this would be serious stuff: the economy and Europe.A 98-minute documentary called \u201cThe Euro Story,\u201d shown in prime time on May 15, included a total of five minutes of comments on the euro crisis by Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who spoke as the former French finance minister and former head of the I.M.F. Narrated by a close friend of his, the economist Daniel Cohen, the program was designed to showcase D.S.K.\u2019s expertise. Christine Lagarde, another former French finance minister and the current managing director of the I.M.F., is interviewed for a much shorter time.Looking older, his white hair combed back, D.S.K. clearly enjoyed reminiscing. He also produced a fluent analysis of the euro zone crisis and lashed out at Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and France\u2019s former president, Nicolas Sarkozy. Watching the documentary at home, Antoine Cachin, a French business consultant, said, \u201cD.S.K. stood out as the smartest one,\u201d adding: \u201cThat\u2019s what I used to like about him. He made you feel intelligent. He gave the impression that France had a strategy.\u201dMr. Strauss-Kahn himself has ruled out a political comeback. His trial in the Lille Carlton case, scheduled for next year, promises to be another devastatingly trashy episode in which his role in parties organized with prostitutes will be described at length. Yet D.S.K.\u2019s social-democrat friends are more vocal these days, whipping up nostalgia for their man. Labor Minister Fran\u00e7ois Rebsamen recently claimed he \u201cregretted\u201d D.S.K.\u2019s absence \u201cbecause he has this incredible talent as an economist.\u201dBut does he really? His government record as finance minister from 1997 to 1999 isn\u2019t that glorious. He was the one who came up with the original idea for the 35-hour workweek, blamed today for many of France\u2019s ills. A strong believer in balancing the budget, D.S.K. failed to take advantage of a 3 percent economic growth rate to advocate structural reforms. That he could appear to some today as a potential savior, despite his many personal failings, says a lot about the state of French politics.A contributing opinion writer and the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde.

{"Headline": "Glass Ceilings in Statehouses in the Northeast", "Date": "2014-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHILADELPHIA \u2014 The industrial Northeast enjoys a reputation as a cradle of liberalism, a region that voted overwhelmingly for America\u2019s first black president, started the push on same-sex marriage rights and can reliably be found at the forefront of causes for equality. But there is a notable gap: The Democratic Party has yet to elect a female governor in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island or Massachusetts.Even this year, with women running for governor in three of those states, it is uncertain that any of them will break the pattern. The Democratic Party in each state is rooted in urban machine politics and unions, both of which have been traditionally male dominated. And there have been fewer opportunities in those states for women to acquire executive experience in the state and local offices that are traditional steppingstones to running for governor, or to hold the levers of power in political organizations. (Philadelphia, New York and Boston have never elected female mayors.)Here at a west Philadelphia Democratic ward meeting, a crowd that had gathered Thursday to hear one of the women running for governor, Congresswoman Allyson Y. Schwartz, concentrated more on eating their fried chicken than on listening to her speech, at least until Ms. Schwartz concluded her remarks with a reminder about the stakes in Tuesday\u2019s primary. \u201cWith your help, I will be the next governor, the first woman governor,\u201d she said, winning only her second sustained applause of the night, much of it from the women in the room.In addition to those in Pennsylvania, women in Massachusetts and Rhode Island are vying to break the statehouse glass ceiling. But in all three states, they face contentious primaries. \u201cThe western states have done much better,\u201d Ms. Schwartz said in an interview as an aide drove her to another male-dominated meeting of the city\u2019s Democratic organization. \u201cThe pioneer states just treated women equally from the start.\u201dIt is no quirk of history, according to a few dozen politicians, scholars and strategists who have examined or experienced firsthand the difficulties women have had in seeking to become chief executives in some of the flagship states of blue America. \u201cTo say the old boys\u2019 club is alive and well is true but trivializes the impact that the vestiges of sexism have on women\u2019s opportunities to lead,\u201d said State Senator Barbara Buono of New Jersey, who ran for her state\u2019s governorship last year, but found little support from its Democratic bosses and was trounced by the incumbent, Gov. Chris Christie. Governor\u2019s races are typically the most coveted political prizes in these states because they bring with them the most patronage jobs, the sort of clout that mostly male power brokers are reluctant to relinquish. Further, unlike with some wealthy men who have successfully run outside of the party apparatus, there have been few Democratic women willing or able to fund their own campaigns.Beyond the region\u2019s political culture, the states\u2019 demography has also traditionally worked against women. \u201cThey are older, with a blue-collar electorate in an industrial economy and a heavy Catholic population,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster.Women have become the crucial element of the Democratic coalition in the era of President Obama, propelling both his victories and those of many others in the party, but there is just one female Democratic governor in America today \u2014 Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire. It is different in the Senate, where a record 16 Democratic women hold office. The difference, several analysts said, is that senators are seen as advocates working in a collective body, while governors are stand-alone executives \u2014 and that voters are simply more comfortable with women in the first category than the second.\u201cConvincing voters that women can serve where the buck stops is still a hurdle,\u201d said Debbie Walsh, who heads the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.Emily\u2019s List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, has helped elect 19 women to the Senate but only 10 female governors in its 29-year history. \u201cUntil the last 40 years, many folks didn\u2019t see women as executives,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the head of Emily\u2019s List.But some prominent women concede that a major challenge is one of their own making. \u201cThe biggest issue is really getting women to run,\u201d observed former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, saying some women see high-profile campaigns as \u201cdipping their toes in waters full of piranhas.\u201dIn this year\u2019s governor\u2019s races, the women running in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts are handling their identities in markedly different ways. Ms. Schwartz, the only woman in Pennsylvania\u2019s 20-member congressional delegation, is unambiguous: Her stump speech highlights the potentially historic nature of her candidacy, and her TV ads vow to break up \u201cthe old boys\u2019 club\u201d in Harrisburg, the state capital. Ms. Schwartz\u2019s race is complicated by the fact that another woman, Katie McGinty, is also seeking the nomination and could split the gender-based vote to the benefit of their opponent Tom Wolf, a self-funder who has a sizable lead in polls. In Massachusetts, a similar dynamic has not diminished the front-runner status of Martha Coakley, the state attorney general, whose opponents include another woman, Juliette Kayyem, as well as the state treasurer, Steve Grossman. Both Ms. Coakley and Ms. Kayyem said it was a positive to have more than one woman in the race, and each played down gender. Asked if she thought her gender was a factor in her 2010 Senate loss to Scott Brown, Ms. Coakley said, \u201cI can\u2019t say specifically that that played a role.\u201d And she projected an optimistic view of whether Massachusetts was ready to finally elect a woman to the Statehouse, on Beacon Hill, two years after sending Elizabeth Warren to the Senate.\u201cWe recognize it\u2019s time to move on, and the good news is that we are moving on,\u201d Ms. Coakley said.In Rhode Island, State Treasurer Gina Raimondo is striking a similar balance, alluding to her gender in the context of a broader message about how the state needs leadership from outside the entrenched political class.\u201cRhode Island politics have been dominated by insiders and the well-connected, an insider political class that\u2019s not particularly embracing of new people,\u201d she said, \u201cand frankly that\u2019s part of the reason we have the highest unemployment rate in country.\u201d Yet Ms. Raimondo enjoys some official support from elements of her state\u2019s party establishment, as do Ms. Schwartz and Ms. Coakley \u2014 a sign that gender politics in this region is becoming more complicated. But women who have run in these states in the past and lost \u2014 recalling critiques about their appearance in the press and all manner of patronizing comments \u2014 still worry about sentiments below the surface. Myrth York, a Rhode Island Democrat who lost three gubernatorial races, lamented, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re as progressive a state as we think we are or are portrayed.\u201dLynn Yeakel, who ran for both Senate and governor in Pennsylvania during the 1990s, spoke of an enduring \u201cdouble standard\u201d and recalled that as recently as 20 years ago some of her female supporters, nicknamed \u201cThe Babushka Set,\u201d had to hide her campaign materials from their husbands.Even women who did break the gender barrier by winning the governor\u2019s race faced gender-tinged criticism. Ms. Buono recalled that when she was in the New Jersey Assembly and Gov. Christie Todd Whitman, a Republican, was in office, some legislators would refer to Ms. Whitman\u2019s administration as \u201cthe estrogen palace\u201d or \u201cthe broads down the hall.\u201dThere is one notable exception in this region\u2019s history: The first woman elected governor who had not been a wife or widow of a governor hailed from the industrial Northeast \u2014 Ella Grasso, a Connecticut Democrat who won the governorship in 1974. Ms. Grasso, a Mount Holyoke graduate who could \u201ccurse a blue streak,\u201d as one associate recalled, succeeded in a machine-dominated state because she forced her way into the club, serving in state politics and Congress for 22 years before being elected governor.\u201cElla was one of the boys because she had lived for two decades in the back room,\u201d recalled Bill Curry, a state senator when she was governor. \u201cIf she pulled up a chair to an all-male poker game, nobody would dare not deal her in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still Feeding the Herd", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDining Review | ConnecticutThe long, hard winter at last recedes, the heart springs up, and the mouth hungers for the foods of summer. Burger, anyone? With longhorn skulls mounted on posts, lamps hewed from logs and a big Wilson\u2019s meat chart identifying the relevant cuts, Max sets you down in a carnivorous, frontierlike world. Framed photos of bovines decorate your booth, putting eater and eaten eye to eye. By 5:30 p.m. on a weekend the place is mobbed, the beleaguered hostess herding guests into the crammed corral of the bar. The volume at Max boggles the mind; well over a thousand meals are served on a busy Saturday.And it\u2019s easy to see why: Everything is really, really good. Much lighter was a timbale of fresh chopped yellowfin tuna, incorrectly billed as spicy but nice nonetheless, mixed with diced tomatoes and topped with an enticing cilantro crema. Texas chili, built around an intense chili paste, was appropriately beefy, with a few black beans sprinkled in to irk the purist. Chicken wings, blackened and smoky, came slathered in a sweet, thick chipotle-honey sauce. Candied bacon lollipops \u2014 an idea born from Mr. Sudol\u2019s fond description of bacon as \u201cmeat candy\u201d \u2014 propped chunks of thick-cut applewood-smoked bacon on skewers radiating like antennas from a halved Granny Smith apple pooled in a sweet cider reduction. Max\u2019s burgers approach the Platonic ideal of what a deluxe hamburger should be. Made with certified-humane Black Angus beef, they\u2019re not grilled but griddled, which Mr. Sudol believes locks in juices and flavor better than an open flame. Great care is taken to cook to order, so there\u2019s a noticeable difference between, say, medium-rare and medium. The aptly named burgers include the Miss Daisy, served with old-fashioned primness on a butter-grilled slice of country white bread, with Brie cheese infiltrating each glossy bite. The showy and indecently rich Fatty Melt encloses a burger between two butter-soaked grilled cheese sandwiches, with bacon added for good measure. An Inside Out burger, cooked medium, draws on the sweet, pungent power of the Gorgonzola stuffed inside. A Kobe Fun Guy burger uses a truffled mushroom spread to augment the beef\u2019s royal lineage, though Max\u2019s basic beef is so tasty, you won\u2019t need the upgrade. Even the pseudo-burger alternatives to beef are excellent and cleverly designed. A shrimp burger, for instance, is held together not with mayo and breading, but with a shrimp mousse, so that nothing adulterates the seafood. Max pays attention to the little things, like hand-cutting all fries, or serving homemade pickles, or press-frying bacon to sleekly fit your sandwich. There\u2019s the squiggle of chive oil laid atop sweet, thick tomato soup, or the scent of truffle oil gracing a dish of tater tots. Onion strings advertised as \u201ccrispy\u201d are in fact crispy, and the spreads and dipping sauces complementing the burgers \u2014 apple-honey Dijon, au poivre, rosemary aioli \u2014 lend just the right pizazz.

Is Counting on the Past", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALEXANDRA, South Africa \u2014 In this poor black township on the outskirts of Johannesburg, the campaign posters exhorting voters to return the African National Congress to power in Wednesday\u2019s election reached deep into the party\u2019s glorious past.\u201cDo it for Madiba,\u201d said one poster, referring to Nelson Mandela, South Africa\u2019s first black president, by his clan name.\u201cDo it for Chris Hani,\u201d another poster declared, referring to the firebrand A.N.C. leader assassinated in 1993.The posters, put up by the South African Communist Party, the A.N.C.\u2019s partner in government since the end of white rule in 1994, avoided mentioning the country\u2019s current president, Jacob Zuma, who is beset by scandal. But the misdirection was not fooling Nomakwezi Buya.\u201cThey are just abusing the names of Mandela and Chris Hani because they are dead people,\u201d said Ms. Buya, 59, who is a former A.N.C. loyalist who says she will vote for a breakaway party this time. \u201cThey are not keeping their legacy alive.\u201dFive months after the death of Mr. Mandela, the party is counting on its dead heroes to keep its current, sullied leadership in power. It is likely to work: The A.N.C. is poised to win overwhelmingly in this nation\u2019s fifth democratic election, granting a second term to Mr. Zuma, 72, whose popularity was further eroded by a recent report detailing the misuse of $23 million in public funds to upgrade his private home.But a projected decline in support is expected to chip away at what has effectively been a one-party state since the end of apartheid 20 years ago. By how much remains the key question.In recent months, young men have looted shops, burned tires and hurled rocks in townships surrounding Johannesburg and Pretoria, in what are called \u201cservice delivery protests\u201d aimed at the A.N.C. Their message \u2014 that the party that freed South Africa is now led by a corrupt class that has failed to raise the standard of living of the average black South African \u2014 resonates here in this traditional A.N.C. stronghold.Still, the absence of a clear alternative for the black majority, as well as older black voters\u2019 enduring loyalty to the figures who liberated them, has given the A.N.C. an insurmountable lead in the polls.\u201cThe people that go to vote are our grannies, our parents, because they came with the A.N.C. from far,\u201d said Tshidiso Nonyane, 25, who voted for the party in the past but has not registered for this election. \u201cThe A.N.C. is going to win because of those people. If there was another party that would truly bring jobs, better housing and stuff like that, that would be better.\u201dA college graduate with a degree in marketing, he is now working at a McDonald\u2019s.\u201cThe youth is not voting because there\u2019s no point in voting,\u201d he said. \u201cEven on that day, we won\u2019t even be watching the news to check who is winning or what because we know the A.N.C. is going to win. So the A.N.C. is only winning for the wrong reasons.\u201d\u201cFor the first time, the A.N.C. is not taking electoral victory for granted,\u201d said Steven Friedman, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. \u201cEven if the competition is being hyped up, the A.N.C. is taking it seriously, and that is politically significant.\u201dAs an example, Mr. Friedman said, the party had directed its lawmakers to pass only legislation popular among voters in the run-up to the election \u2014 the first time it had bothered to do so.Here in Alexandra, Ms. Buya was planning to vote for the Congress of the People, a party started by dissident A.N.C. members in 2008. Asked why, she waved her arms inside her small shack where she lives with her two daughters and two grandchildren under a thin roof made of corrugated metal.\u201cWe still live here after 20 years,\u201d she said.The government gives her grandchildren a total of $105 a month in grants, enough for the family to survive. But Ms. Buya focused on the public housing that she and other dwellers of Alexandra\u2019s poorer corners have yet to receive.The Workers and Socialist Party, started last year by onetime A.N.C. allies, has been making inroads here among the young with its message of nationalizing the economy. One of its leaders, Mzonke Mayekiso, 44, who was imprisoned for smuggling arms into Alexandra for the A.N.C. in the early 1990s, said the decision to splinter from the A.N.C. had been wrenching.\u201cI grew up in the A.N.C., I went to jail for my activities in the A.N.C., and I decided to leave my history with the A.N.C. to start a new chapter,\u201d he said.Under the A.N.C., the lives of tens of millions of black South Africans have improved with access to better education and health care, electricity and water, and even free housing. But there is growing frustration that the improvements appear to have stalled for average black South Africans, and that inequality is growing in an increasingly corrupt society that rewards those with ties to political power.Mr. Nonyane, the McDonald\u2019s worker, and a jobless friend, Lesego Masike, 26, had both won scholarships to college. They had graduated with degrees but could only get jobs at the local mall paying about $200 a month. The few classmates who had gone on to good jobs invariably had political connections, they said.They were milling outside Mr. Masike\u2019s modest government-issued house, where he has lived since 2003 with his mother and sister. The family did not have the means to \u201cextend\u201d their house with an extra room or two, a common practice here.A couple of blocks away, a house that had been extended to two floors towered over its neighbors. The house belonged to a \u201ctenderpreneur,\u201d a politically connected businessman who wins government tenders, or contracts, for construction projects, neighbors said.Mr. Masike voted twice for the A.N.C. but had not registered this time. He avoided talking politics with his family, adding, \u201cIf I tell my granny that the A.N.C. is corrupt, she gets very angry.\u201dLate in the afternoon, his mother, Martha Maseko, 49, came home from her job at a supermarket. \u201cAfter 27 years, I\u2019m earning less than 10,000\u201d rand, or $950, a month, she said.She was more fortunate, she said, than Alexandra\u2019s shack-dwellers, some of whom still rely on toilets that empty into buckets. But she was frustrated and was planning to vote for a party other than the A.N.C. for the first time. \u201cThe A.N.C. is failing us because they\u2019re eating our money,\u201d she said in her living room.Her mother, Ruth Maseko, 73, sat listening, adding softly, \u201cI\u2019ll decide next Wednesday.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scottish Independence Vote Could Set Off E.U. Exodus", "Date": "2014-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyIf the Scots vote to leave Britain in September, that could set off a chain reaction that leads to the rest of Britain\u2019s quitting the European Union. This is a threat British pro-Europeans need to take seriously, given that a vote in favor of Scottish independence is quite possible, though the chances are still less than 50 percent.Were it not for the Scotland factor, the risk of Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union would be receding. A string of business leaders have in recent months argued that the economy would be damaged if Britain lost full access to the European Union\u2019s single market. All of the opinion polls by YouGov since March have shown a lead, varying between two and six percentage points, for Britain\u2019s staying in the European Union. In the previous year, YouGov\u2019s polls were consistently in favor of pulling out, with one showing a lead of 17 points for the \u201cout\u201d campaign. This shift has happened even though the United Kingdom Independence Party, which wants to pull out of the European Union, is expected to get the most votes in this month\u2019s European Parliament elections. The party\u2019s rise, on the formidable debating skills of its leader, Nigel Farage, seems driven more by disaffection with London politics and immigration than a strong desire to quit the European Union.But a vote for Scottish independence would change all that. And here the polls are moving in the opposite direction. Until a year ago, Scotland\u2019s quitting Britain seemed a remote possibility. But in one ICM poll last month, 42 percent of those quizzed said they wanted to stay in Britain, versus 39 percent who wanted to quit. Alex Salmond, the Scottish nationalist leader, is running an effective populist campaign. The odds from the betting house William Hill currently imply a 30 percent chance of Scotland\u2019s exit from Britain. Its departure would increase the chances of a British exit for four reasons.First, the Scots are more pro-European Union than other Britons. If there is a referendum on Britain\u2019s European Union membership in 2017, as Prime Minister David Cameron has promised, the Scots wouldn\u2019t vote, and it would therefore be a little harder to persuade the rest of Britain to stay in. The absence of Scotland might deprive the \u201cin\u201d campaign of two or three percentage points of net pro-European Union votes. That could be decisive in a tight race.Second, if Scotland leaves, the chances that Britain will hold a referendum will shoot up because it will be more likely that there will be a Conservative government in 2017. At present, the Labour opposition has 41 members of Parliament from Scotland, while the Tories have only one. Britain has 650 members of Parliament in total. If the Scottish M.P.\u2019s were excluded, it would be harder for Labour (which has pretty much said it won\u2019t call a European Union referendum) to run the country.This doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Cameron would necessarily win the next general election, in May 2015, because the Scots would still get to vote in that election, even if they backed independence this September. It would take at least until March 2016 for Scottish independence to become effective. So Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, might well become prime minister in 2015.The snag is that, once Scottish independence became effective, Scotland would lose its M.P.\u2019s in Britain and Mr. Miliband, if he were prime minister, would probably lose his majority. Either there would then be a new general election, which Mr. Miliband would probably lose, or Mr. Miliband would immediately be replaced by a Conservative prime minister, who would then call a referendum on European Union membership.That new Conservative prime minister, mind you, almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be Mr. Cameron. If he had lost both Scotland and a general election in quick succession, he couldn\u2019t stay as leader. In fact, he might even be kicked out before next year\u2019s general election, such would be the blow to national pride.The possibility that a vote for Scotland\u2019s exit could lead to a new Conservative leader is the third reason why it would increase the chances of a British exit. Mr. Cameron is a lukewarm pro-European. He would probably be replaced by a more euro-skeptic leader who might actively campaign to pull Britain out of the European Union.The final reason why Scotland\u2019s leaving might lead to a British exit is linked to Mr. Cameron\u2019s strategy of renegotiating Britain\u2019s relationship with the European Union before holding an in/out referendum. He hopes to use the concessions he has won as a strong reason for voting to stay in. The problem is that if Scotland votes for independence, there will then be a messy negotiation of the terms of its departure from Britain. Brussels would also need to negotiate the terms of Scotland\u2019s admission to the European Union.Would both London and Brussels be able to focus on renegotiating their own relationship when they are tied up bargaining with Edinburgh? There has to be a risk that they wouldn\u2019t, and that therefore, Mr. Cameron\u2019s strategy of going to the electorate with a new deal on Europe in 2017 would be in tatters. That, in turn, would make it harder for the \u201cin\u201d campaign to win a referendum.In other words, Mr. Salmond may be as big a risk to Britain\u2019s European Union membership as Mr. Farage.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Pickup Buyers Opt for V6s", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMotoringIt\u2019s much too soon for a retirement party, but the V8 engine seems to be losing its clout with buyers of full-size pickup trucks. For the first time in about 50 years, many big-truck customers no longer consider a 6-cylinder engine to be a downgrade. \u201cThe V6s today are V6s in name only,\u201d said Doug Scott, truck group marketing manager at Ford Motor. \u201cThe technology that we have been able to apply has really resulted in much better power output, while at the same time achieving much better fuel economy.\u201d By Ford\u2019s estimates, roughly 57 percent of F-150 pickups are now shipped with V6 engines. The 3.5-liter twin-turbocharged EcoBoost V6, developing a V8-like 365 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque, is now the model\u2019s most popular engine with a so-called \u201ctake rate\u201d of 47 percent. An entry-level, naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V6, which puts out 302 horsepower and 278 pound-feet, accounts for the balance of Ford\u2019s small-engine mix today, or 10 percent of sales. Just last year, Ford\u2019s 5-liter V8 was the most popular engine in the F-150, accounting for more than 50 percent of sales. But in the fall, Ford increased EcoBoost production. By December, the V8 was taking a backseat to the boosted V6. \u201cIn just over three years, we have been able to sell over 500,000 EcoBoost-equipped F-150s,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cThe engine has gotten more popular, and we have been in a better position to meet that demand.\u201d Ford expects the 6-cylinder renaissance to continue. Later this year, the company will drop the 6.2-liter V8 it has been offering, leaving the 5-liter as the only V8 offered in the 2015 F-150, while adding a 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6, whose power ratings have not been announced.The current 3.5-liter turbo is rated at 16 miles per gallon in the city and 22 on the highway. The naturally aspirated 3.7-liter V6, rated at 23 m.p.g. on the highway, will shrink to 3.5 liters, a downsizing made possible because the new aluminum-body truck will weigh less.Ford expects its line of three V6s to account for more than 70 percent of all F-150 sales. Mileage numbers for the 2015 F-150 are still hush-hush, but Ford promises to up the ante. \u201cThis is going to be the most fuel-efficient F-150 ever,\u201d Mr. Scott said. The main competitors, from General Motors and Ram, aren\u2019t standing still, however. G.M.\u2019s 4.3-liter V-6, delivering 285 horsepower and 305 pound-feet of torque, accounts for 20 percent of its half-ton pickup sales, up from 5 percent last year, while achieving up to 24 m.p.g. on the highway. \u201cThere really is no downside to the V6, unless you are towing a really heavy trailer,\u201d a Chevy spokesman, Tom Wilkinson, said. G.M.\u2019s new 4.3-liter V6 has direct injection, variable valve timing and cylinder-deactivation technology that automatically shuts down two cylinders in cruising mode to save fuel. Not to be outdone, Ram expects that its V6 lineup \u2014 consisting of a 3.6-liter V6, with 305 horsepower and 269 pound-feet of torque, and a 3-liter turbocharged EcoDiesel \u2014 may together account for close to 30 percent of its full-size pickup mix by the end of the year. Bob Hegbloom, brand director for Ram, compared the first Ram pickup with a Cummins diesel engine, in 1989, with Chrysler\u2019s current 3-liter EcoDiesel. The Cummins engine made 160 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque, whereas the new V6 \u2014 which is half the size \u2014 produces 240 horses and 420 pound-feet. \u201cTechnology has caught up,\u201d he said.Ram holds bragging rights for class-leading fuel economy, with its EcoDiesel rated at 28 m.p.g. on the highway. Its most fuel-efficient conventional truck, the 2014 Ram 1500 HFE, also leads the gasoline class. Equipped with the 3.6-liter V6 and an optional engine stop-start system, and mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission, it is rated at 18 m.p.g. in town and 25 m.p.g. on the highway. Aside from engines, truck makers are considering higher-geared transmissions and even smaller engines to reach the 30 m.p.g. mark and beyond. Ford and G.M., which offer only 6-speed transmissions today, are in a partnership to develop 9- and 10-speed automatics, and experts say that 4-cylinder engines are not off the table for half-ton trucks. \u201cThere is a scenario under which you might have a large, turbocharged 4 that could run in the lightest-capacity version of these trucks,\u201d said John Voelcker, editor of Green Car Reports. \u201cOnce the market is 80 percent V6s, then they might look at it.\u201dLater this year, G.M. is reintroducing midsize Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon trucks that feature 2.5-liter in-line 4-cylinders. Still, the lazy V8 leads the pack among heavy haulers. As such, Ford is aiming EcoBoost at owners who tow trailers, boats or campers only occasionally.\u201cIf you are a frequent tower, it may be that for you the 5-liter is a better choice,\u201d Mr. Scott said. Driving style can take a significant bite out of fuel economy, Mr. Voelcker echoed. \u201cIf you baby a turbo, you can get great mileage,\u201d he said. \u201cBut most people don\u2019t drive turbos that way.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Indicates He\u2019ll Respect Result of Ukrainian Election", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byST. PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 Addressing an economic forum haunted by the prospect of more sanctions against Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday gave his clearest indication yet that he would work with the winner of this weekend\u2019s presidential election in Ukraine.Mr. Putin repeatedly said he hoped that the conflict in Ukraine would calm, that Russia would continue to play a significant part in the affairs of its \u201csister nation,\u201d and that it would support a negotiated settlement.Mr. Putin stopped short of saying he would recognize the vote as legitimate, and reiterated his assertion that the government in the capital, Kiev, which is organizing the vote, had usurped the power of President Victor F. Yanukovych in a coup. The election will not represent a \u201cgeneral national mandate,\u201d he said.But Russia will \u201crespect the choice of the Ukrainian people,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cWe understand and see that people in Ukraine want to get out of this situation.\u201d On the direct question of whether Russia will accept the outcome, Mr. Putin said, \u201cWe will watch what will happen.\u201dMr. Putin spoke at a business forum where Russian officials traditionally woo foreign investment, and where corporate and finance officials conceded that the Russian economy was stalling from the uncertainty created by American and European Union sanctions.Mr. Putin used the platform to highlight the Russian view of the unfolding crisis. When the European Union proposed an association agreement with Ukraine that was to have been signed last November, Mr. Putin said the Russians were told that it was \u201cnone of our business.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to offend anyone, but I haven\u2019t seen such a snobbish attitude in years,\u201d he said, reaping laughter and applause from his audience each time he mocked the United States or demanded that Ukraine pay Russia the roughly $3.5 billion he said the country owes Russia for natural gas. \u201cWhere\u2019s our money?\u201d he asked at one point.During the speech and subsequent questions, lasting about an hour and a half, Mr. Putin veered between conciliatory remarks and repetition of the more virulent charges against Ukraine, the United States and the European Union that are common in the Russian news media.In the question-and-answer period, Mr. Putin brushed aside a question about American accusations that he had dissembled about Ukraine, a reference to the masked \u201cgreen men\u201d in Crimea who Russia initially denied were Russian soldiers.If President Obama wants to be a judge of others, he should work in a court, Mr. Putin said.Mr. Putin noted that Russia had not interrupted the delivery of United States military cargo shipped overland and by air across Russia to troops in Afghanistan, that Russia and the United States still shared intelligence on terrorism, and that just this week he had relayed to the Iranian leadership American concerns about that country\u2019s nuclear program.In the speech, his main economic policy address of the year, Mr. Putin formulated a strategy to pull the country out of near recession by prioritizing trade with China and encouraging Russian companies to produce substitutes for imported goods, a well-worn idea in Russian policy. A plan to finance companies cut off from Western banks using state-backed funds showed that Mr. Putin had come down on the side of an isolationist strain in Russian economic policy thinking. Cities and regions will be encouraged to buy domestically made goods, he said.On the stage with Mr. Putin were representatives of emerging markets: a Chinese vice president and an Arab and an Indian investor.Trying to speak over the heads of Western government officials directly to multinational corporations, Mr. Putin told the assembled businessmen that he respected their role as investors in Russia, and said they were welcome, in spite of tensions.Total, a French oil company, signed a deal to explore for shale oil in the Bazhenov deposit in Siberia. Offering more details on a major gas deal with China announced the day before, Gazprom said it would receive an advance payment of $25 billion from the China National Petroleum Corporation, which will help offset capital flight.The credit card companies Visa and MasterCard, which seemed at risk of being banished from Russia after they were forced to comply with United States sanctions and cut off customers at targeted banks, reached an agreement with Russian officials on Friday to remain and work under a new law governing electronic payments.Because of a translation error, an earlier version of this article misstated the title of the Chinese official who appeared on stage with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. He is a vice president, not a deputy prime minister.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Chief to Meet With Hollande on Alstom Deal", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 General Electric and Siemens are going all out this week to woo France as they compete to acquire the energy business of Alstom, the struggling French conglomerate that makes high-speed TGV trains.Top executives of the American and German companies are set to appear Tuesday afternoon before the Economic Affairs Committee in the lower house of the French Parliament, where they will seek to win skeptical legislators over to the benefits of their respective offers.And on Wednesday, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande will meet for a second time with Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, giving him another chance to soothe French worries about the company\u2019s friendly $13.5 billion bid for Alstom\u2019s energy business, which ranks among the world leaders in power generation and transmission equipment.Mr. Hollande\u2019s government was caught off guard in April by the news that G.E. was making a play for Alstom \u2014 and that the offer had the unanimous support of the French company\u2019s board. While Alstom is in no immediate danger, the board and Martin Bouygues, whose family company is the largest shareholder, had decided that it needed a bigger partner to compete internationally.Mr. Hollande and his economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, responded by excoriating Alstom\u2019s management and encouraging a more complex proposal from Siemens to combine the power and transport businesses of the French and German companies into separate European champions.With widespread discontent about the anemic economy, Mr. Hollande\u2019s support is at the lowest levels ever recorded in French opinion polls. To make matters worse, his Socialist Party suffered a stinging defeat on Sunday in European parliamentary elections to the anti-Europe, anti-globalization National Front, so he might find it challenging to sell the French public on a takeover of one of the country\u2019s industrial crown jewels.G.E., for its part, has sought to show that it is a model corporate citizen, reminding officials and the public that it has been active in France for decades. Last week, at the government\u2019s request, it announced that it was extending its offer period for Alstom by three weeks into June.That delay gives Siemens more time to study the French company\u2019s books as it considers whether to make a formal offer. The Siemens chief executive, Joe Kaeser, is trying to convince skeptical analysts that an Alstom deal makes sense. He will have a chance to make the case on Thursday, when he addresses an investment conference in New York.The extension of the G.E. offer also gives Mr. Montebourg more time to think about an alternative to both foreign companies.\u201cPlan A is G.E., Plan B is Siemens, Plan C is a home-based solution,\u201d Mr. Montebourg told Reuters last week, adding that any such third option could include investments from either the private sector or the state.Deirdre Latour, a G.E. spokeswoman, declined to comment, as did Alexander Becker, a spokesman for Siemens. Mr. Montebourg\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Follow the Money, China-Style", "Date": "2014-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Since China introduced a floating exchange rate on July 21, 2005, the Chinese yuan has consistently risen in value against the United States dollar, from a low of 8.28 yuan to the dollar in July 2005 to a high of 6.06 in January of this year. But the appreciation of the yuan has failed to convince ordinary Chinese people that their money buys more; on the contrary, they feel it\u2019s worth less.For the last nine years, while the yuan has appreciated in relation to other currencies, it has steadily lost value at home. Many attribute this to excess printing of currency by the central bank. The excess of China\u2019s money supply (known as \u201cM2\u201d) at the end of 2013 totaled 110.65 trillion yuan ($17.77 trillion), four times greater than the figure 10 years earlier, when it stood at 22.1 trillion yuan ($3.55 trillion, at today\u2019s rate). The basic tenets of monetary policy say that for every 1 yuan rise in the value of the economy, the central bank should add 1 yuan in currency. Any supply of currency above that rate is excess. Today, the value of Chinese currency in circulation compared with gross domestic product is at a ratio close to 2:1 (in 2013, China\u2019s G.D.P. amounted to 56.88 trillion yuan, or $9.31 trillion). Because China\u2019s economic growth relies chiefly on investment, it requires major injections of capital. As the government economist Wu Xiaoling put it, \u201cIn the past 30 years, we have used excessive money supply to rapidly advance our economy.\u201d In most economies, that would lead to rampant inflation, but if we look at the rise in China\u2019s Consumer Price Index over the last two years, it\u2019s usually been in the range of 2 to 3 percent, and only occasionally above 3 percent. During the last decade, there have been only two occasions when prices rose sharply: in 2008, when the increase topped 8 percent, and in 2011, when it peaked at about 6 percent. Why has large-scale monetary inflation failed to trigger price inflation?From official quarters, we hear denials that China\u2019s money supply is inflationary. Sheng Songcheng, the head of the central bank\u2019s statistics and analysis department, said in January that the money supply was large because the savings rate and the ratio of indirect financial investment (that is, funding in the form of bank loans) were high. China has one of the highest household savings rates in the world, surging recently to 50 percent of disposable income (although it is only a minority of households driving the trend). Economists differ as to what this all means, but one professor of literature has coined a term for it: \u201cthe economics of corrupt officialdom.\u201d Corrupt officials, he argues, have a lot to do with the absence of price inflation.Corrupt officials generally do not spend the huge sums they acquire from kickbacks, and are loath to deposit their money in banks for fear it will be discovered. So they hide their money instead. The professor estimates that as much as 50 percent of the surplus money supply may have been taken out of circulation for this reason. China\u2019s Internet commentators have seized on this phenomenon, hailing dishonest officials\u2019 creative ways of hiding money as performance art.For example, Xie Mingzhong, a former Communist Party secretary of Wenchang in Hainan Province, was dismissed after he allegedly concealed more than 25 million yuan in safe deposit boxes.Yan Dabin, the former chief of the state communications bureau in Wushan County, Chongqing, hid cardboard boxes containing 9.39 million yuan in the bathroom of his new apartment, where they were discovered after a water leak.Xu Qiyao, a former chief of the construction department of Jiangsu Province, accepted some 20 million yuan in bribes. Parts of that sum were wrapped in layers of plastic and hidden in a hollow tree trunk, beneath an ash heap, in a rice field and inside a latrine.Li Guowei, the former chief of the highway bureau in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, buried a box stuffed with 2.8 million yuan in a garbage heap next to a brother\u2019s house. \u201cI was an unlucky dog when I got picked out,\u201d he said.Luo Yaoxing, the former chief of the immunization planning office of the disease control center of Guangdong Province, rented a luxury apartment to store his booty. He wrapped the notes tightly inside black plastic bags. Despite protecting his stash with waterproof paper and drying agents, 1.2 million yuan still got moldy.The list goes on. Despite a wave of prosecutions over the past decade, there is little reason to believe that much has changed. In December, a former deputy director of the Hohhot Railway Bureau in Inner Mongolia, Ma Junfei, was given a suspended death sentence for accepting bribes and concealing the sources of his immense fortune. His annual salary would have been only about 120,000 yuan ($19,300), but his two houses were stuffed with cash and gold with a value of more than 130 million yuan ($21.48 million). During his trial, Ma Junfei admitted that concealing the money he had received in bribes was a colossal headache.The professor\u2019s estimate that half of the money supply surplus has been salted away by corrupt officials is a calculation based more on poetic license than empirical evidence, but I have no doubt that the total of stolen cash is big enough to play a role in curbing price inflation at a time of monetary expansion. Like most Chinese, I am sure that those officials who have been brought to justice represent the tip of an iceberg of kickbacks and bribes.Of course, \u201cthe economics of corrupt officialdom\u201d can\u2019t stop prices from rising. That is one change ordinary Chinese have become very conscious of in recent years: Everything is getting more expensive \u2014 only the money gets cheaper.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Trade Figures Return to Slight Growth", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s exports and imports returned to slight growth last month as orders to the United States and the European Union surged, offering some positive signals after a weaker-than-expected start to 2014.Analysts said the trade picture was better in April than the data released on Thursday suggested, because export figures last year had been inflated by fake invoices before a midyear crackdown by the authorities.Exports rose 0.9 percent in April, from a year earlier, after declines of 6.6 percent in March and 18.1 percent in February, the General Administration of Customs said.Imports grew 0.8 percent from a year earlier, after an 11.3 percent fall in March, to produce a trade surplus of $18.5 billion, more than double the $7.7 billion surplus in March.Export growth was largely driven by demand from developed economies. Shipments to the United States jumped 12 percent in April from the period a year earlier. That was a sharp increase from a rise of 1.2 percent in March and a drop of 11.3 percent in February.Exports to the European Union surged 15.1 percent last month, compared with 8.8 percent growth in March and a 14.4 percent drop in February.Emerging markets, including those in Southeast Asia, lagged. Exports to countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 3.8 percent, slowing from double-digit growth in previous months, and shipments to Brazil rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier.Some analysts cautioned that the new data did not mean exports were set for a strong recovery, given the weak demand from emerging economies.\u201cTrade is still quite weak,\u201d said Kevin Lai, an economist at Daiwa in Hong Kong.The government has set a target of 7.5 percent growth for exports and imports this year. China missed its targets of 8 percent in 2013 and 10 percent in 2012, and some analysts and officials say they think the goal this year could also be tough to reach.China\u2019s economy, the world\u2019s second-largest, grew at its slowest pace in 18 months in the first quarter, and a Reuters poll shows that analysts expect growth of 7.3 percent in 2014, the weakest in 24 years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Geithner, Staying on Script", "Date": "2014-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThe audience seemed to buy his story: He acknowledged that the 2008 bank rescues he helped engineer were unfair and offensive because they rewarded the very people who had created the disaster, but he defended them as stabilizing the economy and, ultimately, helping all Americans. \u201cWe weren\u2019t perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was messy. We had to learn as we went along.\u201d Mr. Geithner wrote his book, he said, to honor the people who worked with him during the conflagration at both the Federal Reserve and at the Treasury. But he had other goals: to make clear that he felt his course was the right one for the nation, to apologize for not having seen the crisis coming as a financial overseer and, perhaps most important, to convince people that he was not in the pocket of the banks he rescued. The book, which is readable and revealing, achieves some of this. One on one, Mr. Geithner can come across as arrogant; but on these pages he\u2019s self-effacing. He recounts frequent \u201cempathy mistakes\u201d that he made at Treasury, such as interrupting a low-income housing advocate amid her impassioned description of the human toll of the foreclosure crisis. He also acknowledges that he was an inept public speaker, saying his first speech as Treasury secretary was a disaster.\u201cI swayed back and forth, like an unhappy passenger on an unsteady ship,\u201d he writes. \u201cI kept peering around the teleprompter to look directly at the audience, which apparently made me look shifty; one commentator said I looked like a shoplifter.\u201d But his book is less successful in making the case that he cared as much for troubled borrowers as he did for reckless banks. And he fails to answer one of the most crucial questions about the crisis: How did he and his regulatory colleagues at the Fed, with their army of researchers and high-powered economists, miss the immense and obvious buildup of risk in the financial system that led to the crisis?Mr. Geithner insists that everything he did during the crisis was intended to protect the citizenry and not the banks. By saving the nation\u2019s financial system, he argues, he and his colleagues staved off economic Armageddon. Perhaps. But this leaves no room for a middle ground, a series of actions that would have averted catastrophe while awarding Main Street with the same attention and generosity that was heaped on Wall Street. Mr. Geithner repeatedly says his many critics never offered really workable alternatives to resolve the mess. Maybe so, but he gives little indication that he would have been willing to entertain alternatives offered from outside his circle \u2014 another empathy mistake.Mr. Geithner acknowledges missing signs of the coming cataclysm during his tenure as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But he gives himself credit for making speeches in which he warned of potential risks in the system. These speeches had little effect, though, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Consider a March 2007 address that he highlights. \u201cI gave several reasons why everyone involved with subprime mortgages, as well as securities backed by subprime mortgages, ought to be concerned about \u2018what we might call the adverse tail, or the negative extreme,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he writes. Not exactly a 911 call.As for the oversight mistakes that he and his regulatory colleagues made, Mr. Geithner essentially says \u201cWe were human.\u201d But this fails to address head-on the possibility that he was a captured regulator, a man locked into the mind-set of the very bankers he was supposed to oversee. For example, Mr. Geithner writes that in his early days as president of the New York Fed \u2014 he began in 2003 \u2014 he had deep concerns about the sufficiency of bank capital levels. Yet he didn\u2019t require these institutions to fatten their capital cushions before the debacle.\u201cI hadn\u2019t pushed the Federal Reserve in Washington to change the rules to raise regulatory capital requirements,\u201d he writes, \u201cbecause those rules were then mired in protracted international negotiations.\u201d Last week, I asked Sheila C. Bair, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for her recollection of these events. She replied with an email recalling that in 2006, she attended her first Basel Committee meeting, the international negotiations that Mr. Geithner was referring to. While there, she pushed unsuccessfully to raise bank capital levels. Why was she unsuccessful? \u201cI was actively undermined by the Fed, the New York Fed and the comptroller of the currency,\u201d she said. \u201cI later complained to Tim about the way his representative on the Basel Committee had undermined me. He was unapologetic.\u201d (A spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner said that he and Ms. Bair have \u201cdisagreed at times on the optimal design\u201d for bank capital. But the spokeswoman asserted that he \u201cwas never in favor of weaker capital standards.\u201d) His dealings with executives at Citigroup, a bank overseen by the New York Fed, are Exhibit A for regulatory capture. While he notes that the New York Fed banned Citi from making major acquisitions in 2005 after illegal activity was found in its Japan operations, he does not mention that a year later his colleagues lifted the ban, wrongly persuaded that the bank had fixed its internal controls. Mr. Geithner writes repeatedly that Citi\u2019s risks were hidden from its regulators. But did he want to see them? His close associations with Citi officials may have blinded him \u2014 he was on a charity board with Sanford I. Weill, the creator of Citigroup; was an acolyte of Robert E. Rubin, the former vice chairman; and had frequent meetings with the bank\u2019s top officials as the credit storm gathered. Mr. Geithner does do some introspection. \u201cI did not view Wall Street as a cabal of idiots or crooks,\u201d he writes. \u201cMy jobs mostly exposed me to talented senior bankers, and selection bias probably gave me an impression that the U.S. financial sector was more capable and ethical than it really was.\u201d That\u2019s as close as he gets to saying that he was wrong to trust \u2014 not question \u2014 bankers he encountered. A final flaw: In his book, Mr. Geithner boasts that the bailouts he helped design have been profitable to taxpayers. But his calculations do not take into account the cost of capital that the taxpayers extended to the banks. We were the lenders of last resort and should have been paid an enormous premium for the use of our money. We were not. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hardship Makes a New Home in the Suburbs", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCaught in PovertyMORENO VALLEY, Calif. \u2014 The freeway exits around here are dotted with people asking for money, holding cardboard signs to tell their stories. The details vary only slightly and almost invariably include: Laid off. Need food. Young children.Mary Carmen Acosta often passes the silent beggars as she enters parking lots to sell homemade ice pops, known as paletas, in an effort to make enough money to get food for her family of four. On a good day she can make $100, about double what she spends on ingredients. On a really good day, she pockets $120, the extra money offering some assurance that she will be able to pay the $800 monthly rent for her family\u2019s three-bedroom apartment. Sometimes, usually on mornings too cold to sell icy treats, she imagines what it would be like to stand on an exit ramp herself.\u201cEveryone here knows they might have to be like that,\u201d said Ms. Acosta, 40, neatly dressed in slacks and a chiffon blouse, as she waited for help from a local charity in this city an hour\u2019s drive east of Los Angeles. Both she and her husband, Sebastian Plancarte, lost their jobs nearly three years ago. \u201cEach time I see them I thank God for what we do have. We used to have a different kind of life, where we had nice things and did nice things. Now we just worry.\u201dIn no place is that more true than California, synonymous with the suburban good life and long a magnet for restless newcomers with big dreams. When taking into account the cost of living, including housing, child care and medical expenses, California has the highest poverty rate in the nation, according to a measure introduced by the Census Bureau in 2011 that considers both government benefits and living costs in different parts of the country. By that measure, roughly nine million people \u2014 nearly a quarter of the state\u2019s residents \u2014 live in poverty.Not long ago, the Inland Empire, as the sprawling suburban area east of Los Angeles is known, attracted people hoping to live out that good life. Before the recession, it was booming; housing developments were cropping up all the time, quickly followed by big box stores and strip malls to cater to the new residents.The region was \u2014 and still is \u2014 the fastest growing in the state. But the jobs have never really followed the people who come here looking for cheaper housing. The median home value is $325,000 and the median rent is $1,690, according to the real estate database Zillow. That compares with $462,000 and $1,860 in Los Angeles.For many, those costs are still unaffordable. Unemployment in the region hovers around 10 percent and nearly one-fifth of all residents live in poverty, the highest rate among the largest metropolitan areas in the country. By the official federal measure, nearly one-third of all children here are poor. The number of poor in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties nearly doubled over the last decade.Many would-be workers lack office skills or more than a basic education, making minimum-wage jobs the norm for them. Many here are immigrants \u2014 some living in the United State illegally, making them ineligible for most government benefits. But like Ms. Acosta, many others came here legally decades ago and had a strong foothold in the American economy \u2014 a job, a house, cars and regular travel.\u201cThis is where poor people live now, and this is where they are going to live,\u201d said Alan Berube, an author of the Brookings Institution study. \u201cWhen poverty moved out of the inner cities it didn\u2019t just go next door, it went 30 miles away. But at the time those families might not have been poor \u2014 they were just chasing the middle-class dream. Then, boom, that evaporated.\u201dProsperity Slips AwayMost mornings Sebastian Plancarte, 39, puts on a freshly laundered, collared polo shirt, carefully tucked in. He gets his daughter, Camila, dressed for kindergarten and makes sure his son, Sebastian, has his homework ready for middle school. They are out the door by 7:30 a.m. and he is home nearly two hours later, back to wander parking lots selling ice pops before the afternoon pickup routine begins. He is happy to be involved in his children\u2019s lives, but this is hardly the kind of fatherhood he once imagined.For years, the couple thought of themselves as wealthy. They bought a five-bedroom house in a suburb just a few miles east of downtown Los Angeles, where they both worked in the jewelry district \u2014 she inspected diamonds and he designed bracelets and rings. Making $16 an hour, plus commissions, they earned as much as $2,000 a week. They traveled to San Diego and Las Vegas, they bought their two children the toys they asked for. Just more than a decade after they had emigrated from Mexico, they believed their hopes had become a reality.But in 2011, Ms. Acosta was laid off. So was Mr. Plancarte, just a few months later. They soon sold the house for far less than they had paid. They drove east, looking for something they could afford to rent, and landed in Moreno Valley, a city 60 miles inland that has become a common outpost for those priced out of Los Angeles. They live in a sprawling apartment complex designated for low-income families.The paletas have become a centerpiece of their lives. The couple constantly think about the best prices for ingredients and how many pops are in their small freezer; they take orders by phone to deliver to backyard parties. When their son asks to get hamburgers at the local In-N-Out, they have a standard response: \u201cThe mathematics are very simple,\u201d Ms. Acosta said. \u201cIf you want to eat there, we need you to sell $25\u201d of the ice pops.\u201cThe hardest part is the shame,\u201d Mr. Plancarte said, sitting at his kitchen table as his wife and daughter ate mango paletas doused in chamoy, a blood-red sugary hot sauce. \u201cPeople say to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you find a job over there, or at that factory or that place?\u2019 First of all, they aren\u2019t there, I\u2019ve tried. But even if they have a job, it\u2019s going to be paying me $8 an hour. So I\u2019ll spend no time with my family to make less money than I make now selling these.\u201dBy Ms. Acosta\u2019s calculation, the couple earned about $25,000 last year, nearly all of it in cash. And while it is nearly $2,000 above the official poverty line for a family of four nationally, it is hardly enough to meet their basic needs. By the time they pay for rent, gas, phone, electricity and food, they have spent about $2,000 a month, Ms. Acosta said.Her husband is still looking for work; in the winter months they relied mostly on whatever she could make selling cosmetics and costume jewelry door to door. Their lives reflect the contradictions of many living on the edge. They have a 2001 Jeep Cherokee, a small flat-screen television and a few remaining pieces of jewelry. They don\u2019t have health insurance or any savings, and they have not bought new clothes for nearly two years.\u201cMy friends in L.A., the ones who still have money, it\u2019s like they forgot all about us,\u201d she said.The family\u2019s economic descent has proved most difficult for 12-year-old Sebastian, who remembers Christmas trips to Universal Studios and regular mall excursions. Camila, 5, cannot recall anything different from what she has now. Neither child knows that their Christmas gifts came from charity. They are all contributing to the piggy bank in the kitchen; if they can save enough, Ms. Acosta has promised to take them to Disneyland this year. For now, even going to the beach an hour west would cost too much for gas. The local park is hardly a fun outing \u2014 it reminds them of their work selling ice pops most weekends.\u201cWe have to be really good actors,\u201d Ms. Acosta said. \u201cBut after they go to bed, we just sit and worry about how we are going to pay for things we want to give them.\u201dWhen his son asked for pizza recently, Mr. Plancarte took a silver bracelet he had given his wife to a pawnshop, where he was offered a fraction of what he thought it was worth. He accepted, too embarrassed to tell his son they could not have pizza. Ms. Acosta recently went back and saw the bracelet priced at $90 \u2014 more than twice what her husband had received.Traveling More to Make LessSitting inside Catholic Charities offers a glimpse of the constant need: this family needs extra cash to pay the utility bill; this single mother cannot find child care to allow her to work a graveyard shift; that elderly man who came from Mexico has no way to pay for his medication.Imelda Santana, whose desk is just a few feet away from the entrance, is often the first stop for requests. Ms. Santana is empathetic \u2014 just a couple of years ago she needed help after her husband left her and she lost her job as a loan officer amid the housing crisis. After working as a volunteer for months, Ms. Santana was hired to sift through requests to see which families the organization might assist. Even on the best days, she said, there are more demands than they can handle.\u201cWe have people here who used to make donations now knowing what it is to run out of toilet paper in their house and not have the money to buy more,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if they get food stamps, it does not cover toiletries. There\u2019s just never enough.\u201dYadira Rodriguez, 35, has traveled hundreds of miles looking for work in this county, which is roughly the size of New Jersey. When her husband stopped earning enough to pay for monthly expenses for their three young children, she took a job in a factory packing boxes to be shipped to retail stores. But the $8-an-hour job was 30 miles north of her Moreno Valley apartment, taking her more than an hour in traffic, twice that if she needed to take the bus.Since she was classified as a temporary worker, she would leave her home at 4 a.m. only to find out at 6 a.m. that she would not be hired for the day. On days there was work, she would arrive back home 12 hours after she left.\u201cI could not understand how this was worth the money,\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \u201cI would get home and the kids would be tired and cranky and I didn\u2019t have energy for them. How was this going to make my life better?\u201dAfter three months, she quit. Her family relies on $800 a month from the state\u2019s temporary cash assistance program to pay for groceries and utilities, and gets occasional help from charities. The landlord has let the family slide on the rent at times, Ms. Rodriguez said.Like Ms. Rodriguez, many would-be employees see unpredictability as a fact of life. Many social workers see more clients working two part-time minimum wage jobs, juggling schedules to make sure they do not disappoint any boss and hustling to cobble together child care for shifts that can begin or end before dawn. Many are immigrants who speak only basic English after years of living in Latino enclaves, first in Los Angeles, and now here.\u201cThis is the edge of affordability; people came here because they were pushed out to the only place where they could afford,\u201d said John Husing, a local economist who has studied the region for years. \u201cWhen they came here the primary wage earner could find a job to pay the bills. The problem is that time has passed and we don\u2019t have a lot of jobs that allow that anymore.\u201dWhile many of the state\u2019s coastal areas have begun to see signs of an improved economy, the inland region has continued to struggle. Unemployment and foreclosure rates remain stubbornly high here and there are few signs that the area will boom as it did a decade ago. Housing prices have inched up as wages have stagnated, making it even more difficult for families to stay afloat.\u201cWhat we have out here is more need and fewer centers of resources,\u201d said Dom Betro, the executive director of Family Services, a nonprofit group that provides child care and food to needy families in Riverside County. \u201cWe have more working poor than anyone can know how to handle. People travel further distances to work for less pay because they have to. Even if there is help \u2014 and that\u2019s not always \u2014 people who need it can\u2019t get to it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s all these new problems but no new philanthropic dollars there to address them,\u201d said Mr. Berube, from the Brookings Institution. \u201cIn many places there are these de facto systems in place but not the kind of leadership to really address what\u2019s needed.\u201dWhen Larry Ellwell became principal of Victoria Elementary School in San Bernardino a few years ago, he was stunned by the number of families who could not afford necessities like clothes and dental care. When he worked with poor students closer to Los Angeles, he said, they knew where to find aid. But in the Redlands school district, home to a university and well-appointed mansions, there were few free clinics or other outlets for assistance. So he began to offer them \u2014 now the school hosts a roving clinic staffed by medical students and a clothing giveaway known as Victoria\u2019s Closet.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of triage work \u2014 who needs something the most and what do they most need,\u201d Mr. Elwell said. \u201cThere\u2019s no stigma anymore, because so many people are just trying to scrape by and make it work.\u201dFor Ms. Acosta, scraping by recently took a new turn: She moved to the other side of the desk at Catholic Charities, taking a job as an intake worker. She works about 30 hours a week at $12 an hour, giving people the same kind of help she seeks. Even now, she is not earning enough to stop selling ice pops.Just a couple of years ago, when the dry cleaner called reminding her to pick up a pair of pants, Ms. Acosta told him to give them to charity. \u201cNow I am one of the people taking giveaways,\u201d she said. \u201cI see people all the time in worse positions than we are in.

{"Headline": "Shares Fall After Mixed Economic News", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors retreated from stocks on Thursday, giving the Dow Jones industrial average its worst day in five weeks, after disappointing earnings from Walmart Stores and mixed news about the global economy were reported.Financial markets reflected broader investor jitters: Bond prices rose, small-company stocks fell anew, and safe, slower-growth industries fared best.The latest economic data from the United States was mixed: Factory output fell. But fewer people sought unemployment benefits. The news was more disappointing in Europe, where output in the 18 countries that share the euro rose just 0.2 percent in the first quarter.\u201cPeople are just a little bit nervous about the entire global economic environment at the moment,\u201d said Ryan Larson, head of United States equities at the Royal Bank of Canada. The Dow lost 167.16 points, or 1 percent, to close at 16,446.81. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 17.68 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,870.85, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 31.33 points, or 0.8 percent, to 4,069.29. The Dow was dragged down by Walmart, which fell $1.91, or 2.4 percent, to $76.83. The company reported lower earnings for its most recent quarter and warned that the current one was not expected to be much better. Kohl\u2019s shares dropped $1.82, or 3.4 percent, to $52.21 after reporting lower first-quarter earnings. One bright spot was Cisco Systems, the telecommunications equipment maker. Its stock jumped $1.37, or 6 percent, to $24.18. Cisco reported earnings that were better than expected.The broader stock sell-off comes two days after the Dow and S.&P. 500 hit record highs, not adjusted for inflation.The Russell 2000 index, a measure of mostly small-capitalization companies, fell 0.7 percent on Thursday. The index is down 9.3 percent from its March 4 high.The bond market had its best day since early February, when measured by the Barclays United States aggregate bond index, a broad gauge of the entire market.The yield on the Treasury\u2019s 10-year note hit its lowest level in about 10 months, dropping to 2.50 percent, from 2.55 percent late on Wednesday. Its price rose 14/32, to 100 1/32. At the beginning of the week, the 10-year note had a yield of 2.66 percent. That is an extraordinary move for bond yields. Typically, such a movement in the bond market might signal something wrong with the American economy. But recent economic data has been mixed. For example, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell 0.6 percent in April. But a Labor Department report showed that the number of Americans who filed for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-year low.And the Labor Department said consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in nearly a year in April, putting inflation on pace to rise 2 percent this year. Investors do not normally buy bonds at 2.5 percent interest if inflation is running at 2 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s really confusing, to be honest,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. \u201cThe bond market thinks there\u2019s a risk out there that the stock market isn\u2019t seeing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Power of \u2018the Street\u2019", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThe tangled events leading up to World War I are much written about this centennial year, and one striking element is the power of \u201cthe street\u201d to push history in unexpected and sometimes tragic directions when popular passions are either deliberately fired by demagogues or aroused by tribal loyalties, ethnic myths, xenophobia or legitimate frustration.That may be what is happening over Ukraine. The surprising announcement by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, on May 7 that he was pulling Russian armies back from the Ukrainian border and calling on anti-Kiev secessionists to suspend a referendum set for Sunday seemed at first to signal that he was ready to defuse the protracted and increasingly dangerous conflict.But by week\u2019s end NATO said it hadn\u2019t seen any military pullback; more clashes were reported in southeastern Ukraine; and the motley secessionists holed up in government buildings in Donetsk said they were still preparing for a referendum on breaking with Kiev.Protests in ThailandIn Thailand, after months of violent demonstrations, the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra by the Constitutional Court on May 7 posed the question of what to do when different institutions of government become hostage to implacable adversaries.The ostensible reason for deposing Ms. Yingluck, whose Pheu Thai party was elected to office by a landslide in 2011, was that she abused her power when she replaced an official with a family member. The real reason was that Ms. Yingluck is the younger sister of Thaksin Shinawatra, the tycoon who was prime minister until he was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and who still plays an active role in Thai politics from exile in Dubai. It was the third time in recent years the court had removed a prime minister on a dubious pretext.What next? More violent rallies seem inevitable. National elections are tentatively scheduled for July 20, and the Shinawatra clan\u2019s \u201cred-shirt\u201d supporters from the rural heartlands in the north and northeast have a majority of the votes. But the \u201cyellow-shirt\u201d traditional elite of upper- and middle-class Thais from Bangkok and the south, with their supporters in the royal establishment, decry the Shinawatra clan\u2019s populist economic policies and want to install an appointed government that would introduce election \u201creforms,\u201d presumably to prevent another automatic red-shirt victory.King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand\u2019s popular monarch, has intervened in crises past, but he is 86 and ailing. In the absence of any institutional solution, it would seem time for the bitterly opposed sides to start talking.Atrocities in NigeriaPerhaps the most talked about news of the week concerned the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a brutal Islamist sect in Nigeria opposed to their education. The sect, Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as \u201cWestern education is a sin,\u201d threatened to auction off the girls. Many countries offered help in rescuing the girls and a team of United States military officers arrived to assist with communications, logistics and intelligence.That so many teenage girls should be seized from their school simply because they wanted an education was in itself terrible; worse, the girls had been abducted on April 14, and it took Nigeria\u2019s president, Goodluck Jonathan, three weeks to even acknowledge the kidnapping. And when he did, it became evident that he had no idea where the girls were or what to do to save them.Boko Haram, under a demented leader called Abubakar Shekau, has been waging a terror campaign from bases in the largely Muslim and poor northern states of Nigeria since 2009. At least 1,500 people have been killed in the first three months of this year alone in attacks by the cult and in equally vicious, though largely ineffective, reprisals by the government. Boko Haram has not paused in its terror campaign since the abductions \u2014 on Monday, dozens of gunmen chanting \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d descended on the town of Gamboru Ngala in northeastern Nigeria, massacring at least 336 residents and setting hundreds of houses on fire.Celebration in RussiaBack in Ukraine, one of the few things certain in the crisis was that Mr. Putin\u2019s moves were hugely popular in Russia. The president used the Russian Victory Day holiday on May 9 to put his seal on the annexation of Crimea and on the resurgence of Russian power, presiding over a military parade in Red Square, where he proclaimed that the holiday confirmed that \u201cthe invincible power of patriotism triumphs.\u201d Then he defiantly flew to the Crimean naval base at Sevastopol, where he was greeted with loud cheers from Russian sailors.After mass demonstrations against his administration last year and a weakening economy, the Ukrainian crisis has allowed Mr. Putin to achieve extraordinary popularity at home even as he tightens the screws on a fading opposition and erodes his standing in the West.A Pew Research Center survey conducted between April 4 and 20 found that 83 percent of Russians have confidence in the way Mr. Putin is conducting world affairs. At the same time, reflecting the success of Mr. Putin\u2019s relentless campaign to portray the United States as Russia\u2019s enemy No. 1, the poll found that only 23 percent gave America a favorable rating \u2014 the lowest in the 12 years Pew has been polling.In Ukraine, meanwhile, pro-Russian secessionists in the headquarters of the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d marked Victory Day by hanging out a banner with Stalin\u2019s image and the phrase \u201cDeath to fascists.\u201d Their leaders said that despite Mr. Putin\u2019s call to postpone it, they were going ahead with the referendum, which asks one question: \u201cDo you support the creation of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic?\u201d It was unclear who would be voting and from what lists, but a sizable \u201cyes\u201d was all but certain, given that opponents of the armed secessionists were not likely to show up or vote \u201cno.\u201d But what supporting the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic meant would ultimately depend, again, on how Mr. Putin chose to use it.The Obama administration, for its part, said Thursday that it was ready to impose the next set of sanctions if the Kremlin continued to pursue what Washington describes as a campaign to disrupt the Ukrainian presidential election scheduled for May 25. The government said the next wave of sanctions will target Russia\u2019s defense, high tech, engineering and energy sectors.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

{"Headline": "In Tepid Wage Growth, a Potent Sign of a Still-Fragile Economy", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe single best gauge of the economic recovery \u2014 better than the headline unemployment rate \u2014 may be wage growth.So ignore April\u2019s sharp drop in unemployment. Pay no attention to the creation of 288,000 jobs announced on Friday. The most important number in the latest jobs report did not change at all.Average hourly wages for American workers held steady at $24.31 last month. They have increased just 1.9 percent over the previous 12 months. But after adjusting for inflation, real wages have increased by something like 0.5 percent.The two men also argue that the Federal Reserve should focus on wage growth in calibrating its stimulus campaign because wage growth effectively summarizes other measures like unemployment and participation.Mr. Blanchflower found affirmation for this theory in Friday\u2019s jobs report. In the traditional view, the decline of the official unemployment rate should have indicated that the labor market was closer to good health, and it should have put upward pressure on wages. But the unemployment rate fell entirely because people stopped looking for work, not because they found jobs. And wages did not rise by even a penny.\u201cWhat happened today is entirely consistent with what we said would happen,\u201d Mr. Blanchflower said in an interview by telephone on Friday morning. \u201cHourly wages were up two pennies last month, and this month they\u2019re flat, and that tells you there\u2019s too much slack in the labor market. And all the other stuff is just noise.\u201dTheir paper is the latest contribution to a raging debate about labor market slack, a concept that is easy to explain, hard to quantify and very important right now.When only 48 percent of American adults held full-time jobs in April, the important question is what share of the rest were prevented by the weak economy from finding full-time work. Put differently, how much of the damage caused by the Great Recession can still be fixed by the Fed, or by fiscal policies that broadly promote economic growth?The unemployment rate, which counts people actively seeking work, overstates labor market slack during good times, because some people are always between jobs. Even during the halcyon 1990s, the rate bottomed out around 4 percent.Since the recession, however, the unemployment rate has understated slack, because millions of Americans have stopped looking for jobs that do not exist. As the economy improves, it is likely that some of those people will rejoin the hunt.Policy makers including Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, say the unemployment rate remains the best gauge of the labor market. But they acknowledge it has lost some of its value.In March the Fed said it would consider other measures, including wage inflation, in charting its campaign. Ms. Yellen suggested she would like to see wages rising at a \u201cnormal\u201d pace of about 3 or 4 percent a year.Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Posen see an easier answer. Instead of counting heads, policy makers can simply rely on market forces to do the work. Wage inflation, after all, is basically a summary of the balance between supply and demand. Employers raise wages as they find it harder to hire and retain qualified workers, so the market, in effect, is constantly judging the extent of labor market slack.\u201cUnlike unemployment, the rate of wage inflation requires less judgment and is subject to less distortion by such factors as inactivity,\u201d the paper says. \u201cUnemployment, underemployment of part-timers, long-term unemployment and participation rate reveal their nonstructural component by their influence on wage growth. And that is what the Fed should be trying to stabilize along with prices.\u201dThe main objection to this view is not about the accuracy of wage inflation, but about its timeliness. Wages generally are among the last prices to rise during an economic expansion. Prices, in particular, generally rise before wages.To keep price inflation under control, Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, warns that the Fed needs to begin raising interest rates well before wage inflation takes hold. Indeed, he contends the time has already come.\u201cIf you want to hit inflation on the head, you need a Fed Funds rate that is above 4 percent, say 4.25 percent to create any pressure, and it will take you considerable time to get from zero to 4, and in the meantime you could see very substantial inflation,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cYou could say that this is too early and we don\u2019t know quite yet, but I\u2019m saying that if we run a risk, we run a risk of being behind the curve.\u201dWhile Friday\u2019s report showed no sign of wage pressures, Mr. Slok said that some alternative measures of wages had started to show an upward trend. \u201cAbout a year ago or six months ago, there was no sign of wage pressure, but when you look at the data today, some of the measures are starting to point upwards,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it really is the case that there is so much slack, why are any of these indicators going up?\u201dBut the greater concern about inflation, at the moment, is that prices are rising too slowly. The Fed\u2019s favorite inflation index rose just 1.1 percent in the 12 months that ended March 31, the government said on Thursday. That is well below the 2 percent pace the Fed considers healthy.Mr. Blanchflower and Mr. Posen have experience as central bankers \u2014 they served separately in recent years on the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee \u2014 and they argue that the greater risk is in failing to do enough about unemployment, in part because that is also the best way to raise inflation back to a healthier pace.\u201cPulling back too soon is worse than pulling back too late,\u201d Mr. Blanchflower said. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t know what full employment is until we begin to approach it.\u201dThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life at nytimes.com/upshot.

{"Headline": "A Coffee Crop Withers", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN LUCAS TOLIM\u00c1N, Guatemala \u2014 When coffee rust attacked the farms clinging to the volcanic slopes above this Mayan town, the disease was unsparing, reducing mountainside rows of coffee trees to lattices of gray twigs.During last year\u2019s harvest, Rom\u00e1n Lec, who grows coffee on a few acres here, lost half his crop. This year, he borrowed about $2,000 for fertilizer and fungicide to protect the plants, as he did last year. But the disease returned and he lost even more.\u201cThere are nights when you cannot sleep, thinking how to pay back the money,\u201d said Mr. Lec, 65.A plant-choking fungus called coffee rust, or la roya, has swept across Central America, withering trees and slashing production everywhere. As exports have plunged over the last two years, the effects have rippled through the local economies.Big farmers hire fewer workers to pick the ripe coffee cherries that enclose the beans. Smaller farmers go into debt and sell livestock or tools to make up for the lost income. Sales fall at local merchants. Teenagers leave school to work on the farm because their parents can no longer hire outside help. At the very end of the chain are the landless migrant workers who earn just a few dollars a day.\u201cIf you frame this in terms of everyone that is connected to the economics of coffee, it\u2019s a very serious problem,\u201d said Roberto de Michele, a specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank who is based in Guatemala City.The coffee rust has spread far and fast, driven by higher temperatures in the region that have allowed the fungus to thrive at higher altitudes. Many experts say climate change is largely to blame for the shifting weather patterns.The economics of the business have added to the farmers\u2019 plight. After years of low coffee prices, smaller farmers could not afford to replace aging coffee plants, which have proved more vulnerable to the rust\u2019s attack.\u201cThere was nothing to hold it back because the farms were in very poor shape,\u201d said Maja Wallengren, a coffee expert based in Mexico.The trouble here is just one of several factors that are pushing up prices in the global commodity market, increases that may carry over to supermarket shelves and the specialty coffee houses that sell the high-grade arabica coffee for which Central America is known. Market prices have risen 70 to 80 percent since November, driven mostly by drought in Brazil, the world\u2019s largest producer.In Central America, the pain is acute. Four million people there and in southern Mexico rely on coffee for their living, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. Twenty percent of the half-million jobs in Guatemala directly tied to the crop have already disappeared, estimated Nils Leporowski, the president of Anacaf\u00e9, the country\u2019s coffee board.The rust outbreak has pushed many families to the edge of survival.\u201cRoya has exposed the depth of the social and economic problems in terms of people\u2019s vulnerability to the market and to climate change,\u201d said Peter Loach, the Guatemala director of Mercy Corps, an aid agency. \u201cWhat makes it different and complicated is that it\u2019s a slow-onset natural disaster over two to three years.\u201dEven in good years, Jos\u00e9 Obispo Tax Tal\u00e9, 34, had to scrimp to feed his eight children. In the past, his work as a day laborer on coffee farms would give him just enough money to rent land, buy fertilizer and grow corn for food.Since the coffee rust hit, farmers are hiring fewer workers and paying less. So Mr. Tax had to borrow about $1,300 to grow corn. \u201cSometimes, you get desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to work, but there is none.\u201dThis year, the lean season, when food supplies run out for the poorest farmers, started two months early, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, a monitoring service, because of falling coffee earnings and reduced corn yields over the last couple of years. Forecasts of irregular rainfall this summer raise additional concern.\u201cYear after year, these families are confronted by layers of vulnerability,\u201d said Anne Valand of the World Food Programme, who estimated that as many as 300,000 Guatemalans could need emergency food aid later this year. \u201cBit by bit, the layers are becoming thinner.\u201dAs the coffee rust has taken hold, farmers have been spending much of their time and money trying to fight the disease by spraying fungicide, replacing or cutting back old plants, and managing the shade trees that filter sunlight and appear to reduce the spread of the rust.\u201cPeople are scared of the roya,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Leja, who farms about seven acres in plots in San Antonio Palop\u00f3, a nearby municipality. He pruned his trees and sprayed fungicide, but it proved futile. He has lost as much as 60 percent of his production over the last two years.Instead of hiring four workers for the harvest as he usually does, he relied on extra labor from his 18-year-old son, who put off plans to study medicine.The changing fortunes of Guatemala\u2019s small farmers raise the question of whether some of them should continue to grow coffee at all or instead should switch to food crops. Some say they could not make the change even if they wanted to.\u201cBeans and corn don\u2019t grow well here,\u201d Mr. Leja said, pointing at the steep hillside. \u201cThe coffee income is very important. It pays for corn and beans.\u201dThe latest epidemic of coffee rust began in Central America three years ago. It spread rapidly last year, prompting most governments to declare states of emergency. Last year\u2019s harvest fell 15 percent in Guatemala, and neighboring countries had losses as big and even bigger. Export figures suggest that Guatemala\u2019s harvest this year has fallen an additional 10 percent.Nobody has escaped. Guillermo R\u00edos, a midsize producer who grows coffee on 37 acres near the Mexican border in Huehuetenango, said he had sprayed fungicide four times and managed to limit the outbreak to just 10 percent of the plantation.\u201cMy priority is to rescue what I invested,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. But his profit was minimal, and the higher costs have halted his plans to add plants on additional land he owns. He will hire fewer workers than he expected.While rust hit Central America in the 1970s and 1980s, the outbreaks were contained at lower altitudes. This rust outbreak has advanced to the highest altitudes, including the steep slopes here around Lake Atitl\u00e1n. Rising temperatures and extreme weather, like flooding, have encouraged roya\u2019s spread, said Ana R. R\u00edos, a climate change specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank.With the changing conditions, the industry is intensifying efforts to breed varieties that are resistant to rust and heat stress while maintaining their quality. But the research is only beginning, and it may take 25 or 30 years before resistant hybrids reach farmers, said Leonardo Lombardini, the deputy director of World Coffee Research at Texas A&M University.\u201cThe problem is that farmers are struggling and also the climate is changing rapidly,\u201d Mr. Lombardini said. \u201cThe window of climate conditions for arabica is relatively narrow.\u201dResearchers are also growing plants from seeds collected all over the world and sending them to different countries for field trials to see where they thrive. That should give farmers who do not have much money to invest some assurances that when they replace their old trees, the new ones will be productive.In the meantime, the priority is returning the farms to health.Guatemala\u2019s agriculture ministry provided small farmers with fungicide last year, although many complained that it reached them too late or that it was not enough. Others simply sold it. The government has increased the amount of money in a fund to provide low-interest loans to $100 million and extended it to 2026. The fund had only $28 million when the measure was approved last fall.\u201cThe coffee here is positioned for its quality like the wines of France,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Sebasti\u00e1n Marcucci, Guatemala\u2019s vice minister of agriculture. \u201cThe majority of coffee comes from the small producers. I hope that they can be motivated.\u201dWith help from Anacaf\u00e9, the government is showing farmers how to prune and replace their trees. They also plant beans and vegetables between the coffee seedlings to provide food while they wait three years for them to start producing.More and more farmers are listening. Servando Santos, 56, the manager at the San Miguel Integrated Agricultural Cooperative in Tzampetey, said he fought off the rust by spraying fungicide, using fertilizer and controlling the shade over his plants. \u201cYou have to adapt to the roya,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to make friends with it.\u201dMike McDonald contributed reporting from Guatemala City.Advertisement"}

Investors seemed to rally behind a bidding war in the food industry as well as a somewhat positive report on the labor market.The S.& P. 500 climbed 10.25 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,920.03. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 65.56 points, or 0.4 percent, to 16,698.74, while the Nasdaq composite index jumped 22.87 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,247.95.Among the biggest gainers was the deli meat and hot-dog maker Hillshire Brands, whose shares rose $7.94, or 17.7 percent, to $52.76. Only two days after Pilgrim\u2019s Pride made a $6.4 billion offer to buy the company, the chicken company Tyson Foods stepped in to offer $6.8 billion.Investors expect that Tyson\u2019s offer will start a bidding war. Hillshire\u2019s closing price was already above Tyson\u2019s offer of $50 a share. The stock is up 43 percent this week alone. Tyson also rose on the news. The stock gained $2.50, or 6.13 percent, to $43.25, making the company the biggest gainer in the S.& P. 500.The stock market has moved little this year, but one theme that continues to play out is the large number of corporate deals. In addition to the battle over Hillshire, Apple said it would buy Beats Electronics for $3 billion.\u201cIt\u2019s an encouraging sign because companies see the economy improving,\u201d said Joseph Tanious, a global markets strategist with J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \u201cLast thing you want to do as a large company is use your cash to buy a company when you have an uncertain outlook on the economy.\u201dOther food companies also rose after the Hillshire Brands news as traders anticipated more deals and possibly more bidding wars. The jam and jelly maker J.M. Smucker increased $2.38, or 2.37 percent, to $103. Hormel Foods, the maker of Spam, rose $1, or 2 percent, to $48.71.Investors also had a round of mixed economic data to interpret Thursday. The Labor Department said the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dropped last week to 300,000. The less-volatile four-week average fell to 311,500, the lowest since August 2007.Bond prices pulled back slightly, pushing the 10-year Treasury note to a yield of 2.47 percent, from 2.45 percent on Wednesday. The price fell 7/32, to 100 9/32. Yields have been trading at lows not seen in a year, as foreign buyers have jumped into Treasurys. Most investors believe this recent downward movement in bond yields is temporary. The Federal Reserve, the biggest buyer of Treasurys for the last few years, is slowly exiting the market and the economy is improving.\u201cThe 10-year Treasury has everyone scratching their heads,\u201d Mr. Tanious of J.P.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Only a Million", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s sad what a million dollars has fallen to.I have been thinking about this recently, ever since The Times had an article about Jeb Bush\u2019s scramble to make up for the fact that he left the governorship of Florida with a net worth of only $1.3 million.I have to admit, I was surprised Jeb Bush did not have more money than that. He must have felt terrible at family gatherings. When they started planning for Christmas, do you think the other Bushes assured Jeb that they\u2019d be happy with a pot holder or a knitted scarf, just as long as it was handmade? The article, reported by Michael Barbaro, had a happy ending. Bush is now making more than $1 million a year just for giving advice to Barclays bank. Which is hardly his only job. He has a ton of gigs like that. People are lining up to pay vast sums for the man\u2019s opinion.A million dollars used to be a magic number, a sign of permanent affluence. You\u2019d made it! But now it won\u2019t buy you lunch with Warren Buffett (the winning bidder in a charity auction paid $1,000,100) or even, it appears, a public defender. The lawyers for the allegedly indigent former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his father billed the government more than $1 million during their public corruption trial. Senior citizen thug Whitey Bulger\u2019s defense cost taxpayers more than $3 million.Most Americans\u2019 reverence for the million-dollar figure is based on the fact that they do not have a million dollars themselves and are not seeing any signs that Barclays will want to give it to them for a year\u2019s worth of consultation. But there are also a lot of old cultural memories. Back in the 1950s, people were watching Marilyn Monroe in \u201cHow to Marry a Millionaire\u201d and on television, \u201cThe Millionaire.\u201d That was the series about a superrich guy named John Beresford Tipton, who liked to send $1 million to total strangers. Secret gifts that changed their lives, although often not for the better. John Beresford Tipton was a little like the Koch brothers, except his checks were smaller and the recipients were not required to plot against solar energy.\u201cHow to Marry a Millionaire\u201d was the story of three women who were looking for rich consorts who would support them in the style to which they wished to become accustomed. Since it was the \u201950s, the plot held they were looking for \u201chusbands\u201d \u2014 and nobody ever suggested that a million dollars would not be enough to keep a kept girl fed and sheltered.But now we have learned from the ongoing Los Angeles Clippers crisis that owner Donald Sterling spent $1.8 million just to buy his lady friend a duplex. This information is contained in a lawsuit brought against the woman in question, V. Stiviano, by Sterling\u2019s estranged wife. Stiviano\u2019s lawyer has not denied the part about the gifts, although he says there is not a \u201cpeppercorn of a fact\u201d that any fraud was involved.While the world can\u2019t wait for Sterling to vanish from our collective consciousness forever, I wouldn\u2019t mind keeping a \u201cpeppercorn of a fact.\u201d But to get back to politics: A million dollars will get you Jeb Bush\u2019s advice. Also, it will buy a visit from Hillary Clinton. Four, in fact \u2014 she gets around $250,000 per appearance. When someone in the audience threw a shoe at her recently, she was speaking at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries. Hillary dodged the stiletto with quite a bit of dexterity and grace. But you had to ask: Why is this woman giving a paid talk to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries? The Clintons came out of the White House with very little cash, but there\u2019s got to be a point when you stop making up for lost time. It\u2019s not that money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. It\u2019s that these days it requires a whole lot more than a million dollars. More than half of all the members of Congress are now millionaires, but many of them don\u2019t seem to be all that thrilled about their financial condition. \u201cThey feel: \u2018We\u2019re so underpaid,\u2019 \u201d said Fred Wertheimer, the campaign finance reform activist. Once politicians get to Congress, they become acquainted with people who are truly rich. That\u2019s pretty much a necessity because re-election is something else you cannot generally buy for a million dollars. Suddenly, they\u2019re hanging out with folks who have private jets and four houses. Eventually, many lawmakers begin to feel as though they are making an enormous sacrifice by holding public office for $174,000 a year. And then they\u2019re off to a D.C. law firm or lobbying job, which will pay them huge salaries for knowing the people they know. It will never occur to them that if voters had not given them that stint of public service, they would be processing divorce cases back home in East Cupcake. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Energy Incentives", "Date": "2014-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersReaders discuss an editorial criticizing efforts to impose surcharges on solar installations.What was proposed in Arizona and elsewhere is not a tax, but rather a fairer, less socially regressive distribution of network costs. It is also consistent with the long-term viability of cost-effective renewable energy, as well as energy efficiency. Rooftop solar needs the electric grid as much as everyone else, and solar customers should pay a fair share of the cost rather than seeking a subsidy from lower income consumers.Sustainable renewable energy is vital. Inefficient, unfair cross-subsidies endanger the viability of that vital resource. The writer, a former commissioner of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, is executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group at the John F. Kennedy School of Government.To the Editor: President John F. Kennedy in his Inaugural Address in 1961 spoke of \u201ca long twilight struggle\u201d against the \u201ccommon enemies of man.\u201d Those were the dark days of the Cold War, but we now face even darker days as global forces profiting from fossil fuels conspire to restrict the growth of energy sources that would displace that profit.The Koch brothers and their apologists in the coal and petroleum industries can hardly be expected to relinquish their dominance of energy markets without a fight. Those who aspire to sustainable energy sources today have a long twilight struggle of our own. In a world of palpable climate destabilization, civilized society can no longer afford carbon-based energy systems and the fossilized thinking that accompanies it. Further delay of renewable energy development only imperils us further. The writer is a lecturer in the Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook University.To the Editor: Subsidies for solar energy are imperfect and may lead to some uneconomical impacts. Eliminating them would be fine, if we also were to eliminate the subsidies to other energy sources. Fossil fuels are the most subsidized. There are explicit subsidies through royalties and tax preferences. Moreover, there are implicit but real subsidies because we know that future generations will bear substantial costs for environmental damage related to burning coal, gas and petroleum, yet we include nothing in the price of those fuels to reflect that damage.If we were to eliminate the explicit subsidies that underwrite the exploration and production of fossil fuels and impose a meaningful tax on carbon, then the argument of the Koch brothers to eliminate subsidies from solar energy might be worthy of consideration. The writer is a retired executive of Duke Energy.To the Editor: The continuing debate over reform of net metering has little to do with renewable energy itself. Instead, it\u2019s about ensuring the integrity of the electric grid while at the same time providing more transparency for ratepayers.The electric grid is not an amorphous delivery system that can always be expected to reliably carry electricity to customers. Rather, the grid is a complex, tangible network consisting of power generation, transmission and distribution systems that require constant maintenance and expansion. This, of course, comes with a cost. Currently, when customers with solar panels are reimbursed at the full retail rate for the surplus electricity they generate, they in effect avoid having to pay for the grid services they use. These costs are shifted to electricity ratepayers without solar panels.The American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s model policies suggest implementing a modest fixed grid charge or other rate mechanism \u2014 which we don\u2019t consider a \u201ctax\u201d \u2014 that recovers costs from all customers that use and benefit from the grid. The writer is director of the Energy, Environment and Agriculture Task Force of ALEC.To the Editor: Your editorial about attempts by Big Carbon advocates to roll back state renewable energy laws showcases a self-interested campaign to undercut the growing role of renewable energy in our electricity system. While the renewable energy industry has been aggressively responding to and successfully countering these challenges, there is a very different and far more encouraging story unfolding here in the Northeast.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York Public Service Commission recently announced the Reforming Energy Vision initiative, starting a process to develop new policies to modernize our electricity system. This vision, rather than slowing renewables, aims to embrace renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage, a more intelligent and dynamic grid, and new models for utilities and third parties that provide cleaner and cost-effective energy to consumers.The tide is starting to turn from resistance to renewables to a discussion about how to create a cleaner, more reliable electric grid that will strengthen our economy and society.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elections Put Europe\u2019s Centrists on Notice", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorld ViewAfter all, for four years now, unified Europe has been an economic basket case. There were the years of crisis when it looked as if the euro zone could unravel at any moment. Even since that period ended in 2012, the economic results in large areas of the continent have been terrible.What makes the elections interesting and important is what they signal for the future. The centrist parties of Europe are now on notice.The entire post-World War II push toward European unity was built on suppressing the nationalist and extremist urges that made the first half of the 20th century a nightmare of war and Depression. If the countries of Europe were economically and politically unified around democratic principles, the logic went, never again could a Hitler threaten his neighbors.But for stability to continue, the elites in charge of this new system in Brussels and Frankfurt and Strasbourg (homes of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the European Parliament) have to hold up their end of the bargain, and deliver prosperity.They have failed their citizens for the last half a decade. The single currency, the euro, used on much of the Continent, has made it impossible for countries to make the adjustments through fluctuating currency when facing very different economic situations. Instead, economic adjustment is accomplished through a long, grinding process of falling wages and slashed public benefits in Southern Europe.So far, in the elections that really matter \u2014 for national Parliaments \u2014 turmoil has been averted. In some countries, discontent in the streets meant swapping parties of the left for those of the right (Greece and Spain). In others it meant voters sending out parties of the center-right in favor of the left (France and Italy). It\u2019s telling that of the leaders of major European powers from half a decade ago, only Angela Merkel of Germany remains in charge. Not coincidentally, Germany has had the strongest economic performance of the major European powers.The question is what happens if some of the extremist protest parties that made gains in the weekend\u2019s elections start to acquire real power in some of the national Parliaments and try to turn some of their more extreme stands into law, unraveling the six decades of work toward a united Europe.So far the center has held. The elections are a warning to the governing parties across Europe that unless they can get better economic results, that won\u2019t last forever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Weak Ruble Weighs on Earnings at Carlsberg", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOPENHAGEN \u2014 The Danish brewer Carlsberg on Wednesday reported a first quarter that was more difficult than expected, capped by a weak Russian ruble and declining sales in Eastern Europe. It also lowered its outlook for 2014 net profit and for the Russian beer market.The group said that it now expects reported adjusted net profit to grow only by low-single-digit percentages in 2014, down from an earlier guidance of mid-single digit growth.\u201cIncluded in the outlook is a more uncertain macro situation in Russia and Ukraine,\u201d Carlsberg said in the report.Carlsberg, the maker of Baltika, Tuborg and Kronenbourg 1664, said the Russian market was now assumed to decline by mid-single-digit percentages in beer volume in 2014, against an earlier guidance of a low-single-digit decline.Carlsberg, the market leader in Russia, has suffered from a slowing of the economy there and a law banning the sale of alcohol from street kiosks, which combined led to an 8 percent slump of the Russian beer market last year.Operating profit before special items fell to 453 million Danish kroner, or $84.56 million, from 680 million kroner a year ago and below a forecast for 749 million kroner in a Reuters poll.Carlsberg\u2019s sales fell 14 percent in Eastern Europe in the first quarter, which was slightly more than expected by the analysts.In Asia, sales grew by 21 percent, which was much weaker than expected, and in Western Europe, sales grew by 2 percent, which was slightly weaker than expected.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Sizzling Real Estate Market Cools", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 After almost two decades of nearly unceasing increases in real estate prices and construction across China, one of the world\u2019s longest-running bull markets finally seems to be stalling, with broad consequences for the country\u2019s economy and possibly its politics.Prices are falling for both new and old apartments. The volume of deals is drying up. And developers are pulling back, furloughing workers and delaying new projects. In the latest sign, housing starts plummeted 25 percent in April from a year ago, the Chinese government announced on Tuesday.It is a severe blow for a country where real estate sales offices have become ubiquitous and tower cranes are jokingly described as the national bird.Su Hua, a real estate broker in Shenzhen, had his highest commissions ever last year, as a speculative frenzy prompted families all over China to buy and sell apartments at a brisk pace. But he sat in a deserted office late last week with several silent phones on his desk. His income has halved so far this year.The question is how much further the real estate market will slow, and whether its troubles will spill into other sectors of the economy, notably the banking system. Any weakness in the great Chinese economic engine could reverberate through the global markets. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict how the bursting of a Chinese real estate bubble plays out because it plays out in very small steps,\u201d said Joel H. Rothstein, a partner in the Beijing office of the Paul Hastings law firm who specializes in Asian real estate.China\u2019s real estate market correction \u2014 some economists are even calling it the popping of a bubble \u2014 is partly the result of a deliberate decision by the country\u2019s leaders in Beijing.The Federal Reserve and other regulators in the United States did not try to deflate what now seems to have been an American housing bubble in the years leading up to the 2008 downturn. But the Chinese leadership has been increasingly concerned over the last several years that housing prices were rising to unaffordable levels and that the economy was becoming overly dependent on investment; residential construction accounts for one-ninth of all economic output.The result has been a series of policies that includes punitive interest rates for mortgages on second homes, a ban on the purchase of third homes and, more recently, deliberate action by the central bank to keep short-term interest rates well above the rate of inflation. Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, reaffirmed tight credit policies on Saturday, saying that he did not think the economy was in sufficient trouble to justify monetary policy stimulus.But the real estate market continues to slump, which could prompt Beijing to take a different tack.Economic data released on Tuesday also included a deceleration in industrial production, with growth in steel and cement output slowing to a crawl. Retail sales also grew more slowly than expected in April, and the furniture market stalled as fewer families moved into new homes.According to Centaline, one of China\u2019s largest real estate brokerage firms, transactions over the May 1 holiday weekend fell by half in Beijing and Shanghai from a year ago. The weekend is traditionally one of the two biggest real estate buying times of the year, along with a weeklong national holiday at the start of October.Mr. Su, the real estate broker, worries that the market tumult shows no sign of ending. \u201cThere is not much else I know how to do,\u201d Mr. Su said. \u201cMaybe I will consider selling insurance on the side, if business continues to slow.\u201dA handful of real estate restrictions are already being rescinded. In the last two weeks, state-controlled banks in Shenzhen, adjacent to Hong Kong, have stopped charging the extra half percentage point to one percentage point above the regulated national benchmark rate for mortgages. They had been charging extra in recent years, in an effort to discourage excess in the market.But some experts wonder whether wealthy families will want to jump back into the market even if the most important restrictions, on the purchase of multiple apartments, are lifted. Nicole Wong, the head of property research at CLSA, a Hong Kong-based brokerage and investment firm, said that easing limits on overseas investment meant that more wealthy families were starting to send their money to Hong Kong and elsewhere instead of buying more apartments.For real estate prices, \u201ceven if you relax all the restrictions, it won\u2019t make much of a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cThe one thing that is certain is the direction is set, and it is down \u2014 but it can be managed.\u201dChinese banking executives and economists say that a severe housing downturn would most likely cause a considerable increase in nonperforming loans at the country\u2019s banks. But they make several arguments for why even a fairly steep slump in housing might not lead to the bank failures or emergency bailouts seen in the United States when its market soured.A major reason is that a significant drop in the housing market would still leave the prices of most homes higher than the balance on the mortgages. So almost nobody expects a big wave of foreclosures.The bulk of the homes in China were bought more than five years ago, and real estate prices have about doubled in the last five years. Down payments range from 20 to 40 percent and are often higher, giving banks a larger cushion against any losses.A bigger worry is the extent to which companies in other sectors have borrowed money from banks and trusts that they were supposed to invest in equipment purchases and other business activities, but have secretly speculated in real estate instead. Extensive anecdotal evidence suggests that such speculative activity by companies has been widespread.Other sectors of the Chinese economy are healthier than residential real estate, and could help sustain economic output. Infrastructure spending by the government, particularly railroad construction, is moving into high gear. And the central bank has gradually pushed down the renminbi against the dollar in currency markets this year, helping the competitiveness of Chinese goods.With so much wealth tied up in housing, concerns are rising about the potential for protests and other turbulence if real estate prices keep falling. A new crop of discounts adds to the nervousness.Government and private sector statistics for real estate prices are inconsistent and hard to compare. But discounts of 10 to 20 percent from a year ago are increasingly common for homes sold between individuals, and for new units sold by developers as well, real estate executives said.The chairman of a large developer with operations across China said that offering price discounts for the remaining units in half-sold projects was extremely difficult, because earlier buyers could protest and demand refunds equal to the discounts. The potential for protests, and not banking sector exposure to real estate, \u201cis what concerns me,\u201d said the developer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But Winnie Y. Cheng, the research director at Centaline, said that many developers could not afford to hold apartments off the market indefinitely and were already cutting prices. Street protests have occurred, notably in Hangzhou, although earlier buyers have mostly accepted the discounts for later buyers, she said.These days, she added, \u201cAll of the developments are willing to cut their price.\u201dHilda Wang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But anyone who carefully compares the institutions and responsibilities of the Articles of Confederation to the European Union must take exception to his statement that \u201cthe Confederation had been a league of 13 independent states held together by a treaty not much different from those undergirding the European Union today.\u201dUnlike the association created by the Articles of Confederation, the successive treaties establishing what is now the European Union have enabled it with many attributes, including a customs union, a common currency (for most of its 28 members), a European Court of Justice, tens of thousands of employees and an ability to pass legislation that national governments must enforce. We Americans tend to minimize the extent of the role that this supra-government organization has developed.\u25c6Otherwise OccupiedTo the Editor:But Olson appears to have too credulously accepted Seymour Morris Jr.\u2019s account in \u201cSupreme Commander\u201d of MacArthur as a crusading liberal during his leadership of the occupation. In addition to the land reforms, women\u2019s right to vote and the initial purges of Japanese militarists from government, \u00adMacArthur also presided over what historians have identified as the \u201creverse course\u201d in American policy in 1947-48.John Dower, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cEmbracing Defeat,\u201d summarizes these events: \u201cDriven by Cold War considerations, the Americans began to jettison many of the original ideals of \u2018demilitarization and democratization.\u2019 . . .

MacArthur\u2019s time in Japan was a relative bright spot in an otherwise dark career, but it does a disservice to history to try to whitewash the blemishes that existed even here.The writer is a professor of history at Shippensburg University.\u25c6Art and LifeTo the Editor:On March 21, 1972, after reviewing the manuscript of \u201cThe Dolphin\u201d with Frank Bidart, Elizabeth Bishop wrote a poignant, excruciatingly detailed response to Robert Lowell.

{"Headline": "For Schools, Long Road to a Level Playing Field", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneIn the American national mythology, there are few more revered ideas than the belief in education\u2019s power to provide every child a shot at success and to overcome entrenched inequality.In developing its system of public education, the United States took care to avoid the European model of providing high-quality education only to the best, most advantaged students, while generally channeling children from a working-class background into vocational tracks at an early age.While it often fell short of the ideal, the United States aimed to provide universal comprehensive education to every child, creating \u201can egalitarian system that put the elite systems of Europe to shame,\u201d the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz wrote in their book, \u201cThe Race Between Education and Technology.\u201d By the early 20th century, young Americans were much more educated than their peers in almost every European country.That is, of course, no longer the case. Every few years, the United States faces the ritual humiliation of seeing how its educational standards trail those of most other industrial countries.But perhaps even more disturbing, the report highlighted another trend: the persistent gulf in the test results between the rich and the poor.According to calculations by the O.E.C.D., socioeconomic background explains 15 percent of the variation in the performance of American students, far more than in high-performing countries like Finland, Japan and Norway. Only one in 20 children coming from the most disadvantaged quarter of the population manages to excel at school and climb in the rankings.Americans may protest that the tight link merely reflects the United States\u2019 more heterogeneous population and greater income inequality. But the truth, noted the O.E.C.D., is that \u201csocioeconomic disadvantage translates more directly into poor educational performance in the United States than is the case in many other countries.\u201dOne of its core recommendations belied American education\u2019s egalitarian beginnings: Stop channeling disadvantaged students into a lower-quality education.Tracking in the United States is not formal, as it is in Germany, where children are directed early in high school onto either a vocational path or one that requires a college education. \u201cIt tends to be done as a matter of practice or custom,\u201d the O.E.C.D. noted. That may make it harder to change. What\u2019s more, it often starts earlier, from a child\u2019s first year in elementary school.The way schools are funded \u2014 mainly through local real estate taxes \u2014 creates a built-in advantage for schools in rich communities, where schools can hire the best teachers, build the best labs and buy the best computers and where the wealthy can surround their children with the children of other wealthy people.Tracking also happens within schools, where students are often separated by ability. \u201cAdvanced children are all put together; they all know each other and learn from each other\u2019s habits,\u201d said Sal Khan, the founder of the Khan Academy of online education. \u201cAt the low end, it\u2019s an intellectual wasteland.\u201dAddressing the vast disparities between students\u2019 abilities will not be easy. In some public schools, children who are entering the sixth grade with the measured proficiency of first graders are mixed in with children who perform well above the sixth-grade standard.Schools struggle to teach this mix. Teachers are frustrated: Almost half leave the profession within five years.Joel Rose, who heads the educational technology nonprofit organization New Classrooms, is testing a model that blends live and virtual teaching to tailor education to students\u2019 abilities and interests, designing classes based on the ease and speed with which each student works.This kind of tailoring, Mr. Rose believes, provides a way to effectively educate children of many disparate abilities in one class. \u201cIf one sixth grader is at the fifth-grade level and another is operating at the ninth,\u201d Mr. Rose says, \u201cwe can teach to both.\u201dThe challenge, however, is not something that technology alone can address. In an early pilot using Mr. Rose\u2019s model in a handful of schools in disadvantaged communities, students learned math 20 percent faster than the national average. Lifting them onto a trajectory that would make them ready for a state university, Mr. Rose acknowledges, would require them to advance at 2.5 times the national pace.This is not a new problem. Disparities of education were already in the spotlight 13 years ago, when No Child Left Behind promised to educate every child to a minimum standard.Contrary to the standard argument of many liberals, solving the problem probably doesn\u2019t require a lot of new money. Among advanced nations, only Luxembourg spends more per child than the United States. But in contrast to the views of many conservatives, what it does require is changing the way resources are allocated, focusing more on the students who need help the most.For all the controversy in political circles, the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to establish a common core of national standards should help reduce some of the vast disparities in education that persist among states, giving educators their first chance to compare educational progress across the nation and improving accountability.And it may help move the American system from one focused on basic skills and minimum standards to one seeking to develop higher-order thinking skills, giving teachers and principals much more discretion to experiment with different ways of achieving these goals.But that won\u2019t overcome perhaps the greatest shortcoming in the United States compared with top performers like Canada, Finland and Singapore: a dearth of excellent teachers.Schools of education must prepare teachers \u201cto teach what the state expects students to learn,\u201d the O.E.C.D. report said. Admissions standards at institutions that prepare teachers must be \u201chigh enough to attract the kinds of people who will be needed,\u201d and the programs at these institutions must be \u201cdesigned to attract young people who could choose to be doctors and architects and engineers.\u201dWhile this will most likely require higher salaries for teachers, it needn\u2019t cost more in the end. The O.E.C.D. acknowledged that it is probably cheaper to hire American teachers often \u201crecruited from the lower-performing segment of high school graduates in relatively low-status teacher-education institutions.\u201d But a substantial share of the teachers who enter the system are gone after five years, and many higher-priced specialists are needed to assist the average classroom teacher.In other countries, classroom teachers are paid more, but such salaries allow those countries to recruit more competitively and train candidates in higher-status institutions. Those teachers stay in teaching longer, need to be replaced less frequently and require much less specialized assistance in the classroom.In fact, America\u2019s \u201clow cost\u201d solution is a lot more expensive once all costs are taken into account.Closing disparities in education requires addressing all these shortcomings. That won\u2019t be easy. But as long as the performance gap remains so wide, education cannot do its job of leveling the playing field of opportunity.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Court Rejects British Challenge to Tax on Trading", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The top court in the European Union on Wednesday cleared a legal obstacle to a proposed tax on financial transactions, a plan bitterly opposed by bankers in London.European Union finance ministers plan to meet early next week to discuss next steps for setting up the tax, though the British government warned it could bring a further case against the plan.With London a global financial center and trading hub of Europe, Britain opposes taxes that might make the city less competitive with Wall Street or Asian money centers. And many British are politically opposed to ceding any tax authority to the European Union.But the court said that Britain did not have the right to challenge efforts by other countries to create a tax on financial transactions.France and Germany, which support the proposal, have pledged to make progress by May. But there are no precedents for setting direct taxes at the European Union level, and further challenges by Britain could impede the process.The British government brought the case a year ago at the court, the European Court of Justice, seeking to block 11 other member states of the union from establishing the financial transactions tax, which would levy a small charge on the purchase of stocks and bonds and on derivatives trades.Even if Britain chose to ignore the tax, banks or financiers in London could still be partly liable if another party to a trade is based somewhere \u2014 like in France or Germany \u2014 that the tax applied.On Wednesday the court, in Luxembourg, ruled that there was no legal impediment to the 11 countries\u2019 going forward with their plans. The court also said that some British complaints about the cost of the tax \u201ccannot be examined\u201d as it had \u201cnot been definitively established.\u201dKnown as a Tobin tax, after the American economist who proposed it more than three decades ago, the tax is seen by many policy makers as a way of making the financial sector pay for some of the costs incurred by taxpayers during the recent financial and debt crises, which led to huge bailouts for overstretched banks.No detailed agreement is yet in place among those countries in favor, and they still must discuss how rapidly to adopt such a tax and precisely what financial trades it should cover \u2014 even what the money should be used toward.The United States has expressed its own concerns about such a tax.The Obama administration has opposed domestic proposals for a financial transactions tax, on the grounds that it would be vulnerable to evasion, create an incentive for traders to work around it and place a new burden on retail investors. A Treasury spokeswoman said that while Europe needed to decide on fees and taxes for itself, the Obama administration has made clear that it opposes such proposals to the extent that they might hurt United States investors or have other cross-border effects.Britain already operates a so-called stamp duty that taxes stock trading. But the British government has long been uneasy about handing any authority over taxation to Brussels.Britain is also in the throes of a debate over whether to sever some ties with the European Union, and the legal wrangling over the financial transactions tax is one of several disputes between Britain and the union on financial services.Even so, some specialists contend that such a tax, rather than harm traders in the City of London, could actually push more financial business toward London, as banks sought to leave countries where the tax would be in place.The British Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday that the court\u2019s decision confirmed that Britain still \u201cwill be able to challenge the final proposal for a Financial Transaction Tax if it is not in our national interest.\u201d Britain \u201crisked not being able to do that if we had not made this challenge now,\u201d the statement added.Tax lawyers said the debate was far from over.Richard Croker, the head of corporate tax at the law firm CMS Cameron McKenna, in referring to the ruling on Wednesday, said: \u201cThis is merely a skirmish in the battle.\u201dThe European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, made a formal proposal for the tax in October 2011, spelling out a plan to require financial institutions in participating member states to pay a tax of at least a tenth of 1 percent of the value of transactions with other institutions.But in response to opposition from Britain and Sweden, 11 countries \u2014 including Germany and France \u2014 decided in February 2013 to opt instead for a procedure known in the European Union as enhanced cooperation.The procedure allows a core group of European nations to proceed with policies that other nations do not want to adopt. A minimum of nine nations are required for the commission to write legislation. The other backers are Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.The commission has estimated that the tax could raise as much as 35 billion euros (about $48 billion) each year if used in the 11 countries in favor.Lawyers from governments in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Portugal were among those who defended the tax in the case that was dismissed on Wednesday.After the ruling, a body representing banks in Britain pledged to continue pushing to block any such tax from being introduced in Europe.The association has not conducted its own assessments of how much the initiative would cost the City of London, according to Paul Stephenson, a spokesman.Labor unions were among groups that vowed on Wednesday to continue supporting the rapid adoption of the tax to rein in financial speculation and to create a new source of revenue for poor people in Europe and overseas.Annie Lowrey contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beginning of a New Era for India?", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From IndiaNEW DELHI \u2014 On Monday, the swearing-in of the new Indian prime minister began like a mishap. The ceremonial head of state, President Pranab Mukherjee, who administered the oath, said, \u201cI\u201d and looked sideways as though he were about to say, \u201cI really wanted to be prime minister.\u201dFor that was once considered his destiny, and it was almost within his grasp as a powerful leader of the Indian National Congress. But the party chose Manmohan Singh and eventually got rid of Mr. Mukherjee honorably by nominating him as president, which is a bit like the British monarch but without the estate. Mr. Mukherjee, of course, stopped after \u201cI\u201d and looked at Narendra Modi, who then read the oath and assumed office as the head of government.In an unsung coincidence, the man who administered the oath had contributed in an immeasurable way to the rise of Mr. Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party. For Mr. Mukherjee was a disaster as finance minister from 2009 to 2012. The relationship between Indian business and the government deteriorated as he presided over a slowing economy, and the Congress party never recovered.As Mr. Modi and his ministers were sworn in, the news media covered the event with enthusiastic optimism, with television commentators showering compliments on the newborn government, which they said looked a lot like its single parent, Mr. Modi.Yet, the new cabinet is not a major departure from the old. Thirteen of Mr. Modi\u2019s ministers are facing criminal charges in courts, including serious ones like attempted murder and kidnapping. And, although Mr. Modi has portrayed himself as a friend of youth, most of his ministers are over 60 and looked older as they climbed up a short flight of stairs to take the oath.What appeared to impress political observers most was the presence of leaders of neighboring nations who had accepted Mr. Modi\u2019s unusual invitation to witness his installation. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was on hand, but minutes after Mr. Modi was sworn in, as though in tribute, Pakistan\u2019s paramilitary forces opened fire on the Indian border.Political analysts hoped that the two leaders would get along. From Mr. Modi\u2019s tweets after a banquet on Monday, it appeared that one thing the two men share is a love for their mothers.Mr. Modi and his party had received only 31 percent of the vote, but within this fraction there was a rare political treaty between the elite and the poor. In recent times the two segments have often despised each other\u2019s political choices, though in December they appeared to have found a consensus in backing Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party as chief minister of Delhi.But that accommodation was transformed in a matter of weeks as Mr. Kejriwal\u2019s incurable appetite for street demonstrations even once he became chief minister ensured that the middle class and the poor joined in losing faith in him. The day Mr. Modi was sworn in as prime minister in Delhi, Mr. Kejriwal was in prison not far away, swatting mosquitoes of which there were many in his cell. He was jailed following a charge of defamation brought by the former president of Mr. Modi\u2019s party, Nitin Gadkari, whom Mr. Kejriwal had accused of corruption.The core of Mr. Modi\u2019s cabinet includes Rajnath Singh, the new home affairs minister and a former physics lecturer who believes that ancient Hindu scriptures and a conversation with the poet Rabindranath Tagore helped Werner Heisenberg formulate quantum mechanics; Arun Jaitley, finance and defense minister and an articulate lawyer who was too suave to win a seat for his party when he contested the general elections; and Sushma Swaraj, external affairs minister and once a prime ministerial aspirant who has a tense relationship with Mr. Modi.Across the nation, people watched on television the first light of the new government whose urgent mission is to infuse life into the economy. Among them, a 6-year-old girl, after being told that Mr. Modi was the new prime minister, asked, \u201cIs he a nice man?\u201dThis election season, as the nation voted for a better material life, it was somehow the least relevant question.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Missouri, Republicans Prevail on Tax Bill", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 In a showdown over tax policy, the Republican-controlled State Senate on Monday overrode Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon\u2019s veto of a major tax-cut bill, setting the stage for sharp reductions in state personal income taxes. The Senate debated the bill for less than 30 minutes before overriding the veto on a 23-to-8 vote. The Republican-controlled House is expected to vote on the override on Tuesday. Myron Neth, a Republican member of the House, delivered an impassioned speech on the floor in favor of the bill Monday night, arguing that the state needed to give businesses tax breaks in order to stay competitive. \u201cSmall business and midsized business are what makes this economy happen and we continue to penalize them for what they do,\u201d he said.The vote was a rebuke of Mr. Nixon, who last September lobbied so vigorously against a different tax-cut bill championed by Republican legislators that the lawmakers failed to override his veto of that measure.The governor, who had described the new tax-cut bill as \u201cill-conceived,\u201d said in an interview Monday night that he was prepared for it to now become law. \u201cWe\u2019ve laid out the case for the public, and whatever happens, I\u2019ll continue to manage the state in the same way that we have,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best way, but if they decided it is, then we\u2019ll balance the budget accordingly.\u201d The legislation would gradually reduce the top individual income tax rate to 5.5 percent, from 6 percent, starting in 2017, provided state revenue is growing. It would also phase in a 25 percent deduction for business income reported on personal tax returns. Democratic senators who spoke against the bill said they worried it would threaten Missouri\u2019s excellent credit rating and reduce state funds for education. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to do a tax cut at this level,\u201d said Senator Jolie Justus, speaking on the Senate floor, citing services that she said were already severely underfunded. \u201cWe are on the wrong track.\u201d But the bill\u2019s sponsor in the Senate, Will Kraus, said the bill included compromises and safeguards that would protect the state\u2019s economy.\u201cThis bill is a fiscally sound bill,\u201d he said.When the votes were tallied, Mr. Kraus leaned back in his chair, clasped his hands and laughed. After the legislature failed to override the governor\u2019s veto last year, the Republicans came back this spring with a shorter bill, only five pages long. They rallied more support in the business community and argued that the tax cut would boost small businesses. In the halls of the Capitol, they posted black-and-white placards outside their offices, displaying the number of businesses in their districts that they said would benefit. And perhaps most crucially, after the governor vetoed the most recent bill last Thursday, they moved quickly to schedule an override session, hastily gathering members on Monday. House leaders, who needed to convince at least one Democrat to vote with the Republicans, spent the weekend and Monday rallying support for the override. John Diehl, the House majority floor leader, said in an interview in his office on Monday afternoon that he was confident he had the votes to override the governor\u2019s veto. The faster timetable worked in the Republicans\u2019 favor, he added. \u201cThis time, the governor hasn\u2019t had four months to fly around on the state airplane scaring people,\u201d Mr. Diehl said. \u201cAnd you can only do scare tactics and misinformation for so long.\u201d After issuing a veto on Thursday, Mr. Nixon appeared in Kansas City the next day for some hasty campaigning, blasting the bill as a financially irresponsible measure that would destabilize the economy.

{"Headline": "With Narendra Modi, a Change in India", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialNarendra Modi, India\u2019s presumed next prime minister, and his opposition Bharatiya Janata Party made history by delivering a crushing defeat to the ruling Indian National Congress party, which has controlled Indian politics for most of the past 60 years. Winning more than 272 parliamentary seats, the B.J.P. received the strongest mandate of any party in 30 years. Mr. Modi, the Hindu nationalist and former tea seller, ran on his expansive promises to revive India\u2019s moribund economy, end corruption, create millions of jobs and lift millions of people out of poverty. The landslide victory reflects a changing country more willing to extend governance to those outside the established elite. The loss was so humiliating for the Indian National Congress party, which has governed for most of India\u2019s independence, that it was unclear if it could rebuild its prominence. The Gandhi family, which dominates the party, should hand over the leadership to others. That is the only chance for India to have a credible opposition. The victory gives Mr. Modi, who has been chief minister of the state of Gujarat for 13 years, the chance to revitalize the economy and shape the way India engages with the world. How he moves forward will matter to Indians clamoring for jobs and development, but also to others, including the United States, which sees India as a vital economic and security partner in Asia. One of the most important questions is whether Mr. Modi will be the pragmatic pro-business leader who has argued for putting a priority on economic reforms and creating jobs, or whether he will be the strident Hindu nationalist who might impose a sectarian agenda on a largely secular state. Many Indian Muslims blame him for failing to stop bloody riots in his home state in 2002, leaving more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims. Others fear he will try to quash dissent and centralize authority.American officials were so concerned about the Gujarat killings that they refused to give Mr. Modi a visa for nearly a decade. The administration now is prepared to engage with a Modi government, particularly on economic issues, one official said, and President Obama moved quickly on Friday to invite Mr. Modi to the White House. The two countries will have to work hard to overcome the strain built up between them in recent years. During the Bush administration, a misguided United States-India civilian nuclear deal promised much and delivered little as the Indian government failed to open its economy up to greater trade and foreign investment. Mr. Modi needs to deliver on his vow to make progress, and he and Washington must confront differences on global trade issues. On security, the two countries should pursue deeper cooperation beyond occasional military exercises and arms sales, like calming tensions between China and Vietnam over regional waterways, building peace between India and Pakistan and stabilizing Afghanistan. Mr. Modi has set very high expectations for economic revival and his government, but he can\u2019t achieve those goals if he exacerbates sectarian divisions, for example, by using divisive rhetoric against Muslims. He set a good tone on Friday by promising to work for the good of all Indians, and he will need to stick to that commitment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Campuses Without a Compass", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe last thing a dad gets to really teach his daughter is how to drive a car.When I say teach, I\u2019m talking the moment that begins with the instructor knowing nearly everything, while the pupil knows almost nothing. By the day a kid earns a driver\u2019s permit, there\u2019s been a lifetime of these handoffs: how to dice a carrot, tie a shoelace, skewer a bully.The driving lesson arrives at just the right time \u2014 during that year when regular road trips to prospective colleges offer plenty of long driving times, as well as that horripilating ritual known as merging onto an Interstate. These road trips also coincide with peak season of teenage narcissism. There\u2019s a special kind of schadenfreude watching someone realize that oncoming traffic is not at all impressed by wit or beauty. Of course, teaching driving does require gums of steel. Seeing a delivery truck outside your passenger window that is five inches, four inches, three inches away can prompt multiple spontaneous root canals. On the other hand, corners that clip the tire rim with the intimacy of a bottle opener have also allowed me to perfect my Munch scream. My daughter Yancey, a high school junior, and I hit the road this year on numerous trips to visit colleges up and down the Eastern Seaboard. The journey to the University of Vermont got off to a slow start when the previous day\u2019s curb kiss finally deflated into nauseating flapflapflap somewhere in Massachusetts. Today\u2019s mini-lesson: Always loosen the lug nuts before you jack up the car. After that practice session (and two others in subsequent weeks), Yancey got the procedure down. \u201cChanging a tire is kinda cool,\u201d my flat-tire maven observed, while loosening the stiffer lug nuts by jumping up and down on the tire iron. The good news is that at some future date, as her young male friends are leafing past Starbucks cards to find their AAA number, Yancey will just spit in her hands and get \u2019er done. On driving instruction road trips, teaching calm control of the wheel means trying to sustain a parental pose of implacability no matter what happens. Yet, over one hill, a state patrol officer was leaping about I-91 traffic, waving frantically. Yancey whipped around the cop and began to pull over, panicked that she was getting a ticket, until I realized that the officer was simply heaving big curls of retread off the road. \u201cDo cops normally dance on the Interstate?\u201d Yancey asked. My silence (from ebbing fight-or-flight hormones) let this question settle into today\u2019s koan.A half an hour later, the back door of a truck popped open and out cascaded dozens and dozens of beer cans. Yancey held the wheel steady as we detonated our way through the Interstate equivalent of jumping around on Bubble Wrap. Farther along, a massive pickup truck was suddenly tailgating Yancey at 65 miles per hour \u2014 his way of expressing impatience with her textbook good driving. \u201cDo I speed up?\u201d she asked insistently. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. (At last, a contingency I know too well: a jackass.) \u201cAnd don\u2019t put on the brake either,\u201d I continued. \u201cInstead just take your foot off the gas, and enjoy.\u201dA good minute or two passed as the speedometer drooped to 65, 62, 59, 55, until finally the other lane opened up. The pickup pulled up beside me on the passenger side so I might have a good look-see at what Time magazine once called the \u201cinternational sign of obscene derision.\u201d Yancey and I waved and smiled as if we\u2019d just bumped into an old friend. The apoplectic driver rocketed off. \u201cIt\u2019s the simple things in life you treasure,\u201d said Yancey, quoting our favorite Tony Shalhoub line (from the way-underrated \u201cGalaxy Quest\u201d). The University of Vermont had a pretty good tour, I was told. I got our flat tire replaced. But the Q&A was largely about weather. The thought of spending a school year in Superman\u2019s Fortress of Solitude had the future baccalaureate already planning the next road trip, down south.Our new itinerary would begin at the New College of Florida, then a drive north in a U-Haul truck to pick up some heirlooms from my family in Charleston (where I\u2019m from). The next day we\u2019d hit some North Carolina colleges before heading back home. New College is obviously a serious academic campus, but one of those closeted colleges that feels compelled to make a pitch that is largely about the good life. The beachside campus in Sarasota does resemble one of those vintage postcards boasting Art Deco mansions and psychoactive sunsets. The first thing you hear about is its hippie-dippie curriculum, and that the entire campus was once the estate of Charles Ringling, one of the maestros behind \u201cRingling Brothers United Monster Shows, Great Double Circus, Royal European Menagerie, Museum, Caravan, and Congress of Trained Animals.\u201dAnd sure, it did seem as if half the boys get around by skateboard, but we had lunch at Four Winds, the student-run vegan joint (formerly Ringling\u2019s elephant barn), and there was a real intensity in these scholars. Turns out, the curriculum is very student-controlled \u2014 you work out a \u201ccontract\u201d of your studies each term and you get to expunge all evidence of a class or two that doesn\u2019t turn out. That might sound funky, but it quickly drives the students to follow their bliss into a focused major. A required senior-year thesis practically creates an outline for a student\u2019s prospective career. Our tour guide told us that among public colleges, New College has the second highest rate of sending students off into graduate specialties in the country. And, as a carnivore wary of vegan Epicureanism, I found that the eggplant sandwich at Four Winds was filled with great flavors and totally free of moral disdain. Next morning, early, we headed out in the truck for South Carolina. At the Interstate entrance, we pulled into a Target to get a few electronic supplies. When we returned, the truck wouldn\u2019t start. Not even a sound, and the most comfort U-Haul would provide was the assurance that a mechanic would be there by 5 p.m. \u201cHow can we just sit in a parking lot all day?\u201d was this morning\u2019s koan. Target had some very economical five-pound sacks of semi-stale pistachios. We drifted down the way to a Chipotle outdoor cafe: Vladimir and Estragon marooned in cheap chairs, contemplating the mysteries of asphalt. Then, the mechanic arrived, and this part was just surreal. In less than two minutes, Jose figured out that it was a \u201cleaking fuel pressure regulator.\u201d He happened to have a chunk of precisely the right hose, and two minutes later the truck started right up. \u201cThis is a miracle,\u201d my abecedarian declared. Junky souvenir stands in Florida probably date back to Ponce de Leon\u2019s second voyage, but for a child of the Deep South, the constancy of a certain bright orange roadside shed in the Sunshine State is soothing. At Florida Citrus Center & Souvenir World, I stocked up on bags of jumbo fruits, orange blossom honey and papershell pecans. The terrarium of live baby alligators for sale suggested that New York\u2019s urban legend might need an update. Meanwhile Yancey was lost at a shelf of postcards of bikini\u2019d tushes set upon by gator\u2019s jaws (\u201cI\u2019d rather bite than switch\u201d), shot glasses bearing crude party jokes, and backscratchers carved to resemble pink flamingos. Another milestone was reached: She was trying to determine which trinket\u2019s kitsch would survive north of the border. For the first time, she was pondering the half-life of camp. (Which ought to be a page in that \u201cBaby\u2019s First Things\u201d book I never wrote anything in.)Because of the truck\u2019s mechanical issues, we heaved to at a Holiday Inn along a strobing neon strip in Orlando where the magic of texting revealed that my nephew Jim was just down the street, hosing down his three kids from a full day of Pirates of the Caribbean and candy. So, Jim slipped away from his crew after bedtime, and the three of us set off on the Odyssean pursuit of unfranchised grub. We wound up in a dank Irish pub tucked into a side alley. A loquacious 9-year-old quickly ditched her unruly family for the calm harbor of ours. She took us on in billiards but was more thrilled when Yancey related the never-fail strategy she discovered for getting the stuffed bear out of the bar\u2019s arcade claw game: Maneuver the controls while peering in through the side of the machine since those glass panes don\u2019t subtly distort distance perception. By the end of the night, an aging lounge lizard with wheezing John Mayall vocals had seized the karaoke machine and croaked through diabetic versions of songs like \u201cZiggy Stardust\u201d and \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jack Flash.\u201d Conversation about job prospects for post-collegiate Yancey ground to a halt when we all simultaneously suspected that the Scroogean Ghost of Economy Future had somehow led us to this damp floor and these breathy lamentations.The morning after got us to Charleston, to pick up some beds and chairs and a certain notorious painting that I\u2019d been avoiding for, well, decades. It\u2019s a 19th-century portrait of my great-great-grandfather Somers Buist, but I\u2019d been delaying having the thing in my house since it seemed so grandmotherly and a major Charleston clich\u00e9. My family was tired of passing it around, though \u2014 an old, cracked oil painting of an apple-cheeked Confederate sporting a Borat mustache seated upright in a baroque gilded frame. But I was thrilled to take possession now, having heard the story. My mom, a true goody-goody (most vile swear word: \u201cpookie\u201d), confided a while back that the painting was in fact not a family heirloom. She stole it. Better: the caper was masterminded by another notorious local goody-goody, my friend Preston\u2019s dad. The thought of these two stately nerds skulking about town sometime in the early 1970s and sneaking out of, let\u2019s just say, a revered Charleston institution, is a scenario I\u2019m still trying to process. So, next morning, great-great-granddad, Yancey and I hit the road north. At the University of North Carolina, I was told to cool my heels in a coffee shop (fine with me), and the wait was worth it. Yancey returned with scorching accounts of helicopter parents overwhelming the tour, stepping on their own children\u2019s questions before turning every talk into a reminiscence of Greek life and beer bongs back in the day. Duke\u2019s tour was somewhat more cerebral, although the story had just broken of a freshman, who went by the handle Belle Knox, filming some seriously explicit porn to relieve her dad of the burden of the $61,404 bill. \u201cI am so sick of all the slut-shaming,\u201d Yancey told me over dinner. \u201cDid you read the essay she wrote about why she was exploring her sexuality?\u201d In fact, I had read it, and Ms. Knox is impressively smart and quite poised, really, when she explains the choices she made. \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying, daughter,\u201d I said, \u201cbut, for the record, I just want to say that were you to get into Duke, I will pay every nickel of your tuition. I will write the copy of the inside of matchbooks \u2014 no biggie.\u201dA few weeks later, we were in the outer Berkshires, wandering the campuses of Williams and Bennington. Both were fantastic, even though a summary of everything so far revealed that each had its own problems \u2014 too jockey, small, cold, Greek, distant, slut-shaming. The conclusion? More road trips this summer, to Pennsylvania and Ohio. After leaving the great barnlike structures of Bennington, Yancey was spent and snoozing in the back seat under a coat. I took a wrong turn and stumbled upon the only Vermont tourist trap somehow located in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. \u2014 the Big Moose Deli & Country Store, whose front porch was crammed with dozens of life-size things and people, including, for no discernible reason, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi in their Blues Brothers\u2019 Ray-Bans. It was comforting to see that souvenir vulgarity knows no geography. So I stocked up on Amish popcorn and huckleberry jam.

{"Headline": "Bailout Is Over for Portugal, but Side Effects Will Linger", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisLISBON \u2014 Europe\u2019s climb out of its debt crisis has been narrated by a long debate on whether the austerity imposed on countries that needed international bailouts would bring more pain than relief.Portugal\u2019s move to exit its bailout gives new ammunition to the austerity advocates who have called for shredding European-style social safety nets that in many countries no longer seem affordable.As practiced by Portugal, austerity meant deep cuts in public employee wages, lower pension payments and unemployment benefits and budget rollbacks in previous sacrosanct areas like education. Adding to the pain were higher personal income taxes, steeper value-added taxes and reduced reimbursements for drugs and doctor bills.The Lisbon government and its creditors have now concluded that the country has done enough cutting that it can exit its three-year, 78 billion euro bailout program on schedule this month, without requiring a just-in-case credit line. But Portugal is also demonstrating that there are harsh trade-offs in trying to end entrenched ways of life and restore growth \u2014 trade-offs that leave the economy in a fragile position.Such themes are common across Europe. While growth is slowly returning and the markets are stabilizing, the recovery is punctuated by serious problems that threaten to derail the weak economy. Unemployment remains stubbornly high in some countries. Deflation fears are mounting. And the geopolitical situation remains unstable as Europe faces potential fallout from the escalating crisis between Ukraine and Russia.The European Commission said on Monday that growth in the European Union would gain significant momentum through 2015. But it also warned of significant challenges to the nascent recovery, including tensions with Russia and an unwillingness by member governments to continue reforms. \u201cThe recovery has now taken hold,\u201d said Siim Kallas, an Estonian politician who is a vice president of the commission. But it is \u201cimportant to embrace structural reforms early on and to stay the course, whatever challenges may be faced along the way,\u201d he said.In Portugal, unemployment, while starting to decline, is still above 15 percent, higher than the euro zone average. Tens of thousands of workers have moved to Britain or Germany, as well as more distant but Portuguese-speaking countries like Brazil and Angola, in search of better futures. And despite formally leaving its bailout program, Portugal will still need decades to pay down the total of \u20ac738 billion ($1 trillion) in public and private debt the country has amassed.\u201cMy estimate is that we are considerably better off than we would have been had the program not been implemented,\u201d said Lu\u00eds Cabral, a Portuguese economist and professor at New York University. \u201cThe death spiral that was predicted for the Portuguese economy failed to materialize.\u201d And by allowing Portugal to regain its borrowing ability, he argued, \u201causterity has made a positive contribution to growth.\u201dHaving emerged last year from recession, Portugal is now expected to grow more than 1 percent both this year and next. That is about in line with the 1.2 percent growth that the European Commission forecast for the euro zone as a whole this year and 1.7 percent for 2015.But the bailout \u2014 secured by a Socialist administration in 2011 although carried out by a center-right government that came to power only a month later in a voter revolt \u2014 has come at a high social cost. And politics could determine whether even Portugal can and will stay on this new, hard-won course.Pedro Passos Coelho, Portugal\u2019s center-right prime minister, wasted little time on Sunday in trying to take the credit for dragging Portugal out of a \u201cperiod of national emergency,\u201d during which his government\u2019s tax increases and spending cuts provoked many street protests but gained plaudits from lenders. With another general election in 2015, there is a risk that the government might start lapsing on the most unpopular reforms, said Antonio Rold\u00e1n, an analyst at the Eurasia Group in London.Some business executives are more optimistic, even if that requires taking a long view.Portugal, like other suffering euro zone economies, has experienced a significant exodus of workers. About 120,000 left the country in 2012 alone, out of a labor force of 5.5 million.Those who left included many young and qualified workers, even from companies that remained profitable throughout the crisis, like Tekever, a Portuguese technology company. Ricardo Mendes, Tekever\u2019s chief operating officer, said that about 20 of its 150 engineers left Portugal during the crisis, some asking to relocate to Tekever\u2019s foreign subsidiaries and others finding jobs with rivals overseas.\u201cWe lost great people here not because there was something wrong with the work itself but just because of the bad environment in Portugal, and that is a real pain,\u201d Mr. Mendes said. \u201cWhen people see a better future for their kids by living in London, what can you say to them?\u201dStill, Mr. Mendes expressed confidence that \u201cwhen the economy really goes up and investments are made, people will come back.\u201dPortugal became the third euro economy to negotiate a bailout, after Greece and Ireland, when its debt financing costs spiraled out of control. But the country was not hit by the bursting of a construction bubble, as happened to Ireland and Spain. Nor was the reliability of its government accounts ever called into question, as in Greece, which is still laboring under its bailout program and the tough oversight of its international creditors. Instead, Portugal suffered what its former finance minister, V\u00edtor Gaspar, called \u201ca bust without a boom.\u201dPortugal\u2019s biggest challenge may be reining in public debt. Government debt has soared during the bailout program by almost a third, to \u20ac276 billion, or 129 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 94 percent at the end of 2010.Cristina Casalinho, a board member of I.G.C.P., the state debt management office, acknowledged that Portugal still faced \u201ca significant deleveraging process.\u201d But over all, she said, \u201cthe economy is now on a stronger footing, evolving out of a model led by domestic demand into a growth model powered mostly by external demand, and that is a real asset going forward.\u201dPortugal\u2019s overhaul has gone far beyond fiscal tightening. Changes to labor rules have significantly lowered the cost of hiring and firing employees.That has helped attract foreign investment. Last week, Volkswagen said it would spend \u20ac677 million to expand production at a factory near Lisbon.And jobs are being created in some new sectors. Teleperformance, an outsourcing company based in Paris, is helping turn Portugal into a European call center hub. Teleperformance\u2019s call centers, able to handle more than two dozen languages, employ 4,600 people here, compared with a staff of 1,800 in Portugal at the end of 2010, before the bailout.Portuguese exports now represent about 40 percent of G.D.P., up from 28 percent in 2009. While the crisis pushed many manufacturers into bankruptcy, the survivors have used spare production capacity to aim far more aggressively at overseas markets.\u201cChanges had to be made very quickly, and that has been very painful for most people, but the end result is that the economy is much stronger and better able to compete on the world market than three years ago,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Jorge, chief executive of Sogepoc, a Portuguese food group that is Europe\u2019s largest producers of tomato paste.Still, the austerity debate \u2014 along with street protests \u2014 is unlikely to end with the bailout program. Spending cuts in sectors like education have caused irreparable social and economic damage to Portugal, according to some politicians and analysts.\u201cWe would have required under any circumstances a strong effort to control public finances and an amount of austerity, but this was a complete overkill and a disaster,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Cravinho, a former Socialist minister.Like many other critics of austerity, Mr. Cravinho equates that tough discipline with the German government that has been its most vocal preacher.\u201cMaking Portugal appear like a very successful case and proving that austerity works in the short term is an important political message,\u201d he said, \u201cNot so much for us, but more for Germany.\u201d James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Climate Change Doomed the Ancients", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe authors, 16 retired high-ranking officers, warned that droughts, rising seas and extreme weather events, among other environmental threats, were already causing global \u201cinstability and conflict.\u201d But Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a stalwart believer that global warming is a \u201choax,\u201d dismissed the report as a publicity stunt. Perhaps the senator needs a history lesson, because climate change has been leading to global conflict \u2014 and even the collapse of civilizations \u2014 for more than 3,000 years. Drought and famine led to internal rebellions in some societies and the sacking of others, as people fleeing hardship at home became conquerors abroad. One of the most vivid examples comes from around 1200 B.C. A centuries-long drought in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions, contributed to \u2014 if not caused \u2014 widespread famine, unrest and ultimately the destruction of many once prosperous cities, according to four recent studies.The scientists determined the length and severity of the drought by examining ancient pollen as well as oxygen and carbon isotope data drawn from alluvial and mineral deposits. All of their conclusions are corroborated by correspondence, inscribed and fired on clay tablets, dating from that time.Ancient letters from the Hittite kingdom, in what is now modern-day Turkey, beseech neighboring powers for shipments of grain to stave off famine caused by the drought. (The drought is thought to have affected much of what is now Greece, Israel, Lebanon and Syria for up to 300 years.) One letter, sent from a Hittite\u00a0king, pleads for help: \u201cIt is a matter of life or death!\u201d Another letter, sent from the city of Emar, in what is now inland Syria, states simply, \u201cIf you do not quickly arrive here, we ourselves will die of hunger.\u201d The kingdom of Egypt, as well as the city of Ugarit, on the coast of what is now Syria, responded with food and supplies, but it is not clear if they were able to provide enough relief. It certainly created problems of national security for the great powers of the time. Correspondence between the Egyptians, Hittites, Canaanites, Cypriots, Minoans, Mycenaeans, Assyrians and Babylonians \u2014 effectively, the Group of 8 of the Late Bronze Age \u2014 includes warnings of attacks from enemy ships in the Mediterranean. The marauders are thought to have been the Sea Peoples, possibly from the western Mediterranean, who were probably fleeing their island homes because of the drought and famine and were moving across the Mediterranean as both refugees and conquerors. One letter sent to Ugarit advised the king to \u201cbe on the lookout for the enemy and make yourself very strong!\u201d The warning probably came too late, for another letter dating from the same time states: \u201cWhen your messenger arrived, the army was humiliated and the city was sacked. Our food in the threshing floors was burned and the vineyards were also destroyed. Our city is sacked. May you know it! May you know it!\u201dWhile sea levels may not have been rising then, as they are now, changes in the water temperature may have been to blame for making life virtually unlivable in parts of the region. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Archaeological Science found that the surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea cooled rapidly during this time, severely reducing precipitation over the coasts. The study concluded that agriculture would have suffered and that the conditions might have influenced the \u201cpopulation declines, urban abandonments and long-distance migrations associated with the period.\u201dTo top it off, catastrophic events, in the form of a series of earthquakes, also rocked many ancient cities in these areas from around 1225 to 1175 B.C. These, together with the famines and droughts, would have further undermined the societies of the time, most likely leading to internal rebellions by the underclass and peasant populations who were facing severe food shortages, as well as invasions by migrating peoples. We still do not know the specific details of the collapse at the end of the Late Bronze Age or how the cascade of events came to change society so drastically. But it is clear that climate change was one of the primary drivers, or stressors, leading to the societal breakdown. The era that followed is known as the first Dark Ages, during which the thriving economy and cultures of the late second millennium B.C. suddenly ceased to exist. It took decades, and even hundreds of years in some areas, for the people in these regions to rebuild.We live in a world that has more similarities to that of the Late Bronze Age than one might suspect, including, as the British archaeologist Susan Sherratt has put it, an \u201cincreasingly homogeneous yet uncontrollable global economy and culture\u201d in which \u201cpolitical uncertainties on one side of the world can drastically affect the economies of regions thousands of miles away.\u201d But there is one important difference. The Late Bronze Age civilizations collapsed at the hands of Mother Nature. It remains to be seen if we will cause the collapse of our own. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Home Resales Rise, but the Pace Lags", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of existing homes rebounded slightly in April, but the pace of buying remained slower than last year\u2019s.The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.65 million, up 1.3 percent from March. Home purchases dropped 6.8 percent in the last 12 months.Much of the April gains were concentrated in the volatile condominium market, which grew by 7.3 percent. Sales of single-family homes rose just 0.5 percent last month.Home sales continue to be significantly slower than the 2013 pace, when 5.1 million used homes were sold. That is well below sales of 5.5 million that are consistent with a healthy housing market.Severe winter weather delayed sales in the Midwest and Northeast in January and February. Would-be buyers also wrestled with higher prices and rising interest rates in the last 12 months, causing the real estate market to lose some momentum from last year.But in a positive sign, the April report shows that would-be sellers are shaking off the severe winter and listing their homes. The market has a 5.9-month supply of homes, up from 5.2 months a year ago.\u201cWith the warmer weather and the \u2018promise\u2019 of higher prices, more homeowners put their homes on the market,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Median prices rose 5.2 percent to $201,700 in April, the slowest growth rate since March 2012, the Realtors group said.Sales of existing homes began to slow in the second half of 2013 as mortgage rates crept up from historical lows. Average rates for fixed, 30-year mortgages last week were 4.2 percent, compared with 3.5 percent a year ago.On Friday, the Commerce Department will report sales of new homes in April.In another measure of economic health, the number of people seeking unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remained at a low level that suggests hiring will remain steady.Initial jobless claims rose 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The increase occurred two weeks after jobless claims fell to their lowest level since May 2007.The four-week average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure, dipped 1,000, to 322,500. The average reached a seven-year low of 312,000 last month. Jobless claims are a proxy for layoffs, so the low levels suggest companies are cutting fewer jobs.The Conference Board\u2019s index of leading indicators, which is intended to predict overall economic activity, posted a solid gain last month, providing further evidence of stronger growth after the severe winter hindered activity. On Thursday, the board reported that the index increased 0.4 percent in April, after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in March. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ganges River: Revered, Soiled and Symbol of an Indian Election Campaign", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVaranasi JournalVARANASI, India \u2014 For centuries, Hindus have brought their dead to banks of the Ganges River in this ancient city, with the promise that if their bodies are burned on the riverfront, their souls will escape the constant cycle of rebirth and attain moksha, or salvation. Transporting their souls is the goddess of the river, whose ebbs and flows have run through thousands of years of civilization.There was a time in living memory when the water in the river was clean enough to drink, said Shyamlal Eshad, a boatman in his 50s. Today, three hundred million liters of raw sewage mixed with industrial pollutants are dumped in the Ganges here every day, according to B.D. Tripathi, an environmental scientist and an advocate for cleaning the Ganges. The stench along the uneven cobblestone steps in parts of Varanasi is overpowering, and Mr. Eshad laments his goddess in decline.\u201cGanga Ji is crying,\u201d said Mr. Eshad, using a term of respect for the river.Now this city\u2019s holy waters are at the center of one of the most important elections in India\u2019s modern history as Narendra Modi, the front-runner in the race for prime minister, has made the cleanup of the sacred river a metaphor for his campaign. He says he wants to restore the river\u2019s purity just as he will revive a nation sullied by corruption and stalled by mismanagement and bureaucratic sloth.\u201cI feel Mother Ganga has called me to Varanasi,\u201d Mr. Modi said to a sea of caps, masks and flags in saffron, the color of his Bharatiya Janata Party, at a rally leading up to the voting here on Monday. Results are expected Friday. \u201cI feel like a child who has returned to his mother\u2019s lap,\u201d he said.Cleaning up the Ganges, a river on which 450 million people depend, is a cherished goal that spans religious divisions.\u201cThere\u2019s some sort of symbolic confession to Hindu nationalism, but cleaning the Ganga is a project that Muslims would embrace, too, except that they wouldn\u2019t vote for him for his record,\u201d said Ashutosh Varshney, a political scientist at Brown University.Varanasi in many ways symbolizes the entwining of the Hindu and Muslim faiths in India. Pilgrims, philosophers, poets and performers have flourished amid the rise and fall of the city\u2019s Hindu and Muslim conquerors, who dotted its labyrinth of alleys with thousands of temples and mosques. Like India, Varanasi has a Hindu majority, but it has a larger than average number of Muslims. The two faiths are bonded by the silk industry, music and cultural practices, creating what is often viewed as a model for communal harmony.The 15th-century mystic Sufi poet Kabir was born into the Muslim weaver community in Varanasi. He was so revered for his tolerance and insight into the essence of all religions that when he died, Muslims and Hindus fought over his body. Legend has it that he turned into flowers: Muslims buried half of them; Hindus cremated the rest.The parties of both Mr. Modi and Mr. Kejriwal have tried to woo the city\u2019s 60,000 weavers by promising to rejuvenate the dying handloom industry and connect it to international markets, which now are flooded with imitation garments and Chinese competition.Haji Mohammed Shamin, a Muslim weaver whose family has been making the city\u2019s famous silks for at least five generations, said the Muslim vote was firmly against Mr. Modi, though split among his rivals. He voted for Mr. Kejriwal.But the pull of Mr. Modi and his pledge to rejuvenate the river is strong here. Mr. Eshad, the boatman, said that if Mr. Modi could preserve the Ganges, he could \u201cremain in power for another 20 years.\u201dVishwambhar Nath Mishra, who is head of one of the city\u2019s most visited temples and an engineering professor, said he talked with Mr. Modi and Mr. Kejriwal about the river\u2019s problems.\u201cWe have tried our very best, but it wasn\u2019t until this election that we\u2019ve seen the issue resurface as a focus issue,\u201d said Mr. Mishra, caretaker of the home of the 16th-century poet Tulsidas, who retold the Ramayana, an ancient epic poem. He said Mr. Modi \u201cwants to convey a message that he leads this society.\u201dDr. Tripathi, an environmental science professor at Banaras Hindu University and a member of a government panel studying the Ganges, said the flow of the Ganges is being blocked by dams for irrigation and electricity, limiting its ability to clean itself. Ninety-five percent of the pollution comes from the raw sewage and industrial pollutants pouring into it; the rest is half-burned flesh and religious items, he said. Officials claim they lack the money to build proper water-treatment facilities.\u201cWe are converting a river into a pond due to our actions,\u201d said Dr. Tripathi, blaming mismanagement for the many hundreds of millions of dollars invested in the river with little to show for it. Like many here, he believes Mr. Modi is the only candidate decisive enough to save the river.\u201cModi\u2019s approach with Varanasi, is definitely for a lot of Hindus, a call to the ancient past,\u201d said Nilanjana S. Roy, a writer. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to create a Hindu symbol and it\u2019s a call to clean up the pollution of the culture.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quixotic \u201980 Campaign Gave Birth to Kochs\u2019 Powerful Network", "Date": "2014-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe backed the full legalization of abortion and the repeal of laws that criminalized drug use, prostitution and homosexuality. He attacked campaign donation limits and assailed the Republican star Ronald Reagan as a hypocrite who represented \u201cno change whatsoever from Jimmy Carter and the Democrats.\u201dIt was 1980, and the candidate was David H. Koch, a 40-year-old bachelor living in a rent-stabilized apartment in New York City. Mr. Koch, the vice-presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party, and his older brother Charles, one of the party\u2019s leading funders, were mounting a long-shot assault on the fracturing American political establishment.The Kochs had invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the burgeoning libertarian movement. In the waning days of the 1970s, in the wake of Watergate, Vietnam and a counterculture challenging traditional social mores, they set out to test just how many Americans would embrace what was then a radical brand of politics.It was the first and only bid for high office by a Koch family member. But much of what occurred in that quixotic campaign shaped what the Kochs have become today \u2014 a formidable political and ideological force determined to remake American politics, driven by opposition to government power and hostility to restrictions on money in campaigns.\u201cThe 1980 campaign was instructive in helping them learn what ideas resonated,\u201d said Robert A. Tappan, a Koch Industries spokesman, \u201cand at the same time, giving them an understanding of the implications of the electoral political process.\u201dBusiness Meets PoliticsThe Kochs, heirs to a family oil refining and marketing business, were unlikely entrants in a presidential campaign.Politics was a dangerous game for those in business, Charles Koch argued in a 1974 speech to libertarian thinkers and business leaders in Dallas. Subsidies and special treatment demanded by corporations had helped turn Americans against free enterprise. Business had colluded with the Nixon administration to design price controls and other \u201csocialistic measures.\u201dThe most effective response was not political action, Mr. Koch argued, but investment in pro-capitalist research and educational programs.By the end of 1974, Mr. Koch had helped found what would become the Cato Institute, today one of the country\u2019s leading libertarian research institutions. He was joined in that effort by Ed Crane, chairman of the three-year-old Libertarian Party. The two men believed that libertarian ideas had to be more accessible to the average person if they were to change the country. Over dinners at Charles Koch\u2019s house in Wichita, Kan., and in correspondence with both brothers and their mother, Mr. Crane worked to persuade the family that a vibrant party organization was critical to advancing that goal.The family would become the Libertarian Party\u2019s most important donors.But their other consuming interest was business: Charles Koch, then in his first decade as president of Koch Industries, had aggressively expanded the firm\u2019s holdings in oil refineries, petroleum products and commodities, while David Koch worked as an executive at the company\u2019s engineering subsidiary.As the brothers became more politically active, Koch Industries repeatedly butted against the federal government\u2019s new energy regulations. One month before Charles Koch\u2019s speech in Dallas, a federal audit found that Koch and two other companies had broken federal oil price controls. In 1975, a Koch subsidiary was cited for $10 million in overcharges on propane gas.The family\u2019s frustrations were captured in a fund-raising letter that Charles Koch wrote on behalf of the 1976 Libertarian presidential candidate, Roger MacBride, a co-creator of the \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d television series. Mr. Koch excoriated Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford for backing price controls, and attacked legislation to impose fuel economy standards as \u201cone of the many demonstrations of the bankruptcy of the Republican alternative to Democratic interventionism.\u201dNew Financing ToolThe Supreme Court handed the Kochs an important weapon in a 1976 decision in Buckley v. Valeo. The court opened two loopholes in a two-year-old campaign finance law that had placed tight controls on what candidates, parties, and private individuals could spend on campaigns: A candidate could spend an unlimited amount of his or her money running for office, and an individual was free to spend an unlimited amount of money promoting candidates so long as the spending was not coordinated with them.The next three years witnessed the birth of the Koch political apparatus. Charles Koch sought to recruit like-minded businessmen who would invest in the libertarian cause, an embryonic version of the Koch-supervised donor club that poured $400 million into the 2012 campaign.The brothers and Mr. Crane saw other hopeful signs. In California\u2019s 1978 state election, voters approved Proposition 13, sharply reducing property taxes, and gave Ed Clark, the Libertarian candidate for governor, 5 percent of the vote.They also became closely involved in the party\u2019s day-to-day operations. David encouraged party leaders to develop policies opposing President Carter\u2019s energy proposals. Charles required detailed accounting of spending and chided party officials when they fell behind schedule on direct mail. But, within the family, Charles and David Koch\u2019s political activities were becoming a point of contention.Most of the family\u2019s enormous wealth was vested in Koch Industries shares, which Charles Koch was determined to hold privately to avoid regulations over publicly traded companies. William Koch, David\u2019s twin, felt that Charles, as the company\u2019s chief executive, was not paying enough dividend income to the family, and complained of having to borrow money to buy a house.Money and PassionIn March 1979, Mr. Clark declared that he would seek the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential nomination. A lawyer for Atlantic Richfield Corporation, he was the candidate many libertarians had been waiting for: polished, substantive and well spoken.The goal was \u201cto try to run somebody who looked like an actual politician, a normal person, not your typical \u2018Star Trek\u2019 convention wannabe like most party members were,\u201d recalled Bruce Bartlett, a supply-side economics expert who volunteered as a speechwriter for the Clark campaign.But a Clark presidential campaign needed money and a running mate. The Kochs could provide both. If one of the brothers joined the ticket, he could \u2014 thanks to the Buckley loophole \u2014 donate as much as he wanted to the campaign, finally giving the ticket enough cash to run ads and seek a ballot spot in all 50 states. David Koch announced his candidacy in August 1979.The post-Watergate campaign finance law \u201cmakes my blood boil,\u201d Mr. Koch wrote in a letter to party members. He had a simple proposal: \u201cAs the Vice-presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party I will contribute several hundred thousand dollars to the Presidential campaign committee in order to ensure that our ideas and our Presidential nominee receive as much media exposure as possible.\u201dIn September 1979, some 2,000 Libertarians gathered at the Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles. Some had grown hostile to the Kochs, Mr. Crane or both, viewing them as controlling. Mr. Clark was accused of being a puppet of the Kochs \u2014 a charge that echoes today in attacks on the brothers that are a centerpiece of the Democrats\u2019 2014 campaign strategy.On the convention\u2019s second day, Mr. Clark addressed delegates to rebut the criticism. David Koch offered a chance \u201cto expose the federal election laws as a sham,\u201d he said. Charles Koch\u2019s financial support of the party was \u201cnot evidence of a takeover, but rather of his commitment to libertarianism.\u201dThe Clark-Koch ticket easily won the party\u2019s support. Taking the stage with Mr. Clark on the final day of the convention, David Koch joked about his ambivalence.\u201cI feel if I practiced I\u2019m liable to become a politician, and I have a lot of mixed feelings about that,\u201d he told the crowd, according to an account published in The Libertarian Review. He denounced the \u201charassment\u201d of Koch Industries and implored the activists to make the party \u201ca force that will roll back the coercive force of government.\u201dFamily DiscordDavid Koch became an enthusiastic campaigner. He spoke on college campuses, before groups of business executives and at rallies for grass-roots libertarian activists. The ticket drew particular notice in Alaska, where sentiment was rising against federal takeovers of land. All told, Mr. Koch campaigned in 27 states.\u201cHe liked it, and he thought he got a good response, so he did more and more of it as time went on,\u201d Mr. Clark recalled in a telephone interview. Questions about the Kochs\u2019 motives arose on the trail. A campaign document written to prepare Mr. Clark for tough questions from the press included a section on the ticket\u2019s close ties to the oil and gas industry.\u201cMost of your campaign is financed by the oil-billionaire Koch family,\u201d read the hypothetical question, which continued: \u201cWouldn\u2019t a Clark administration simply be \u2018Rule by Big Oil\u2019?\u201dKoch Industries\u2019 clashes with the federal government were also intensifying. The Department of Energy continued to audit the company for violating federal oil price controls and overcharging retail energy customers.In an energy policy speech that May in Portland, Ore., David Koch railed against what he saw as overregulation. Presidents Nixon and Carter had bequeathed an \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d energy policy, he argued, a mix of subsidies and price controls that had stymied market forces and caused high prices and shortages.The campaign drew interest from many opinion writers and some local press coverage, but it struggled to be taken seriously by larger outlets. One of the most extensive stories about the campaign appeared in Ambassador, the in-flight magazine of Trans World Airlines.\u201cCharles was horrified that David had actually had to spend capital instead of just some of the interest on some of his money,\u201d said Ms. Pillsbury-Foster, who became a critic of the brothers\u2019 involvement in the libertarian movement.David Koch had no expectation of winning. \u201cIf we get 3 percent of the vote we\u2019ll consider it a moral victory,\u201d he told students on a visit to upstate New York.But in November, Mr. Clark and Mr. Koch won 921,128 votes, more than any earlier Libertarian ticket but barely more than 1 percent. The breakout minor candidate that year was John Anderson, while Ronald Reagan built a coalition of social conservatives, foreign policy hawks, disaffected Democrats and traditional conservatives that dominated American politics for the next decade.Discord within the family grew, and just before Thanksgiving, William Koch tried to seize control of the company in a boardroom coup. He accused Charles of mismanaging the firm and set in motion a bitter legal battle. The Clark-Koch campaign ended the year about $140,000 in debt.\u201cAs a candidate, meeting only libertarians, it seemed to me that everyone was voting for us,\u201d David Koch wrote in a letter to raise money to clear the party\u2019s debts. \u201cWe all got a little too optimistic.\u201dWithin a few years, a new faction won control of the Libertarian Party, and Charles and David Koch gradually withdrew.Today, the donor club overseen by the Kochs, known as Freedom Partners, generates hundreds of millions of dollars each election cycle. Since 1980, the Republican Party has moved closer to the Koch family\u2019s views on government regulation. Its rising members now court the Kochs and like-minded donors at twice-yearly \u201cseminars\u201d that the brothers organize. In 2012, David Koch was a delegate to the Republican National Convention.\u201cI think the Republican Party has a great chance of being successful and that\u2019s why I support it,\u201d Mr. Koch told reporters at an American Prosperity reception in Tampa, Fla., that year. \u201cThe Libertarian Party is a great concept. I love the ideals, but it got too far off the deep end, and so I dropped out.\u201dAn earlier version of this article, when giving the vote total for the 1980 Libertarian Party ticket, misidentified the presidential candidate. It was Ed Clark, not Ed Crane.\u00a0Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Loans That Avoid Banks? Maybe Not", "Date": "2014-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was that rare thing, scarcely seen in the financial world since the debut of the A.T.M. or microfinancing: an innovation to help regular people. When peer-to-peer, or P2P, lending began in the middle of the last decade, it offered an easy way for people to lend money to each other over the Internet.By cutting banks out of the process, borrowers typically got a lower interest rate than they would have paid on a credit card or a loan without collateral. And individual lenders earned higher returns \u2014 averaging in the high single digits \u2014 than they would have received by parking their money in a savings account or a certificate of deposit.That blend of altruism and yield attracted many individual investors, particularly in the wake of the financial crisis, when interest rates, and trust in banks, hit historic lows.Now, as the industry matures, a new class of investors is storming the P2P gates, and they include the very institutions that P2P had set out to bypass. Today, big financial firms, not small investors, dominate lending on the two platforms. At Prosper, which has been courting institutional lenders over the past year, more than 80 percent of the loans issued in March went to those firms. More than a dozen investment funds have been formed with the sole purpose of investing in peer-to-peer loans.P2P sites are also attracting some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names as board members and investors, and investment banks are vying to manage Lending Club\u2019s hotly anticipated initial public offering.\u00a0The influx of institutional money has supercharged the sector, allowing Prosper and Lending Club and a host of newcomers to extend more loans to more borrowers. Lending Club figures that it has saved borrowers $250 million in interest charges. The two platforms say they have made more than $5 billion in loans to date and have been doubling in growth every year.But investor demand is now outstripping the loan supply, spurring fierce competition among investors to snatch the best loans first. And the original P2P investors \u2014 the dentists, dabblers and stay-at-home moms who helped establish the market \u2014 are finding themselves outgunned by the cash-rich, algorithm-wielding arrivistes.Still, the Wall Street makeover \u2014 some would say takeover \u2014 of P2P lending is raising concerns as the new players begin securitizing loans and clamoring for more. Insiders predict a day when the loans are regularly sliced, diced and securitized, hedged, traded on secondary markets and tracked by exchange-traded funds.At the very least, the big players\u2019 entry runs counter to the original notion of P2P lending as a populist alternative to the high stakes world of Wall Street. The term \u201cpeer to peer\u201d has become something of a misnomer. Some of the latest lending platforms are ditching individual investors altogether to focus on big lenders.Acknowledging the growing role of institutions, Ron Suber, the president of Prosper, says the industry as a whole is better described as \u201conline consumer finance.\u201dAlgorithmic Cherry-PickingWhen Len Kendall, a digital-marketing executive in Chicago, was considering striking out on his own in 2012, he knew that he would have to live leaner. One place to cut back was his credit cards. Despite having an excellent credit score, over 700, he was paying 17 percent interest on about $10,000 in credit card debt. That was when he heard about Prosper.He applied for a loan and within days was approved for $10,000 to be paid back over three years at 7.5 percent interest. This loan was funded by dozens of small investors, who typically split investments over a large number of loans to diversify their risk. \u201cIt was a pretty simple decision,\u201d Mr. Kendall says. \u201cWhy should I pay more in interest than I have to?\u201dLending Club and Prosper focus on prime and near-prime borrowers, that is, consumers with FICO scores higher than 640. The platforms apply their own credit models and assign borrowers to categories reflecting their level of risk. In the case of traditional loans, banks pocket the profit. On P2P sites, the individual lenders do. \u201cThe difference is who\u2019s benefiting from it,\u201d says Renaud Laplanche, the founder and chief executive of Lending Club. Prosper and Lending Club take a small origination fee from the borrower and 1 percent of interest payments to the lenders.The sites\u2019 business model relies on scale: Lending Club, the market leader, earned $7 million on revenue of $98 million in 2013, its first full year of profitability after seven years. That was on loan volume of $2 billion.The fastest, and some say only, way to reach the kind of scale needed is to turn to institutions with boatloads of money to lend. Attracted by peer-to-peer\u2019s relatively high and predictable yields in a low-interest environment, big investors have jumped at the opportunity.The loans not taken by these sophisticated investors go back to a fractional lending pool that is open to both individual investors and institutions. That doesn\u2019t sit well with some. \u201cThe institutional investors are snapping up all the worthwhile loans,\u201d one investor wrote on Prosper\u2019s blog, echoing many comments.Scrambling to Meet DemandProsper and Lending Club have created speed limits, known as governors, to counter these moves, and they have instituted purchase limits to ensure that big buyers don\u2019t hog all the loans. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an arms race,\u201d Mr. Kassul says. \u201cThey put a governor on, but then everyone tries to trick the governor.\u201dLending Club and Prosper say they are trying to balance their lender mix among individuals, institutions and active fund managers. \u201cWe want to be extremely careful and not let a handful of investors drive our expansion,\u201d Mr. Laplanche of Lending Club says.And Mr. Suber of Prosper says, \u201cWe\u2019re making sure we stay true to our original business of P2P finance.\u201dStill, to meet demand, P2P executives are pushing into new, higher-yield markets. In March, Lending Club expanded into small-business lending, an area where a wide range of online lenders already operate, and in April it acquired Springstone Financial, which lends money to students and people undergoing elective surgery. This $140 million deal was financed in part by a $65 million equity infusion by T. Rowe Price, BlackRock and other institutional funds, which valued Lending Club at nearly $4 billion.The changes worry some investors. \u201cThey already have a problem keeping up with demand,\u201d says Ian Ippolito, an entrepreneur in Tampa, Fla., who invests on Lending Club. \u201cThe question is, would they be tempted to lower their quality to attract more borrowers?\u201dIt\u2019s not an idle question. The first P2P loan portfolios have been securitized, ratings agencies are looking at the market, and insurance companies are considering products that would allow investors to hedge against loan defaults.The dynamics taking shape \u2014 high demand for riskier loan categories, hedge funds leveraging and securitizing their investments \u2014 raise troublesome parallels to the mortgage crisis of 2008.Many in the industry see little risk of a crisis, at least for now. At several billion dollars, the current P2P market is far too small to present any systemic risk, and P2P executives say lending has been handled responsibly. However, unlike a bank loan that requires collateral, the loans are unsecured. Also in contrast to a bank\u2019s typical practice, the P2P sites don\u2019t always verify a borrower\u2019s income. These factors result in higher risk and potential higher return.All the peer-to-peer lending sites are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, among other agencies. Because Prosper and Lending Club work with individual investors, they are required to register each loan they offer to the public as a security.In the event of another downturn, defaults would probably rise. But P2P executives say their underwriting is more transparent and their marketplace model more resilient than those of the banking system. \u201cYou would have to have a catastrophic default,\u201d says Mr. Kassul at Ranger Capital.To assert some control, Lending Club and Prosper insist on approving leverage levels and securitization plans in their financial agreements with big lenders. \u201cWe get all sorts of financial engineers come to us saying they want to create a derivative market, a credit default swap market,\u201d Mr. Suber says, \u201cand we say no, we are not participating in that.\u201dSmall-Investor StabilityNo matter where the bulk of the money is coming from, marketers like to emphasize the human face of P2P lending. A direct-mail solicitation from Lending Club reads, \u201cInstead of paying interest to a credit card company or on a traditional bank loan, you get your loan through ordinary people like YOU who want to invest in YOUR success.\u201dThat\u2019s because the notion of P2P as a marketplace of individuals resonates with the public. On Zopa, which has underwritten more than 500 million pounds, or $840 million, in loans with only retail lenders, borrowers have reported feeling more responsibility to repay a loan when they know that another person has lent the money. The site\u2019s tiny default rate of less than 0.2 percent seems to back that up.\u201cWe\u2019re proof you can have a market of reasonable scale with just retail lenders,\u201d says Mr. Andrews, Zopa\u2019s chief executive. Lately, he has been approached by British institutions about investing on Zopa. \u201cWe welcome that,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe key is how to manage it.\u201dSome start-ups, such as Lendvious, LendingRobot and Lend Academy, are creating tools to help small investors achieve better returns. And new platforms will arise that cater to retail investors, Mr. Renton at Lend Academy predicts. \u201cWe\u2019ll see more niche sites emerge that say, \u2018Let\u2019s get back to the roots of this,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he says.Small investors, it turns out, add much-needed stability to the market. Hedge funds and institutions tend to pull out of an asset class when another sector becomes more attractive. With retail investors, \u201cit\u2019s not just a handful of institutional investors behaving the same way at the same time,\u201d Mr. Laplanche says. \u201cIt\u2019s tens of thousands of people making their own decisions.\u201d It was individual investors, after all, who stuck with Prosper and Lending Club as they grappled with regulatory and operational hurdles in the early days.Given the stability and the cachet that small investors bring, the online consumer lenders will try hard to maintain a balance. But it\u2019s a challenge.Like other sectors of the collaborative economy, where people directly rent out or lend assets such as cars, homes and skills to others, P2P lending originated in part as a way to take back some economic control from institutions that had lost public trust. So the shift to large institutions causes some to pause.An article last Sunday about peer-to-peer lending, which began as a way for individuals to lend money to each other online, misidentified a hedge fund that has entered the sector. It is Arcadia Funds, not Arcadia Capitol Advisors.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amid Drawdown, Fears of Taliban Resurgence and Economic Collapse", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 In recent years, the growing resentment in Afghanistan toward American forces\u2019 raids and airstrikes has been balanced, in part, by concerns about what might happen after foreign troops leave.That ambivalence about the American presence here was again illustrated on Wednesday in reactions to President Obama\u2019s announcement that the United States would leave 9,800 troops in Afghanistan after the NATO-led combat mission here ends this year, and that nearly all troops would be gone by the end of 2016.In interviews with officials and business leaders, one common reaction to the decision was the belief that too few American troops were being left behind for too few years.Some worried that announcing such a short deadline would allow the Taliban to easily wait out the American presence, or that the quick drawdown would put Afghanistan\u2019s weak economy at greater risk of failure.Many of the Afghan politicians who are considered progressives to the West also were the most hawkish in their response to the news, fearful that the coming withdrawal would embolden conservatives to roll back the rights won by women and minorities here since 2001.\u201cThe government and the people are facing tremendous challenges,\u201d said Fawzia Koofi, a member of Parliament and women\u2019s rights advocate. She added: \u201cI think at least we need another 10 years of direct support and five years of indirect support from the international community, especially the U.S., to turn this country into a proper and prosperous country.\u201dUnderpinning the desire to see American forces remain is Afghans\u2019 keen sense of history. The American decision to leave Afghanistan to its own devices after Soviet forces withdrew in 1989 is viewed here as a betrayal that ultimately gave rise to the Taliban, and the American invasion in 2001.Most Afghans hate the thought of repeating the civil strife of the past two decades, and the widespread perception until Tuesday was that the United States\u2019 desire to sign a long-term security agreement with Afghanistan meant that American forces would remain for 10 more years, or perhaps even longer.The security deal still has to be signed. But both Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, the contenders to replace President Hamid Karzai in the presidential runoff vote scheduled for June 14, have said they would sign the deal as soon as they took office.Yet neither Mr. Ghani nor Mr. Abdullah chose to comment on Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement. Neither wanted to risk alienating Afghanistan\u2019s largest benefactor or turning off voters, said officials from both campaigns.Even though few of those interviewed said they expected large numbers of American troops to remain in Afghanistan after the NATO-led mission ends this year, some said they were still caught off guard by the speed with which the American forces would be withdrawn.Hajji Agha Lalai, a member of the provincial council in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan, noted that the Americans had promised that \u201cthey will stay until Afghans are able to defend their country on their own.\u201dBut \u201cif we look at the situation now,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s pretty shaky and unstable.\u201dScratch the surface, though, and even those who were adamant about the need for American forces to remain said they did not want to see them actually conducting raids.\u201cThere is no need for them to go to the villages,\u201d said Ahmad Jan, 30, who runs a small jewelry shop in Kabul. \u201cThey should stay in their bases and just train the Afghans to do the fighting.\u201dThe United States could not overcome the Taliban with 100,000 soldiers, Mr. Jan pointed out, and concluded, \u201cWe have proven that we are better fighters than Americans.\u201dSpeaking to reporters, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford, the top American commander in Afghanistan, sought to highlight the certainty provided by Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement. \u201cI believe that the decision was good news for the Afghan people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt eliminates the uncertainty about the future.\u201dFew Afghans seemed convinced. A running theme connecting much of the reaction was the widely held view here that the Taliban are a proxy force for Pakistan, which is the real problem that the United States needed to deal with. The American refusal to militarily confront Pakistan, where much of the Taliban leadership resides, is a source of near universal frustration in Afghanistan.Mr. Karzai channeled that frustration in his almost offhand reaction to Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement. The Afghan leader has in recent years often been the country\u2019s most vocal critic of the United States outside the Taliban, and he has refused to sign the security deal, which he negotiated, in part because he has maintained that the United States is too close to Pakistan.A statement from his office focused largely on reports that Pakistani forces had shelled villages in northeastern Afghanistan for the past two days, saying that General Dunford and Ambassador James Cunningham dismissed the reports as \u201cexaggerated\u201d when they met with Mr. Karzai on Wednesday.But later at the same meeting, the statement said, Afghan military officials provided a briefing saying that more than 300 mortar shells had struck Kunar Province in the past two days, wounding 12 people and destroying homes.At the very end, it mentioned that General Dunford had briefed the Afghan president on Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement, but it offered no comment beyond a truncated recounting of what the American commander had said.Even the Taliban offered a tepid response on Wednesday. The insurgents condemned Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement, but dispensed with their usual rhetorical flourishes.\u201cWhat American leaders might do in two years, they should do it today,\u201d they said, adding that the Taliban \u201cjihad won\u2019t be canceled by the decrease in number of soldiers.\u201dTaimoor Shah contributed reporting from Kandahar, Afghanistan, and Habib Zahori from Kabul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Amsterdam Design Conference, a Call to Action", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Art of Collecting: Frieze New YorkAMSTERDAM \u2014 Can we create buildings that heal the environment? Are there graphics that can make it simple for everyone to learn Chinese? Can luxury knitwear help preserve traditional African cultures?These are a few of the questions being addressed this week at \u201cWhat Design Can Do,\u201d a two-day conference in Amsterdam that is bringing together some of the world\u2019s leading thinkers on design and challenging them to use their skills to help improve the world. \u201cWe want to show that design is more than just a beautiful illustration or a nice chair; it\u2019s also a tool to solve problems,\u201d said Richard van der Laken, who is among the designers that founded the conference in 2011 and is its creative director. \u201cIt can be much more than just aesthetics. For creative people themselves, it\u2019s a call to action: You have these skills, so please use them in a way that benefits society.\u201dAt the conference here on Thursday and Friday, 25-minute lectures by some 20 speakers are highlighting design projects that have a potential social impact, whether addressing environmental, educational, economic, or cultural concerns. Speakers include the British fashion designer Paul Smith; Richard Th\u00e9 of Germany, senior designer at Google Creative Lab; and the American architect and professor Teddy Cruz, who has investigated cultural conflict at the San Diego-Tijuana border between the United States and Mexico. There is also Laduma Ngxokolo, an African textile and knitwear designer who created knitwear using traditional Xhosa beadwork motifs and patterns for manhood initiation rituals and influenced Western haute couture along the way, as well as ShaoLan Hsueh, a Taiwan-born, London-based venture capital investor who invented a graphic-design-based pictorial system to teach her children Chinese, called \u201cChineasy.\u201d The conference is also featuring breakout sessions so the 1,200 participants can discuss the presentations, network, and, potentially, develop new collaborations and ideas. \u201cWhat I hope is that people will pick up the inspiration that we offer and will make new connections and bring that into action,\u201d said Mr. van der Laken, one of the founders of the Amsterdam-based graphic design agency De DesignPolitie (The Design Police). \u201cWe offer them a structure and a platform and a call to action, and we can facilitate that, but in the end people have to do it themselves.\u201dThe conference is reflective of a shift taking place across disciplines in the world of design today, said Paola Antonelli, senior curator of the Department of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who is one of the conference\u2019s introductory speakers. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in architecture, it\u2019s happening in some product design \u2014 of course not in the big companies yet \u2014 it\u2019s happening in speculative design, and in graphic design, it\u2019s throughout,\u201d Ms. Antonelli said recently by telephone from the Milan. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because design is connected to its present and when people are changing and cultures are changing, design helps the change happen.\u201dShe said the design community\u2019s engagement with social activism had fluctuated through the years, with peaks in the 1960s and early 1970s and smaller crests later in the 20th century. Today, she noted, \u201cthere\u2019s a much more activist kind of design than it was in the 1980s and mid-90s, but it\u2019s an activism that\u2019s not overtly political or militant, it\u2019s just a matter-of-fact, different approach to design all together.\u201dThree cultural currents are driving the new ways that designers must conceive of their projects, Ms. Antonelli said: open source, the maker movement, and the share economy. For example, she said, with statistics indicating that fewer young people want to own a car, \u201call of a sudden car companies have to design cars for people who don\u2019t want to own cars but want to use them at their convenience.\u201d \u201cThe same thing is happening with homes, like with the success of AirBnB,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the future, architects might have to design homes that can be shared.\u201dClimate change is another force behind innovative design, Ms. Antonelli said. At the conference, Rachel Armstrong, a British-based designer, scientist, and former physician, is addressing how some environmental damage can be reversed by architectural design that incorporates biological or natural elements. Examples include the creation of algae fa\u00e7ades for high-rise buildings that can absorb and consume carbon dioxide in cities or Phillips\u2019 Microbial Home project, a domestic ecosystem that welcomes certain bacterial organisms into our living spaces to do things like manage waste or produce light.\u201cBy inviting nature into hidden spaces we can start to transform the impact of buildings,\u201d Ms. Armstrong said in a telephone interview. \u201cWith the advent of 30 years of biotechnology, we now have insights into the way that natural processes work, so we can actually start to shape them. Although we\u2019ve been culturally conditioned to think of technology as being machines, new technological possibilities lie within the natural world.\u201dMs. Armstrong believes that it is particularly important for designers to have opportunities such as the \u201cWhat Design Can Do\u201d conference to \u201ccross-pollinate.\u201d\u201cI think design meeting itself and interrogating its own capabilities and defining an agenda for itself to create a common purpose \u2014 even if it\u2019s for the next year \u2014 is incredibly empowering,\u201d she said.For Ms. Antonelli, who also runs a research and development department at MoMA, asking what design can do is critical to moving perceptions of design and the design community. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of design being considered decoration and cute objects, and things you can buy and consume,\u201d she said. \u201cA conference like this for me is fantastic because it shows that the whole realm of design can come together to improve society. So it\u2019s not about people buying cute chairs but people thinking and living in a different way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fringe Gets Bigger", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialDespite a widespread sense that something akin to an earthquake had struck the Continent, the vote does not mean the European project \u2014 the \u201cever closer union\u201d promised by the Treaty of Rome in 1957 \u2014 is in any immediate danger of being voted out of existence by hostile xenophobes sitting in the European Parliament. Though the Euroskeptics will be a sizable, if fragmented bloc, the parties most supportive of the union will command almost 70 percent of the 751 seats. Even so, Europe\u2019s leaders must now take serious stock of mounting frustration, apathy and even antipathy to the very idea of union.The European Parliament has fewer powers than Europe\u2019s national legislatures. The turnout has always been small, and many voters use the European ballot to punish their national parties and leaders. Moreover, this came in the wake of a protracted and painful economic crisis in Europe. More than a tenth of the work force, about 26 million Europeans, is unemployed, with the highest rates in the countries hit hardest by the euro crisis. That, in turn, has increased suspicion among poorer Europeans that foreigners are taking their jobs.But European leaders would be foolish to see this as a transitory protest that will dissipate as economic recovery takes hold. Many Europeans appear to feel that the mainstream parties have become deaf to their problems and mired in scandal and inaction. In France, the dismal showing of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s Socialists was accompanied by yet another political scandal in the center-right opposition. In Britain, for instance, UKIP capitalized on fatigue with business as usual to take 27 percent of the vote over Labour\u2019s 25 percent and 23 percent for the Conservatives. By contrast, it was noteworthy that in Italy, the three-month-old center-left government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi got 40.8 percent of the vote in a whopping endorsement of his promise of far-reaching reform.The challenge for Europe\u2019s leaders is to find ways to resolve the tension between the union and the 28 national identities they represent. Their immediate task is to select a new president of the European Commission to replace the departing Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, a process in which government leaders are required to take \u201cinto account\u201d the results of the election.Clearly, the choice will be important in the search for ways to increase trust in the European project. But the election must also prompt a serious discussion on issues like immigration, which touch on nearly every member country, and more broadly on whether the European Union has, in fact, become too intrusive and controlling.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Economic Recovery Yields Few Benefits for the Voters Democrats Rely On", "Date": "2014-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Signs that a long-awaited economic recovery may finally be gaining steam should be welcome news for President Obama and his party as they try to stem losses in this year\u2019s midterm elections. But rising payrolls, lower unemployment and a buoyed stock market, while lifting the fortunes of the rich, are leaving behind major Democratic constituencies, including young women and blacks, just as the party tries to motivate them to turn out to vote in November.\u201cThere\u2019s a recovery for some people, you know, and other people, not so much,\u201d said James Carville, a Democratic strategist, who likened the current conditions to those in 1994, when Democrats were trounced despite an economy that was clearly in recovery.Though broad measures of the economy are showing signs of improvement, a closer look at important indicators among individual groups reveals that voting blocs critical to Democrats in recent elections are not yet feeling the benefits.Consider women, whose unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent, up almost two percentage points from when Mr. Obama took office, as they weighed whether to vote in the midterms of 2010. Today, it is 5.7 percent, a seemingly shining number for Democrats desperate to widen the gender gap.But while the number of women out of work appears to be much improved, the number of women employed compared with the total female population is 55.2 percent, actually worse than it was in October 2010. Progress, in fact, is a mirage, the product of what economists call the disappearing work force: people giving up and dropping out.\u201cAfter all these years, it\u2019s no wonder people are still feeling the weight of the Great Recession,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, which tracks the well-being of the poor and the working class, \u201cbecause the weight is still there.\u201dMidterm elections tend to be fueled more by mood than by policy, and five years after the recession\u2019s official end, core Democratic constituents might be forgiven for their sour mood or disenchantment with the president.Voters with family incomes below $30,000 backed Mr. Obama against Mitt Romney 63 percent to 35 percent in 2012, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. According to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in late April, 46 percent of such voters said they would vote for a Democrat running for Congress, versus 43 percent who would vote Republican. Women between the ages of 18 and 49 would back a Democrat over a Republican for Congress 48 percent to 42 percent, much narrower than the gap of 59 percent to 39 percent that Mr. Obama enjoyed.In contrast, Democratic prospects have improved among those who are better off. Voters with incomes over $100,000 backed Mr. Romney 54 percent to Mr. Obama\u2019s 44 percent in 2012. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in April, voters with incomes over $100,000 would back a Republican over a Democrat for Congress 46 percent to 44 percent. Even Republicans, usually loath to draw class distinctions, see the dynamic. \u201cPeople are working harder, but they are being left behind,\u201d said Representative Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican who is running to unseat Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat. \u201cNot everyone can be a doctor or a lawyer.\u201dThe politics of the economy mirror the economic statistics. In employment prospects, job security and wage growth for all but the most affluent, the recovery remains anemic at best, a difficult selling point for the party that has held both the White House and the Senate for more than five years. Democracy Corps, a Democratic polling firm, advised Democratic candidates to give up hope on the economy and drive home a populist message comparing the fortunes of the top 1 percent with the struggles of everyone else.\u201cAs a start, Democrats should bury any mention of \u2018the recovery,\u2019\u00a0\u201d stated an April memo from the group, which includes Mr. Carville and Stanley B. Greenberg, who were two political strategists for Bill Clinton. The discontent is manifest not in the headline numbers \u2014 falling unemployment, rising payrolls, climbing corporate profits that have fueled a healthy stock market \u2014 but in numbers deeper in the weeds.Nearly 6.7 million people reported holding multiple jobs as Americans prepared to vote in 2010. That number now tops more than seven million.In October 2010, more than 2.57 million said they worked part time because those were the only jobs they could find. In April, 2.62 million said that. Average hourly earnings stood at $18.46 when Mr. Obama took office, $22.73 at the last midterm elections, and $24.31 in April \u2014 slow but steady progress, even adjusting that 2009 figure for inflation, to $20.40. But income growth has been very uneven, said Heather Boushey, an economist at the Center for American Progress, a research institution closely allied with the president. Income for households in the exact middle of the income distribution declined 4.26 percent from 2009 to 2012, the last year for which data is available. For white households, mean income declined by 2.2 percent. For black homes, the decline was 4.5 percent; for Hispanics, 4.2 percent.Meanwhile, pretax income for the top 1 percent grew by 31 percent over that same time frame. The other 99 percent saw income growth of 0.4 percent.An obscure measure of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Jolts (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey), shows that layoffs are no longer the big concern they once were, but the \u201cquits rate,\u201d which measures workers\u2019 willingness to leave a job voluntarily, remains depressed. That indicates people remain fearful of their prospects, unwilling to take risks, and thus unable to get ahead.Measuring what economists call the employment-population ratio is even more telling \u2014 and for Democrats, most disturbing. Blacks, whose support for Mr. Obama has been unwavering, have seen their unemployment rate drop from 15.7 percent at the last midterms to 11.6 percent, still high but a considerable improvement. But the rate at which they are employed has barely moved, to 53.8 percent of the black population from 52.4. Black women have seen no improvement in their employment rate.Support among black voters for a Democratic congressional candidate stands around 77 percent. It was 93 percent near Election Day 2012.Hispanics, the bulwark in 2010 that kept the Senate in Democratic hands, have seen their unemployment rate fall nearly in half since then, to 7.3 percent from 12.6 percent. But Hispanic employment has risen just barely, from 58.6 percent to 60.8 percent of the Hispanic population. Jared Bernstein, a former economist for the Obama White House, put it this way: Since the end of the recession, the gross domestic product has grown 11 percent, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is up 83 percent, corporate profits have swelled 53 percent \u2014 and median household income, in the most up-to-date numbers, has fallen 4 percent.\u201cThe broad story is that economic growth is absolutely necessary to help the middle class and poor, but it\u2019s not sufficient,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about this inequality problem in abstract, but concretely, for any given amount of growth, you\u2019re going to get less in the middle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New Wave of Oyster Bars", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cTo me, oysters are one of those perfect foods,\u201d said Mr. Cimarusti, who regards their appreciation as a national character trait dating back to early Native Americans. \u201cConnie & Ted\u2019s is really a celebration of American seafood. It just seemed like it was perfectly right to have a big oyster bar and to make oysters a big focus of what we do.\u201d Countless chefs across the country have come to a similar conclusion, and the result is a crop of ambitious new restaurants that start with the humble oyster bar and take it in fresh directions, applying all the precepts of the modern culinary canon: a focus on seasonality, an eagerness to surprise, and a commitment to cooking styles that maintain regional identities even as they breach national borders.Yet within the old framework, American chefs have demonstrated an uncanny ability to innovate. They take advantage of airfreight to showcase fresh shellfish from nonlocal waters, not only allowing East Coast restaurants to serve West Coast oysters (and vice versa) but also bringing the shellfish to landlocked cities like Nashville, Minneapolis and Denver. When the Japanese-themed oyster bar ICHI Kakiya opens in San Francisco this summer, it will serve West Coast oysters, though not exclusively. \u201cWherever the oysters are good for that season, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have,\u201d said Tim Archuletta, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Erin. The cooked dishes at these oyster houses are more diverse as well, reflecting the palates of a widely traveled generation of chefs and, in some cases, the ethnic makeup of the communities they serve. The Atlantic blue crab in the crab cakes at Fishing With Dynamite nods to the summers Mr. LeFevre spent as a child in Onancock, Va. But his cooking is equally influenced by the Mexican and Southeast Asian cuisine he has encountered in Los Angeles. Ponzu and pico de gallo are served as oyster condiments, along with cocktail sauce and mignonette. In February, a special sandwich containing a pork-and-shrimp cake flavored with curry and Kaffir lime was called \u201cPretty Thai for a White Guy.\u201d\u201cMy goal with Fishing With Dynamite was to combine the East Coast love of seafood with the West Coast vibe,\u201d Mr. LeFevre said.The simple New England oyster bars and clam shacks her family had visited on vacation provided a convenient model for Pearl\u2019s cramped original space, which contained a small kitchen, a counter and a single table. But the restaurant has always been more than just a folksy homage to coastal Maine. Ms. Charles chose to serve fried oysters instead of clams, she said, \u201cbecause I loved New Orleans.\u201d She included bouillabaisse, wine-steamed mussels and whole grilled fish because she believed they dovetailed well with the rest of the menu. In her words, she wanted \u201cto do it the way a chef would do it.\u201d\u201cWe consider ourselves a traditional south Louisiana seafood restaurant,\u201d said Ryan Prewitt, the chef and co-owner. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t think New Orleans needed another fried seafood place.\u201d (P\u00eache Seafood Grill was named the best new restaurant in America by the James Beard Foundation on Monday, and Mr. Prewitt was named a co-recipient of the Beard award for the best chef in the South.)One evening, the tavern\u2019s chef, Chris Lorenz, multitasked, shucking Sunken Meadow oysters from Cape Cod Bay and fixing absinthe-scented razor clams with trout roe and shaved fennel. Adolfo Garcia, the owner, sat at the marble-top cocktail bar, recalling how raw oysters had been at the center of so many gatherings in his native Huatulco, on Mexico\u2019s Pacific Coast. \u201cPeople here, they\u2019re treating them the same way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in from work and ordering a dozen and a Sazerac. And the Chicago community, they\u2019re thinking outside the box. They\u2019re not just ordering Blue Points. They\u2019re ordering Miyagis. They\u2019re going oyster crazy.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Faces Hurdles, Country by Country, in Bid to Expand in Europe", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Netflix, whose digital distribution of movies and TV shows has made it a media force in the United States, now has wide eyes for Europe.The American company said on Wednesday that it plans to expand its European offerings to six more countries, including Germany and France.But it will face a variety of challenges in taking on Europe\u2019s entrenched players country by country, including the fact that many of the domestic pay-TV companies already have exclusive rights to some of the programming that Netflix\u2019s service typically carries.In France, for example, Netflix will be unable to offer subscribers its own most popular in-house production, the political drama series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d starring Kevin Spacey. The pay-television giant Canal Plus already has the French rights to the series.But with its growth in the United States beginning to slow, Netflix may have no choice but to forge ahead in Europe, where it already has a foothold in Britain, Scandinavia and the Netherlands with a subscription service via cable or Internet broadband for which it charges the equivalent of about $10 a month.The company did not say how much it would charge subscribers in the new markets it plans to enter, which are also to include Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland by the end of the year. But analysts say the arrival of a new competitor could prompt price wars, and that whatever impact that may have on the companies, it could be good news for consumers.\u201cThe opportunity for online video services is large,\u201d said Cesar Bachelet, senior analyst at the technology research company Analysys Mason. Mr. Bachelet expects the number of pay-TV households in Western Europe\u2019s largest economies to increase more than fourfold by 2019, to 24.5 million.Netflix\u2019s expansion, to begin later this year, would be the company\u2019s biggest rollout since it arrived in Europe in 2011. And wherever it turns, from Finland to France, Netflix will run into video-on-demand services that got there before it.In Britain, Netflix has been battling the satellite giant Sky. Canal Plus already dominates the French market. And in Germany, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s on-demand TV service is the powerhouse. But there are also other smaller rivals in each of these markets, as well.And then there is Amazon, Netflix\u2019s American rival, which already offers on-demand broadband video services across the Continent.Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans or on how it would compete with so many established players.\u201cWe will let our current performance speak for itself,\u201d Mr. Evers said by email on Wednesday. The company\u2019s share price rose 3.2 percent in early afternoon trading in New York on Wednesday.Besides battling incumbents in 13 European countries, Netflix will also need to arrange rights deals for both American and local content in each of those markets.That contrasts with its United States experience, where it has signed agreements for movies and television programs for the entire country.The competition for the best programming could prove fierce. In Germany, for example, Sky Deutschland, a satellite television operator, already has rolled out an on-demand video service, for which it has signed deals for popular American series like \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d France could prove even more challenging, according to Mr. Bachelet. \u201cThe French market is tough because it already has pay-TV providers that offer a lot of content,\u201d he said.To complicate matters, French laws require a delay in the online release of films until at least three years after they are shown in movie theaters. Netflix, whose European headquarters are in Luxembourg, also may be forced to help pay for film production in France to comply with national rules for distributors.Despite the challenges, Netflix is eager to diversify beyond its core market in the United States, which now represents 72 percent of its 49.8 million global subscribers, according to its latest financial statement. The company also operates across Latin America.Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has said he wants to generate up to 80 percent of the company\u2019s revenue from international markets. That would be a big step up from today\u2019s portion, about 27 percent.Rivals notwithstanding, Europe offers Netflix a potentially attractive growth area, as countries like Germany and France have built up extensive high-speed broadband networks that would be conduits for the company\u2019s programming.\u201cThese are big markets where you can sell to a large number of affluent customers,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at the technology consultancy Jackdaw Research. \u201cMany Europeans are open to watching U.S. content.\u201dAnalysts say Netflix, which has primarily focused on older content more than on recent releases, could also survive in parallel to European rivals that have invested heavily in new movies and television shows. Netflix in some ways serves as a living archive, with TV shows like \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d from the 1990s or movies like \u201cBack to the Future\u201d from 1985.Such fare has enabled the company in Britain, for example, to partner with the cable television operator Virgin Media, which offers new customers a six-month free subscription to Netflix when they sign up for a cable package.That is similar to its approach in the United States, where Netflix has garnered more than 30 million subscribers nationwide, despite consumers continuing to pay for cable subscriptions from carriers like Time Warner Cable.Europe also offers Netflix more regulatory certainty than the United States.That contrasts with the United States, where regulators are still mulling changes that might allow network operators to charge companies like Netflix extra to use their cable networks because their video services soak up a lot of Internet capacity.Europe\u2019s stance on net neutrality, analysts say, would allow Netflix to stream its services to European customers without it having to pay for access to broadband, cable or mobile networks.The company\u2019s European plans have put it head-to-head with Amazon, whose Prime service, which includes online video content, costs around $11 a month. That compares with Sky Deutschland, which charges the equivalent of about $13.50 a month for a Netflix-like service, while Canal Plus\u2019s comparable offering in France costs about the same.Amazon\u2019s European video efforts date to 2011, when it bought the British on-demand video company Lovefilm for 200 million pounds, about $337 million. Lovefilm, which has been incorporated into Amazon Prime, has now expanded across Europe, particularly in Germany.While exact figures on Amazon\u2019s video subscribers are not available, analysts say the number of Prime customers stands at around 20 million worldwide, or less than half of Netflix\u2019s total number of global users.In a study by Decipher Media Research in London, Netflix was seen to be adding British subscribers at a faster rate than Amazon. That is partly because Amazon is a more diverse brand, not necessarily known for video programming, and partly because of interest in Netflix\u2019s original content, like \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\u201cNetflix has a bigger catalogue of content than Amazon,\u201d said Mr. Dawson of Jackdaw Research. \u201cVideo streaming is what its brand is known for.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated an offer from the British cable operator Virgin Media. It offers new customers a six-month free subscription to Netflix; the subscription is not permanently free.Advertisement"}

The average stock trades at 16 times its earnings over the last year, according to S&P Capital IQ. That\u2019s slightly higher than the historical average. Some technology stocks, however, are valued much higher. Amazon\u2019s stock has lost 27 percent this year, but it is still trading at a lofty 465 times earnings.\u201cMany of these stocks have come down a lot, but you can\u2019t say they\u2019re cheap,\u201d Mr. Kleintop said.High prices reflect expectations for higher earnings, and companies in the S.&P. 500 are on track to report that earnings increased 3 percent in the first quarter, according to S&P Capital IQ. The problem is, earnings growth is slowing down. In the previous quarter, earnings jumped nearly 8 percent.And there are concerns about future profits. Of the companies that have provided forecasts for the second quarter, nearly nine out of 10 have warned of weaker earnings.Whole Foods dropped $9.02, or 19 percent, to $38.93 after the grocery chain cut its profit outlook for the third time in six months.Among technology stocks, NetApp, a data management and storage company, fell $1.28, or 4 percent, to $33.70 and Salesforce.com lost $1.35, or 2.6 percent, to $50.43.

{"Headline": "Reaping Benefits of Expansion, Emirates\u2019 Profit Rises 43%", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut some analysts warned that the carrier, the world\u2019s fourth-largest in terms of the number of international passengers, risked slower growth in the coming years as heavy investments in new planes and premium-class services begin to erode profit margins.The airline, which is the world\u2019s largest customer for the twin-deck Airbus A380 as well as for Boeing\u2019s new 777 jet, said it carried 44.5 million passengers last year, up 13 percent, as it added nine destinations in Asia, Europe and North America, and took delivery of two dozen new planes.Seat capacity growth of around 14 percent outpaced growth in the airline\u2019s fuel bill, which rose by around 10 percent to just under 31 billion dirhams, the airline said. Because of a drop in jet fuel prices over the year, Emirates said it had succeeded in reducing its fuel cost per seat by around 4 percent.\u201cOn the face of it, it\u2019s good that they still have increased profitability\u201d over the past year, said Saj Ahmad, chief analyst for StrategicAero Research in London. \u201cBut I wonder whether they could soon be hitting the buffers in terms of how much physical expansion starts eating into their profitability.\u201dFacing intense competition from smaller Gulf carriers like Qatar Airways and Etihad of Abu Dhabi \u2014 particularly for coveted first- and business-class passengers \u2014 Emirates is engaged in an ever-more heated battle with its rivals in the region to acquire the latest aircraft from Airbus and Boeing.Emirates, which is wholly owned by the Dubai government, turned industry heads in November when it placed orders for 150 of Boeing\u2019s new 777X \u2014 a revamped version of its popular wide-body aircraft \u2014 with an option for 50 more, and ordered an additional 50 Airbus A380s on top of the 93 it had on order for delivery by 2019. Etihad and Qatar announced orders for roughly 200 new wide-bodies between them.Referring to Emirates, Mr. Ahmad said, \u201cThey are obviously impacted by this more than anyone else.\u201dEmirates brushes such concerns aside, however, as it continues to bet on a long-term future that rests heavily on the support of its only shareholder, the Investment Corporation of Dubai, to which Emirates said Thursday it would pay a dividend of roughly 1 billion dirhams, equivalent to nearly one-third of last year\u2019s profit.Air transport is big business in Dubai and the rest of the United Arab Emirates, representing nearly 15 percent of gross domestic product. Airlines in the Middle East \u2014 driven largely by Emirates and its Gulf rivals \u2014 are expected to register a combined $2.2 billion profit in 2014, a record for the region, according to forecasts by the International Air Transport Association.With the help of Dubai\u2019s rulers, Emirates takes full advantage of its strategic location. The Persian Gulf within an eight-hour direct flight of the fast-growing economies of Asia, as well as the big economies of Europe and the United States.By offering connections through the glittering terminals of Dubai International Airport \u2014 among the world\u2019s most modern and, spanning nearly 400 acres, largest air terminals \u2014 Emirates and its Gulf rivals have pushed aggressively into the home markets of leading European and North American carriers, focusing in particular on wealthy business travelers.The Dubai carrier\u2019s first-class and business-class services are consistently rated among the world\u2019s best in passenger surveys, offering amenities like private \u201csuites\u201d with showers and spas, as well as a stand-up bar. Last year, it was ranked first out of 200 airlines in the Airline of the Year survey by Skytrax, a British air travel research company. The survey is based on an online satisfaction survey of 18 million passengers worldwide.Last year, Emirates sought to leverage its high-end reputation and confront European and American rivals head-on by introducing its first daily trans-Atlantic service between Milan and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The route, set up as a stopover between Dubai and New York, competes directly with nonstop connections offered by Italy\u2019s struggling flag carrier, Alitalia, as well as Delta, American Airlines and United, which flies to nearby Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.Sheikh Ahmed said on Thursday that Emirates would continue to operate the Milan-New York route pending the outcome of its appeal of the Italian ruling, which is expected in the fall. While he declined to provide financial figures, he insisted the route was profitable for the airline.\u201cI don\u2019t think we operate any political routes,\u201d he said.But analysts stressed that making money on the trans-Atlantic service was probably a secondary concern for now.\u201cEmirates has so many profitable routes in Europe that they could cross-subsidize this route for as long as they need to,\u201d Mr. Ahmad, the StrategicAero analyst, said. Provided Emirates is able to persuade the courts that trans-Atlantic flights are compliant with European laws, he said, \u201cthey might eventually be able to make this work from Spain or Germany as well.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the amount that jet fuel prices had fallen over Emirates\u2019 fiscal year. Jet fuel averaged just under $3 per gallon in the year to March 31, 2013; it is not the case that jet fuel prices over that period fell by roughly $4 a gallon.Advertisement"}

Eliminating drug abuse, doubling the global share of renewable energy by 2030 and achieving protection of agricultural biodiversity are either ambiguous or would cost more than their expected benefits.\u201cThese goals are going to mobilize up to $700 billion in resources,\u201d Mr. Lomborg told me. \u201cIf we can just get one poor target replaced by one phenomenal target, we can generate billions in benefits.\u201dThe tension over the new set of global objectives extends beyond the quality of the individual goals, however. The deepest disagreements are over who will shoulder the burden of achieving them. Who will provide the money? How much? On what terms will the technology transfer from rich to poor occur? \u201cEverything that has to do with the \u2018how\u2019 is controversial,\u201d the rich-country diplomat told me.This kind of tension is not unique to these Sustainable Development Goals. From global trade to climate change, it comes up every time countries swap and apportion rights and responsibilities. It is probably easier to overcome in a debate over aspirational objectives like the S.D.G.s than in more bare-knuckled negotiations over things like limits on carbon emissions.Still, such divergent views highlight an essential question: Can common targets actually push development forward?William Easterly, a development economist at New York University, is one of the profession\u2019s most determined skeptics. Global development experts, he says, mistake development for an engineering problem that experts like themselves can correctly identify and address.In the real world, Professor Easterly says, development occurs as people identify problems and push for solutions through their political systems. Setting global goals that nobody is truly accountable for achieving not only misrepresents what causes poverty but also substitutes goal-setting for real action.The initial development goals, he says, were just \u201ca brilliant campaign by the U.N. to get a bigger seat at the table,\u201d muscling into turf that until then had been the domain of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.Arvind Subramanian, a development economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, shares a similar perspective. While there are crucial challenges that call for international collaboration (climate change, new vaccines for diseases of the developing world and technologies to advance agricultural productivity in Africa come to mind), problems like poor education, malnutrition and poverty are invariably addressed by action within each individual country. Foreign aid is not the right tool to address them.\u201cCollective action in this day and age has become much more difficult,\u201d Mr. Subramanian told me. \u201cWe should reserve it for the very big challenges of providing global public goods. It\u2019s nonsense to spend it on eliminating poverty in Burundi.\u201dProfessor Sachs disagrees. For him, the mobilization of resources by the Millennium Development Goals for combating AIDS and malaria in Africa was more significant than the fact that the continent didn\u2019t achieve many of the goals. \u201cEven if they didn\u2019t do everything one hoped for,\u201d he said, \u201cthey created an energy, a drive, an organizational knowledge, an interest in community action.\u201dYet even Professor Sachs wonders whether almost 200 countries can fit their priorities into a meaningful set of actionable goals. \u201cThere\u2019s cooperation now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut actually doing something about the hard issues remains an open question.\u201dEmail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

The focus on longer hours and more testing has not bridged race and class gaps as proponents promised, and it is no surprise that gender gaps are also apparent.The testing model fails to consider broader socioeconomic realities, underpaid and under-rewarded teachers, and children\u2019s overall needs for effective learning.Rather than force \u201cfidgety boys\u201d to sit still for longer hours (or diagnose attention deficit disorder and drug them to comply), let them play! Address children\u2019s need to move from one activity to another and blow off energy in the playground while offering multiple approaches to learning. This approach has put Finland at the top of educational performers among developed countries.More recess, more arts and sports, the elimination of standardized testing, the valuing of teachers \u2014 it\u2019s not a mystery!To the Editor:Your article doesn\u2019t mention an important ingredient of the problem. The rise in boys\u2019 troubles coincides exactly with the push by schools to ramp up literacy demands in the earliest grades \u2014 a time when boys are least able to cope with reading and writing.Thus, boys fall behind and conclude that school is for girls. To the Editor:As a longtime educator and student of learning differences, I believe that one means of bringing boys into school success and the \u201cknowledge economy\u201d is a serious effort to redirect their inappropriate media use. Multiple studies document the academically and personally damaging effects of too much recreational \u201cscreen time,\u201d particularly for youths on the lower socioeconomic rungs.Boys are particularly vulnerable to getting \u201chooked\u201d on first-person shooter games. These can affect the growing brain by resetting motivation circuits into an addictive loop that blocks sustained academic effort. Nighttime games also interfere with sleep, causing attention problems.Whether or not violent games create violent behavior, a hyper-aroused, externally driven young nervous system is a poor candidate for self-control of either behavior or intellect.In fact, one reason boys succeed in the \u201cbest performing schools\u201d may be that their parents and teachers tend to restrict the amount of time students spend with video games while encouraging the active physical and social pursuits so necessary for healthy development. The writer, an educational psychologist, is the author of \u201cYour Child\u2019s Growing Mind: Brain Development and Learning From Birth to Adolescence.\u201d To the Editor:As headmaster for 26 years at the Browning School, an all-boys school founded in 1888 here in New York City, I believe that David Leonhardt may well take heart in the fact that some schools do acknowledge the profound differences between boys and girls.At Browning, we are aware of the obvious distractions and learning styles and are dedicated to educating boys in such a way that they enjoy learning; in fact, they thrive.As for the toughness Mr. Leonhardt believes is all too desirable a trait in the minds of boys who aspire to success, let me add that \u201cgrit\u201d was one of our founder\u2019s favorite words and became our motto (\u201cGrytte\u201d). Grit is distinct from overbearing \u201cmacho\u201d masculinity.Rather than emphasizing the need to be gruffly assertive, we have chosen instead to stress that failing is part of the learning process and that anything worth having is worth working hard for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "So Far, U.S. Sanctions Over Ukraine May Be Inflicting Only Limited Pain on Russia", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As it tries to punish Moscow for its intervention in Ukraine, the White House asserts that the sanctions it has imposed have had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on Russia\u2019s economy, but their real effect so far, according to economic specialists, appears to be more psychological than tangible.White House officials have pointed to the fall of the Russian ruble and Moscow stock markets as evidence of the success they have had in pressuring the Kremlin. Yet the ruble and Russian markets fell before President Obama began imposing sanctions. Today, in fact, both the ruble and the markets are slightly stronger than they were before the first sanctions were announced.Russia\u2019s economic downturn predated any action by the United States or Europe and, to some extent, predated the Ukraine crisis. Specialists said the volatility surrounding Ukraine has clearly aggravated Russia\u2019s economic problems by sapping international confidence, punishing its credit standing and increasing investor wariness, but it is not clear how much of that stems specifically from the sanctions.Just this week, the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth projection for Russia for the year to 0.2 percent and declared that the country is in recession, citing the uncertainty of the confrontation with the West. But the fund\u2019s top Moscow official attributed the slowdown as much to the fear of more sweeping sanctions that may be imposed in the future as to the impact of the limited measures taken to date.That uncertainty may represent the real impact of sanctions, according to experts and Obama administration officials. In addition to the shrinking growth projections, Russia recently had its credit rating downgraded to just above junk status, and investors are demanding higher interest rates to hold Russian bonds.Administration officials said it would be a mistake to assume those negative developments are unconnected to sanctions simply because only a relative handful of Russians have been targeted by them. The president\u2019s threat to escalate with sanctions against whole sectors of the Russian economy has been an important factor, too, the officials said.\u201cOne of the purposes of sanctions is to create uncertainty and to create the expectation in the marketplace that worse could be coming,\u201d said David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary who oversees sanctions. \u201cThat uncertainty has led the market to punish the Russian economy.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s approach to sanctions has generated a fierce debate in Washington. The president argues that his measured strategy has sent a potent signal while preserving a united front with hesitant European allies and holding more powerful sanctions in reserve in case Mr. Putin orders a full-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine.Some lawmakers and Russia specialists in both parties, however, argue that his approach has been too measured. \u201cIf they named two or three big financial institutions, that would have had a big impact,\u201d said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine, who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey say they don\u2019t want to shoot all the bullets at once. They could have shot some more bullets and still had plenty in reserve.\u201dThe current American sanctions target 30 government officials and business leaders, as well as some of their companies. While some small Russian banks will have to stop taking Visa or MasterCard, the sanctions have not stopped major transactions or projects by those targeted. It is not clear whether the targets even have assets in the United States to freeze.Beyond the targets themselves, large companies like Exxon Mobil, Boeing, Royal Dutch Shell, Siemens and BP have done nothing to curtail operations in Russia. The chief executives of Shell and Siemens even met separately with Mr. Putin in recent weeks, making clear business will continue, although Shell has since added that it will hold off starting new projects for now.Exxon Mobil and BP are partners with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company led by Igor I. Sechin, who is on the American sanctions list, but both companies can continue working with Rosneft because Rosneft itself was not targeted. Just this week, the Austrian energy company OMV made a pipeline deal with the Russian company Gazprom while Germany said it would not block the sale of RWE\u2019s oil and gas unit to the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.\u201cThe sanctions news has had little additional impact,\u201d said Christopher J. Weafer, a founding partner in Macro Advisory and a longtime financial analyst in Moscow. \u201cBut most investors are staying away from Russia for now. They are waiting until there is a clearer picture of the trend in the economy and the effect on earnings over this year and longer.\u201dAt a meeting in Moscow this week that included American Embassy officials and business representatives, there was little clarity about what was allowed under the current sanctions, and some executives concluded that they would err on the side of caution, an attitude that could effectively enhance the impact of sanctions. One participant said American officials recommended that chief executives not attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg this month that is important to Mr. Putin.Russia\u2019s economy was already slowing last fall. The Moscow government shifted from a stimulus spending strategy to a money supply strategy to try to reduce borrowing rates as a way to increase business activity.The ruble started to depreciate sharply in January, long before Russia intervened in Ukraine, but the annexation of Crimea accelerated the drop as well as capital flight. Russia\u2019s central bank intervened by raising key rates to control the slide in the ruble.By the time Mr. Obama imposed his first sanctions on March 17, the fall of the ruble and markets had stabilized. The ruble, trading at 36.57 to the dollar before the sanctions, improved to 35.64 to the dollar on Thursday. The Micex stock market index closed at 1,237.43 the Friday before the first sanctions and was up to 1,306.01 on Thursday. Goldman Sachs estimated capital flight out of Russia at $50 billion before Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions.Obama administration officials said the expectation of sanctions had already been factored into the market by that point, and they noted that even Mr. Putin had said the sanctions were causing damage, although he said the impact was \u201cof no critical character.\u201dTimothy M. Frye, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, said the Russian economy was declining even without sanctions. \u201cBut it\u2019s wrong to say that sanctions are not having any impact in Russia and that the Russian government can easily ignore them,\u201d he said.Still, Mr. Frye said Mr. Putin can now shift blame. \u201cThe sanctions do give the Russian government an excuse, a scapegoat for the poor economic performance,\u201d he said. Russian officials are already saying its tough economic times \u201care due to the West\u2019s nefarious activities, when in reality the underlying problems are Russia\u2019s bad governance.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Andrew E. Kramer from Moscow. Danny Hakim contributed reporting from London, and Andrew W. Lehren and Natalia V. Osipova from New York.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Crimea, It\u2019s Russian Troops In, Tourists Out", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYALTA, Crimea \u2014 When choosing the idyllic setting for an extramarital affair, Anton Chekhov opted for Yalta, and this seaside resort proved so grateful that it erected a bronze statue of the fictional enchantress with her Pomeranian on the main boardwalk.Back when \u201cThe Lady With the Dog\u201d was published, Crimea\u2019s southern coast rivaled the French Riviera. Chekhov, who wrote several famous works in his study here with its red walls and stained glass window, was unequivocal in his enthusiasm.\u201cThe coast of Crimea is beautiful, cozy, and I like it better than the Riviera,\u201d he wrote more than 100 years ago, according to the permanent exhibition at his estate. \u201cYalta is better than Nice.\u201dThat was perhaps the most famous endorsement of Crimea until President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia came along.But right now, the summer is looking like a washout, travel experts say. Few Ukrainians and virtually no Westerners are expected any time soon.\u201cThere will be no tourist season this year,\u201d fretted Lilia Ivanova, indicating the quiet harbor near her tour agency. The first cruise ship scheduled to visit this year, the M.S. Hamburg, steamed past without stopping. All international flights were halted with the annexation.Last year, six million tourists visited Crimea \u2014 almost four million Ukrainians, and the bulk of the rest Russians. About 12 percent were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships that docked in 2013, according to tour operators. Virtually all of those dockings have been canceled this year.It doesn\u2019t help that Yalta \u2014 indeed, much of Crimea \u2014 fell prey first to the Soviet penchant for concrete and then to the more modern plague of endlessly homogeneous chain stores and apartment blocks. The place needs a little work, and many here hope that the Kremlin will provide it.In April, Mr. Putin announced that he had ordered the price of round-trip airplane tickets for vacationers from Russia slashed to $214, compared with a normal fare of about $385 from Moscow, and subsidized train tickets. State-run companies like Gazprom and Rosneft said they would underwrite vacations for tens of thousands of employees.Some Russians who work for government-owned companies have told their friends that they were ordered to vacation in Crimea this year. State-run television inaugurated a relentless campaign plugging the peninsula: Caves! Waterfalls! Palaces! Yuri Gagarin vacationed here! (Gagarin, the first man in space, remains a Russian archetype, used to plug almost any state goal.)But even Mr. Putin spoke bluntly about the limits of its attractions.\u201cIf we don\u2019t offer cheap tickets, people simply won\u2019t go,\u201d he said in announcing the subsidies. \u201cGiven its current infrastructure, Crimea is designed for people with small incomes.\u201dSunshine, agriculture and the dilapidated Black Sea fleet are the three main pillars the Kremlin expects to exploit in its push to transform Crimea into an economic success story that proves the benefits of Mother Russia\u2019s embrace. There has also been talk of casinos.Propping up Crimea will be a difficult, expensive effort. Russia has earmarked $5 billion just to save the Black Sea fleet from the scrap heap. Agricultural exports face transportation issues because the peninsula is geographically remote from Russia.But tourism presents some of the biggest challenges. After being the playground of royalty, Crimea remained a cherished summer vacation destination in the Soviet Union, as few Soviets were allowed to travel abroad. It offered some of the only warm beaches available. So tourism has long been a cornerstone of the economy.Traditionally, a vast majority of tourists arrived by train, with most Russians crossing through Ukraine. For the past two months, however, television news in Russia, monopolized by the state, has depicted Ukraine as brimming with neo-Nazis bent on shedding Russian blood. The threat was largely invented, but it frightened potential visitors.Initially, Russia and its allies running Crimea vowed to match, if not increase, the number of tourists from last year, but they then began to scale back expectations. The acting head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, was recently quoted telling local reporters that the government expected at least three million tourists.As if to hedge their bets, Mr. Putin and his allies wasted no time in accusing Ukraine of benign neglect. Ukraine received Crimea from Moscow in 1954, then ruled the area for 23 years after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Moscow blames Kiev for every flaw, from the decrepit ships Russia seized to low agricultural exports, which Mr. Putin said dropped 60 percent under Ukrainian rule.Russian government inspectors, the president lamented during a recent national television broadcast, found Crimea\u2019s hotels and resorts terribly shabby.\u201cSome of these, if not all, cannot be used under Russian sanitary and epidemiological standards,\u201d Mr. Putin said. (This in a place once famous for sanitariums.)He went on: \u201cWhen they asked how former vacationers could have put up with this sort of quality, they heard this odd, and shameful, answer: \u2018It\u2019s O.K., we mostly had miners as guests here. It made no difference to them; they\u2019d down half a glass of vodka and go to the beach.\u2019 But we can\u2019t take this approach with Russian vacationers.\u201dTour operators said the legions of Russian tourists wanting to lounge could find far nicer beaches, bigger buffets and better hotels in convenient, inexpensive destinations like Turkey or Egypt, safely distant from the urban unrest in those countries.\u201cThe whole idea of tourism in this area is a little different,\u201d said Sergei V. Ivashin, the young general director of a Moscow franchise for Pegas Touristik, a major Russian tour operator. \u201cCrimea is not for people who want to lie on the beach in Egypt and eat eight meals a day, but people who want to see the culture and history of their own land, their own country. We are aiming for those kinds of nationalist tours.\u201dThere is plenty of Russian history here. The biggest draw, with 782,000 visitors in 2013, according to the Tourism Ministry, is Livadia, the Italian Renaissance palace the last czar, Nicholas II, erected in 1911.But Crimea has definitely seen better times.Take Chekhov\u2019s home. The writer settled here in 1898, drawn, like so many, to treat his tuberculosis. He built a modest white house.He wrote \u201cThe Cherry Orchard\u201d and \u201cThree Sisters\u201d here, among other works. Sergei Rachmaninoff accompanied the opera bass Fyodor Chaliapin on Chekhov\u2019s black upright piano. Leo Tolstoy visited. Unlike many Russian museums ransacked during the 1917 revolution, this one still has authentic furnishings because Chekhov\u2019s sister and his widow lived here for decades after his death in 1904.But giant apartment towers have encroached on Chekhov\u2019s unbroken view of the sea and have badly affected the house itself. When cracks developed about 18 months ago, museum officials went to court to stop the construction of a nearby apartment building, guides said.The heady mix of literary, political and military history helped Mr. Putin win wide support among Russians for taking Crimea back. Peddling its beaches, however bedraggled, could lift that support even further. And experts cite another factor in Crimea\u2019s favor: warmth.In oft-frozen Russia, no ruler can really do wrong by adding hundreds of miles of warm beachfront property, said Natalya V. Zubarevich, a professor at Moscow State University who specializes in social and political geography. \u201cThe result would not have been the same if he had added Alaska.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Concentrated Markets Take Big Toll on Economy", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneNobody believes AT&T\u2019s $48 billion shot at buying DirecTV will be the last attempt by the nation\u2019s communications leviathans to get even bigger. Verizon will inevitably try to bulk up in response to Comcast\u2019s $45 billion grab for Time Warner Cable. Sprint, the No. 3 wireless carrier, is lusting for No. 4 T-Mobile.Each of these deals, of course, is justified by the drive to compete. Yet three decades after the United States dismembered its telecom monopoly, the melee of mergers is reshaping the backbone of the information age \u2014 including telephone, cable television and broadband Internet \u2014 into an oligopoly where competitors are in short supply.\u201cThey say they have to become larger because the other one is becoming larger,\u201d said Eli Noam of Columbia University, who directs its Institute for Tele-Information. \u201cWhat is the limiting principle?\u201dIndeed. And it isn\u2019t just the distributors: \u201cContent\u201d providers like Amazon, Google and Facebook dominate their markets as well.The question could be asked even more broadly. Four airlines \u2014 United, Delta, American and Southwest \u2014 serve 71 percent of domestic air traffic in the United States, according to Severin Borenstein of the University of California, Berkeley. From 1980 to 2009 the share of the top four fluctuated around 55 percent.So what is the concentration of so many markets doing to the American economy?\u201cI\u2019m fairly convinced that things have gotten worse,\u201d said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist, who teaches at Columbia University. Technology companies have \u201cbeen extraordinarily innovative in creating monopolistic innovations.\u201d But, at the same time, policy has aided market concentration. \u201cThere are various ways,\u201d Professor Stiglitz added, \u201cthat we undermine competition through rules and regulations.\u201dThe excess profits companies can extract from their customers when they face little or no competition \u2014 known to economists as \u201crents\u201d \u2014 may be deepening income inequality, Professor Stiglitz and others have argued. The evidence shows up in fatter corporate bottom lines and a rising share of national income that goes to profits.\u201cIn a competitive economy, the real return to capital would be much smaller,\u201d Professor Stiglitz said. Concentration in the financial sector might have something to do with the fact that finance and insurance amass 15 percent of corporate America\u2019s pretax profits, employing 5 percent of its private sector workers.Consider health care, a sector that accounts for nearly one-fifth of the American economy. Hospital systems have been growing at breakneck speed, gobbling up independents and taking over physician practices.Mr. Gaynor counts more than 1,000 hospital system mergers since the mid-1990s, often involving dozens of hospitals. And yet between 1990 and 2007, the commission did not win a single case against a hospital merger.Consolidation, to be sure, is not always a bad thing. It can create efficiencies where there are economies of scale, such as sharing administrative costs over a broader market. In markets that remain competitive, some of these efficiencies are likely to be passed on to consumers in the form of better service or lower prices.The dominance of some high-tech firms, like Microsoft in its day or Facebook now, is to some extent inevitable given their low marginal costs \u2014 it costs practically nothing to produce an additional unit of software \u2014 and network effects, because a social media platform is much more useful to consumers the more people are on it. This will drive users to the dominant player \u2014 be it Facebook or Twitter \u2014 at the expense of all others.And the dominant Goliaths might even have a positive effect on innovation: The prospect of being bought out for billions by Google or Facebook is a great incentive for venture capitalists to invest in the kind of garage-level tinkerers who can come up with the new Instagram or Snapchat.\u201cThe tech sector is pretty awesome in delivering value to consumers,\u201d said Carl Shapiro, a former member of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSome caution is appropriate before concluding that competition is lacking.\u201dYet there are reasons to worry about the nation\u2019s concentrated markets. Start with prices: airline fares started rising in 2009 and are now at their highest since 2002, according to Professor Borenstein\u2019s calculations.There are broader concerns. We might have better word processors had it not been for the market power of Microsoft Office. There may be better forms of search based on natural language that we may never see because of Google.\u201cSuccessful incumbents are often tempted to acquire start-ups that begin to pose a disruptive threat, rather than face them down the road,\u201d Professor Shapiro said. \u201cSuch acquisitions can harm competition and hinder innovation, but they are hard for antitrust authorities to challenge.\u201dIt is not clear what caused this slowdown. Mr. Litan says tougher regulation and increasing economies of scale may be the main culprits, weighing against small new entrants. But the pattern also fits a picture of entrenched incumbents erecting walls against new contenders. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this result,\u201d Mr. Litan told me. \u201cI\u2019m still struggling with this puzzling fact.\u201dWhat does this portend? As technology makes further inroads into the broader economy \u2014 bringing along its intellectual property protections and its dominant companies with their huge economies of scale \u2014 the potential risks that market concentration could stymie broader swathes of the economy cannot be discounted.Take broadband, the enabling platform of the Internet age, which allows young information technology companies to tap the vast troves of information with which to build new services and to cheaply reach large numbers of users.Broadband companies are not doing badly. Comcast\u2019s earnings were up by a third in the first quarter of the year. AT&T\u2019s were up 11 percent.Future competition on the Internet \u201cwon\u2019t be David versus Goliath,\u201d Professor Noam said. \u201cIt will be a battle of Goliaths,\u201d pitting big broadband oligopolies against big, dominant content providers riding on their pipes.The question is, will there be a place in this world for any Davids?A chart with the Economic Scene column on Wednesday about concentrated markets misidentified the unit of measurement for the download speeds offered by broadband providers. The speeds are measured in megabits per second, not thousands of megabits per second.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Crisis Pushing Putin Toward China", "Date": "2014-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the intended audience for these conciliatory remarks may not have been the United States and Europe, who would distrust them in any event. No, Mr. Putin\u2019s gaze was more likely fixed on China, where he arrives on Tuesday by all accounts determined to show that he, too, wants to pivot to Asia.Mr. Putin has stressed repeatedly in recent weeks that Russia sees its economic future with China, noting that its Asian neighbor was on track to surpass the United States as the leading global economic power. A tilt to the East is also in keeping with Mr. Putin\u2019s recent turn to a conservative nationalist ideology, emphasizing religion, family values and patriotism in contrast to what he sees as the increasingly godless, relativist and decadent West.\u201cToday, Russia firmly places China at the top of its foreign trade partners,\u201d Mr. Putin said in an interview with Chinese journalists on the eve of his visit, according to a transcript released Monday by the Kremlin. \u201cIn the context of turbulent global economy, the strengthening of mutually beneficial trade and economic ties, as well as the increase of investment flows between Russia and China, are of paramount importance.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s announcement of a pullback of Russian forces from the Ukraine border was likely to help calm the situation there before presidential elections scheduled for Sunday. But it could also be seen as a gesture to Chinese sensitivities about separatism, given Beijing\u2019s continuing troubles with Tibet, the Uighurs and scores of lesser-known ethnic and religious minorities.It was also the third time Mr. Putin had announced a pullback without any evidence of troops actually departing, the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, noted Monday at a news conference in Brussels.The centerpiece of Mr. Putin\u2019s two-day visit to China could well be a long-stalled deal with Russia to ship natural gas from new Siberian fields to China starting around 2019. The two have been haggling over the deal for a decade, but could not agree on a price for the gas.Experts anticipate that Russia is finally prepared to come to terms, if only to let Washington and Western Europe know that it has other markets for its gas and important friends in the world.\u201cBecause of this current disaster in our relations with the West, they have no alternative,\u201d said Vasily B. Kashin, a China expert at the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow policy organization. \u201cThey need to go to Asia to make any deals possible as quickly as possible.\u201dMr. Putin is due in Normandy on June 6 for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day invasion. He is likely to meet with President Obama and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, to discuss the Ukraine crisis. Brandishing a new gas deal with China would strengthen Mr. Putin\u2019s hand, helping deflate the threat of Western sanctions.In the interview with Chinese journalists, Mr. Putin noted that bilateral trade with China last year was close to $90 billion. Although Russian trade with the European Union as a bloc is far larger, amounting to some $370 billion in 2012, trade with China is on par with leading individual partners like Germany. Trade with the United States was only $26 billion in 2012.Russia needs new markets because it is hugely dependent on commodity exports, earning some 67 percent of its export income from oil and gas alone. Financing from China would also help offset reluctance by Western banks to extend new loans, given the threat of sanctions.\u201cThere will be a natural gas agreement, which is very important not for the agreement itself, but because it will open the road for further, much bigger agreements in natural gas and other raw materials,\u201d Mr. Kashin said.Mr. Putin said Russia would try to increase trade volume with China to $100 billion next year and double that by 2020.Aside from what he described as a \u201cstrategic energy alliance,\u201d Mr. Putin mentioned possible joint projects in airplanes and helicopters, mining, agricultural processing and transportation infrastructure. Other technical and military cooperation agreements will also be discussed, but both sides tend to keep those secret, so details might not emerge for some months, experts said.Russia and China, which share a border of more than 2,600 miles, have long had uneasy relations. Russia, wary about the economic gorilla along its southern borders, blocked Chinese investment, particularly in fields considered strategic like energy, except for two small deals. Mr. Putin on Monday clearly enunciated a more welcoming message.\u201cThat is a big shift,\u201d said Clifford Gaddy, of the Brookings Institution in Washington and the author of a book on Mr. Putin, \u201cand indicates how serious they are in taking a step toward China.\u201dMr. Gaddy added, \u201cIt is a shift in rhetoric, and we will see if it is followed up with a shift in action.\u201dIn highlighting that the sanctions are helping to disrupt the Russian economy, the Obama administration has virtually ignored that it is pushing Russia toward greater dependence on China, Mr. Gaddy noted.The Russians are hoping that China will also agree to help build a bridge linking the mainland to the Crimean port of Kerch, lending not only valuable expertise but also tacit endorsement of an annexation that much of the world considers illegal. There is no current land link to the annexed territory.China abstained from a United Nations Security Council vote in March rejecting the referendum that Russia organized in Crimea before annexing it. That earned China special praise from Mr. Putin in his speech announcing the annexation.Russia and China are also scheduled to hold joint naval exercises in China toward the end of the month, and President Xi Jinping was one of the few world leaders to put in an appearance at the Winter Olympics in Sochi.There is, of course, no guarantee that the two sides will come to terms on the gas deal. Alexei Miller, the chief executive of state-run Gazprom, announced over the weekend that Russia and China had agreed on everything in the 30-year contract except the price.Experts noted that the price gap had endured for years, although it is generally believed to have shrunk from hundreds of dollars per thousand cubic meters to $50 or less. Before, Moscow\u2019s bargaining strategy was to wait out the Chinese, figuring that their insatiable appetite for natural resources would bring them to Russia\u2019s doorstep at favorable terms.But analysts believe that passive strategy is over.\u201cThere is no more time, with sanctions escalating,\u201d said Ildar Davletshin, the head of oil and gas research at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank. \u201cRussia has become more desperate to get a real outlet.\u201dMr. Davletshin also noted that as negotiations had dragged on, Russia gradually lost market share to other suppliers in Central Asia.Russia, with its massive resources, is attractive to the Chinese. \u201cRussia is just across the river and it is vast and underpopulated, so it is attractive for China to own a piece,\u201d Mr. Davletshin said.That also puts its resources out of reach of American sanctions and the United States Navy, analysts noted.As initially conceived, Russian gas was to enter China in its far west, where the demand was lowest, and in the ensuing years China negotiated deals for other, cheaper sources.So the current deal concentrates on selling 38 billion cubic meters of gas, worth about $14 billion if they agree to a price of around $380 per thousand cubic meters, as analysts expect. Part of the bargaining also concerns the financing China might provide to build the nearly 1,500 mile pipeline, estimated to cost $30 billion.Andrew Higgins contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Late Rally Sends Dow to New High, Barely", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market closed out May on a mostly higher note on Friday, sending two of the three major indexes to nominal highs.Trading was uneven, and indexes moved between small gains and losses for most of the day. A late push higher left the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index at nominal highs, but just barely.May was the best month for investors since February. The S.&P. 500 rose 2.1 percent for the month, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq rose 3.1 percent.\u201cThis market may have been choppy earlier in the year, but the trend is higher,\u201d said Karyn Cavanaugh, a market strategist with Voya Investment Management.The Dow on Friday rose 18.43 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 16,717.17, less than two points above its previous high set on May 13. The S.&P. 500 rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,923.57, also closing at a record. The Nasdaq, however, fell 5.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,242.62.On Friday, investors had two somewhat disappointing reports to interpret. The Commerce Department said consumer spending unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent in April, the first drop in that indicator in a year. Economists expect the drop to be temporary, however. Consumer spending jumped 1 percent in March.\u201cIt is obvious that after an unseasonably colder January and February, consumers came out with a vengeance in March,\u201d Chris G. Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients. \u201cSo April\u2019s poor showing on the spending front is payback for a strong March.\u201dIn a separate report, the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index fell more than analysts were expecting, dropping to 81.9 in May from 84.9 in April. Economists had expected 82.8. Still, Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said that confidence in the first five months of this year had been at the highest level since 2007.Next week will be heavy with economic data. The May jobs report comes out June 6. Economists expect that the economy created 220,000 jobs in May and that the unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent, according to FactSet, a financial information provider. The European Central Bank will also have its interest rate policy meeting on June 6.Lions Gate Entertainment was one of the biggest decliners Friday. The movie studio dropped $3.40, or 12 percent, to $26.13 after reporting a profit of 35 cents a share, a 70 percent drop from the year before and well below what analysts had expected. Lions Gate\u2019s movies include the \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d series.The sunglasses retailer Pacific Sunwear of California dropped 52 cents, or 18 percent, to $2.42. The company warned investors that it would report a 2-cent loss this quarter versus the 2-cent profit that analysts had expected.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at 2.48 percent. Bond yields are near their lows for the year thanks to strong demand. The price fell 2/32 to 100 7/32.\u201cIf we were in a normal bond market, these yields would signal weakness in the U.S. economy,\u201d said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. \u201cBut I think what\u2019s going on is more of a temporary phenomenon.\u201dRoughly 3.2 billion shares traded hands on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

{"Headline": "Rent or Buy? The Math Is Changing", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReal Estate and the RecoveryBilly Gasparino and Jenna Dillon-Gasparino were savvy enough to wait out the housing boom of a decade ago as renters. Not until 2010, well into the bust, did they buy a house in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, less than a mile from the beach, for $810,000.Only four years later, the couple see new signs of excess in the housing market and have decided to go back to renting. They are close to a deal to sell their house \u2013 for $1.35 million, a cool 67 percent gain.\u201cIt just seems like the housing market came back so strongly, so fast, that maybe there\u2019s a little bit of a bubble there,\u201d said Mr. Gasparino, 37, an executive with the San Diego Padres.Their decision reflects a new reality in many of the nation\u2019s largest metropolitan areas. An analysis by The New York Times finds that in the country\u2019s most expensive places, including New York, the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, buying a home again looks like a perilous investment, based on the relationship between their prices and rents or incomes. And in a longer list of areas, including Boston, Miami and Washington, prices have risen enough that buying is no longer the bargain it looked to be a few years ago.The choice between buying a home and renting one is among the biggest financial decisions that many adults make.\u201cA lot of these coastal markets look overvalued compared to rents,\u201d said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cIn these markets, it seems generally more attractive to rent than to buy, even as the national market is broadly well balanced.\u201dFor example, Venice, where the Gasparinos are selling their house, has benefited from an influx of tech industry, including from the opening of Google\u2019s Los Angeles office there in 2011. \u201cYou have engineers, visual effects artists, people making 2, 3, 400 thousand dollars a year coming in,\u201d said Tami Pardee, principal of Pardee Properties real estate brokerage in Venice. \u201cThe problem I\u2019m having is inventory. There isn\u2019t enough of it.\u201dThanks to low interest rates and home prices that remain 13 percent below their 2006 peak nationally, buying continues to look like a good deal in much of the country. In the once-frothy markets of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., for example, the typical home price is still 30 to 40 percent below 2006 levels, even more if one accounts for inflation.But across much of California and the Northeast, prices are now high enough that the costs of owning a home \u2013 property taxes, repairs, fees to real-estate agents and mortgage interest \u2013 may outweigh the financial benefits, including the tax break.It is the latest change in a yo-yo pattern over the past decade. From 2004 to 2006, the math overwhelmingly favored renting rather than buying across most of the country, even as many Americans mistakenly decided that home prices could never fall. From 2009 to 2011, buying was an extraordinary deal in most of the country. Even the markets that have experienced huge price increases are far from the clear-cut bubble conditions of the mid-2000s, but they\u2019re inching closer with every bidding war.Since the start of 2011, prices have risen 33 percent in the San Francisco area, 30 percent in Miami, 24 percent in Los Angeles \u2014 and even more in some of the most desirable neighborhoods within those areas.In the San Francisco Bay Area, home of the sharpest recent price increases, the sale price of a home is about 20 times what it would cost to rent a home of the same size for a year. That ratio, based on an analysis of data from Zillow, is the same as in 2003, when the San Francisco real estate market had yet to become an out-of-control bubble but was well on its way there.When low mortgage rates are taken into account, buying a home in San Francisco looks somewhat more attractive \u2014 but with a 10 percent down payment and prevailing interest rates, buying a home is 6 percent more expensive than renting a place of the same size, the same premium for buying as there was during the dot-com boom in 1999. Just two years ago, buying in the San Francisco area was 24 percent cheaper than renting an equivalent place.The potentially overvalued markets are the result of three forces. They are taking place in local economies that suffered only minimally during the recession that began in 2008 and have experienced strong job growth since then.They are fueled further by the low-interest rate policies that are aimed at bolstering the overall national economy but don\u2019t discriminate based on geography. Even as San Francisco\u2019s housing market is at risk of overheating, buyers there get the same ultralow mortgage rates engineered by the Federal Reserve as home buyers in depressed Detroit or Cleveland do.And the new booms are taking place in markets where restrictions on building hinder developers from responding to rising demand by constructing more housing. That distinguishes the major California markets from the strong local economies in Texas and elsewhere. The Dallas area and the San Francisco area added similar numbers of jobs last year, but local governments in Dallas issued permits for nearly four times as many new housing units.There are important caveats, of course. The wisdom of buying versus renting depends heavily on each person\u2019s financial situation, plans and preferences. And the clich\u00e9 about all real estate being local holds; each neighborhood can have its own unique dynamics in the for-sale and for-rent housing sectors that must be considered.Home buyers in even the highest-price markets can take some solace in the fact that prices aren\u2019t as outlandishly high relative to rents as they were in 2006. But they should also know that homes are also priced richly enough to leave no room for error.It\u2019s a bit like the current consensus opinion of economists on the value of the stock market: not in a bubble, necessarily, but certainly expensive enough to make a buyer wary. While home prices may stay high for months or years to come, buyers are leaving themselves vulnerable to a decline toward more normal historical valuations. Renters avoid that risk, even if they also don\u2019t get some of the upside if the bull market for houses in places like Santa Monica, Nob Hill and TriBeCa has longer to run.\u201cIf you thought home values in the Bay Area or Southern California were such that we might see another housing correction, that radically starts to advantage rental housing,\u201d said Stan Humphries, Zillow\u2019s chief economist, who argues that current prices are reasonably well justified, while acknowledging that prices are high enough to leave buyers exposed.The real estate market in Venice, where the Gasparinos are selling their house to lock in the gains, shows the forces shaping the new boom markets. Besides the tech employment there on Silicon Beach, as the local boosters put it, the supply of housing can\u2019t expand to meet that rising demand. The area is filled with block after block of low-slung houses and apartments, and density restrictions stand in the way of constructing tall buildings.That combination has been enough to send the median price per square foot of homes that are sold up 49 percent since late 2010 in the 90291 ZIP code, according to Zillow, and the median rent per square foot up 23 percent in the same span.\u201cWhen we bought four years ago after the crash, the market was dead, and it felt like everybody learned their lesson,\u201d Mr. Gasparino said. \u201cIt just went back so fast.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Bill Clinton Defends His Economic Legacy", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFormer President Bill Clinton, who has grown increasingly frustrated that his economic policies are viewed as out-of-step with the current focus on income inequality, on Wednesday delivered his most muscular defense of his economic legacy.The speech reflected a strategic effort by Mr. Clinton and his advisers to reclaim the populist ground now occupied by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other ascendant left-leaning Democrats, and, potentially, to lay out an economic message that could propel his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to the White House in 2016.\u201cMy commitment was to restore broad-based prosperity to the economy and to give Americans a chance,\u201d Mr. Clinton told students at Georgetown University, his alma mater, as Mrs. Clinton looked on from the front row. For nearly two hours, the former president defended the impact of policies like welfare overhaul and the earned-income tax credit, and displayed a series of charts detailing the number of people his policies lifted out of poverty.\u201cYou know the rest,\u201d he said of the 1990s. \u201cIt worked out pretty well.\u201dAs president, Mr. Clinton presided over one of the healthiest economies in recent memory, but he also forged a new model of a pro-business, pragmatic Democrat who championed public-private partnerships and open markets. His language as president was more focused on lifting the middle class than castigating the wealthy. That should not be confused with a lack of concern for the poor, Mr. Clinton says now.That nuance has grown harder to communicate in recent weeks, especially as Ms. Warren has promoted her best-selling book, \u201cA Fighting Chance,\u201d which argues that the deck is stacked in favor of big banks and against ordinary people. A cadre of economic advisers has been helping Mr. Clinton crunch data and think about how to better frame his economic legacy \u2014 one that included a balanced budget and the creation of 22.7 million jobs \u2014 in the context of the current climate of economic populism.The effort began early this year, when the Clintons were accused of using the swearing-in of Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York as a way to shore up their progressive credentials ahead of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s potential 2016 campaign.\u201cToday, when someone talks about inequality they\u2019re supposed to be a real left winger,\u201d Mr. Clinton said at a book party in January. Mr. Clinton told the small crowd, which included Martin O\u2019Malley, the governor of Maryland and a potential rival to Mrs. Clinton, that he had been fighting income inequality since his earliest years in Arkansas politics.He slyly mocked critics who suggest that he had discovered the inequality issue recently, saying: \" \u2018Oh, look at Bill Clinton, he went to the swearing-in of Bill de Blasio. He really is slick still.\u2019 \u201dFraming his policies effectively has implications beyond Mr. Clinton\u2019s legacy. As she decides whether to run for president in 2016, Mrs. Clinton has come under criticism from some left-leaning Democrats who view her as too cozy with Wall Street. During her 2008 bid, Mrs. Clinton had to balance promoting the economic success of her husband\u2019s administration with distancing herself from policies less popular with Democratic primary voters, like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the deregulation of the financial industry.Last week, dozens of labor scholars and activists, including Ralph Nader, sent Mrs. Clinton a letter asking her to use her influence with Walmart to urge the retailer to raise wages for its predominantly female work force. From 1986 to 1992, Mrs. Clinton served on the board of Walmart.\u201cShe has been going around the country getting awards and making $200,000 per speech giving soft, cushy addresses on mother and apple pie issues,\u201d Mr. Nader said in an interview. \u201cIt just surprises me as to why she wouldn\u2019t come out for something so obvious.\u201dVoters generally have a rosy view of the 1990s: Median family income increased to $48,950 in 1999 from $36,959 in 1993. And, from 1992 to 2000, unemployment fell to 7.6 percent from 14.2 percent for African-Americans and to 5.7 percent from 11.6 percent for Hispanics, according to Department of Commerce data.\u201cPeople can make their criticisms, but if you look back on the economy, people thought it was pretty darn good, especially for working-class people,\u201d John Podesta, a former chief of staff to Mr. Clinton, and a senior adviser to President Obama, said in an interview last fall.In his speech on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton called inequality \u201ca severe constraint on growth\u201d and said it had not been as much of an issue in the 1990s, when incomes grew more slowly for the richest 20 percent of families than for the poorest 20 percent.And, he said, he faced a contentious Republican-led Senate and House that would have rejected overheated talk that castigated the wealthy or focused solely on wealth redistribution. Mr. Clinton aimed to appease the other side by also devoting energy to deficit reduction and reforming the welfare system.Al From, an adviser to Mr. Clinton who worked on his 1992 campaign, said, \u201cWe argued starting in 1991 that the progressive position ought to be that nobody who works full time in America to support a family ought to be poor.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019m sure he feels that he doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves for the economic gains that happened during his administration.\u201dCritics have accused Mr. Clinton of trying to be all things to all people and said that some of his policies, namely the trade agreements and legislation that allowed the commingling of commercial and investment banks, might have exacerbated the current inequality. Others point out that the Internet boom coincided with his presidency.\u201cYou can say, \u2018Oh, Clinton was lucky, he caught the tech boom.\u2019 \u2018Clinton was lucky, he came out of a recession,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Clinton said on Wednesday. He pointed to a chart that showed that 7.7 million people were lifted out of poverty during his administration, compared with 77,000 during the Reagan years.If she runs in 2016, Mrs. Clinton would confront the inequality issue from a very different place than her husband did in 1992, when he made $35,000 a year as governor of Arkansas. Back then, Mr. Clinton seemed to have a natural connection to people of modest means while his opponent, the elder President George Bush, struggled to say how much a gallon of milk cost.On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton said he thanked God every day that \u201cHillary and I and some of our friends in this audience who live in New York probably pay the highest aggregate tax rates in America.\u201dThe challenge is not about personal wealth, but policies, said Robert B. Reich, a secretary of labor under Mr. Clinton. And some policy experts argue that the era of centrist Clinton economics may have expired.\u201cBut, again, let\u2019s not get carried away here,\u201d he added. \u201cI ran on income inequality in 1992.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled, in one instance, the surname of an activist who sent a letter to Hillary Rodham Clinton asking her to use her influence with Walmart to urge the retailer to raise wages for its predominantly female work force. He is Ralph Nader, not Nadar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pennsylvania Governor Faces an Uphill Battle for a Second Term", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARRISBURG, Pa. \u2014 Since Pennsylvania changed the law in 1968 to allow its governor to serve two consecutive terms, no incumbent has been denied re-election. But Tom Corbett, a Republican, is in danger of becoming the first. Explanations have turned as much to the governor\u2019s personality as his policies. Even his chief re-election strategist, John Brabender, said Mr. Corbett suffered by comparison to the governor next door, who, for better or worse, captures attention. \u201cChris Christie is this dynamic, bantering politician who makes news on all sorts of national programs,\u201d Mr. Brabender said. \u201cTom Corbett is somebody who goes to work and does their job to the best of their ability and doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about all those things.\u201dThe governor, a direct, no-nonsense former attorney general, has not bounced back from an unpopular first year. Faced then with a $4 billion deficit, he honored a pledge not to raise taxes and presided over cuts that forced thousands of teacher layoffs and fewer services for the poor. As he runs for re-election, he is widely seen as the most vulnerable incumbent governor in the country. \u201cHe\u2019s been unable to explain in language that was clear and unmistakable and compassionate what he\u2019s been trying to do,\u201d Mr. Madonna said.With four Democrats vying for the chance to challenge Mr. Corbett, his advisers say polls will begin to reverse themselves once a specific opponent emerges from the primary on May 20. The potential challengers have begun to do the governor\u2019s work for him, aggressively attacking one another, and especially the front-runner, Tom Wolf. But even those in Mr. Corbett\u2019s party do not always sound convinced. Republicans in the State Senate, for example, still talk about the last time Mr. Corbett paid them a visit. The moment preceded a vote on school vouchers, which the governor favored, but which made many senators nervous because of the opposition of teachers\u2019 unions.The senators were hoping Mr. Corbett was prepared to take the political heat, and even visit their districts, if needed. Instead, they heard a stump speech about school choice \u2014 and the governor left without taking questions. He has not been invited back to address the senators since, more than two years ago.\u201cSometimes I think he still thinks he\u2019s attorney general,\u201d said Senator Mike Folmer, a Republican who supports the governor but laments that his blunt style limits his appeal. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem compassionate enough.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Corbett was affable and unguarded, as close associates say he is one on one. Standing in a corridor of Harrisburg University, where he had given a talk to schoolchildren at a science fair, he spoke in quarters close enough to frequently touch a reporter\u2019s elbow.He dismissed the idea that he faced a charisma gap with voters. \u201cThis style got me elected,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hired to do a job. I was hired to go in there and make the tough decisions.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t want to accept the truth because it is not convenient,\u201d he said of his opponents.Mr. Wolf, a former revenue secretary, called the governor\u2019s explanation of a drop in federal stimulus money \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d in a Democratic debate. He blamed him for 20,000 teachers who lost jobs. \u201cHe was there to decide what the priorities of the state are, and he, for whatever reason, decided education is not a priority,\u201d Mr. Wolf said.All four Democratic contenders agree on how to increase education spending: by taxing the booming natural gas industry. They argue that Pennsylvania is giving away the store to drillers in the Marcellus shale formation by not collecting more.Allyson Y. Schwartz, a Democratic congresswoman from the Philadelphia suburbs running for governor, called on the state to \u201cdemand they give us 5 percent and use the money to invest in education.\u201d The governor opposes adding new taxes to fees that drillers already pay, mostly to the counties where they operate. The argument the other side makes, he said, is that the gas is the property of all Pennsylvanians. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the property owner\u2019s gas. I\u2019m sorry: It\u2019s the mineral owner\u2019s gas.\u201dHis invoking of property rights was a reminder that the governor hews strongly to conservative principles, even in a state that has a moderate tradition. Elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, Mr. Corbett has refused to expand Medicaid under the president\u2019s health care law, and he has presided over corporate tax cuts of $1.2 billion.\u201cYou can go all the way back to Reagan: Reduce your taxes, you\u2019re going to see growth,\u201d he said.\u201cTom Corbett has dug us into a hole because he has been ideologically driven to say no new revenues no matter what,\u201d Ms. Schwartz said in the debate.With the Democrats agreeing on their anti-Corbett line, they have turned on one another ahead of their primary. Mr. Wolf, a businessman from York, spent nearly $4.5 million of a personal fortune in an early airwaves barrage, portraying himself as a folksy outsider concerned about his employees. He opened a double-digit lead.Now Ms. Schwartz is questioning his business practices, accusing him of structuring a buyout of his kitchen-cabinet company that led to layoffs of a majority of its work force.The fourth Democratic candidate, Katie McGinty, a former state secretary of the environment, has not attacked her rivals, but is lagging in fund-raising and is not well known to voters.Normally incumbents root for a particular opponent who they perceive would present the weakest target. Mr. Corbett and his advisers profess no preference for the Democrat they would most like to face. At the moment, they are enjoying watching the other side carve itself up.Mr. Corbett said: \u201cI\u2019m not the politician; I\u2019m the prosecutor. You can have all the opinions you want. I\u2019ll take the facts.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Debate Over Future Beyond End of Stimulus", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTANFORD, Calif. \u2014 The combination of a persistently weak labor market and evidence of a little more inflation is prompting an increasingly vigorous debate among Federal Reserve officials about the future of the central bank\u2019s stimulus campaign.The debate reflects both the stability of current Fed policy, which is essentially on autopilot until autumn as the central bank winds down its bond-buying campaign, and the considerable uncertainty about what the Fed should do next \u2014 and how.The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her allies have emphasized the need to remain focused on job creation. But other officials and economists, many of whom gathered this week at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University to discuss their concerns, want the central bank to start raising interest rates more quickly.Investors are watching as officials hammer out the critical details of those plans, and are nervously awaiting the continuation of a retreat unfolding on a scale just as grand as the construction of the stimulus campaign over the last half-decade \u2014 and with a similar potential to create significant disruptions in global financial markets.\u201cWhen looking ahead to the exit plan, the Fed will need to remember the wisdom of Mike Tyson,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \u201cEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\u201d Inflation remains below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed regards as healthy, but it has increased in recent months, in line with the forecasts of Fed officials. After months of fretting publicly that prices were rising too slowly, the authors of the Fed\u2019s campaign have shifted to insisting that prices are not rising too quickly.Mr. Dudley said wages, in particular, were rising much more slowly than the historical average, about 2 percent a year rather than about 3.5 percent a year.An alternate measure, she said, \u201cpaints a more benign view of recent inflation, one that could have implications for the appropriate path of monetary policy.\u201dThe combination of low inflation and high unemployment has simplified Fed policy debates in recent years. Easy money is the answer to both problems. If inflation strengthens, however, the Fed could find itself on the horns of a dilemma.Millions of Americans remain unable to find full-time work, a crisis only partly reflected by the unemployment rate, which fell to 6.3 percent in April. The number of people working part-time jobs, or who have stopped looking for work because they cannot find full time-jobs, may now be nearly twice as large as the excess in the Americans actively looking for work and therefore counted as unemployed.Inflation is generally restrained by unemployment, because workers demanding pay increases are easily replaced. But some researchers see evidence that long-term unemployment may not exert the same pressure on wages. That could force a choice between dialing back stimulus prematurely and accepting higher inflation.But Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and another participant at the Hoover conference, cautioned that a temporary increase could loosen the Fed\u2019s control. \u201cThat places a lot of weight on the credibility of your communications,\u201d Mr. Lacker said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure our communications are up to that.\u201dMs. George urged the Fed not to be deterred by volatility in financial markets as it raised interest rates. \u201cSuch pressures will need to be resisted,\u201d she said, warning that keeping rates low would encourage excessive risk-taking, while raising rates in a \u201cstop and go\u201d manner would cause unnecessary volatility.Alongside the debate about what to do is a debate about how to do it. The Fed finds itself in need of new tools to influence economic conditions. Before the crisis, the Fed raised and lowered borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by adjusting the \u201cfederal funds rate\u201d banks must pay to obtain short-term loans. But demand for those loans has dwindled as the Fed has credited banks with trillions of dollars in reserves in payment for its bond purchases. Officials see benefits in preserving the federal funds rate, because of its familiarity and its ubiquity in financial contracts. To raise borrowing costs as economic conditions improve, however, the Fed must also raise the cost of using the excess reserves.The Fed is not planning to rely on selling bonds to reverse the buildup; it could take a long time to sell that many bonds without disrupting financial markets. Instead, the Fed is discussing raising the interest rate banks are paid on the reserves, and to tie up reserves with contracts called reverse repurchase agreements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Works to Mend Fences With Liberals", "Date": "2014-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has won significant support from traditionally Republican constituencies, including business executives who like his tax cuts and Wall Street financiers delighted with his support of charter schools. But this courtship has come at a price: As he begins his bid for a second term, he is struggling to hold on to support from the left wing of his own party.Liberals\u2019 misgivings about Mr. Cuomo, one of the nation\u2019s most prominent Democratic governors, are quickly coming into focus as the Working Families Party, one of New York\u2019s most effective political organizations in recent years, considers whether to endorse him.Leaders of the party, an alliance of labor unions and liberal activists, backed Mr. Cuomo in his bid for governor in 2010 and were a driving force behind Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s political ascent.But they are now so frustrated with Mr. Cuomo that they are privately talking about whether to nominate their own candidate to run for governor this year, according to party officials.\u201cHe is too far to the right for us,\u201d said David Schwartz, vice chairman of the Working Families Party of Westchester and Putnam Counties.Now, worried that a liberal challenger could siphon votes away from him in November, Mr. Cuomo is working to repair his relationship with the party.The split is akin to a family rift: Mr. Cuomo is heavily favored against his presumptive Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, the Westchester County executive, so neither the governor\u2019s camp nor the Working Families Party sees Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election as imperiled by the dispute. Rather, endorsing someone other than Mr. Cuomo would be intended mainly to make the left\u2019s discontent more widely known.It would be a rebuke for Mr. Cuomo, who is hoping to achieve an overwhelming margin of victory in the November general election, enhancing his stature as a potential presidential candidate and driving home his image as a Democrat who can work with Republicans to chart a middle course and break through legislative gridlock.It also would be risky for the Working Families Party: If its nominee for governor does not earn at least 50,000 votes in November, the party would lose its spot on the ballot in New York State, where candidates can appear on the ballot on multiple party lines. With Mr. Cuomo as its candidate in 2010, the party received about 155,000 votes.With that in mind, groups associated with the party have floated some high-profile names as potential standard-bearers in place of Mr. Cuomo, including Cynthia Nixon, the actress known for her role on \u201cSex and the City,\u201d and a friend of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s. (She said in an interview that she was not interested.)The frustration with Mr. Cuomo among left-leaning Democrats has been building for years. Although he proudly calls New York \u201cthe progressive capital of the nation,\u201d the governor has been selective in choosing what progressive issues to champion, an approach that liberal activists and some Democratic lawmakers have found maddening.But on fiscal issues, Mr. Cuomo has charted a course that the left views as pulling steadily to the right: He pressured state workers to accept a wage freeze, reduced pension benefits for newly hired employees and passed a cap on increases in local property taxes. And in the state budget approved in March, he exempted some multimillion-dollar estates from paying estate taxes, and reduced taxes on corporations.\u201cHe was a Democratic governor from a liberal progressive tradition,\" said State Senator Bill Perkins, a Democrat from Harlem. \"I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s abandoning that tradition.\u201dMr. Cuomo remains popular with New York voters who identify themselves as liberals: Roughly 70 percent had a favorable opinion of him in Siena College polls conducted over the past three months. But a poll last month also offered evidence of some lingering dissatisfaction. Fifty-six percent of Democrats said they wanted Mr. Cuomo to be more of a liberal, as did 80 percent of self-described liberals. And given a hypothetical ballot in which Mr. Cuomo faced Mr. Astorino and a more liberal Working Families Party nominee, 24 percent of voters said they would back the unnamed liberal.Stepping up the pressure on Mr. Cuomo, leaders of the Working Families Party emailed their members recently and asked for their thoughts on whether to back the governor.Dan Cantor, the party\u2019s executive director, said\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0that party leaders \u201cdon\u2019t know how this is going to turn out.\u201d\u201cBut the W.F.P. has insisted from its founding that the economy must work for everyone, not just the 1 percent,\u201d he added. \u201cSo it\u2019s gratifying to know that there are New Yorkers of all races and classes who feel the same way.\u201d\u201cAs the polls show, there is a big difference between those who claim to be spokespeople for the left and the actual left,\u201d he said.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s attempt at a rapprochement is playing out largely behind the scenes, as he tries to persuade the leaders of unions affiliated with the Working Families Party to urge the party\u2019s leadership to stick with him.Time is short: The party will hold its convention on May 31.A reconciliation appears to hinge on one contentious issue: a proposal to enact a system for public financing of state political campaigns, which has been a top priority for government reform groups and liberal activists.The Working Families Party is pushing Mr. Cuomo to strike a deal with legislative leaders for a broader public financing system than the much-maligned pilot program that was recently approved.The governor is working to convince the party\u2019s leaders and other activists that he shares their goal. In a private meeting with advocates of campaign finance reform, Mr. Cuomo said that when he is eulogized, he wants to be remembered for three accomplishments: legalizing same-sex marriage, tightening gun laws and passing a public-financing system, according to people with firsthand knowledge of the meeting. And he met with advocates on Wednesday to discuss how he believed a deal could be reached.But Mr. Cuomo also appears to have some apprehension about the back and forth with the Working Families Party. According to people who have spoken to the governor, but insisted on anonymity to avoid antagonizing him, he has expressed resentment at being issued an ultimatum over public financing by party leaders.The deliberations over endorsing Mr. Cuomo have also exposed a fault line within the party. Some of the unions behind it have fared well under Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration, like 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, whose members benefited when he championed a wage floor for home health workers.In the most extreme scenario, Mr. Cuomo could pressure the unions to pull their support from the Working Families Party should it run its own candidate.Kevin Finnegan, the political director for 1199 S.E.I.U., said he did not agree with Mr. Cuomo on everything, and that the leaders of the Working Families Party needed to be \u201crealists.\u201d\u201cOur goal was to push Democrats to the left,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have been successful in that. The governor is going to win, and why not use this opportunity to develop a better relationship with him?\u201dBut some party officials worry that supporting the governor could have other ramifications. \u201cI think the problem for many of us,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, of the Westchester and Putnam chapter, \u201cis if we put Andrew Cuomo on our line, maybe we have greater access to him or we get a few things done, but what have we done to the party? What have we said to the electorate about what we stand for?\u201dAdvertisement"}

In spite of the daily chaos, conflict and crisis, she and other 20- and 30-somethings here insist that Ukraine has a brighter future in store, and they say they can build it.Ms. Gumenyuk, 30, covered the Arab Spring revolts for two years as a journalist, so she knows firsthand how even the most promising revolution can lead to bitter disappointment. Still, she says, \u201cI have more optimism than I did half a year ago.\u201dAs messy as the aftermath has been, Ms. Gumenyuk and others profess satisfaction with the change in Kiev. What existed before was \u201cfeudalism,\u201d she said; now, \u201cmy state perhaps cannot defend me, but it\u2019s not acting against me, as it was before.\u201dIrena Karpa, 33, a writer and musician who is popular among young Ukrainians, shares the optimism, and the relief that her country was shaking off the old order. \u201cFor a very long time, I thought I was alone,\u201d she said. \u201cFinally, it all happened \u2014 people stopped being so passive.\u201dHer parents\u2019 generation, she said, focused on their private lives as the Soviet Union came apart in 1991 and Ukraine gained what has proved to be a messy independence. Business was conducted on an \u201cI know you, you know me\u201d basis, she said, stunting the growth of private companies and institutions. Now \u201cthe Soviet Union finally collapsed,\u201d Ms. Karpa said. \u201cIt is a pleasure to live in another historic moment.\u201dOne lesson she had learned, she said, was the importance of voting. Like many of her contemporaries, she did not bother to cast a ballot in the 2010 election and regretted the result. \u201cI say now, it was my own fault Yanukovych got elected,\u201d she said. \u201cBad power is elected by good people who do not vote.\u201dMr. Khodorkovsky recently told civic activists at an arts center in Donetsk, a major city in the east, that such readiness distinguished Ukraine from Russia under Mr. Putin. And Dmitri Oreshkin, one of the liberal Russian commentators who accompanied Mr. Khodorkovsky, told the Ukrainians, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the people in power, you can change it.\u201d He added, \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201dAlmost everyone at the arts center said they thought the national elections would take place as scheduled on May 25, even though Russia and its proxies in the east want to disrupt or invalidate them. But everyone was nervous about what might happen along the way, especially on Friday, the annual holiday celebrating the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 \u2014 a holiday that took on ominous overtones after Moscow started accusing the Kiev authorities of \u201cfascism.\u201dSavik Shuster, a veteran of Russian television in the years when it was largely free of state control, moved in 2005 to Kiev, where he now hosts popular discussions with politicians and citizens that are broadcast live. He expressed as much confidence as anyone that, this time, Ukraine would secure its revolutionary gains and not watch them evaporate as it did after the peaceful Orange Revolution of 2004-5.One reason, he and others said, was that blood had been shed this time and the Maidan was ready to revolt again if necessary. There are still hundreds of people camped in the square, almost all of them men.Irina Minkova, 44, a web designer who was introduced at the Maidan Committee tent in the square as a spokeswoman, spoke fervently of defending the revolution\u2019s gains and of presenting draft laws to Parliament that would put an end to chronic corruption and mismanagement. Mr. Yanukovych \u201chas gone, but we haven\u2019t succeeded in breaking his regime,\u201d and must keep fighting to do so, she said.Hanna Hopko, a young activist who showed Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. around the square in April, is one of several dozen people who have been working on the draft laws. The group, which includes lawyers and former government ministers, presented a package of proposals at the start of the month.Ms. Gumenyuk said the paradox of the Maidan is not lost on Ukrainian security officials: With the police appearing corrupt and ineffectual, especially in the east, she said, \u201cthe only people ready to defend the state are their former enemies\u201d like her, working to build a new Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Tries to Ease Drop in Real Estate Prices", "Date": "2014-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaBEIJING \u2014 China will increasingly manage its troubled property sector locally, as the nation seeks to avoid causing either an abrupt slowdown that undermines the economy or another surge in prices, according to government economists involved in policy discussions.After increasing at double-digit rates through most of last year, home prices started easing in late 2013 as a sustained campaign to clamp down on speculative investment and easy credit gained traction.The annual growth in average prices for new homes slowed to an 11-month low in April, official data showed Sunday. Existing home prices dropped from a month earlier in 22 of 70 cities in April, compared with 14 in March.Data last week showed property sales dropped 6.9 percent in the January-April period from a year earlier in terms of floor space and fell 7.8 percent in terms of value.The authorities know that a severe property crunch could worsen a buildup of debt but also that a blanket easing of restrictions could set off another round of credit-fueled increases in home prices. \u201cThere is no sign that the central government will relax property controls on a nationwide scale, even though the economy is slowing,\u201d said Zhao Xijun, deputy head of the Finance and Securities Institute at Renmin University in Beijing. \u201cThe pressure is mainly on local governments, because some of their debts are maturing and they need to repay.\u201d Local governments rely heavily on revenues from land sales to pay debts that official data show total 17.9 trillion renminbi, or about $2.8 trillion, so price declines and slowing sales have raised concerns about their ability to service the debts. The government economists expect the restrictions on property that were introduced over the past five years to largely remain in place, particularly in major cities, but with some local authorities given leeway to support their markets.Some smaller cities, including Tongling in Anhui Province; Ningbo in Zhejiang Province; and Nanning in Guangxi Province, have started to loosen restrictions on home purchases.In 2012, Beijing forced governments in areas including Wuhu, Foshan and Chengdu to withdraw plans to ease controls on real estate, but there has been no such response this year.\u201cThey are still watching. Property prices have started to fall, but they still don\u2019t see any serious problems,\u201d said a senior economist at a government research organization in Beijing.\u201cThe bottom line is that a property slowdown doesn\u2019t trigger financial risks,\u201d said the economist, who was not authorized to speak to the media. President Xi Jinping has said that the country should adapt to a \u201cnew normal\u201d of slower growth as the government pushes market-based overhauls to cut debt levels in the economy and generate more sustainable long-term growth.The cooling real estate market helped drag annual economic growth to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter, and a sustained decline would put China at risk of missing its economic growth target \u2014 7.5 percent \u2014 for the first time in 15 years.Standard Chartered said that official figures showed there was 17 months of stock of apartments in China\u2019s major metropolises, including Beijing and Shanghai.\u201cThe momentum is clearly negative. This downturn appears worse than previous episodes \u2014 the scale of oversupply is likely to be larger, and policy makers are understandably more hesitant to step in with immediate support,\u201d Standard Chartered economists said in a report.The government is still trying to deal with the effects of a four trillion renminbi stimulus package implemented in 2008-9, which insulated China from the global crisis but also created piles of local debt and record house prices.\u201cIt\u2019s natural to relax controls if property prices fall. Our purpose is to curb price rises and we should relax if prices no longer rise,\u201d said Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Center, a top government research body. \u201cI don\u2019t think property prices will rise further. On the contrary, the downward pressure is big.\u201d Last week the central bank called on banks to speed up the granting of home loans to first-time home buyers, although that is seen having only a limited impact.\u201cWe doubt that banks will rush out with mortgages,\u201d analysts at Bank of America Merill Lynch said in a research note. \u201cEven a meaningful increase in mortgage supply shouldn\u2019t fundamentally change the worsening property market conditions.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Earnings at Telef\u00f3nica and Alcatel-Lucent Reflect Industry Difficulties", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Many of Europe\u2019s largest telecommunications companies are still struggling to profit from consumers\u2019 seemingly insatiable appetite for Internet access.On Friday, the Spanish carrier Telef\u00f3nica and Alcatel-Lucent, the French-American telecom infrastructure giant, were the latest companies to report first-quarter earnings that showed the difficulties faced by the industry.Telef\u00f3nica, one of Europe\u2019s largest carriers, with operations from Brazil to Germany, reported a 23 percent drop in its first-quarter net income, to 692 million euros, or roughly $955 million, compared with the same period last year, as it faced stiff competition in important European markets.Alcatel-Lucent, which is undergoing a major restructuring that includes cutting an estimated 10,000 jobs worldwide, posted a \u20ac73 million loss in the first three months of the year, compared with a \u20ac353 million loss in the same period in 2013. The company benefited from continuing cost-cutting, which is expected to total \u20ac1 billion by the end of next year.While both companies operate in different parts of the telecom sector, their difficulties are representative of the problems hurting the broader industry.For European carriers like Vodafone of Britain and Deutsche Telekom of Germany, growing competition from low-cost rivals and much-needed investment in high-speed mobile data networks have sapped their ability to profit from the growing use of smartphones and tablets.Telecom infrastructure companies like Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland are facing competition from fast-growing Chinese rivals like Huawei and ZTE. They also are struggling to persuade many of their customers, which are primarily the world\u2019s cellphone operators, to buy new networking equipment and increase the sector\u2019s already large debt burden.Europe\u2019s telecom sector is similarly undergoing a new round of takeovers, as carriers, cable operators and infrastructure companies position themselves to take advantage of the expected increase in Internet usage, particularly on mobile devices.\u201cConsolidation could act as a vital antidote to tough market conditions in Europe\u2019s telecommunications sector,\u201d said Adrian Baschnonga, a telecom analyst at Ernst & Young in London. \u201cOperators are keener than ever to preserve profitability in the light of rising demand, disruptive competition and falling prices.\u201dTelef\u00f3nica, which is waiting for antitrust approval of its proposed \u20ac8.6 billion takeover of the German carrier E-Plus, suffered from weak demand in its Spanish and German operations during the first quarter of the year.To expand its content offerings in the Spanish market, Telef\u00f3nica announced late on Wednesday that it had agreed to buy the local pay-television company Digital Plus for around $1 billion. The move comes as the company offloads assets in countries like Ireland to reduce its \u20ac42.7 billion debt.Telef\u00f3nica also said that it had been hit by currency fluctuations in its largest Latin American markets, though it was continuing to upgrade its infrastructure to keep pace with local and international rivals. \u201cWe are making significant investments, accelerating our network modernization,\u201d Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s chairman, C\u00e9sar Alierta, said in a statement on Friday.Shares in the Spanish company had fallen 3.3 percent in early afternoon trading in Madrid on Friday after its earnings missed analysts\u2019 estimates.Alcatel-Lucent has said that it expects investment from European carriers to pick up over the next two years, and it already has sold around \u20ac350 million of assets as part of its restructuring plans.The company\u2019s shares had risen 2 percent in early afternoon trading in Paris on Friday, as analysts responded positively to its efforts to revamp its operations, which have struggled since the merger of Alcatel and Lucent Technologies in 2006.\u201cWe expect Alcatel-Lucent to show further improvement in profitability through the course of the year,\u201d analysts at Liberum Capital in London told investors in a research note on Friday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Housing Is Recovering. Single-Family Homes Aren\u2019t.", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReal Estate and the RecoveryThe headlines in the new report on home building activity \u2014 which is being closely watched, after many other kinds of data point to a softening in housing \u2014 are pretty terrific.The number of permits for new housing units soared 8 percent in April, the Census Bureau said on Friday, to an annualized 1.08 million. And the number of homes on which builders began construction rose a whopping 13 percent, to an annualized 1.07 million. If nothing else, the numbers help assuage fears that the housing industry is losing momentum. It now looks like the rough winter was indeed a major factor holding back home building activity so far this year, and there is now a spring thaw underway.But even in the good new numbers, there is a clear trend evident: The entirety of the improvement is coming from more building of housing in structures with five or more units, most commonly rental apartment buildings.The number of permits issued for single-family homes rose by a mere annualized 2,000 in April, whereas the number of units in so-called multifamily structures rose by 81,000. The same story applies for housing starts, where the number of single-family homes rose a measly 5,000, versus 124,000 for multifamily units.In other words, if you think that this housing recovery involves any meaningful increase in the number of traditional, suburban single-family homes with a yard and picket fence, you have it wrong. The number of single-family homes started is well below its level of late last year and still at February 2013 levels. Multifamily construction, meanwhile, has been soaring throughout the last five years.There are a few stories one can tell of what\u2019s going on here. One is a simple shift in consumers\u2019 preferences. Perhaps more people are inclined to live in big cities, where pretty much all the housing available is in apartment towers and other multifamily structures.But it probably isn\u2019t all by choice. If young adults are facing challenges saving up to buy a home because of weak job prospects, high student loan debt and minimal wage gains, they may be finding their way to smaller rental apartments and townhouses rather than bigger single-family homes.One thing that is for sure: The concentration of home building activity in the multifamily sector means it is having less overall economic punch.

{"Headline": "Ford Remakes F-150, the Nation\u2019s No. 1 Vehicle", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDETROIT \u2014 The heady combination of growing sales and big profits has spurred automakers to reinvest heavily in new models and make major changes to some of their most prominent vehicles.No company has stretched further than Ford Motor, the second-largest American automaker after General Motors, which on Monday took the wraps off a radically redesigned pickup truck at the annual Detroit auto show.Instead of playing it safe with its best-selling F-150 truck, Ford will replace its traditional steel body panels with aluminum parts, which saves weight and improves fuel economy.Such a wholesale change would have been unheard-of a few years ago, when Ford and other carmakers were under intense pressure to cut costs and save money.But now Ford has invested heavily to significantly make over the truck, even though it finished 2013 as the nation\u2019s top-selling vehicle of any kind for the 32nd consecutive year.\u201cIt\u2019s all about maintaining leadership,\u201d said Alan R. Mulally, Ford\u2019s chief executive. \u201cWe don\u2019t take risks we can\u2019t deliver on.\u201dFord is hardly alone in its efforts to significantly upgrade high-volume products and seek to gain an edge in a competitive marketplace.The aggressive approach is made possible, in part, by drastic improvements in the financial conditions of the Detroit carmakers and their foreign rivals.Ford, like their hometown competitors General Motors and Chrysler, has transferred costly retiree health care obligations to employee trusts.The companies have also reduced the number of workers and factories to better align production with market demand.In addition to cutting costs, the companies are enjoying the fruits of a steadily expanding market for new vehicles in the United States, as well as higher sticker prices for new models.Industry analysts said the companies are intent on building on their recent success with better products loaded with new technology and features\u201cThese turnarounds always take place because of new product,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an independent auto analyst in Detroit. \u201cIn this case, Ford is rolling the dice on the aluminum truck to improve what is already a dominant position.\u201dChrysler, the smallest of the three Detroit car companies, is also pushing hard to capture a bigger chunk of the American market, which last year grew by 7.6 percent, to 15.6 million vehicles.The company has methodically revamped several of its most important models since it was forced to seek a government bailout and file for bankruptcy five years ago.On Monday, it showed off a new version of its Chrysler 200 midsize sedan \u2014 which has lagged the company\u2019s overall growth in the United States.\u201cWe needed a credible competitor in the midsize market,\u201d said Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and its Italian parent company, Fiat.Chrysler spent more than $1 billion to overhaul an assembly plant in Sterling Heights, Mich., to produce the new model, which features a fuel-saving nine-speed transmission and a sleek new body style.Since its bankruptcy and bailout, Chrysler has focused mainly on improving its most successful models, like the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickup truck.But Mr. Marchionne said that Chrysler was now financially healthy enough to expend resources on products that, in the past, might have been neglected.\u201cDo we have the resources to do whatever we want to do?\u201d he said. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201dGeneral Motors, the biggest American automaker, is also revving up product programs that were delayed or hampered by its bankruptcy and bailout in 2009.The company is showing off variations on two hot models, the Chevrolet Corvette sports car and Cadillac ATS sedan, at the Detroit show.G.M. also revealed a redesigned version of its GMC midsize pickup \u2014 a niche vehicle that it could not afford to update when the company was under financial stress.\u201cWe might not have done this before,\u201d said Mark Reuss, who this week takes over as G.M.\u2019s global product chief. \u201cBut we see a lot of open space in the market where we can make gains with a midsize pickup.\u201dOther automakers are also loading up with new models being introduced in Detroit, like a new version of the Fit subcompact from Honda.The star of the show so far, however, has been the Ford pickup.Analysts and executives from competing automakers have expressed mixed views on Ford\u2019s bold strategy to trim 700 pounds of weight in the F-150 with aluminum parts.The question asked repeatedly was why would Ford risk such a broad change of a perennially popular vehicle?\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier about our recent success, but we cannot afford to be complacent for one second,\u201d said William C. Ford Jr., Ford\u2019s executive chairman.Redesigning the truck and updating factories to produce it could cost Ford more than $2 billion, according to estimates by analysts, an enormous commitment, even for the capital-intensive auto industry.\u201cThis is a huge deal,\u201d said Alec Gutierrez, an analyst with the auto-research firm Kelley Blue Book. \u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for Ford in so many ways.\u201dBut Ford has made several large bets on new technology under the leadership of Mr. Mulally, who said recently that he would remain at the automaker at least through this year rather than continue to be considered as a chief executive candidate at the software giant Microsoft.\u201cWe had one of our most fantastic years ever in 2013, but we cannot back off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to take chances if you want to stay the leader.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Hollywood, All Things Hip Lie in Brooklyn", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe inevitable has happened.It is another sign of how far Brooklyn\u2019s fortunes have risen. \u201cGirls\u201d and, before it, movies like Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d have been able to claim a measure of homegrown authenticity, since their creators lived in Brooklyn. But the wave of movie, advertising and especially television filming that has inundated the borough in recent years, glorifying its leafy neighborhoods and cultural cachet, has swept it into the mainstream, the big-budget and the touristy.By now, Brooklynites have discovered what Manhattanites have long known: Filming can be a messy, intrusive business. Over the winter, the mayor\u2019s office declared a moratorium on filming in part of Brooklyn Heights after residents grew tired of disruptions.And the chasm between reality and the big screen is wide indeed. \u201cManhattan has always told the story of aspiration and wealth,\u201d said Laura Berning, a longtime location scout. \u201cNow Brooklyn is telling the story of a really upwardly mobile person.\u201dTo be sure, Brooklyn has had many cameos onscreen. There was the pink house on Rugby Road in \u201cSophie\u2019s Choice.\u201d The streets of Bay Ridge in \u201cThe French Connection.\u201d A Coney Island roller coaster in \u201cAnnie Hall.\u201d Brooklyn Heights in \u201cMoonstruck.\u201dBut consider this: According to Andrea Raisfeld, a location agent, Ms. Berning is scouting upscale Brooklyn homes for a coming movie, \u201cThe Intern,\u201d directed by Nancy Meyers. Her interiors are so well-known on \u201cGirls\u201d that Lena Dunham\u2019s character, visiting a deluxe brownstone in one episode, blurts out, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a Nancy Meyers movie!\u201d While Manhattan is still filmed more than any other borough, Brooklyn runs close behind. The tax credits New York State has afforded the film industry, along with strong support from the administration of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, have brought more productions to all of the boroughs over the past decade. Still, half of the 29 television series produced in the city last season were based in Brooklyn, compared with one out of seven in the 2002-2003 season. Many of this year\u2019s new pilots were shot in Brooklyn, scouts said.Some in the film and television industry have been wary that the new mayor, Bill de Blasio, with his populist reputation, could favor the residents who are disgruntled with filming on local streets.The office\u2019s new commissioner, Cynthia L\u00f3pez, who grew up in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, said the office was \u201cworking very hard to think about creative ways in which we can be very transparent so people know exactly when production is coming in.\u201dStephen Levin, a city councilman who represents some of Brooklyn\u2019s most-filmed neighborhoods, has introduced legislation that would require Ms. L\u00f3pez\u2019s office to publicize where filming permits are issued.\u201cWhen you find out that there is a major movie star on your block, there\u2019s the initial thrill,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the thrill kind of wears off.\u201dFor productions, however, the bloom has yet to fade. Location fees are cheaper than across the East River. More technicians, directors and actors now live in Brooklyn. Brooklyn offers a tantalizing array of locations, from the Victorians of Ditmas Park \u2014 which can stand in, or \u201ccheat,\u201d for any suburban neighborhood \u2014 to the working-class-looking streets of Greenpoint to the charming storefronts in Carroll Gardens, perfect for period shoots.\u201cOne thing that we\u2019re really looking for is old New York character, and Manhattan\u2019s definitely lost that,\u201d said John Perez, a location scout for print advertising shoots.And for productions set in locations farther afield, there are two major studios, Steiner Studios in the Navy Yard and Broadway Stages in Greenpoint. Television shows based at Steiner Studios, like \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d which is set in Prohibition-era Atlantic City, can fan out into nearby neighborhoods for exterior shots or other locations with a minimum of bother, said Doug Steiner, the developer of Steiner Studios.Brooklyn stands in for Washington on \u201cThe Americans.\u201d It \u201ccheats\u201d for parts of Chicago on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d which is based at Broadway Stages.Will\u2019s \u201capartment\u201d is a loft in a former Bushwick industrial building; doubling as his restaurant is Isa, the seasonal Italian Williamsburg spot. Like any self-respecting Brooklyn restaurant, the fictional restaurant, Van Renseller, is farm-to-table and proud of it: Will even mentions personally picking its vegetables at a local farm.Cue disdainful groans from locals who fear that Brooklyn has become a bit too famous for its own good.New York\u2019s film-worthy neighborhoods are \u201cno longer SoHo or the Upper West Side,\u201d said Matthew Hammond, a teacher who lives in Greenpoint. \u201cNow it\u2019s, like, Bushwick. Like \u2014 really?\u201dThose houses are easy to find. Location scouts need only scour blogs like Brownstoner, page through \u201cshelter\u201d magazines or knock on doors in picturesque neighborhoods. After all, Hollywood and advertising agencies want the same thing buyers want: lots of light, open kitchens, well-preserved historical detailing, graciously proportioned rooms and, preferably, a back garden.That describes the Fort Greene brownstone Ms. Raisfeld, the location agent, who represents about 100 Brooklyn properties, was photographing recently as its owner, Julie Hirschfeld, rushed to make her son\u2019s bed and cringed over a dead plant in the window.Ms. Raisfeld drives into Brooklyn at least once a week to collect new homes. \u201cI call it \u2018feeding the monster,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough.\u201dNeither can the directors and the advertisers. Scouts said Mikimoto, of the pearl jewelry, is hunting for a Brooklyn Heights brownstone for its advertisements. Microsoft recently shot an advertising campaign in a Park Slope brownstone.That has not stopped productions from using fancy lofts for young characters, perhaps dressing them down in a slight concession to authenticity. A production crew, with cameras, lighting equipment and dozens of people, often requires a big space. And, well, illusions are what the movies are for.\u201cI would not consider it fair if someone in Williamsburg were complaining that we weren\u2019t portraying Williamsburg in an accurate light, considering that person probably just moved here from Ohio,\u201d said Nick Carr, another location scout. \u201cDid they come here for the same reason they\u2019re filming here\u201d \u2014 in search of a gritty-yet-glamorous fantasy of Williamsburg?But nothing enrages the average Brooklynite like the filming itself. Entire blocks become no-parking zones. Production trucks spew noise and fumes onto quiet streets. Production assistants scold pedestrians like traffic cops.\u201cIt depends which side of the check you\u2019re on,\u201d said Glenn Wolin, who lives at Beverly Square West, west of Flatbush. He has earned up to $4,000 a day hosting productions like the HBO series \u201cFlight of the Conchords.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re getting the money, it\u2019s wonderful. If you\u2019re not, it\u2019s a big nuisance.\u201dIn Brooklyn Heights, whose riverside promenade and grand brownstones have been filmed for decades, film crews have been so ubiquitous that the mayor\u2019s office declared a moratorium on filming in the neighborhood\u2019s northern streets late last year.Andrea Demetropoulos has been approached about filming inside her Brooklyn Heights pet store several times, but usually refuses out of consideration for the neighbors, she said.Ms. Demetropoulos remained stubbornly un-starstruck. \u201cWhat do they think, he\u2019s going to run up and kiss them?\u201d she said.While filming in Greenpoint, the \u201cGirls\u201d crew once moved a woman\u2019s noisy birthday party to a nearby bar to achieve silence for the shoot. (The show picked up the tab.)\u201cThat show annoys the hell out of me \u2014 all these silly girls shoving up in here,\u201d said Chris Smith, an artist who has lived in Greenpoint since 1995. Worse still, he said, is the unsettling idea that Hollywood has turned its glamorizing light on his formerly humble neighborhood.\u201cGirls,\u201d whose characters\u2019 apartments and hangouts belong to a recognizable, believable Brooklyn, may be one thing. But even that landscape is more and more slippery.\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to live here anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThe authentic Greenpoint experience was always vinyl siding. Now it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s aspirational.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Central Bank Says Stimulus Is Likely, but Not Before June", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMario Draghi, the president of the central bank, said Europe would suffer from effects like a decline in the Russian economy, stiffer economic sanctions or higher gas prices.\u201cIt\u2019s a very complex geopolitical picture, which could evolve,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at a news conference in Brussels. \u201cIf it does evolve, the euro zone and European Union are going to be impacted more than other parts of the world.\u201dAlthough the central bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25 percent, Mr. Draghi said there was agreement among members of the governing council, which sets monetary policy, that something should be done to counteract very low inflation, which some economists see as a grave threat to the euro zone economy.\u201cThere is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThere is a consensus about not being resigned and accepting this as a fact of nature.\u201dThere was also concern about the euro exchange rate, he said. On Thursday, the euro neared $1.40 as investors sought refuge from turmoil elsewhere in the world. A strong euro makes products from the euro zone more expensive in foreign markets, and tends to push inflation down even further because imported goods become cheaper.\u201cThe strengthening of the euro in the context of low inflation and still low levels of economic activity is a cause for serious concern in the view of the governing council,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Mr. Draghi did not say, however, what action the European Central Bank might take to stimulate the economy. And he left an escape hatch, saying that the governing council wanted to wait for the next round of economic projections by the bank\u2019s experts, due before the next monetary policy meeting on June 5. Mr. Draghi\u2019s statement suggested that the central bank might not act after all if the forecasts point to higher inflation.\u201cThe governing council is comfortable with acting next time,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, but he added, \u201cwe want to see the staff projections.\u201dHaving raised expectations, though, Mr. Draghi might strain his credibility if the central bank does nothing next month.\u201cDraghi has pushed the E.C.B. into a corner from which it will be very hard to escape,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients.Also on Thursday, the Bank of England kept interest rates at a record low. The bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee left its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since the depths of the financial crisis more than five years ago.While many economists have called for more decisive action from the European Central Bank to stimulate the euro zone economy, members of the bank\u2019s governing council have appeared reluctant to deploy the more radical measures that would be required to do so.Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the bank was committed \u201cto using also unconventional instruments within its mandate,\u201d a reference to so-called quantitative easing \u2014 large purchases of bonds or other financial instruments to pump money into the economy. Most analysts, though, expect the central bank to cut its main interest rate closer to zero before taking more radical steps.Annual inflation in the euro zone was 0.7 percent in April, according to an official estimate, which is well below the central bank\u2019s target of close to 2 percent. Such low inflation is risky, some economists say, because it leaves the euro zone vulnerable to a ruinous downward price spiral known as deflation that might be set in motion by some sort of shock, like a worsening of the crisis in Ukraine.Modest inflation is considered healthy, in part because it eases the burden on debtors in a region where many countries, companies and individuals are having problems repaying their loans.The problem facing the central bank is that, while it is standard practice to keep a lid on excess inflation by raising rates, inducing an increase in inflation is much more difficult. It might require the bank to use measures that have never been tested in the euro zone, like huge purchases of government bonds or other assets.Spain, Portugal and Ireland show clear signs that they are emerging from the crisis. But unemployment remains high and credit remains tight for businesses in those and other countries, like Greece and Italy.Some analysts say that the central bank faces too many constraints to be able to deploy quantitative easing. There is no Pan-European debt instrument similar to the Treasuries that the Fed bought as part of its program, for example. There are also legal restraints on the European Central Bank that do not bind the Fed.\u201cIf the E.C.B. could have bought bonds in a traditional Q.E. operation,\u201d Carl B. Weinberg, the chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said in a note, \u201cit would have done so already.\u201dMr. Draghi said the bank\u2019s governing council had received a \u201cpositive presentation\u201d earlier on Thursday on the progress made by some of the countries hardest hit during the crisis. The briefing was by Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the finance minister of the Netherlands who is also serving as the head of the so-called Eurogroup of ministers from the countries that use the euro currency.\u201cSocieties have changed, and the recovery has started,\u201d said Mr. Draghi, who cited a drop in unemployment in Portugal last year. \u201cEfforts which were so painful, and for such a long time, are producing now some positive outcomes.\u201dEuro zone countries lately have been moving ever closer to joint oversight of their economies and banking systems, hoping to prevent a rerun of the crisis that nearly sank the euro. But questions remain about how much further member states should go in a number of areas, including whether to create a permanent post to lead the Eurogroup, rather than the current part-time position.Although Mr. Draghi declined to say whether he favored creating a full-time position at the head of the Eurogroup, he said that the progress on banking reform and economic growth showed that \u201cthe European way of decision-making that takes place in the Eurogroup is good.\u201d\u201cOur crisis would not have been as severe as it has been if we had had more integration, not less integration,\u201d he said, \u201cand our future lies with more integration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Venezuela\u2019s populist president, even put a copy of the book, which he had called \u201ca monument in our Latin American history,\u201d in President Obama\u2019s hands the first time they met. But now Mr. Galeano, a 73-year-old Uruguayan writer, has disavowed the book, saying that he was not qualified to tackle the subject and that it was badly written. Predictably, his remarks have set off a vigorous regional debate, with the right doing some \u201cwe told you so\u201d gloating, and the left clinging to a dogged defensiveness. \u201c\u00a0\u2018Open Veins\u2019 tried to be a book of political economy, but I didn\u2019t yet have the necessary training or preparation,\u201d Mr. Galeano said last month while answering questions at a book fair in Brazil, where he was being honored on the 43rd anniversary of the book\u2019s publication. He added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be capable of reading this book again; I\u2019d keel over. For me, this prose of the traditional left is extremely leaden, and my physique can\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d\u201cThe Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent\u201d was written at the dawn of the 1970s, a decade when much of Latin America was governed by repressive right-wing military dictatorships supported by the United States. In this 300-page cri de coeur, Mr. Galeano argued that the riches that first attracted European colonizers, like gold and sugar, gave rise to a system of exploitation that led inexorably to \u201cthe contemporary structure of plunder\u201d that he held responsible for Latin America\u2019s chronic poverty and underdevelopment. Mr. Galeano, whose work includes soccer commentary, poetry, cartoons and histories like \u201cMemory of Fire,\u201d wrote in \u201cOpen Veins\u201d: \u201cI know I can be accused of sacrilege in writing about political economy in the style of a novel about love or pirates. But I confess I get a pain from reading valuable works by certain sociologists, political experts, economists and historians who write in code.\u201d\u201cOpen Veins\u201d has been translated into more than a dozen languages and has sold more than a million copies. In its heyday, its influence extended throughout what was then called the third world, including Africa and Asia, until the economic rise of China and India and Brazil seemed to undercut parts of its thesis.\u201cIf I were teaching this in a course,\u201d said Merilee Grindle, president of the Latin American Studies Association and director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies at Harvard, \u201cI would take his comments, add them in and use them to generate a far more interesting discussion about how we see and interpret events at different points in time.\u201d And that seems to be exactly what many professors plan to do.Caroline S. Conzelman, a cultural anthropologist who teaches at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said her first thought was that she wouldn\u2019t change how she used the book, \u201cbecause it still captures the essence of the emotional memory of being colonized.\u201d But now, she said: \u201cI will have them read what he says about it. It\u2019s good for students to see that writers can think critically about their own work and go back and revise what they meant.\u201dPrecisely why Mr. Galeano chose to renounce his book now is unclear. Through his American agent, Susan Bergholz, he declined to elaborate. She said he had gradually grown \u201chorrified by the prose and the phraseology\u201d of \u201cOpen Veins.\u201d In his remarks in Brazil, Mr. Galeano acknowledged that the left sometimes \u201ccommits grave errors\u201d when it is in power, which has been taken in Latin America as a criticism of Cuba under the Castro brothers and of the erratic stewardship of Venezuela under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who died last year. But Mr. Galeano described himself as still very much a man of the left, and on other occasions he has praised the experiments in social democracy underway for the last decade in his own country, as well as in Brazil and Chile.\u201cReality has changed a lot, and I have changed a lot,\u201d he said in Brazil, adding: \u201cReality is much more complex precisely because the human condition is diverse. Some political sectors close to me thought such diversity was a heresy. Even today, there are some survivors of this type who think that all diversity is a threat. Fortunately, it is not.\u201dStill, Mr. Galeano has caught many admirers by surprise, including the Chilean novelist Isabel Allende, who wrote a foreword for the English-language edition of \u201cOpen Veins.\u201d In it, she describes how she \u201cdevoured\u201d the book as a young woman \u201cwith such emotion that I had to read it again a couple more times to absorb all its meaning\u201d and took it into exile after Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power.\u201cI had dinner with him less than a year ago, and to me, he was the same man, passionate and talkative and interesting and funny,\u201d she said of Mr. Galeano in a telephone interview from California, where she now lives. \u201cHe may have changed, and I didn\u2019t notice it, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d In the mid-1990s, three advocates of free-market policies \u2014 the Colombian writer and diplomat Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, the exiled Cuban author Carlos Alberto Montaner and the Peruvian journalist and author \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa \u2014 reacted to Mr. Galeano with a polemic of their own, \u201cGuide to the Perfect Latin American Idiot.\u201d They dismissed \u201cOpen Veins\u201d as \u201cthe idiot\u2019s bible,\u201d and reduced its thesis to a single sentence: \u201cWe\u2019re poor; it\u2019s their fault.\u201dBut Mr. Galeano continues to have defenders. In a discussion on the website of the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, one participant noted that in a world dominated by Apple, Samsung, Siemens, Panasonic, Sony and Airbus, Mr. Galeano\u2019s lament that \u201cthe goddess of technology does not speak Spanish\u201d seems even more prescient than in 1971. \u201cThat is what Galeano has done with his book, 43 years after it having been published,\u201d Mr. Ega\u00f1a concluded. \u201cThank you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s tenure as marked by economic doldrums, stifling taxes and a lack of political courage.Beginning what will be a steep uphill battle to unseat Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who remains relatively popular in the polls, Mr. Astorino ticked off rankings of states in which New York fell at the bottom, and implored Republicans gathered here for their state convention to join him in a \u201cfight to save New York.\u201dMr. Astorino, 47, who was born in Mount Vernon, raised in Mount Pleasant and educated at Fordham University, lamented the emigration of New Yorkers.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be telling our children and grandchildren about what New York once was, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t either,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t act now in an urgent and serious way.\u201dNew York Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2002, and they face challenges this year.

Mr. Cuomo has avoided talking much about his bid, indulging in an incumbent\u2019s luxury to remain above the fray.But the state Democratic Party has attacked Mr. Astorino on the governor\u2019s behalf, criticizing him for his opposition to abortion rights and strict gun laws.\u201cIn today\u2019s speech we\u2019ve learned that Republican Rob Astorino is doubling down on his ultraconservative right-wing agenda,\u201d Peter E. Kauffmann, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party, said.Mr. Astorino largely avoided social issues in his speech, delivered in a ballroom at the Hilton Westchester hotel. At the convention, held Wednesday and Thursday, the governor was the favorite villain; a chant of \u201cCuomo\u2019s got to go\u201d broke out at one point.Mr. Astorino was a radio executive and on-air personality, most recently for Sirius XM satellite radio\u2019s Catholic Channel, and has held several elected posts in Westchester County. He was elected county executive in 2009 and won re-election last year.Republicans hope Mr. Astorino can replicate his success attracting voters across the political spectrum. He has some advantages: After a career in broadcasting, he seems natural giving interviews. On Thursday, he delivered a brief portion of his speech in Spanish.Unlike some past conventions, there was no major intraparty drama at this Republican gathering. Republicans had lined up behind Mr. Astorino; on Thursday, they formally gave him their backing, and he is not expected to face a primary opponent.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Astorino acknowledged the challenges he faced, such as Mr. Cuomo\u2019s fund-raising advantage. But he said he was confident he would raise enough money to get his message out. Republicans also gave their backing to Mr. Astorino\u2019s pick for lieutenant governor, Christopher J. Moss, the sheriff of Chemung County. Mr. Moss, who the state Republican Party said would be the first African-American to be nominated by the party for statewide office, has been a critic of the gun-control measure that Mr. Cuomo championed.Addressing the convention on Thursday, Mr. Moss said the state was \u201cplagued by a culture of corruption that gives organized crime a whole new meaning.\u201d He criticized Mr. Cuomo over reports that his office interfered with a panel he established, and then disbanded, to investigate public corruption, a matter that is being examined by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York.\u201cIn the world I come from \u2014 law enforcement \u2014 that\u2019s called obstruction of justice,\u201d he said.Republicans also designated John P. Cahill, who served as the top aide to former Gov. George E. Pataki, to run for attorney general against the incumbent, Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democrat. And they backed Robert E. Antonacci, the Onondaga County comptroller, to challenge the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democrats, Seeing Opportunity, Nominate Businessman for Pennsylvania Governor", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTom Wolf, a wealthy businessman and a former Peace Corps volunteer, won the Democratic nomination for governor of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, setting up what his party hopes will be one of its best chances this fall to flip a governor\u2019s mansion now held by a Republican. Speaking to supporters after his victory at a minor-league baseball stadium in York, his hometown, Mr. Wolf accused Mr. Corbett of leading \u201can administration that wants to hollow out our schools and play fast and loose with jobs.\u201d This week, Mr. Corbett seized on the latest report of the state\u2019s declining unemployment rate, the lowest since September 2008, which will probably be a central issue in the general election.Even before the primary, Mr. Corbett began attacking Mr. Wolf, the clear Democratic front-runner, by tying him to the administration of Gov. Edward G. Rendell, a Democrat under whom Mr. Wolf served for 18 months as revenue secretary. Mocking the beat-up 2006 Jeep that Mr. Wolf is seen driving in his campaign ads, Mr. Corbett released an ad showing a stalled-out Jeep and blaming Mr. Wolf for serving in government during a time of high taxes and rising unemployment. Ms. Schwartz, who made a rare ad boasting of her support of President Obama\u2019s health care law, had sought to appeal to women to end \u201cthe old boys\u2019 club\u201d in Harrisburg, the capital. She led in early polls last year. But once Mr. Wolf began airing television ads in late January \u2014 two months ahead of his rivals, who were busy fund-raising \u2014 he shot to a double-digit lead that continued to widen. It was a textbook case of flooding the airwaves to create a likable image with voters. The ads, which featured Mr. Wolf driving his black Jeep, introduced him as a Ph.D. graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who once drove a forklift for his family\u2019s kitchen cabinet business, and who after growing rich shared the profits with employees. None of the four Democrats stood apart when it came to their attacks on Mr. Corbett. All agreed \u2014 and Mr. Wolf is likely to continue raising the issues \u2014 that the governor was responsible for a $1 billion cut to education during his first year in office. Mr. Wolf also called for a tax on natural gas drillers, which he said should do more to share their prosperity with the state. Mr. Corbett opposes taxing drillers more, saying they will move to other states. Mr. Corbett, in a message to supporters before polls closed, professed no preference for who his rival might be. \u201cThey all represent the same big-government tax-and-spend policies that have failed us before,\u201d he wrote.In Arkansas \u2014 where Democrats hope to retain the office held by Gov. Mike Beebe, who is unable to run because of term limits \u2014 Mike Ross, a former congressman, defeated Lynette Bryant for the party\u2019s nomination. Mr. Ross will face the Republican nominee, Asa Hutchinson, also a former congressman, in November. Mr. Hutchinson defeated a Little Rock businessman, Curtis Coleman. In Georgia, as expected, Jason Carter, a Democratic state senator and grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, and Gov. Nathan Deal, the Republican incumbent, won primaries and will face each other in November. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Spot of Tea Party?", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the warm-up speeches, a hush of expectation fell. The Forum in Bath is an Art Deco movie theater now used mostly for concerts and evangelical services, and on the last Tuesday of April, it had the air of a revivalist meeting. In the foyer, they were selling books, button badges and even tea towels, while inside a lively, if middle-aged, audience nearly filled the former cinema.They had come to hear Nigel Farage, the loquacious, dynamic, bumptious, bibulous, irrepressible leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, who was touring the country ahead of the elections to the European Parliament later this month. He has himself been a member of that body for 15 years and will doubtless be re-elected, although he belongs to it only to attack it, and his party exists to destroy it, or at least British participation in it and in the European Union.That still seems quite a remote prospect, but these elections, separate from national elections, could have a drastic impact on British politics. As yet, UKIP doesn\u2019t have a single member of Parliament, or M.P., in the House of Commons at Westminster. But if the polls are right, UKIP will come out on top in the European elections, ahead of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who at present govern the country in uneasy coalition, as well as the opposition Labour Party. Even if UKIP doesn\u2019t believe in the E.U., winning in the European elections will greatly enhance their position back home.Maybe because he thought he was about to upset the political apple cart, Farage had a swagger in his step as he took the stage at the Forum to thunderous applause. He spoke easily, at some length, with no notes or prompter, relentlessly hammering away at his theme: The country threw away its independence and is now governed by the Eurocrats of Brussels, who have let in a flood of immigrants from Bulgaria and Romania. All will be well if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.Outside, there was a knot of demonstrators as well as a BBC television truck: Farage is news. Two protesters held a banner that said (incorrectly as it happens) \u201cNigel Farage is a banker,\u201d and one woman had a small handwritten placard reading, \u201cThey called Hitler charismatic too.\u201d If the comparison is hyperbolic, she\u2019s hardly alone. For all his apparent geniality, Farage is seen by plenty of people as a pernicious figure and his party as a danger to the political health of the nation.In addition to an egg thrown at him as he was walking through Nottingham three days later, a deluge of criticism and scandal has recently washed over him and his party \u2014 from allegations of financial impropriety to a concerted campaign to brand UKIP as racist, an accusation that some of its own activists have done nothing to discourage. And all of it is laughed off by Farage with cheeky bravado. At his peroration in Bath, he said that he had received a letter from a 92-year-old former bomber pilot: \u201cNigel, you only start getting flak when you\u2019re near the target!\u201dHe likes to dish out flak as well as take it. In February 2010, Farage gained a measure of international fame, or notoriety, when Herman Van Rompuy, a Belgian politician who was the newly appointed president of the European Union, was in Strasbourg, France, to address the Parliament. Farage told Van Rompuy to his face that he was a man with \u201cthe charisma of a damp rag\u201d \u2014 those tea towels on sale at the UKIP meeting in Bath bore Van Rompuy\u2019s face and the words \u201cGenuine Belgian Damp Rag\u201d \u2014 and that no one outside Belgium had ever heard of him. It left Van Rompuy in stunned silence and quickly became a YouTube classic.Among those who cheered Farage\u2019s vulgar assault were plenty of Tory M.P.s at Westminster. They are openly rebellious and disloyal to Prime Minister David Cameron and close to UKIP in spirit. Cameron has placated them by promising a referendum on whether or not to stay in the E.U. after the next election.But here is a tangle of paradoxes. Many voters \u2014 British and otherwise \u2014 use the European elections as a way to vent their spleen against their governments, and conventional politics in general, but then return to the mainstream parties in national elections. However well it does in these European elections, UKIP is still not certain to win any seats at the British general election in a year\u2019s time. And because Labour and Liberal Democrats are opposed to a referendum on European withdrawal, one will be held only if the Conservatives win an absolute majority at Westminster. That doesn\u2019t seem very likely at present \u2014 and what makes it less so is the prospect of UKIP stealing votes from the Conservatives and handing the election to Labour.Although UKIP has the E.U. as its central obsession, its support stems from discontent with much broader social and cultural change \u2014 a fundamental disquiet with the rapidly shifting face of England. Farage delights some and disgusts others, and yet no one is quite sure what to make of him, or even knows for sure who he is.Farage went to Dulwich College in south London, an excellent private school with the distinction of having educated P. G. Wodehouse and Raymond Chandler. By his own account, Farage was a noisy and annoying boy, and a letter from his school days recently returned to haunt him. When he was chosen to be a prefect, one of his teachers wrote an objection to the boy\u2019s offensively right-wing opinions. \u201cOf course I said some ridiculous things,\u201d Farage says with a grin and a shrug, \u201cnot necessarily racist things.\u201d Grinning and shrugging is something he does often.As a schoolboy, he was already absorbed by politics. He knew the man who ran the Conservative Party in his village, \u201cwho\u2019d come back from India in \u201947 and who believed in drinks at 6 o\u2019clock in a truly remarkable way,\u201d Farage says with a tinge of admiration. \u201cYou know \u2014 six or seven large Scotches before dinner!\u201dBut his real conversion came after a visit to his school by Sir Keith Joseph, that fascinating Tory, very rich and very clever, who was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s advance guard, the proto-apostle of a revived free-market creed. Farage says he was \u201cso taken by Keith Joseph that I joined the Tory Party at 14.\u201dAt 17 he supposed that he would go to college or join the army \u201cand then think about the City\u201d \u2014 of London that is, the British Wall Street. But then Margaret Thatcher was elected in 1979. Her government cut taxes, and by 1986 came the so-called Big Bang, the deregulation that quickly transformed the financial sector, for better or worse. Farage heard about the \u201cbright young things\u201d in the City who were \u201cliving hard, doing terribly well\u201d and working at a frenetic pace. \u201cI thought, Well, I\u2019ve got to become one of them as quickly as possible.\u201dSo he did, joining the London Metal Exchange as a broker. Farage\u2019s book, \u201cFlying Free,\u201d is quite readable by the admittedly low standards of political memoirs. In it, he cheerfully describes his City years, not quite an English Wolf of Wall Street but a lad making money fast through a long day and drinking hard through a long night, marrying, chasing women, divorcing.In 1990, Thatcher was deposed by a party coup, to Farage\u2019s disgust. \u201cThe way it was done \u2014 and the people that did it,\u201d he snorts. \u201cChinless bloody nobodies who wouldn\u2019t have existed without her.\u201d In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty turned the European Community into a Union, on paper at least, and conceived the single currency that was adopted by many members 10 years later. Farage was so horrified by this that he joined the group that became UKIP, although he soon fell out with some members.In those days, he not only said but also did some ridiculous things. When he was 21, he spent an argumentative evening in the pub downing beer and Irish whiskey and was hit by a car while walking home. After months of recuperation, he learned that he had testicular cancer, but he was successfully operated on. (He \u201cthanked God\u201d that he\u2019d had \u201ctwo of them,\u201d and he went on to father two sons by his first wife and then two daughters by his second and present wife, Kirsten Mehr, who is German.)Then, on the day of the last British general election, in 2010, he was in a light aircraft towing a UKIP banner when it crashed. Farage was very lucky to survive, and he turned the disaster into a career move: The title \u201cFlying Free\u201d alludes to the crash, and the back cover features a photograph of the author emerging dazed from the wreckage. That kind of brazen cheerfulness is part of his appeal, along with his act as a man of the people (albeit an expensively educated man whose father was a stockbroker).When the government broke promises last year to set a minimum price for alcohol and to restrict sales of cigarettes, Sarah Wollaston, a family doctor turned Conservative M.P., asked angrily: Who on earth wants to be known as \u201cthe party of booze and fags?\u201dHer question is easily answered: UKIP does. Rarely is Farage photographed without a glass of beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, and he has consistently enjoyed good press \u2014 better than he deserves, critics say \u2014 because journalists find him convivial and entertaining, which, it\u2019s fair to say, he is.We met at Boisdale, a restaurant that he frequents not far from Victoria Station and that itself deserves critical deconstruction. Much tartan is spread about, but then \u201cthe owner is the heir to the chief clanship\u201d of the Macdonalds of Clanranald, Farage assured me. The steaks are man-size, the wine flows freely and there\u2019s a smoking terrace above, which is why Farage particularly likes the place.After we washed down our lunch with Champagne and \u201cthis excellent claret,\u201d as he politely called the wine I ordered, we repaired upstairs for another glass of wine and, in his case, several more cigarettes. Political lunches in Washington aren\u2019t like this nowadays.All that is no more than \u201csaying some silly things on Twitter after a few pints,\u201d Farage says, and anyway these are people of no account in the party. But that can\u2019t excuse the egregious Godfrey Bloom, a UKIP Euro M.P. By way of denouncing overseas aid last summer, Bloom asked why the British were giving money to \u201cBongo-Bongo-land.\u201d When rebuked, he first said that he had intended \u201cPresident Bongo of Gabon\u201d (the Gabon president is Ali Bongo Ondimba) and then, on television, that a bongo was \u201ca white antelope that lives in the forest\u201d (they are actually auburn with white stripes).When William F. Buckley was helping to mold the modern American conservative movement more than a half-century ago, his first task, he later said, was to purge the nasty racists and anti-Semites. Farage wants us to believe that he is doing the same. He was eager to tell me that he was speaking the following evening at a meeting organized by The Jewish Chronicle, that he had spoken at mosques several times and that his activists now included a rabbi and a Muslim businessman.Even if you might charitably say that Bloom probably isn\u2019t a real bigot, just a boor and a buffoon, that\u2019s not really much help to Farage if he\u2019s trying to cut a serious political figure. It\u2019s also not his biggest problem. On the face of it, UKIP seems to be a single-issue party, but it is hard to imagine how the obsession with Europe can sustain voter interest in the long run. When UKIP claims that this is the central issue of the day for all British people, it is demonstrably wrong. Polls show that Europe is far down the list of voters\u2019 concerns, after the economy, employment, health care and immigration.To be sure, the European Union is not loved in England today, but then neither is it in most other member states, as a startling continentwide survey has just shown. Asked whether they favored \u201ca more integrated European Union, with more decisions being taken by the E.U.,\u201d only 15 percent of French voters and 12 percent of Germans agreed. And while a mere 5 percent of British voters did, that was exactly the same as in progressive Sweden.What\u2019s odder is that the issue in question, if it is resolved as the party wants, would mean the party\u2019s own destruction. Suppose that UKIP had its way, a referendum were held and the British voted to leave the E.U.? What then for UKIP?It\u2019s true that it does have a ragbag of other policies, some of which resonate even with people who are deeply suspicious of UKIP and allergic to Farage. There is, for instance, UKIP\u2019s opposition to the wind turbines that are now covering the countryside or the Pharaonic plan for a high-speed railway line that will cost untold billions while destroying more of rural England. And there is also its hostility to military intervention.\u201cI would gladly have put on a uniform to fight for the Falklands,\u201d Farage told me, but he and his party opposed Tony Blair\u2019s crusade in Iraq. And it was the cranks of UKIP, rather than the bellicose Labour and Tory Parties, that represented the British public, which never wanted the war. Since then, UKIP has opposed the intervention in Libya and the intervention that might have been in Syria.At the beginning of April, Farage debated on television with Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, and taunted him for his support for bombing Libya. \u201cThe British people have had enough of endless foreign military interventions,\u201d Farage said to loud applause. It was notable that while the mainstream pundits who were there to comment on the debate thought that Clegg won, the public, by way of pollsters, gave the victory to Farage, 68 percent to 27 percent.That means that \u201cT.M.S.,\u201d which seems to have been on air all my life, provides endless opportunity, apart from actual commentary on the play, for old codgers to ruminate, tease one another and exchange anecdotes, all as if time had stood still since Compton and Edrich were batting for England 60 or more years ago.Or even before that. \u201cWhen I first spoke at UKIP meetings,\u201d Farage told me with a smile, \u201chalf the chaps in the audience were wearing Bomber Command ties,\u201d those brave old men no doubt thinking wistfully of the days when they could give more forceful expression to their Euroskepticism by incinerating Hamburg and Berlin.There aren\u2019t many aircrew left, or enough men whose natural habitat is the bar at the golf club to form a real electoral constituency. What the latest research shows, not so surprisingly, is that a large part of UKIP\u2019s support comes from former Labour voters, the old working class, who feel left behind and excluded. \u201cWhite face, blue collar, gray hair\u201d was one succinct description of these voters.Even if the UKIP voter profile isn\u2019t so much mature as downright elderly, with very few young supporters, that might not be such a disadvantage. In all recent British elections, people over 60 have been far more likely to vote than those under 30, which in itself is quite ominous for the future of democracy.Today\u2019s parliamentary leaders of the larger parties \u2014 Cameron, Clegg and Ed Miliband of Labour \u2014 are all uncharismatic, unexciting and unconvincing. At the same time, far and away the most colorful and provocative politicians of the moment are not in Parliament at all. One is Boris Johnson, the roistering, entertaining and extremely ambitious mayor of London. Another is Alex Salmond, the crafty and formidable leader of the Scottish National Party. And then there is Farage.They might all in their different ways be considered mountebanks, but they appeal to more and more voters who are disenchanted with mainline politics \u2014 a disenchantment that has helped Farage personally as well as politically. Quite apart from the political charges, he has been accused of tax avoidance, as well as other shady financial dealings. He employs his wife on the public payroll and was said to have employed a former mistress as well. (Farage has denied this in print.) And none of it matters. Farage almost relishes playing the stage villain, the bounder or rotter, and he sails through it all with the accusations running off him like rain off his waterproof Barbour coat. It\u2019s the same with Johnson, London\u2019s mayor, whose highly eventful sex life doesn\u2019t seem to have damaged him politically at all.If anything, Farage\u2019s brashly rebarbative manner and checkered career have made it too easy for the respectable consensus to dismiss him and to overlook the fact that not everything he says is wrong. The European Union really is bloated, corrupt and undemocratic. Its ruling elite is indeed an unaccountable, self-perpetuating and self-satisfied oligarchy.A single currency embracing countries wildly disparate in economic performance has been a disaster for many, leaving tens of millions of young people in Greece, Spain and Italy with no jobs, no money and no future. The grandiose posturing of that oligarchy in Brussels or Strasbourg is embarrassing in the circumstances. They speak as if the \u201cEuropean Union\u201d were some equivalent of, and rival to, the American Union, when in reality the member states can\u2019t agree on anything from banking policy to Ukraine.In one European country after another, nationalist or nativist or frankly racist parties \u2014 and UKIP has had a tinge of all these characteristics \u2014 are on the rise. It\u2019s possible that many representatives of such parties will sweep into the European Parliament this week, but if that happens, it will not be good enough to blame those who vote for them. To the contrary, it will be hard not to feel that the complacent Eurocracy had it coming.As for UKIP, it may or may not be a serious political force with a real future, but its rise is a reproach to the mainstream political parties. Next year\u2019s British general election is the hardest to call in many years, with the Tories fractious and contumacious, Labour still baffled by how to deal with the legacy of Blair (\u201cmy closest partner and best friend on the world stage,\u201d as George W. Bush so truly called him) and the Lib Dems possibly facing electoral implosion.All of that, and the wild card of UKIP. Nigel Farage and his team of oddballs may not have any very constructive answer to our problems. But as Farage has put it: \u201cIf you\u2019re on a train headed for a crash, you get off.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Seeks $1.6 Billion in Damages From Roche and Novartis", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The Italian government is seeking $1.6 billion in damages from two of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies \u2014 Novartis and Roche \u2014 for losses that it says the national health service incurred from the companies\u2019 efforts to restrict competition in ophthalmic drugs.The ministry statement said that the companies\u2019 anticompetitive actions had caused the national health service \u201cconsiderable damage,\u201d though it did not provide details.\u201cMagistrates will ascertain the facts,\u201d Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin told reporters on Thursday. \u201cShould it turn out that there has been an abuse, it is right that the national health fund is compensated.\u201dNovartis issued a statement rejecting the assertions. \u201cWe strongly deny allegations about anticompetitive practices,\u201d it said, noting that it had appealed the antitrust authority\u2019s fine on May 2. Roche did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but it has previously denied any impropriety, calling the charges unfounded.In a separate action also announced late Wednesday, the ministry said it was pursuing damages of \u20ac14 million from Pfizer, the largest pharmaceutical company in the United States, for seeking to keep generic drugs out of the market. The claim dates to 2012, when the antitrust authority found Pfizer had abused the patent system to stop generic competitors to its Xalatan eye drops, used to treat glaucoma.Pfizer disputed the ministry\u2019s claim, saying in a statement, \u201cWe believe our conduct is in compliance with both industrial and antitrust laws and we vigorously contest the request of damages.\u201dFaced with the strains that an aging population and a stagnating economy have placed on its health service, Italy has been seeking to keep a tight rein on drug costs, an effort that has included a crackdown on questionable sales and marketing practices.The ministry\u2019s claim against Novartis and Roche is based on the conclusion of Italian investigators that the Swiss companies secretly encouraged the use of a drug in which they shared an interest, Lucentis, to treat age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness in the elderly. The companies worked to inhibit sales of a cheaper alternative, the anticancer drug Avastin, they found, by overstating its dangers.It is possible that the fines will not end in Italy, as the French authorities this spring began investigating Novartis and Roche in the same case.David Jolly reported from Paris and Gaia Pianigiani from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Buenos Aires", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateOriginally a single-family home, this building in the Recoleta\u00a0neighborhood of Buenos Aires is now luxury apartments. A five-bedroom\u00a0unit on the third floor is on the market for $1.8 million.A FIVE-BEDROOM APARTMENT IN THE RECOLETA NEIGHBORHOOD OF BUENOS AIRES$1.8 MILLIONThis five bedroom three-and-a-half bath apartment is on the third floor of a French-style building in Recoleta. The building, originally a single-family home, dates to the early 20th century. The lobby is decorated with classical statues, and a stone staircase leads to the apartments upstairs.The apartment features original stained-glass windows, parquet floors made of Slovenian oak, fireplaces and high ceilings throughout. French doors connect the graceful reception rooms, which include a formal living room, an office, and a formal dining room. Doors in the dining room open onto a Juliet balcony, and the room\u2019s chandelier is fashioned out of concentric circles. The kitchen has black-and-white tiled floors, double ovens and an informal dining area that seats eight. There is also a smaller breakfast nook beside the butler\u2019s pantry. A long hallway with gilded molding and contoured ceilings leads to the five bedrooms. The master suite includes a private sitting room, a walk-in closet and a marble bathroom. The unit also includes staff quarters with three bedrooms and a laundry room.Residents of the building share a parking facility and a courtyard. A rooftop deck is accessible via a service elevator. The space is surrounded by a lush container garden, and there is a shady sitting area, a barbecue and a bathroom.Recoleta is an upscale commercial and residential district that has been compared to Paris and other European cities. The building is steps from boutiques, cafes and restaurants. On the weekends, locals and visitors stroll down the streets watching street performers, shopping and visiting museums and parks. Ministro Pistarini International Airport is a 40-minute drive away.MARKET OVERVIEWArgentina\u2019s real estate market has slowed recently, according to Sue Rasmussen, a sales agent for ReMax Mas in Buenos Aires, citing an 18.6 percent drop in the number of transactions in 2013. Ms. Rasmussen attributes the downturn to political unrest and to the currency fluctuations that continue to plague the Argentine economy. Because the Argentine peso is unstable, real estate has historically been priced in dollars.But Micah Miller, an American lawyer with Wiener Soto Caparros in Buenos Aires, said that in 2011 the government drastically tightened restrictions for Argentines who want to convert pesos into dollars. This has made it much harder for Argentines to buy property, because most sellers prefer to find a buyer who can make the purchase in dollars. These new exchange restrictions have contributed significantly to a slowing real estate market, Mr. Miller said.Sellers have been unwilling to lower prices, so prices have not declined significantly. But there is some indication that sellers are getting more flexible. \u201cBy some accounts, many sellers have closed at 10 to 15 percent discounts off the list price,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Prices for well-appointed apartments in Recoleta are around $204 to $235 per square foot, Ms. Rasmussen said, but some can cost as much as $557 per square foot, depending on the location and the prestige of the building. In contrast, a luxury loft apartment in a converted factory in the Barracas neighborhood might cost 50 percent less.The apartment profiled here is priced at $293 per square foot.WHO BUYS IN BUENOS AIRESAlthough there are many residents from other Latin American companies living in Buenos Aires, Ms. Rasmussen said they are more likely to rent than to buy. \u201cThey are mostly employees of petroleum companies, diplomats and students,\u201d she added.Most of the foreign buyers in Buenos Aires come from Europe and the United States, said Adriana Massa, the listing agent for this property and the general manager of Argentina properties for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. There are also a few residential buyers coming from China and Korea.BUYING BASICSForeigners in Argentina need a tax identification number before they can buy property, according to Mr. Miller. Foreigners are also required to document where the money for the purchase is coming from and sign an affidavit testifying that the money was obtained in a legal manner. In addition, Mr. Miller said a 2011 law restricts the amount of rural land that can be owned by a foreigner to 1,000 hectares (about 2,500 acres.) For properties inside the city of Buenos Aires, there is no restriction on foreign ownership.Transaction costs include a notary fee of 1 to 2 percent of the purchase price, plus a real estate agent commission of 2 to 4 percent. Both the commission and the notary fees carry a 21 percent value-added tax, according to Mr. Miller. Transfer taxes and recording fees come to about 2 percent of the purchase price, although a portion of this tax is waived for the purchase of primary homes, Mr. Miller said.WEB SITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYSpanish; peso (1 peso = $0.12)TAXES AND FEESMonthly maintenance fees for the apartment are $1,000.

{"Headline": "A Victory for Airbnb in New York", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAirbnb, the popular apartment-sharing service, won a legal standoff Tuesday when a state judge ruled that the company did not have to give up customer records as part of an investigation by the New York attorney general.The decision may give Airbnb only temporary respite, however. The office of Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said he planned to issue a new subpoena in coming days for Airbnb customer records that addressed the judge\u2019s concerns.Still, Airbnb was fast to claim victory in one of the most prominent of several conflicts between members of the Internet\u2019s sharing economy and government officials.Airbnb has met opposition from an array of factions, including hotels that face competition from its services, neighbors who don\u2019t like strangers staying next door and tenant rights groups who fear Airbnb will further diminish the availability of affordable housing.Airbnb, for its part, has promoted the economic benefits that its service brings to people who are able to make extra money by renting out rooms in their homes, along with neighborhoods that see additional tourists attracted by local housing.In a statement, Airbnb said it looked forward to working with Mr. Schneiderman to \u201cmake New York a better place to live, work and visit.\u201d\u201cThis decision is good news for New Yorkers who simply want to share their home and the city they love,\u201d the company said.As services like Airbnb and Uber, the ride-sharing service, spread across the country, lawmakers and other officials in some cities have started seeking ways to curb their explosive growth and bring them into compliance with existing laws, written before the companies were ever imagined.In Seattle, the City Council recently passed rules imposing limits on the number of vehicles from ride-sharing services, though the companies have collected enough signatures to challenge the measure. In San Francisco, where Airbnb is based, proposed legislation could make short-term rentals through Airbnb and other services more complicated and expensive.The Supreme Court in New York squashed a subpoena served to Airbnb by the state\u2019s attorney general that sought information about the start-up\u2019s users.The Internet Association, a trade group that represents major web-based companies, called the judge\u2019s decision an \u201cimportant win for the innovation economy and individual liberty.\u201dThe group\u2019s president and chief executive, Michael Beckerman, said in the statement: \u201cThe Internet Association supports the court\u2019s recognition that overly broad subpoenas that would not be appropriate going to a brick-and-mortar business should not be applied to sharing-economy services either.\u201dMr. Schneiderman, the attorney general, had asked Airbnb to produce records for thousands of Airbnb \u201chosts\u201d in New York, the people who rent out their apartments to others.He had sought their physical and email addresses, dates of guest stays and the amount of revenue the hosts made on their rentals, among other information. Some of the site\u2019s hosts, he says, are violating the law. In New York City, it is illegal to rent out an apartment for fewer than 30 days, a measure that was put in place in 2010 to crack down on unregulated hotels.Airbnb had numerous objections to the subpoena, but the one that resonated with Justice Gerald W. Connolly of the Albany County Supreme Court was the company\u2019s argument that the demands for customer data were overly broad. In his decision, the judge said the subpoena was not limited to hosts in New York City, nor to rentals of fewer than 30 days.The subpoena \u201cas drafted,\u201d the judge wrote, \u201cseeks materials that are irrelevant to the inquiry at hand and accordingly, must be quashed.\u201dThe judge also said in the decision that there was evidence that a \u201csubstantial\u201d number of Airbnb hosts were violating New York\u2019s hotel and tax laws, and he ruled against the start-up on several of its other objections to the subpoena.\u201cOur office is committed to enforcing a law that provides vital protections for building residents and tourists alike,\u201d said Matthew Mittenthal, a spokesman for the attorney general. \u201cThe judge rejected all of Airbnb\u2019s arguments except for a narrow technical issue, and we will reissue the subpoena to address it.\u201dEven as the case continues, Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, said he would like to see Airbnb and lawmakers find a way to come up with new set of guidelines that distinguish between occasional users of the service and those who are doing it on a much larger scale with multiple apartments.\u201cWe need a new regulatory framework that is reasonable and inclusive of providing this new form of short-term accommodation commercially,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

This was the first time it moved into positive territory for the year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 5.62 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,883.95. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.01 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,114.56.Stocks started the day lower after the government reported that the economy stalled in the first three months of the year as winter storms chilled business activity. The Commerce Department said growth slowed to a barely discernible 0.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, less than the rate of 1.1 percent forecast by economists, according to FactSet.The market\u2019s reaction to the report was muted because most investors expect the slowdown to be temporary as growth rebounds along with warmer weather.\u201cMost people, including us, expected March to have been the strongest month of the first quarter\u201d and believe that growth will continue to pick up, said Sean Lynch, global investment strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank. \u201cThat\u2019s an O.K. environment for the market.\u201dStocks climbed higher in the afternoon after the Fed, giving a positive view of the economy, said it would reduce its monthly bond purchases by another $10 billion, to $45 billion. \u201cGrowth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions,\u201d the Fed\u2019s policy makers said in their statement.Among the stocks on the move, Sealed Air rose $1.72, or 5.3 percent, to $34.31 after the food packaging company\u2019s earnings easily beat expectations. Twitter fell $3.65, or 8.6 percent, to $38.97 after its customer growth disappointed investors when it reported quarterly results late Tuesday.More than 60 percent of S.&P. 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings. Analysts currently expect earnings to grow by 1.7 percent in the period, according to S&P Capital IQ data. That compares with growth of almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter and 5.2 percent in the same period a year ago.In the bond market, interest rates dropped. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.65 percent from 2.70 percent late Tuesday, while its price rose 14/32, to 100 29/32. As bond yields remain relatively low, stocks will most likely remain attractive to investors, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. \u201cWhat else are you supposed to do with your money?\u201d Mr. Kelly said.

{"Headline": "Why Divestment Fails", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorExcept that it won\u2019t be. Individual divestments, either as economic or symbolic pressure, have never succeeded in getting companies or countries to change.Global public equity markets constitute about $60 trillion of market capitalization. With about $19 billion, Stanford\u2019s endowment represents only about five-hundredths of 1 percent of the world\u2019s capitalization. Even if Stanford divested itself fully of all its stocks, both fossil and nonfossil, it would probably take the market less than an hour to absorb the shares. It would not lead the executives of the affected companies to engage in soul-searching, much less in changes in operations. Proponents of divestment argue that it sends an important signal, and that other university endowments will follow. Yet all of them together command only about $500 billion of market capitalization. Moreover, if divestment really drove down fossil-fuel stock prices, then there would be plenty of other investors ready, able and willing to step in to buy their shares, now trading for just a little cheaper than they otherwise would.But didn\u2019t a similar boycott force South Africa in the 1980s to abandon apartheid?Unfortunately not. In an academic study, my co-authors and I found that the announcement of divestment from South Africa, not only by universities but also by state pension funds, had no discernible effect on the valuation of companies that were being divested, either short-term or long-term. And there was no real effect on the composition of their shareholders between institutional and noninstitutional investors. We looked hard for evidence linking boycotts and sanctions to the value of the South Africa\u2019s currency, stock market and economy. Nothing.In retrospect, our evidence should not be surprising. For each investor and business that withdrew, there were others standing by ready to step in. True, stating that the impact of economic sanctions was low is not the same as stating that the isolation of the apartheid regime had no effect. The wide ostracism may well have weighed on President F. W. de Klerk\u2019s mind. But it was not the economic effect of the boycott that forced him to the table. Of course, not everything is economics. Morals matter. Would I have divested from South Africa? Yes, but I would have had no illusion that doing so would have made a difference. And I would have told others that, in light of its ineffectiveness, I would have understood that reasonable and moral individuals could have come to a different conclusion.In the case of fossil fuels, the situation is even murkier.The moral choice is much less clear than it was with apartheid. Energy is an area with no obvious solutions. Apartheid had no place in a civilized world. Fossil-fuel companies are supplying a market demand, one that for the time being cannot be met by other fuel sources. Divestment won\u2019t change that calculus.And there is no guarantee that the strategy will lead to the outcome that divestment proponents want. Suppose divestment worked \u2014 and coal companies poured their resources into, say, hydroelectric power, or nuclear. Neither outcome would be a clear-cut win for society or the environment. If Stanford really wants to reduce fossil fuel use, it has two better options.For one, Stanford could pay polluters to pollute less and press institutions that want access to Stanford\u2019s intellectual resources. One way to do this would be to take a 180-degree turn from its current course and buy up lots of energy stocks, concentrating its holdings and then using that position to press corporate boards to make changes.This would be expensive. The values of these companies would most likely drop, imposing a cost on the Stanford endowment. But unlike the \u201crun\u201d strategy, the \u201cinfluence\u201d strategy could actually make boards and executives of these companies take notice.The second option is to help make both clean and nuclear energy cheaper than fossil fuels. Stanford has enormous intellectual and financial resources that have helped revolutionize the technology sector. Why can\u2019t it do the same with energy? This includes not only the research and development of clean-energy technology, but also its commercialization. Neither option is cheap. And neither is necessarily the mission nor in the self-interest of Stanford. But either would be more effective than divestment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Report, State Comptroller Is Cautious About Benefits of Casinos", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byALBANY \u2014 Sounding a cautionary note about expanded gambling in New York State, Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli warns in a new report that casino complexes planned for upstate will face stiff regional competition and that much of the new revenue anticipated from the casinos will come from New Yorkers, not necessarily from out-of-state visitors.The report, to be released Friday, is far more guarded about the benefits of new casinos than Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has promoted them as a powerful economic development tool for beleaguered parts of the state.While the report says casinos are likely to enhance state revenue and create jobs, Mr. DiNapoli also says economic benefits statewide may be uneven, with gains in areas with casinos offset by job losses elsewhere.In an interview, Mr. DiNapoli said the report raised doubts as to whether casinos were \u201ca magic solution\u201d to deep-rooted economic challenges.\u201cThere will be winners and losers,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe jury is still out as to what the long-term impact is and whether that might well be as positive as proponents have argued.\u201dGambling officials were dismissive of the report, adding that it was not surprising that New Yorkers \u2014 already avid gamblers \u2014 would make up much of the new casinos\u2019 customer base. \u201cThe \u2018study\u2019 is most notable for its utter lack of facts,\u201d said Lee Park, the director of communications for the New York State Gaming Commission. \u201cIt is beyond dispute that more than a billion dollars each year are being spent by New Yorkers at out-of-state casinos. That\u2019s money that can be used here for education, tax relief and to create jobs.\u201dThe first new casinos could open as soon as 2015, officials say.In promoting his casino plan, Mr. Cuomo said he imagined resorts enticing some of the tens of millions of tourists who flock to New York City every year to extend their visits to other parts of the state. \u201cI believe casinos in upstate New York could be a great magnet to bring the New York City traffic up,\u201d he said in last year\u2019s State of the State address.The Cuomo administration\u2019s estimates suggest that new casinos will generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year in state and local revenue, create thousands of jobs and lead to $1 billion in construction spending.But the comptroller\u2019s report cautions that many gamblers, shoppers and diners at casino-resort complexes will be drawn from inside the state. \u201cIn terms of the state\u2019s economy, such activity primarily represents substitution of gambling losses for other consumer purchases (entertainment or retail sales, for example),\u201d the report says, \u201crather than net new business.\u201dThe report notes the crowded marketplace the casinos will enter, a result of increased saturation of casinos across the country. On the East Coast, recent troubles have included budget bailouts in Delaware and bankruptcies in Atlantic City, it said.Mr. DiNapoli said that he welcomed new revenues and jobs and that he had no opinion as to whether casinos were a good or bad idea. \u201cWe just want people to have realistic expectations as to what may, or may not, come from this,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hoping to Fend Off Suits, G.M. Is to Return to Bankruptcy Court", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn unusual meeting took place this week at a law office high in a Times Square skyscraper. Lawyers from about 100 law firms participated, either in person or by phone. The agenda: solidifying a strategy for taking on General Motors in bankruptcy court.Bankruptcy court was supposed to be a fading memory for the giant automaker. But on Friday, less than five months after declaring the era of \u201cGovernment Motors\u201d over and done with, the new G.M., which just completed its 17th consecutive profitable quarter, will be back before Judge Robert E. Gerber in the Federal Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, girding for a new fight.On the surface, G.M. is merely asking the judge to enforce a provision of its July 10, 2009, bankruptcy reorganization that insulated the \u201cnew\u201d company from lawsuits stemming from accidents that occurred before that date. But the reason for the request is far from routine. The company is trying to shut down a rising tide of class-action lawsuits stemming from its recall of 2.6 million cars because of a dangerously defective ignition switch that it now links to 13 deaths.Asking a judge to enforce part of a restructuring happens in many bankruptcy cases. But in this situation, some bankruptcy experts say, it may be a risky move. Objections have poured into the court from plaintiffs in cases around the country, alleging that the company committed fraud during the bankruptcy proceedings five years ago by not disclosing the potential liabilities from the faulty switch, a problem it now admits was known in parts of the company for more than a decade before the recall.\u201cI think it\u2019s a gamble from G.M.\u2019s perspective,\u201d said David A. Skeel, a bankruptcy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Law and the author of \u201cDebt\u2019s Dominion: A History of Bankruptcy Law in America.\u201d \u201cIf I were the judge, I would not give them a carte blanche and say this litigation has got to stop. I suspect the response will be more nuanced than that.\u201dIn fact, he and others say, the otherwise routine motion could potentially end up leading to a mini-trial of sorts, on whether or not fraud was committed. If that happens, Mr. Skeel said: \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s we\u2019re redoing the bankruptcy. It\u2019s quite possible this trial could be a larger event than the real bankruptcy.\u201dIf allegations of fraud become a focus, the proceedings could go a long way toward answering a question that two congressional investigations, countless news reports and other inquiries have not been able to ascertain so far \u2014 how high up in the company did the knowledge of the switch defect go? G.M. has largely declined to make employees available for questioning and has continually cited its own internal investigation.The two lead lawyers representing G.M. in its motion to enforce the bankruptcy order did not return phone calls. But outside lawyers say the company may still have the upper hand. There is a generally accepted feeling that judges do not like to tamper with sales or restructuring plans and that the greater economic good of this one \u2014 which has been credited not only with saving the company, but also preventing the American economy from sinking deeper into recession \u2014 may be paramount. Whatever the outcome for G.M. and the plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits against it, the result could have wider implications for American business.\u201cThis may be an important case for teaching us how bankruptcy sales can relieve a company of its past mistakes,\u201d said Richard Levin, head of the restructuring practice at Cravath, Swaine & Moore.Some lawyers note that whatever Judge Gerber decides is likely to be appealed by the losing side and could possibly end up in the Supreme Court.The bankruptcy court proceeding on Friday is a procedural conference \u2014 \u201cNo substantive matters will be decided at the conference, nor will evidence be taken,\u201d wrote Judge Gerber in an order \u2014 but it sets the starting point of a process that could be lengthy and perilous.In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, G.M. said it was aware of 59 putative class-action suits filed on behalf of owners of cars with the defective switch, seeking compensation for economic losses, including diminution in value of the vehicles.Lawyers for the myriad cases this week selected three among them to take the lead role before the judge on Friday and possibly beyond \u2014 Edward S. Weisfelner, head of the corporate bankruptcy and restructuring practice group at Brown Rudnick, who organized the large meeting in New York this week; Sander L. Esserman of Stutzman, Bromberg, Esserman and Plifka in Dallas; and Elihu Inselbuch of Caplin and Drysdale in New York.\u201cWe are going to ask the new G.M. for some admissions and stipulated facts,\u201d Mr. Weisfelner said. \u201cThe basic issues are that old G.M. knew about this defect, could reasonably ascertain who the affected consumers were, should have and could have given direct notice.\u201dHe concluded: \u201cThese people were deprived of their due process.\u201dPart of G.M.\u2019s strategy has been to take some of the emotion out of the bankruptcy court battle by moving for the dismissal only of the economic loss cases \u2014 and not any personal injury or wrongful death lawsuits tied to the ignition defect. While that might soften the public relations blow a bit, getting rid of the economic cases is probably more valuable to the company since the price tag for dozens of class actions is likely to be higher.G.M. has hired Kenneth Feinberg, a lawyer who has set up victims\u2019 compensation funds in numerous disasters, including the Boston Marathon bombings and the BP oil spill, to come up with a way to deal with the personal injury claims outside the courts.After G.M. was shepherded through its 39-day bankruptcy proceedings by the federal government, the company had no intention of ever returning to court or revisiting that humbling chapter in its history. Executives portrayed G.M. as grateful for its $49.5 billion federal bailout, but intent on proving that it would never need help again to survive.Once the new G.M. went public in 2010, its chief executive, Daniel Akerson, would rarely refer directly to the bankruptcy case, preferring to call it a \u201csecond chance.\u201d And as the automaker began growing again and making big profits, Mr. Akerson asserted that G.M. was a new entity with little connection to its tumultuous past. At a speech in December, he said the company\u2019s \u201cGovernment Motors\u201d nickname had thankfully faded. \u201cTo be honest, we don\u2019t hear it that much anymore,\u201d he said. (Reached at his home recently, Mr. Akerson declined to discuss the ignition switch issue.)When Mary T. Barra succeeded Mr. Akerson as chief executive this year, she took a similar tack. \u201cThere\u2019s been a sense that since the restructuring, there has been a righting of the ship,\u201d she said in an interview on Jan. 23. But eight days later, Ms. Barra learned that the company\u2019s safety investigators were recommending a recall of older-model Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars for the potentially deadly flaw in their ignition switches \u2014 the beginning of a series of events that would place it on a path back to bankruptcy court.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Increase Puts a Chill on Retail Sales in Japan", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japanese retail sales fell in April at their fastest pace in three years as sales of cars and electronics declined, government data showed Thursday, offering the first indication of how consumers are reacting to a sales tax increase that took effect on April 1.The 4.4 percent decrease in retail sales from the same month last year was more than the median estimate among analysts polled by Reuters of a 3.3 percent decline, and was the biggest drop since the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011.The decrease in sales of apparel and toiletries was limited, according to figures from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, but there are worries that a recovery in durable goods could take more time.\u201cThere are signs that declines in spending on daily necessities is already bottoming out, which supports a gradual recovery in spending,\u201d said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.The government raised the nationwide sales tax to 8 percent, from 5 percent, in April to cover rising welfare costs. But the tax increase has caused economic volatility and concern that Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy after the United States and China, will experience a prolonged contraction if consumers shun higher prices.In March 1997, the month before the last time the government raised the sales tax, retail sales rose 12.4 percent, compared with the same month the year before. They fell 3.8 percent that April, after the tax went into effect. Retail sales remained weak for the remainder of that year as the economy skidded into recession.Officials at the Bank of Japan, the central bank, have repeatedly said that any harm from the current sales tax increase will be temporary and that the economy will continue to grow. Most economists are optimistic that midyear bonus payments will help consumer spending turn around.The government is also pushing public works spending to give the economy a lift. Nonetheless, some advisers close to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe think the central bank will need to add stimulus to ensure that consumer prices reach the target of 2 percent inflation.Sayuri Shirai, a Bank of Japan board member, said Thursday that aggressive monetary stimulus should remain in place well into 2016 because it will take longer than the central bank\u2019s two-year time frame to achieve its inflation goal.Ms. Shirai, a former International Monetary Fund economist, said that the central bank should not be adamant about meeting the two-year time frame \u2014 set in April 2013 when the stimulus program was put into place \u2014 because of the risk of creating excessive distortions in the economy. Her views contrast with the repeated assurances of Haruhiko Kuroda, the central bank\u2019s governor, that Japan is on track to meet the bank\u2019s inflation goal sometime next year.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t think that we must achieve 2 percent inflation strictly in two years at whatever cost,\u201d Ms. Shirai, among the most dovish policy makers in the nine-member board, said after meeting with business leaders in Naha, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is to ensure that 2 percent inflation is maintained in a stable manner.\u201dUnder the stimulus program, the central bank pledged to double the money supply through aggressive asset purchases to accelerate inflation.Mr. Kuroda has repeatedly emphasized his conviction that Japan can achieve the inflation target within two years, although some on the policy board, like Ms. Shirai, agree with private-sector analysts that the time frame is too ambitious for a country only just emerging from deflation.In its half-year projections issued last month, the central bank said it expected to achieve the inflation target during fiscal 2015, which ends in March 2016.But Ms. Shirai said it will take until fiscal 2016 for consumer inflation to reach 2 percent, because households and companies will need time to adjust to price rises after 15 years of deflation. There is also the risk that household spending might lose momentum if wages do not increase enough to make up for the rising cost of living from inflation and a two-stage increase in the sales tax, she said.The tax increase put in place in April was the first step, with a second increase, to 10 percent, scheduled for October 2015, provided the government feels the economy is stable enough to proceed. Ms. Shirai said the Bank of Japan must scrutinize how the second sales tax increase will affect the economy in judging whether the inflation target is achieved, suggesting that stimulus program should be maintained at least until fiscal 2016.Mr. Kuroda has said that the stimulus is an \u201copen-ended\u201d program that will be maintained until the inflation goal is achieved in a stable manner.Advertisement"}

The eldest son of the late King Hassan\u2019s only brother, Moulay Abdellah, he is also the first cousin of King Mohammed VI \u2014 making him third in line to the Moroccan throne.Nicknamed \u201cthe Red Prince,\u201d he grew up to become a political activist whose public support for democracy has put him at odds with his family in Morocco. He exiled himself to America and was banned from the presence of the king for advocating a constitutional monarchy, like that in Britain or Spain.In a culture where princes are expected to hold their tongues and where family affairs do not leave the palace walls, Prince Moulay Hicham isn\u2019t welcome.\u201cIt\u2019s been traumatizing. I have seen a father destroyed. It is a world where everything is artificial and nothing is genuine,\u201d the prince, now 50, said during an interview at his hotel in Paris. \u201cI am happy to live far away. Instead of having 100 friends, you have five friends, but at least you know that they are here for you.\u201dIn April, he published a new autobiography, \u201cJournal d\u2019un Prince Banni,\u201d or Diary of a Banished Prince, that weaves together a series of vignettes and anecdotes to give readers a rare glimpse into Morocco\u2019s royal family. But it also serves as a harsh political critique of the kingdom from an insider.The book, which will be translated into English in a few months, details how King Hassan, who died in 1999, constructed an opaque system of rule in which the elite could flout the law with impunity. Though he celebrates the late king\u2019s undeniable grandeur, the prince describes him as an evil genius who brought Morocco onto the world stage. He also gives an intimate view of life inside the palace, growing up among the intrigues, and the mind games between him and his uncle.He employs a sharp wit to describe some of his uncle\u2019s more perplexing episodes, like the day in 1980 when Hassan made Queen Elizabeth of England wait an hour for him \u2014 meant to show, it was believed, that he was the greater monarch of the two.Prince Moulay Hicham also talks about the humiliation to which he was subjected, and shares intimate accounts of his father\u2019s alcoholism and his mother\u2019s battle with substance abuse.WHEN Mohammed VI inherited the throne in 1999, he was welcomed by a burst of optimism that withered after a few ineffectual gestures toward greater democracy and human rights.\u201cThere is no Moroccan exception. It\u2019s an authoritarian regime, that\u2019s all,\u201d the prince said. \u201cAfter the death of King Hassan, it quickly became evident to his son that change implicates costs and trade-offs. He was not ready to make sacrifices, and the regime just went back to its old ways.\u201d\u201cThis book is harsh because the reality is harsh,\u201d said Ignace Dalle, author of \u201cLes Trois Rois\u201d (The Three Kings), a book on the Moroccan monarchy. \u201cMoulay Hicham is right; this cannot last forever.\u201dKing Mohammed has come under fire for his stranglehold on the economy and for micromanaging the elected government.\u201cI don\u2019t see in Mohammed VI\u2019s entourage any advisers who will tell him to move forward,\u201d Mr. Dalle said. \u201cThey are too absorbed by their own personal interests.\u201dJohn Waterbury, an American scholar and author of \u201cCommander of the Faithful,\u201d an extensive account of Morocco\u2019s politics, said Prince Moulay Hicham\u2019s book provides intimate details that shed light on the monarchy and the king\u2019s entourage.That attempt at transparency, Mr. Waterbury said, was bound to spark shock and anger.\u201cIn his advocacy, Moulay Hicham is hard on many Moroccans, especially the rich and privileged that live off rents provided by the Makhzen,\u201d he added, referring in Arabic to the establishment elite. \u201cHis critique has been building for years. It has been manifest both in family occasions \u2014 weddings, birthdays, even deaths \u2014 and in his published opinions in Le Monde Diplomatique and elsewhere.\u201d\u201cOne does not expose these intimacies, some flattering and some highly critical, without triggering explosions,\u201d he said. \u201cMoulay Hicham wants deep change, the kind of change that would frighten any head of state.\u201dTHE prince, who holds degrees from Princeton and Stanford, and is a former United Nations peacekeeper in Kosovo, serves on the advisory board of Human Rights Watch and has founded various institutes. A businessman and passionate advocate of green energy, he also produced the award-winning documentary \u201cA Whisper to a Roar,\u201d on the fight for democracy across the world.Politics \u2014 in particular the direction of his country \u2014 remain at the heart of his activism.\u201cThe regime will need to meet social demands, and it cannot meet them because it destroys the economy it actually needs to foster,\u201d Prince Moulay Hicham said, dressed in a gray sweater and jeans at his hotel. \u201cBut the Makhzen will ultimately know its crisis because of its own contradictions.\u201d\u201cMoroccans are as well in a comfort zone. They want change, but they don\u2019t want to go through what Tunisia or Egypt went through,\u201d he said.The prince has been estranged from the current king for 20 years, save for a few rare meetings. His daughters, on the other hand, are close to Mohammed VI. He said that while he doesn\u2019t really know his cousin anymore, he has fond memories of a happy childhood together.As for the reaction to his book in the Moroccan media, he just shrugs.\u201cThe book is a best seller,\u201d he answered with a smile and twinkle in his eye. \u201cI am not intimidated. If you survived King Hassan, the rest is a walk in the park.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As many as 2,500 people were said to be missing in the disaster, one of the worst to hit the war-torn country in at least a decade.Weeks of steady rain softened the hillside above the village of Abi Barak in the Argo district of Badakhshan Province, near the borders with China and Tajikistan. Officials said one part of the hill gave way around 11 a.m., burying about 300 houses \u2014 by some estimates nearly half the village \u2014 in a mass of sodden mud. Neighbors who rushed to help were buried when a second part of the hill slid a short time later.\u201cI believe it is beyond human capability to even remove all of the dead bodies,\u201d said Shah Waliullah Adeeb, the governor of Badakhshan. \u201cIt will take months for machinery to complete the search for bodies.\u201dInitial reports on the toll from the landslides were sketchy. Government officials said that up to 2,500 people could have been buried. The United Nations said late on Friday that the death toll was at least 350.The extent of the devastation was also unclear, in part because it was difficult to communicate with the area because the landslides had knocked down cellphone towers, officials said.Aid efforts began almost immediately. Surviving villagers were moved to neighboring areas for safety. President Hamid Karzai ordered his second vice president, as well as the army, the directorate of local government and officials in Badakhshan, to take every available action to aid the affected families.From the White House Rose Garden, President Obama said, \u201cJust as the United States has stood with the people of Afghanistan through a difficult decade, we stand ready to help our Afghan partners as they respond to this disaster.\u201dThe United Nations, which is helping coordinate the relief effort, said that humanitarian supplies in the area were adequate and that emergency funds would be available if more was needed. Afghan officials said that 130 tons of flour, 60 tons of rice and 10 tons of sugar were headed to the area and that senior officials would fly there on Saturday with cash to aid displaced families.Natural disasters are a particularly cruel feature of life in Afghanistan, which is already contending with a deadly insurgency, crippling poverty and a flagging economy. Avalanches, floods and landslides claim dozens of lives each year. \u201cThere have now been more Afghans killed through natural disasters in the past seven days than all of 2013,\u201d said Mark Bowden, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan.With some areas difficult to reach, the extent of the damage from the landslides on Friday may not be known for some time, the organization said.The northern part of the country has been plagued by flooding in recent weeks, with more than 100 people dead or missing and thousands displaced before Friday. Officials said that villages in the Argo district and elsewhere remained at risk for landslides, and the government was working to evacuate the most vulnerable residents to temporary housing in tents, while heavy equipment was moved to Abi Barak.\u201cWe have sent five loaders and excavators to the village to remove the dirt and bring out the bodies and rescue the potential survivors,\u201d said Wais Barmak, the Afghan minister of rural rehabilitation and development and deputy head of natural disaster management. \u201cThis disaster is unprecedented, at least in the last few years.\u201dHabib Zahori contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Financial Trading Tax Moves Forward, Despite New Pockets of Resistance", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 An effort by some European countries to tax financial transactions met new resistance on Tuesday, as Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands voiced reservations.But that did not deter the tax\u2019s proponents, led by Austria, France and Germany, to reach a preliminary agreement with seven other European Union member states to proceed with it. The tax would place small fees on the trading of stocks and some derivative securities beginning in 2016 in the countries that adopt the plan.Under European Union law, a minimum of nine countries are required to allow a core group to pass legislation, such as the tax, that other members of the bloc oppose or want to avoid.On Tuesday, Sweden indicated it might resist the tax, as well. Denmark and the Netherlands also raised concerns. And Slovenia, which previously backed the initiative, indicated that it could withdraw that support.Those developments occurred at a Brussels meeting of European Union finance ministers, but the proponents indicated that they would press ahead, as their numbers would give them the power to do.\u201cOur commitment to the introduction of a financial transaction tax remains strong,\u201d the 10 countries favoring the tax said in a statement. \u201cDeliberations at E.U. level and promising experiences with transaction taxes at national level have confirmed our willingness to advance this project.\u201dFor the French, the tax was among the tools needed to raise the costs for bankers and traders who carried out \u201cspeculative movements that have truly brought misery upon the world,\u201d said Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, referring to the economic crisis that began in 2008.Yet the statement acknowledged that \u201ctechnical work\u201d was needed to address \u201ccomplex issues.\u201d The debate on Tuesday revealed a deepening divide between countries in favor of the taxes and those that oppose them, raising new questions about whether the tax would ever be put into effect.Some of the strongest criticism came from the Swedish finance minister, Anders Borg, who previously did not support the British approach of challenging the tax in court but said he might change his mind because the process to establish the tax lacked transparency. \u201cThere has been very little information and basically no political consultations,\u201d Mr. Borg said, referring to the protax statement released on Tuesday. \u201cWe are receiving this sitting at the table, without any previous opportunity to assess\u201d the plan, he said.Sweden, he said, was \u201cmuch closer\u201d to bringing a court case against the tax.The sharp divisions over the financial transaction tax also represented a jockeying for position before elections to the European Parliament this month.\u201cYou have decided we must come out with something before the elections,\u201d said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and the head of the group of countries using the euro. But the plans were so skimpy that there was little \u201cbasis for the Dutch government to consider joining, certainly not on the basis of what we have here,\u201d he said.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, suggested that Algirdas Semeta, the European commissioner for tax affairs, who told the meeting he remained strongly in favor of the initiative, was helping governments pander to voters before elections by backing a populist measure that could hurt the wider economy.Finance ministers should instead \u201cbe making an assessment on the economic merits of this,\u201d Mr. Osborne said.Countries in favor of the tax were drafting plans \u201clargely in secret,\u201d he said, and offering too little information about what types of trades in derivatives would be taxed, and whether the tax would apply to shares and derivatives issued by nonparticipating countries.But the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, was among the ministers who said that Europe had to be seen taking action in response to the financial crisis. \u201cWe have to deliver,\u201d said Mr. Sch\u00e4uble. \u201cTo tell people that we are not able to find any solution is not the way.\u201dThe next step would be for the 10 participating countries to reach a final agreement on the contents of the law, which would be subject to further discussion by ministers from all 28 members of the union, including Britain and Sweden. But those additional 18 countries would not have a vote. Instead, the law would pass as long as the participating countries gave unanimous approval.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Prepare to Vote on World\u2019s Highest Minimum Wage", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBASEL, Switzerland \u2014 While Switzerland\u2019s booming economy has made the country synonymous with a superlative standard of living, the government estimates that approximately one worker in 10 struggles to pay rent, despite working full time.Just as the issue has been fiercely debated in the United States, the Swiss go to the polls on Sunday to weigh in on a proposed solution: raising the national hourly minimum wage to 22 Swiss francs ($24.65).If successful, it would become the world\u2019s highest minimum wage; more than double the 8.50 euros ($11.64) agreed to last month in Germany, which has the European Union\u2019s largest economy, or the $10.10 sought by President Obama.The referendum is the latest twist on the global debate over the causes and extent of income inequality, what if anything should be done about it, and whether higher minimum wages ultimately help or hurt workers.\u201cIt is a scandal that in our wealthy country, people are working full time and still can\u2019t live on their salary,\u201d said Daniel Lampart, an economist for the SGB/USS trade unions, which introduced the initiative with support from politicians on the left.Gionatan De Vita, who quit a salaried position at Nestl\u00e9 to run his own Italian-style cafe on a winding side street down from Basel\u2019s landmark red sandstone gothic church, said he already could not afford to hire any full-time workers, even at a much lower salary than the amount proposed.\u201cI have three people who I pay at an hourly rate for flexible shifts of about three hours, plus I am here all day myself,\u201d Mr. De Vita said as he wiped down the counter of his bar. \u201cThere is no way I could afford to pay a monthly minimum wage of 4,000 francs,\u201d roughly the equivalent of 22 francs an hour.While poverty here is a relative thing for most people, given the generous social welfare system that ensures a basic standard of living, this is the third time the Swiss have been called upon in recent national referendums to decide the value of work. In March 2013, voters supported a move to give shareholders a stronger say in executive pay, but in November they opposed an outright cap on the amount executive can earn.Many Swiss are clearly uncomfortable with yawning income disparities. Yet they are also uneasy with handing the government too much control over setting salaries, traditionally negotiated by companies and unions within each industry.For a full-time worker, the proposed minimum wage would amount to nearly two-thirds of Switzerland\u2019s median salary in 2012, according to official numbers. Of the 339,000 people the federal statistics office estimates currently earn below the median salary, two out of three are women, most of them working in retail, hotels or personal services.Recent surveys have suggested waning support for the measure, but the government was caught off guard in February when citizens unexpectedly voted to restrict the number of European Union citizens allowed to live and work in the country. Under Switzerland\u2019s system of direct democracy, anyone can propose an issue, and if it wins enough support, it is put to citizens for a vote.Switzerland remains one of the most business-friendly countries in Europe, but the series of referendums focusing on economic issues in the last two years has rattled many executives. Some of the country\u2019s largest companies, which include Nestl\u00e9 and Swatch, say they fear that introducing a minimum wage could damage competitiveness.Two-thirds of Swiss jobs are in small and midsize businesses. Owners of hotels, restaurants and retailers, especially in cities near the borders, are fearful that the proposal would force them to cut largely untrained cleaning and kitchen staff members, because they would otherwise be required to pay them salaries equivalent to that of receptionists or waiters with two to three years\u2019 vocational training.They also argue that a minimum wage would have the opposite effect of that desired by the unions, by forcing more people into part-time jobs that would increase the country\u2019s unemployment rate, which stood at 3.2 percent in April, according to government figures.\u201cThe initiative would be a boomerang for Switzerland,\u201d said Marcel Schweizer, president of Gewerbeverband Basel-Stadt, a trade association in Basel representing small and midsize businesses. \u201cMany branches would be forced to cut jobs that would become too expensive. The hardest hit would be poorly qualified workers.\u201dThe Association of Swiss Cleaning Companies, Allpura, issued a sharply worded statement in which it opposed the wage initiative because it \u201cdestroys jobs and weakens Switzerland\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d It said cleaners earn 18.50 to 26.50 francs an hour.Tobias Straumann, a professor of economic history at the University of Zurich, said he did not believe that the initiative would pass, but he pointed out that the debate had already had an indirect influence on salaries in several industries in which wages were the lowest.Lidl, a German-owned discount supermarket chain, raised its monthly base wage for workers in Switzerland to 4,000 francs at the start of the year. Last year, the electrical and mechanical engineering industry agreed to a minimum hourly wage of 22 francs in its collective bargaining agreement with unions.\u201cThe minimum wage is an attempt by the left to try to push policy,\u201d Mr. Straumann said. \u201cThey have no chance, but they are hoping that some of their ideas will bring about change. Already the launching of the initiative has brought about a lot of progress in the increase of wages in industries where they had been very low.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Right Way to Press Iran", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and its allies have finally begun to work out the terms of a nuclear deal with Iran. That\u2019s hopeful because an agreement that forecloses Iran\u2019s pursuit of nuclear weapons would be enormously beneficial. Such a comprehensive accord would build on the Joint Plan of Action signed last November. That was a preliminary deal in which Iran agreed to pause its nuclear program in return for some modest relief on sanctions. The deal is set to expire in July, but can be renewed for another six months. Washington seems focused on limiting the numbers and types of centrifuges that Iran would be allowed to possess, as well as the quantities and qualities of uranium it would be allowed to keep. But those issues are not the keys to getting the best deal with Iran. They are important, but they should not be the White House\u2019s highest priority.Instead, the Obama administration should focus on three other factors: conducting intrusive inspections, designing a mechanism to easily reimpose sanctions if Iran cheats, and extending the duration of the agreement. International inspectors must be a constant presence at Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and they need to be able to go anywhere and see anything \u2014 immediately and without being blocked by the government. Iran has already agreed to abide by the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which does establish somewhat more expansive inspections and monitoring, but given Iran\u2019s history of lying about its nuclear program, America needs what it had in Iraq: the right of the inspectors to have completely unfettered access. As important as highly intrusive inspections are, they can only be as effective as their enforcement mechanism. The history of arms control and arms limitation agreements suggests that states abide by them when they believe it is likely that they\u2019ll get caught and might pay a heavy price for getting caught. In Iraq, Libya and Iran today, that punishment has taken the form of powerful sanctions. And it is worth noting that the 1994 nuclear agreement with North Korea didn\u2019t work because it was predicated mostly on offering Pyongyang carrots that could be withheld, while the threatened sticks were ephemeral and inadequate. The biggest diplomatic obstacle America is likely to face after signing a comprehensive agreement with Iran would be getting the United Nations Security Council (and the European Union) to reimpose sanctions if Iran were to ever restart its prohibited nuclear programs \u2014 especially if the evidence of cheating was ambiguous. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not enough just to have intrusive inspections. America also needs a \u201csnap-back\u201d mechanism to be able to quickly and easily reimpose the sanctions if the United States and its allies decide that Iran is violating the agreement.The best way to create such a mechanism is to suspend the United Nations and European sanctions rather than lifting them outright. In both cases, a new resolution could be passed every six months that would suspend all of the effects of the sanctions for six months, renewable in perpetuity. This would avoid the difficult process of going to the Security Council and getting a new sanctions resolution passed by a majority of the 15 members without any (Russian or Chinese) vetoes. As we have seen with Iraq, North Korea and elsewhere, that can be diplomatically impossible no matter how convincing the evidence. Finally there is the question of duration. Although no one knows for sure, there is considerable evidence that Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, is sincere in his desire for a nuclear deal. But Mr. Rouhani will be president of Iran for another seven years at most and it is impossible to know who will succeed him. In 2005, the reformist Mohammed Khatami was replaced by a zealot, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. America must therefore seek an enduring deal, one that will last beyond Mr. Rouhani\u2019s term in office.Although the terms are still being negotiated, the inevitable rumors suggest that Washington may be ready to agree to as little as 10 years. Twenty years would be better. And 30 or 50 would be better still.Of course, the Iranians will probably object to all of this. They will protest that intrusive inspections violate their sovereignty. They will argue that last year\u2019s Joint Plan of Action specified the lifting of sanctions, not merely their suspension. And they will complain that Western officials suggested to them in private that the agreement would only last for 10 to 12 years. But the United States will have both legal and practical leverage with which to push back. The Joint Plan stated that in the final, comprehensive agreement, Iran would be treated as a normal nuclear power after the terms of that treaty had ended. That was an implicit acceptance by Iran that it would not be treated as a normal nuclear power until then.More importantly, the Iranian government desperately needs to rid the economy of the burden of the sanctions. Suspension serves all of Iran\u2019s real needs: It removes the impact of the sanctions as a practical matter, preserving only the West\u2019s ability to reimpose them quickly if Iran is caught cheating. That creates exactly the kind of deterrent that has made the difference between success and failure in previous nuclear deals. Iran\u2019s leaders have already demonstrated that they are willing to sacrifice principles for practical benefits. There is no reason to believe that they cannot be convinced to do the same in a comprehensive agreement. Intrusive inspections coupled with sanctions suspension will grant them the economic revival, even prosperity, that they crave while giving America and its allies the greatest assurance that a future Iranian leadership won\u2019t resume a prohibited weapons program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Panel Has Begun to Address How to Gradually Raise Rates", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal Reserve officials have gingerly begun to take on what will be their most difficult task over the next 12 to 24 months: determining how and when to gradually raise interest rates and return monetary policy to a more traditional path, even as they keep trillions in assets accumulated during the huge stimulus efforts of the last five years.Officials at the central bank are not anywhere near a final decision on tactics and strategy, nor do they have a definite date in mind, although most experts expect them to take their first step in raising short-term interest rates in mid- to late 2015.But the minutes of their meeting late last month, released on Wednesday, detail how the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which consists of representatives of the Fed\u2019s regional banks and the Washington-based Board of Governors, have begun grappling with lifting the interest rate that the Fed uses as its major policy tool from a current level close to zero.\u201cObviously, it is still a work in progress,\u201d said Michael Hanson, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cThe market anticipated more detail.\u201dNonetheless, the minutes suggested that the process is well underway. \u201cThis discussion marks the beginning of the post-crisis era,\u201d he said. Mr. Hanson said that holding all those assets on the Fed balance sheet means huge reserves are sitting idle in the banking sector, which in turn makes it much more difficult to raise short-term rates using traditional tools when the Fed finally does decide the time is right to tighten monetary policy. At the April meeting, policy makers reviewed staff presentations that \u201coutlined several approaches to raising short-term interest rates when it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d the minutes said.\u201cBecause the Federal Reserve has not previously tightened the stance of policy while holding a large balance sheet, most participants judged that the committee should consider a range of options and be prepared to adjust the mix of its policy tools as warranted,\u201d the minutes said.The central bank is keeping its options open on how to go about what is one of the most delicate tasks facing Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Fed. \u201cI think the minutes revealed that they don\u2019t know their game plan yet,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago and a longtime Fed watcher. \u201cThere are still a lot more questions than answers.\u201dEven as signs are emerging this spring that economic growth is beginning to pick up after a very slow first quarter, the recovery remains fragile. And if rates rise more quickly than expected, there are fears inside and outside the Fed that the already-slowing housing sector could weaken further. At the same time, the minutes of the April meeting showed that the committee members were concerned that \u201cinflation was running below the committee\u2019s longer-run objective and was seen as posing possible risks to economic performance.\u201dFigures released last week indicated inflation might have increased in April to healthier levels not far from the Fed\u2019s 2 percent, but that data was not yet available when the policy makers met.At the meeting, \u201cmost participants commented on the continued weakness in housing activity,\u201d citing factors like higher home prices, construction bottlenecks from a shortage of labor and harsh winter weather, as well as tight credit. The housing sector, which imploded in the years before the financial crisis and recession, has rebounded strongly in recent years, but those gains have been fading as borrowing rates for home buyers rose in the second half of 2013.Over all, the minutes did not reveal any sharp change in strategy. In a separate development, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Stanley Fischer, a longtime central banker, as a Fed board member. Mr. Fischer is to become Fed vice chairman after a second formal vote, expected soon, allowing him to take the job Ms. Yellen held before she became chairwoman.The Fed has been operating short-handed as departures and the slow confirmation process left three vacancies on the seven-member board. Another governor, Jeremy C. Stein, is to step down next week. Lael Brainard, a former Treasury official, is also expected to win confirmation, but it is not clear when that vote will occur.The next meeting of Fed policy makers is set for June 17 and 18.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maybe There\u2019s Life in the Old Bull Market Yet", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesWorried about the stock market? There\u2019s no shortage of reasons to fret. Weak economic data, lackluster earnings reports and a severe correction in the Internet and biotech sectors have shaken many investors. Yet none of that fazes Laszlo Birinyi. The gloom that has descended over the market recently is for him a source of good cheer. Why? \u201cWe\u2019re in the last stage of a great bull market,\u201d he said in a phone conversation last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the exuberant phase.\u201d Yet investors aren\u2019t acting all that exuberantly, which is a good thing, he says, because the long rally underway since early 2009 is likely to end only after the party becomes dangerously wild. From that perspective, a dose of sobriety is salutary, a good sign. It suggests that the bull market has plenty of room to run. \u201cMost of what passes for news about the market is really noise,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to stop and think and do your research. When you look deeper, you see a different picture.\u201dWhat he sees is a largely benign environment for stocks \u2014 a generally happy picture that he has painted, with relatively minor alterations, since he became one of the first prominent strategists to recognize that a major bull market started more than four years ago. \u201cI\u2019d put it another way,\u201d he said. Opaque electronic trading has made it much harder to track money flows in the market, he said, and to trade with precision at certain moments, particularly at the market opening. That, he said, tilts the odds so they are \u201cbadly skewed against the individual trader.\u201d Like Mr. Lewis, Mr. Birinyi says regulators need to be more vigilant in protecting the public interest.Still, he observes that ordinary investors who have stayed in the market since March 2009 have generally reaped enormous profits, amid many worries along the way. That upward trend is likely to persist, he says, along with the worrying. \u201cThe conditions for a bull market remain intact,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re in an advanced stage now, and you\u2019d expect that some things would change.\u201d \u201cThe overall market is shrugging off the tech and biotech problems, and that\u2019s important,\u201d Mr. Birinyi said. Investors are differentiating among individual stocks and sectors, and shares of many of the biggest companies remain buoyant. Stocks like Oracle, Intel and Apple have all gained in value this year. Because Apple has the largest market cap of any stock, it has an outsize influence on major indexes like the S.& P. 500; its strong recent performance is far more important for the great majority of investors than that of numerous smaller tech stocks combined. The earnings and economic data shouldn\u2019t be a source of worry now, either \u2014 at least not the way he sees things. Analysts have complained about an impending sharp decline in corporate earnings for the last few years, only to be proved wrong, and, he said, so long as the economy stays reasonably strong, earnings will be robust enough to drive the stock market. As for the economy, he shrugs off the feeble first quarter for the gross domestic product. It rose only 0.1 percent, inflation-adjusted, in the latest government estimate, and may well drop into negative territory when the data is updated Thursday. But he points out that G.D.P. estimates are notoriously unreliable \u2014 they sometimes change significantly years later. While recent data for the second quarter appears stronger, he prefers to look at the stock market itself for clues about the economy. Shares of Caterpillar, the heavy-equipment maker, have been strong, signaling that investors believe that robust industrial growth is coming, he said. Similarly, he said, NVR, a home-building stock, has risen smartly. \u201cThat tells me that the market is very comfortable with the housing sector,\u201d he said. The persistence of low interest rates has surprised him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect that at the beginning of the year,\u201d he said. The implications of this for stocks are complex but generally positive: Low rates may aid a continuing stock-market rally because they make stocks more attractive in a bake-off with bonds.Because the market has already risen so much, the biggest gains are probably behind us, he says, and his own short-term projections have been careful: He predicted that the S.& P. 500 would reach 1,900 in this quarter, and it has. Barring a catastrophe (an unexpected war, for example) it seems most likely to him that the market\u2019s momentum will continue to trend upward.That\u2019s why, from his perspective, what others are calling bad news is actually good. It\u2019s dampening the exuberant spirit that may one day stop the bull market in its tracks. But, he says, we\u2019re not there yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The MacGyver Cure for Cancer", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Health IssueTwo decades ago, David Walmer went on a volunteer mission with his church to Haiti. He was sent to paint walls at a hospital in the seaside town of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, but when the people there learned that Walmer was a doctor \u2014 he was a fertility specialist at Duke University \u2014 they asked him to spend the week with a local obstetrician-gynecologist named Jean-Claude Fertilien. Walmer was shocked by what he saw: Fertilien finishing a hysterectomy with the aid of a flashlight when the hospital generator failed to restart, for instance, or when an anesthesiologist wasn\u2019t available for an emergency C-section, the doctor just numbing the skin and cutting. At one point, Walmer was called to the bedside of a young woman in her mid-20s with undiagnosed cervical cancer who had gone into septic shock. There was nothing to be done for her, and she died right in front of him. Walmer was appalled. In the United States, cervical cancer is considered a preventable disease.\u201cYou have 10 years to detect this disease before it becomes untreatable,\u201d Walmer says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s easy to detect. It develops on the outside of the cervix, which you can see.\u201dAt the end of his week in Haiti, Walmer, who is a boyish 61, put a question to Fertilien: \u201cI\u2019m a busy guy. But if there\u2019s one little thing I can help you out with, what would it be?\u201d\u201cCervical cancer,\u201d Fertilien said.Walmer had no expertise with the disease \u2014 he divided his time between seeing patients and doing lab work, analyzing the biology of the uterine lining \u2014 but he told Fertilien he would do his best.Back at Duke, he pressed colleagues to let him work alongside them and learn about the disease. He knew that an effective screening program would be the biggest single fix he could propose. In the U.S., screening is typically done with Pap smears \u2014 a quick swab of a woman\u2019s cervix to screen for the cellular changes that foreshadow cancer. If abnormal cells are found, a doctor will usually perform a colposcopy, in which the cervix is examined using a specialized magnifying lens, a colposcope, to see if disease is visible. Before the widespread adoption of Pap smears in the 1950s and \u201960s, cervical cancer was the top cancer killer among women in the U.S. Now, when caught in time, the diagnosis and treatment are pretty straightforward: Paint the cervix with acetic acid \u2014 essentially vinegar \u2014 which turns abnormal areas white. Confirm the presence of disease with a biopsy. Then freeze or remove the abnormal cells.Thanks to early detection (and helped by the vaccine for HPV, or human papillomavirus), the mortality rate for cervical cancer in the U.S. is relatively low. Not so in developing countries, where it kills almost 250,000 women every year. Haiti has one of the highest rates of cervical cancer in the world. Walmer knew that a national screening program would save countless lives, but deploying colposcopes across the impoverished nation was not feasible. They\u2019re expensive, they require reliable electricity and they\u2019re too big to be easily carted around to the ramshackle clinics throughout the country. A battery-powered, portable and affordable alternative was needed.At the time, in the mid-1990s, Walmer was teaching young doctors how to reverse sterilization surgeries by repairing women\u2019s fallopian tubes. He used loupes, or surgical glasses, to see the tubes properly. \u201cI realized, I\u2019ve got these magnifying lenses right here, and they don\u2019t require any electricity,\u201d Walmer says. A solution began to take shape in his mind. He bought a halogen headlamp at a bike shop and a green filter at a camera store. He figured that by switching back and forth between green and white light he would be able to provide the contrast needed to identify precancerous lesions on the cervix and the pattern of blood vessels that indicate something suspicious.Even as he kept tinkering on his portable, primitive colposcope \u2014 the light wasn\u2019t properly aligned, for starters \u2014 he traveled to Haiti several times a year, his suitcase stuffed with donated surgical gloves, slides and stains and brushes to do Pap smears. \u201cI really felt a calling,\u201d Walmer says. What others might find discouraging \u2014 doctoring in the most downtrodden conditions \u2014 he found exhilarating. \u201cI was having more fun helping the Haitians than I was at my real job,\u201d he recalls. \u201cYou could operate and save a woman\u2019s life, and every time you came back to Haiti, she would come to the clinic and hug you and introduce you to her family members.\u201dBy 1997, he told his boss he was closing his lab, effectively putting an end to a nearly two-decade-long academic career in biochemistry. He started traveling to Haiti more often and joined the boards of nonprofits that were active there. The urgency of his previous work paled in comparison. \u201cIf people are dying of a treatable disease,\u201d Walmer says, \u201chow important is understanding the biochemistry of the uterine lining right now?\u201d He was convinced that developing a realistic way to screen Haitian women for cervical cancer was the key to keeping his promise to Fertilien, so he continued to putter with his rudimentary colposcope.\u201cIt was pretty crude,\u201d he says. \u201cMost people thought it wasn\u2019t likely to work, but it was very Haitian, where people solve problems in creative ways.\u201dIn 2001, when Malkin was a professor at the University of Memphis, he co-founded Engineering World Health, a college club that would eventually expand to dozens of campuses \u2014 including Duke, after Malkin joined the faculty there in 2004 \u2014 and evolve into a nonprofit company whose focus was improving hospital conditions in developing nations. Every summer, the nonprofit dispatches students in physics, chemistry and engineering to places around the world to fix old medical equipment, set up donated supplies and teach health practitioners how to use them. Malkin also started the Competition for Underserved Resource-Poor Economies (CUREs), which awarded as much as $100,000 to a student-generated business plan for a nonprofit that addressed a medical need in impoverished countries.Malkin was intrigued when he heard about Walmer\u2019s device. Maybe, he thought, his students could help turn it into a usable tool. \u201cHe already had a solution,\u201d Malkin says of Walmer, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t working well.\u201dThe problem was that the device was uncomfortable: It put too much weight on the nose. \u201cWe had a working model, but it was too heavy,\u201d Walmer says. \u201cWe were dead in the water.\u201d Walmer had become so frustrated that he put the project aside. Malkin suggested that his students might provide fresh eyes, and Walmer agreed. He invited a group of five students to his office to tell them what he had done so far. Recently, for example, his engineering colleague had attached the lights to the end of the lenses, but that hadn\u2019t worked. \u201cWe need to move everything back to the forehead, which goes back to the concept of what we first had with the bike-light headband,\u201d Walmer told them. The students were game.\u201cThey realized we\u2019d been through lots of renditions, and they realized they were coming in after degreed, Duke University engineers who had volunteered their time,\u201d Walmer says. \u201cThey were all pretty excited. They thought, We are solving a real-world problem.\u201dOne of them, Theo Tam, first learned about Duke\u2019s Engineering World Health club online. It inspired him to leave California, where he worked as a space-systems engineer, and to enroll at Duke, where, in addition to pursuing his master\u2019s in engineering management, he was selected as a CUREs fellow \u2014 one of seven students who would immerse themselves in tech entrepreneurship.In September 2006, Tam, then 24, approached four students in his master\u2019s program to work on the portable colposcope. None of them wanted to touch the project. All four were men, from China, India and Pakistan, and they were squeamish about anything that involved women\u2019s anatomy. They proposed alternate challenges: a malaria microscope, an oxygen flow meter. \u201cAnything but the V-word,\u201d Tam says. \u201cImagine the horror.\u201d\u201cGuys,\u201d Tam told them, \u201cit\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201d Then he sold them on the aspects of the project that weren\u2019t related to gynecology. One student volunteered to focus on marketing, another on finance. Tam took on the clinical research himself.The first task was to settle on a name for the device, something catchy and descriptive but not too cutesy \u2014 they chose \u201cCerviScope.\u201d Next they sketched out a business plan. \u201cEnding cervical cancer,\u201d they wrote during a brainstorming session. Then, \u201cHow?\u201dThey began by reaching out to gynecologists around the globe who had expressed interest in Walmer\u2019s invention after he posted news of it online. In Pakistan, doctors wanted more distance between device and patient, to avoid getting too close and making the woman uncomfortable. In Singapore, doctors requested less distance, to make training students easier. Some doctors wanted a device mounted on a headband; others preferred a helmet or glasses. Some wanted a fixed light; others liked the idea of an adjustable gooseneck. Ultimately, the team decided to accommodate the doctors in Haiti, who wanted the weight on their forehead, not pushing on their nose. But in March 2007, when Tam took a prototype to Haiti and gave it to a doctor there, the doctor tried it on, complained that he couldn\u2019t see well enough and took it off.Tam was also trying to keep the whole thing inexpensive. He increased the magnification to 8x by taking the lenses from a $10 set of binoculars bought at Walmart. A pair of $16 battery-powered LEDs provided the light. The adjustable headband that fitted above the ears was tweaked. In April 2007, the students won the CUREs competition, beating six other teams of undergraduates, grad students and even physicians. Suddenly they had $100,000 in prize money. They hired an engineering firm called Applied Technologies in Cary, N.C., not far from Duke, to refine the device so it could be mass-produced.The first step was to reorient the lenses. Surgical loupes are custom-designed for each physician. \u201cA rep comes to measure the distance between my eyes because different people\u2019s eyes are different distances apart,\u201d Walmer says. \u201cBut if we are going to do this globally, we can\u2019t manufacture each one personally. So we asked them to build a slot so you could move the lenses back and forth, right and left, until they\u2019d line up with whoever\u2019s eyes were looking through the devices,\u201d Walmer says.Then one of the firm\u2019s engineers cannibalized the lenses from a $2 pair of reading glasses and incorporated them with a pair of binoculars. \u201cThere was nothing on the market that gave us the magnification but also focused up close,\u201d said Dan Fucella, the firm\u2019s head. The combination worked: Reading glasses are designed for close viewing, binoculars to magnify objects at a distance, allowing a user to quickly switch perspectives, the better to see cervical changes. Walmer was thrilled as the device approached completion. He regularly tested the latest iteration of his scope on patients. \u201cI love taking a problem, problem solving and bringing together people who can go back and forth over time to solve that problem,\u201d Walmer says. \u201cWorking in Haiti is a slow, steady process, so this matched up with it.\u201dOne final problem existed. It was taking about nine hours to machine the parts and assemble a single unit, and it cost more than $1,000, which was too expensive to be scalable. Help came from Goldman Sachs in Singapore, where one of the student engineers, Gauravjit Singh, went to work after graduating from Duke. Together he and Walmer submitted a grant proposal to the investment bank, which agreed to finance the manufacture of injection molds needed to mass-produce the scopes.Walmer\u2019s own nonprofit, Family Health Ministries, which he started in 2000 after he began receiving donations for his work in Haiti, will be selling the CerviScopes at cost to health care providers in poor countries. (The goal is to price them under $750.) Walmer and his wife, Kathy, initially set up the outfit in their sunroom, with little more than a dedicated phone line. \u201cWe told the kids, \u2018When this phone rings, you be quiet.\u2019 We\u2019d answer, \u2018Family Health Ministries.\u2019 We always pretended to be bigger than we were, and we grew into it.\u201d In the past five years, Walmer says, the nonprofit has raised $6 million. In 2012, the production of the first 200 scopes began. They are now sitting in Walmer\u2019s office while he figures out where they will go. It seems to make sense to roll them out, at least initially, in a country where the regulations and the bureaucracy are familiar, a place like Haiti.The CerviScope is not the only Family Health Ministries project. The group is about to break ground for a surgical wing of a teaching-and-research health center and a birthing center in Haiti, where doctors from the U.S. can work beside their local counterparts. And Walmer is continuing to work on a national cervical-screening program. Even if Pap smears were widely available, they wouldn\u2019t stem the tide of disease; many women in Haiti have underlying inflammation that makes diagnosis tricky. In any case, there aren\u2019t enough doctors to interpret the test results. \u201cThere are only nine pathologists in the whole country, so there\u2019s no one to read Pap smears,\u201d says Walmer, who went into private practice in 2012, giving him more time to travel to Haiti. \u201cWhen we first started doing them, we shipped them to the States.\u201dWalmer advocates testing for HPV, which causes most cases of cervical cancer. As the cost of HPV testing drops, it\u2019s a strategy that is finding favor as a first-line approach to detecting and preventing cervical cancer in the developing world. His nonprofit has set up an HPV lab in Haiti to process the tests. In June, Walmer is taking part in a Haitian Ministry of Health workshop whose focus is revising the country\u2019s standards for cervical screening. \u201cThey have decided this is a priority,\u201d says Walmer, who is in talks with the ministry about using the CerviScopes there.Mother\u2019s Day in Haiti is approaching \u2014 it\u2019s always the last Sunday in May \u2014 and some women traditionally wear flowers that day: red if your mother is living, white or purple if she\u2019s not. This year, Family Health Ministries wants to establish a new Mother\u2019s Day tradition: cervical screening.\u201cLife has a way of detouring,\u201d Walmer says. \u201cPreventing cervical cancer was never my plan. And yet I think this was better than the plan I ever had for my own life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hong Kong\u2019s Rising Cry", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHONG KONG \u2014 Since Hong Kong was handed over by the British to China in 1997, the territory\u2019s seven million residents have been free to govern themselves with relatively little interference from Beijing. That freedom is now under threat, frustration with Beijing is mounting, and the possibility of violence is growing.Although Beijing\u2019s hand can be felt in many areas, its increasing meddling in local politics is most troubling. The central government had promised Hong Kongers they could directly elect their leader in 2017, but it has yet to approve a process for nominating candidates. Beijing appears to want candidates screened by a Beijing-friendly nomination committee, thus dashing hopes for real electoral choice.As a result, Hong Kongers are protesting against the central government with more frequency, segments of the pro-democracy camp are becoming more radicalized, and Beijing\u2019s patience is wearing thin. In this atmosphere, physical confrontations between Hong Kongers and the police are more likely.Should violence break out, China would have an excuse to crack down in Hong Kong, which would be a huge setback for Hong Kongers and the territory\u2019s thriving economy \u2014 as well as an ominous sign of how China intends to use its influence around the world as it continues its economic surge.Beijing and its local allies must give Hong Kongers more avenues for political participation \u2014 or the tension will keep rising. Just as important, the increasing numbers of Hong Kongers who seem intent on confronting Beijing, even if it means resorting to physical clashes with the local police, should re-channel their energies into peaceful protest.A group of activists is planning for later this year what promises to be a large-scale demonstration for genuine universal suffrage. Known as \u201cOccupy Central,\u201d the protest will aim to bring the city\u2019s financial center to a standstill through a nonviolent sit-in. According to the research by the Hong Kong Transition Project, two out of five Hong Kongers, despite fears of violence and economic damage, say they will support Occupy Central. Most of these people are under age 30.But with increasing numbers of Hong Kongers, especially the young, unwilling to compromise on the question of how to nominate candidates for the 2017 election \u2014 Beijing wants to approve candidates, the democrats want the public to nominate candidates \u2014 the demonstration may very well turn violent.The roots of frustration in Hong Kong go deeper than the conflict with Beijing over universal suffrage. Economic factors and strains put on Hong Kong\u2019s resources by mainland Chinese have fueled discontent in the territory for years. Beijing doesn\u2019t have to do much to make this already stressed situation explosive.The gap between the haves and have-nots has widened over the past 20 years, led by the skyrocketing cost of housing. Mainland Chinese people and their money have pushed up prices in Hong Kong; at the same time, for locals wages have remained relatively low and opportunities scarce. Meanwhile, millions of mainland tourists come to Hong Kong to shop, overwhelming the infrastructure and crowding the streets. Aside from purchasing luxury items and books banned on the mainland, they clear the shelves of foodstuffs that they can be assured are genuine and safe.Baby milk powder, for example, is in such high demand by mainlanders that the Hong Kong government restricted sales to make sure Hong Kong babies had enough to eat. Milk powder is no longer available on open store shelves; one has to purchase it from a locked case.The current chief executive of Hong Kong, Leung Chun-ying, has made attempts to address some of the economic issues that are fueling the radicalization. He needs to accelerate those programs and take action on the points of conflict with mainlanders.Mr. Leung tried to tamp down the conflict over the lack of affordable housing by setting aside homes for Hong Kongers only and increasing the taxes on home purchases. Prices have dropped slightly, but the government could also sell some public housing at giveaway prices to lower discontent.Mr. Leung also needs to address the number of mainland tourists entering Hong Kong. The sheer press of bodies back and forth across the land borders is a stampede waiting to happen. Mainland officials, concerned over congestion and growing conflict with tourists in Hong Kong, appear to be stepping in to control the volumes even if Mr. Leung will not.Mr. Leung should announce that he will not seek a second term in 2017. That would show that he is acting in good faith to work out a fair system for the election without bias toward his own future.These actions could ease some of the tensions. But ultimately, Beijing needs to resolve Hong Kong\u2019s desire for universal suffrage.How Beijing handles Hong Kong\u2019s simmering frustrations will be a test of China\u2019s intentions and attitudes toward a freer way of life. If China\u2019s leaders kill political reform in Hong Kong, they are unlikely to start it on the mainland anytime soon. Nor are they likely to promote or protect such values as they move to replace the United States as the dominant power in Asia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Silence Is Golden, and Priced Accordingly", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the WheelLOS ANGELES \u2014 In explaining the new ELR plug-in hybrid, a Cadillac spokesman offered this rationale: \u201cMercedes-Benz doesn\u2019t have anything like this.\u201d So true. As a corporate statement in the 21st century, the ELR makes a certain amount of sense. It\u2019s unique, beautiful, efficient, serenely comfortable and electronically avant-garde. At $75,995 (the base price), or $82,135 as tested, it\u2019s also bracingly expensive. A $7,500 federal tax credit, state and local incentives and, for early buyers, a free 240-volt charging system installed in their garages at Cadillac\u2019s expense, will help to soothe the sticker shock, but for the average green-car shopper, the price is still quite a jolt.The expense seems even higher when one realizes that beneath its lovely, high-cheek-boned skin, sculpted under the watchful eye of Bob Boniface, Cadillac\u2019s exterior design director, the ELR is a sister of the Chevrolet Volt.This is Apollo\u2019s own Volt, to be sure, with a thick, creamy layer of running-gear refinements, noise-absorbing touches, hand-crafted interior and a long list of luxury, safety and technology gizmos.If the Chevy Volt is a four-wheel incarnation of, say, Ed Begley Jr., think of the ELR as an automotive George Clooney.12 PhotosThe ELR\u2019s recalibrated electronic control unit extracts significantly more power from its Volt-spec hardware: a 16.5 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, a primary electric-drive motor and a 1.4-liter gasoline-powered motor-generator. In E.V. mode, the ELR sends 157 horsepower to the front wheels, compared with 133 in the Volt. In extended-range mode, the gasoline motor-generator adds 24 more, for a total of 181 horsepower, versus the Volt\u2019s 151.With a full battery charge, the ELR has an E.P.A.-estimated driving range of 37 miles \u2014 roughly the average American round-trip commute \u2014 in all-electric mode. That charge takes from 12.5 to 18 hours with a standard 120-volt outlet, and about five hours at 240 volts.When the battery is discharged, the gasoline engine fires up to keep the car humming. Car and Driver drove the ELR from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in 9 seconds in E.V. mode, clocked 8.1 seconds in gasoline-powered extended-range mode and reached a top speed of 107 m.p.h. I experienced 30 to 35 miles of all-electric range in real-world (well, California) driving, and an average of 38 m.p.g. in gas-powered extended-range mode. Cadillac estimates total range \u2014 on batteries and the gas range extender \u2014 at 340 miles.To accomplish its 30-plus-mile electric-only range \u2014 essentially even with the lighter, more slippery Volt \u2014 the ELR software charges the battery to a higher state and allows it to discharge more deeply. On 240 volts, the Volt can be fully charged in four hours. The ELR takes five hours, which means it is extracting as much as 25 percent more charge from the same battery. Could a current Volt produce an ELR level of power, and extract more charge \u2014 and thus more range \u2014 from its existing battery? As far as I can tell, yes, it could. And because the Volt is more aerodynamic and 274 pounds lighter, that hacked Volt would be considerably quicker than an ELR. Hackers: to your terminals! With 295 pound-feet of torque on tap, the ELR performs swimmingly in the feeding frenzy of urban commuting. The Volt\u2019s electric motor creates gratifying initial thrust, but loses steam quickly as speed increases. The ELR comes on stronger at first and keeps accelerating longer, with smoother overall power delivery.The ELR is not fast compared with its gasoline-powered coupe competition. Or compared with the similarly priced all-electric Tesla Model S, which can accelerate to 60 m.p.h. in less than 5 seconds. But the ELR is sufficiently lively for almost all real-world driving, including an occasional uphill pass in the Santa Monica Mountains.The ELR chassis uses G.M.\u2019s HiPer Strut front suspension to reduce the torque steer that lurks in front-wheel-drive cars, and to align its wider, 20-inch-diameter wheels with the road. All four dampers adapt continuously to driving conditions and selectable driving modes. The ventilated front disc brakes are bigger than the Volt\u2019s, to handle the ELR\u2019s added weight and speed. The rear suspension shares the Volt\u2019s twist-beam design, with a Watts link added to enhance lateral stability. This is an improvement, but even with its understeer-prone front-drive layout, the ELR can wag its tail in hard cornering if the front tires suddenly gain traction while turned. With the standard electronic stability control engaged, this is not a problem. With the stability control switched off, it can be disconcerting. Is a typical luxury eco-coupe driver likely to throw her ELR down Latigo Canyon at the limits of adhesion? Probably not. The ELR is more capable of going quickly over a twisty road than most of its drivers ever will be, or most of its passengers will ever allow. The ZF Servoelectric power steering is programmed to raise steering effort when the driver selects Sport mode, and to increase effort and on-center feel with increasing speed and cornering force. It works so well one wonders why the Volt\u2019s steering, which uses the same system, is so lifeless. Hackers, while you\u2019re at it ...My test car\u2019s interior was a rich combination of leather, olive wood, carbon fiber and Alcantara. To exploit the silence of the electric powertrain, the ELR has hydraulic suspension bushings, thick window glass and ample sound-damping insulation. Bose\u2019s active-noise-canceling technology helps to keep the cabin calm when the gasoline engine fires up, but the increase in ambient noise is still pronounced. At freeway speeds, the generator sound is largely masked by the muted road and wind noise that slips through the ELR\u2019s soundproofing armor, but at slower speeds and at stoplights the thrum of the genset under the hood is more intrusive. Front-seat room is ample, but the cramped rear seats, with their limited headroom and leg space, are best reserved for the young and the restless. The front-seat shoulder belts are a significant obstacle to rear-seat access. Standard safety equipment includes frontal-collision and lane-departure warning systems. The Safety Alert Seat vibrates through the left, right or forward seat bolsters if you drift from your lane or come up quickly behind another car. It feels vaguely as if you\u2019re running over Botts\u2019 dots \u2014 or as though you\u2019ve found that long-lost cellphone. The Cadillac ELR is an intriguing engineering effort and a striking piece of modern automotive art. Whether it inspires buyers remains to be seen. Is there a significant group of well-heeled drivers who crave the efficiency and subtle environmental cachet of a long-range plug-in hybrid, and who are willing to pay far more than they would ever save in energy costs?

{"Headline": "New Kidnapping Reported in Nigeria as U.S. Offers Help", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byABUJA, Nigeria \u2014 A second kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria\u2019s northeast by Islamist militants put new pressure on the country\u2019s troubled government, which had been hoping to showcase its emergence as Africa\u2019s largest economy this week but instead has been forced to confront its failure to contain a growing insurgency in its north.Men suspected of being fighters from the radical group Boko Haram kidnapped 11 more girls in Nigeria\u2019s northeast, local officials said Tuesday, an intensification of its campaign against female education and the Nigerian government since the abduction of hundreds of schoolgirls three weeks ago.The spectacle of red-shirted protesters in the streets of the capital here, angry at the government for its tepid response to the crisis, put President Goodluck Jonathan under an uncomfortable spotlight as executives from across the world arrived in private jets to attend the Africa meeting of the World Economic Forum, the continent\u2019s answer to Davos.The authorities here \u2014 and particularly the military, itself implicated in numerous massacres of civilians \u2014 appear to be floundering in their response to a crisis that social media have transformed into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. The new kidnappings underlined the inability of the Nigerian government to protect civilians from the growing insurgency. Not a single girl has been rescued so far. In a sign of deepening global concern, on Tuesday the United States offered to provide a team of experts, including military and law enforcement officers, along with hostage negotiators and psychologists, to assist the Nigerians in recovering the girls, an offer that the government here accepted. American officials said \u201cmilitary resources\u201d would not be included, but President Obama weighed in, vowing to \u201cdo everything we can.\u201dA viral social media campaign, using the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, has brought new infamy to Boko Haram, which has been operating in Nigeria for more than a decade. The group\u2019s goal, never clearly enunciated, is to radically undermine the secular Nigerian state.But never in a five-year campaign of bombings, civilian massacres and assaults on state schools have the attacks so shaken the government. The heightening concerns have led to daily antigovernment protests, which continued Tuesday with a demonstration outside defense headquarters here. In a sign of the government\u2019s nervousness, several of the protest leaders were briefly arrested Monday.In the latest kidnappings, more girls were taken from their homes late Sunday in the villages of Warabe and Wala, said Hamba Tada, an official in the area. Heavily armed militants descended from surrounding hills, stealing grain and livestock belonging to villagers, forcing the girls, ages 12 to 15, into an 18-seater bus, and warning locals not to alert the authorities.Another local official confirmed the new abductions, though the area\u2019s top police official, Lawan Tanko denied they had taken place. \u201cBy our record it\u2019s not true,\u201d he said in an interview from Maiduguri, the capital of Borno State.The video has sharpened the sense of urgency about finding the girls quickly, and has added to the deepening embarrassment of the Nigerian government, even as it tries to present a progressive new face at the forum.Unicef has reported that the second kidnappings involved at least eight girls who were seized in their homes in Borno to prevent them from attending school. It called the latest abduction \u201can outrage and a worsening nightmare for the girls themselves, and for the families of the more than 200 girls who have been stolen from their communities in the last several weeks.\u201dManuel Fontaine, Unicef\u2019s regional director for West and Central Africa, said in a telephone interview that the information had been obtained from the agency\u2019s contacts for the area, which has been rived for years by attacks from Boko Haram.In the past, Boko Haram has frequently targeted schools, which it sees as symbols of the secular government\u2019s overreach. Male students have been slaughtered, while the female students have been let go after admonitions to return to their families, abandon their studies and get married. The latest kidnappings appear to represent a hardening of the militants\u2019 line, though not a wholesale departure from it.Pogu Bitrus, a local official in the town where the schoolgirls were taken, Chibok, said: \u201cThis has been going on. It\u2019s been a common practice. They come and attack a place and seize girls. They just have been doing this.\u201dThe military, which has responded brutally to Boko Haram\u2019s campaign, itself engaging in large-scale atrocities against civilians, has so far proved incapable of finding any of the kidnapped girls, some of whom may already have been taken across the border to Cameroon, in a remote, hilly and wild corner of West Africa. The number of missing schoolgirls has been revised by officials more than once, while some escaped shortly after the abduction.It is unusual for the military establishment here, usually fiercely protective of its sovereignty, to accept offers of outside help as it has apparently done in this case.The latest kidnappings, not yet acknowledged by the government, differed somewhat from the wholesale abduction three weeks ago of girls from the school where they were taking their exams. Then, the militants disguised themselves as soldiers.In this case they simply came down from the hills, brandishing their guns in the darkness.They descended \u201cwith several AK-47 rifles hanging over their shoulders,\u201d said Mr. Tada, the local official.\u201cThey evacuated some of our grains, and carried away livestock into a pickup van. The girls were hurled into an 18-seater bus before they fled,\u201d he added.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, Rick Gladstone from New York, and Hamza Idris from Maiduguri, Nigeria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Economy Grows at Fastest Rate in 3 Years", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate of 5.9 percent in the first quarter, the fastest rate in nearly three years, as companies and consumers spent to beat a sales tax increase that is expected to cause a contraction in the current quarter.The growth figures for Japan, released Thursday, were in line with expectations. Strong private consumption, residential investment and corporate spending were the biggest contributors to growth, while public spending fell slightly.Although the economy was already recovering when Mr. Abe took office, his economic policies have been credited with lifting corporate profits and helping Japan escape from a longtime deflationary rut. Sustaining growth will require major changes to increase competitiveness and unblock bottlenecks that inhibit growth, economists say.Mr. Abe is due in June to present his latest explanation of overhaul plans. Haruhiko Kuroda, who as governor of the Bank of Japan is the most influential economic ally of Mr. Abe, describes the overhauls as the \u201cfinal and most important element in addressing Japan\u2019s challenges.\u201dLabor policy changes, like increased participation of women in the work force and better use of foreign labor, are needed to help improve Japan\u2019s lagging productivity and improve public finances, Mr. Kuroda told a conference on Thursday.\u201cThis will be a golden opportunity to resolve the medium- to long-term challenges facing Japan\u2019s economy,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said.Mr. Kuroda reiterated his belief that the economy is moving toward sustained growth, with price increases moving toward the official target of 2 percent inflation.Wages have not kept pace with inflation, even with minor increases for the fraction of workers who are represented by unions during spring labor negotiations. But Mr. Kuroda said tightening employment conditions will lead to the improved incomes needed to support growth in the long run.Although the increase in the sales tax on April 1 to 8 percent from 5 percent is expected to cause a contraction, the latest data suggest growth may rebound relatively quickly.The recovery in the United States and Europe may help Japan increase exports, so far an area that has lagged expectations as soaring import costs for energy, food and industrial components have outpaced increases in demand for Japanese products overseas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Self-Care Strategies", "Date": "2014-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySunday DialogueReaders discuss a doctor\u2019s call for expanded use of mind-body techniques for both financial and health reasons.\u00a0To the Editor:Many economists believe that health care costs will continue to rise. Even more distressing, the Affordable Care Act will likely reinforce current practice, which dictates surgical and pharmacological interventions that can be expensive, inappropriate, burdened by side effects and, often, ineffective.Forty years ago, as a researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health, I began to study inexpensive self-care strategies \u2014 then called \u201calternative therapies\u201d \u2014 that might address the underlying biological and psychological imbalances that contribute to chronic conditions. These included nutrition, exercise and \u201cmind-body\u201d techniques like meditation, guided mental imagery and biofeedback.Since then, research has demonstrated that mind-body approaches reduce stress and improve mood and immunity. They decrease blood pressure in hypertensives, blood sugar in diabetics and pain. Dietary modification can play a major role in preventing breast, prostate and colon cancer, as well as in diabetes and heart disease. And exercise, which can help prevent all of these, can also alleviate depression.We spend about twice as much as many other industrialized nations on health care, often with inferior outcomes. Three-quarters of that spending is on chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, depression and chronic pain \u2014 exactly the ones for which self-care is best suited. Comprehensive programs that offer self-care in a supportive group are even more promising, for both treatment and prevention. This approach is also proving effective for psychological trauma.What was unexamined and alternative 40 years ago is now well researched. It should be fundamental. If we are going to reduce our ruinous costs and improve our declining national health, we must make self-care and group support central to all care.\u00a0Readers ReactAlternative therapies shouldn\u2019t be alternative anymore, but should be thought of as mainstream by now. Taking personal responsibility for one\u2019s health through self-care techniques would be a paradigm shift for most people, but could have a great positive effect on their lives and eventually our national medical economy.Admittedly, it\u2019s a lot harder to work on yourself than to outsource the work to a doctor, and of course many conditions require intense medical intervention. But for the conditions that Dr. Gordon mentions, there are simple ways that we can help ourselves, such as calming ourselves down during a panic attack, lifting ourselves out of depression without drugs in many (though of course not all) cases, or lowering blood pressure naturally.This concept has personal resonance for me as I deal with chronic back pain, a condition notorious for being hard to manage effectively through conventional Western medicine. I take the advice of my doctor, but I also am trying to do the hard work to heal myself holistically through my diet, movement and stress management.The difference between feeling that my care is in my hands versus someone else\u2019s hands can be life-changing, and the implications for society are encouraging, too.\u00a0While Dr. Gordon\u2019s advocacy of alternative health therapies for treating chronic conditions is very welcome, I believe that the Affordable Care Act will help, not hurt, the adoption of those strategies. The clinic I go to exemplifies community health and patient-centered practices that marry alternative and traditional medical approaches.For instance, if a visit to one\u2019s doctor (or nurse practitioner) reveals high blood pressure or high blood sugar, not only will a considered prescription be made, but an appointment with a health educator, nutritionist or acupuncturist will be made. Also, many classes are offered: yoga, dance, a walking group, nutrition, cooking and more, held in various languages. I quit smoking with a combination of prescribed nicotine patches, acupuncture in a group setting, and a support group, all held in the clinic.The Affordable Care Act supports many of these preventive health strategies and is now bringing in many new clients to the clinic. The problem isn\u2019t the federal law; it\u2019s the model in both alternative and traditional medical practices that focuses on profits rather than on patient-centered community health.\u00a0Dr. Gordon claims that a wide variety of self-treatments, also known as complementary and alternative medicine, have now been \u201cwell researched\u201d and shown to be effective. These include meditation and guided mental imagery for improving underlying biological and psychological imbalances, and mind-body approaches for improving mood and immunity.He may be right about some of his examples, but the question is: How good is the science? We should have grasped the lesson of the \u201cwell researched\u201d hormone replacement therapy recommended to postmenopausal women to reduce menopause symptoms and the risk of heart disease. Subsequent randomized clinical trials showed that this risky procedure used by millions of women could increase the risk of heart disease.Until the alternative medical treatments that gullible Americans spend billions of dollars for each year are proved effective and safe in randomized clinical trials or some suitable alternative, a Scottish verdict is warranted: Not proven.The writer is a professor of philosophy at the University of Miami.\u00a0The self-care measures that Dr. Gordon prescribes for patients are sound and effective. This should be obvious to all who care for the sick and are therefore very aware of the mind-body connection. As a physician for 47 years and the daughter of an old-time family doctor, I have seen these methods used effectively. Unfortunately, in our system, there is no financial remuneration for spending time with patients to advise their use. And patients have been convinced that newer medications, technologies and procedures are best.We badly need to change in the direction suggested by Dr. Gordon. It would improve outcomes and lower costs.The writer is a dermatologist.\u00a0I agree with Dr. Gordon that alternative therapies can be very useful, cost-effective approaches to successful care. As a psychiatrist, I have used and taught medical hypnosis, often classified as alternative therapy. Medical hypnosis, an old and well-studied therapeutic tool with a lot of good science behind it, when combined with certain behavior modification strategies, can help patients stop smoking and lose weight. Hypnosis is also a tool that can be used to address deeper issues, including anxiety, high stress and insomnia. Conquering those kinds of problems, in turn, can have a positive effect on physiological illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders.Unfortunately, neither hypnosis nor other alternative therapies are readily taught in medical training programs. These programs need to incorporate alternative and adjunctive care with the recognition that these techniques can be an important component of a well-rounded therapeutic plan, never losing sight of the great medical and surgical treatments that cure illnesses, prevent disease and improve our quality of life.The writer is on the faculty of NYU Langone Medical Center.\u00a0It was like a breath of fresh air to read Dr. Gordon\u2019s letter. This is what health care could look like in the United States if we let it grow up. There is scientific evidence to support these approaches, and they create the holy grail in health care: a partnership between patient and provider, tapping into the body\u2019s own capacity for healing.I still get tears in my eyes remembering a scene in the recent documentary \u201cEscape Fire,\u201d in which a wounded veteran held up a grocery sack full of pharmaceuticals that he had been prescribed for pain and post-traumatic stress syndrome. None of them worked. Where did he finally find relief? In acupuncture.Alternative therapies are another arrow in the quiver of health care, and where evidence supports them, they could be a first line of defense. Healers have always been there for us; it\u2019s the system that\u2019s broken.The writer is a former health care executive.\u00a0Dr. Gordon is a highly respected leader in the area of mind-body medicine. His call to action is timely, and it\u2019s critical that his message be heard by political and medical leaders, as well as the general public. Far more money, energy and time should be spent on educating people about effective self-care and preventive medicine.There is a myth often perpetuated by the mainstream media that interventions such as diet, exercise and mind-body techniques have not been scientifically validated. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Dr. Gordon writes, what was considered unexamined and \u201calternative\u201d is now well researched.It\u2019s time to put these practices in place to affect health care not only from a financial perspective but also from a quality-of-life standpoint.The writer is the publisher of the Natural Medicine Journal.\u00a0The Writer RepliesIt\u2019s heartening to read the responses to my letter. Dr. Rosenthal and Dr. London clearly recognize the importance of integrating self-care and group support in medical practice; Ms. Broner describes a clinic where this is happening; and Ms. Roman exemplifies active engagement in one\u2019s own care. Each year my colleagues and I train many hundreds of physicians and other health professionals who are moving in this direction. So there is progress.Formidable obstacles remain, as some of the writers suggest. Powerful financial incentives urge the ordering of superfluous diagnostic tests, hasten the performance of surgeries that may be unnecessary, and push physicians to quickly write prescriptions rather than patiently teach self-care. Though the Affordable Care Act may, as Ms. Broner observes, encourage more self-care, it does not give it the central place it deserves.Like Mr. Erwin, many physicians continue to question results of scientific studies they haven\u2019t examined. Meanwhile, only a tiny percentage of research dollars is devoted to nonpatentable, low-cost self-care approaches. Even the more open-minded tend to confuse therapies like acupuncture, which requires a professional to administer, with the more fundamental self-care, whose implementation is in the hands of patients.Perhaps this shouldn\u2019t be surprising. A medical establishment that continues to ignore the ancient injunction for physicians to heal themselves cannot be expected to help its patients to heal themselves. It\u2019s time for all of us to act on this life-enhancing, money-saving wisdom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tallinn Reaps Benefits From Former Status as Culture Capital", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Art of Collecting: Frieze New YorkIn Tallinn, which wore the crown in 2011, a cultural upswing was already underway in which its old town was renovated and new cultural venues were built in the last two decades. But there is general agreement that being named culture capital made a big difference to the city\u2019s young artists and the tourists who came to seek them out.\u201cIt was like a catapult,\u201d Evelyn Sepp, the head of Kultuurikatel, or Cultural Hub, an arts space that is one of the most visible legacies of Tallinn\u2019s cultural year. In 2011, the Estonian capital offered about 7,000 cultural events with a focus on alternative, original productions. Culture is one of the pillars of official efforts to unify the 28-nation European Union, and the E.U. budget reflects that priority. Last year, a time of austerity and cuts, the Union increased funding for culture by 9 percent, to \u20ac1.46 billion, or $2 billion, for the 2014-2020 budget, including resources for the European Capital of Culture program. The Estonian economy has proved resilient during the recent crisis, though culture has undoubtedly helped the tourism industry, which relies mainly on visitors from Finland, only 80 kilometers, or 50 miles, across a narrow stretch of the Baltic Sea. The number of guests in Tallinn grew by 15 percent in 2011, to 1.48 million and has increased slightly ever since, according to the Estonian tourism authority. On a sunny spring morning, workers were busy putting the final touches on the building, whose red brick chimney dominates the landscape. But work remains to be done. One of the plans in the build-up to 2011 was to link the old town of Tallinn with its derelict seafront via a footpath called \u201cCultural Kilometer.\u201d Pop-up events blossomed on the route in 2011, and some have since returned every summer. But the footpath, which links Cultural Hub to the Maritime Museum in the revamped seaplane harbor, still runs mostly through industrial wasteland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "End Corporate Taxation", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAFTER years of post-recession somnolence, corporate takeovers and mergers have ballooned to their highest level since 2007, fueled in part by American companies\u2019 fleeing the United States to save tax dollars. Gaming the tax system has, of course, long been a popular blood sport for American business, particularly for pharmaceutical concerns and for technology darlings like Apple.But these days, tax avoidance feels like a full-fledged business strategy, with American citizens as the losers.At the moment, New York-based Pfizer is battling to acquire the British giant AstraZeneca. At $106 billion, that would be the largest of the current raft of tax-advantaged deals. If it\u2019s completed, Pfizer would become a British company, saving it $1 billion or more annually because of Britain\u2019s lower tax rate (21 percent and soon, 20 percent) and other potential breaks. By comparison, Pfizer is currently taxed at a 27 percent rate. Since 2008, about two dozen American companies have used mergers to shift their legal residence abroad through the process known as inversion. That\u2019s about the same number as over the previous 25 years. All told, the raft of increasingly sophisticated tax-avoidance schemes has helped the share of corporate profits paid in taxes to drop significantly. That\u2019s not the only cost. When the New York eye-health company Bausch & Lomb put itself up for sale last year, Valeant \u2014 \u201cCanadian\u201d since 2010 \u2014 used the savings from its 3 to 5 percent tax rate to top the bidding.Washington and Albany took an immediate tax hit. Just as quickly, Valeant \u2014 whose top brass operate from a converted Y.M.C.A. in Madison, N.J. \u2014 eliminated 400 of Bausch & Lomb\u2019s 1,700 Rochester employees. After harsh criticism, the company promised to retain the remaining workers there.Now Valeant is trying to buy rival Allergan and eliminate much of Allergan\u2019s $458 million tax bill for 2013.The tax dodge is hardly limited to pharma and tech. As part of their proposed merger, two huge ad giants \u2014 New York\u2019s Omnicom and Paris\u2019s Publicis \u2014 chose Britain as a tax \u201cheadquarters,\u201d for an estimated $80 million a year in savings.Meanwhile, even the quintessentially American drugstore chain Walgreens, which owns 45 percent of the European company Alliance Boots, is being lobbied by large shareholders to shift its tax home to Europe when its right to buy the remainder of that drugstore chain becomes active next year.The recent cross-border deals often include one more goody for the companies. To help pay for the merger, the American corporations can utilize cash \u201ctrapped\u201d abroad by rules requiring that 35 percent be paid to the Treasury on profits brought home. Action is clearly needed. But most of the proposals floating around the capital are more focused on helping companies compete in the global tax race to the bottom.Nor has President Obama been able to gain international cooperation to end this self-defeating competition.At a minimum, Congress should embrace the president\u2019s recent proposal to both restrict the use of inversions and tax a merged company as an American company if it is managed in the United States and has substantial business here. That meritorious provision needs to be coupled with more aggressive action against other egregious practices, such as using tax havens to transfer vast amounts of profits out of Uncle Sam\u2019s reach.A more ambitious, and therefore more politically difficult idea, would be to scrap our unworkable corporate tax system altogether and instead tax shareholders, first by eliminating low tax rates on capital gains and dividends.That would offset only a small portion of the loss of corporate tax revenue (a projected $350 billion in 2015), so we should raise the balance by eliminating loopholes enjoyed by wealthy Americans, increasing rates on their earned income and potentially introducing new concepts, such as taxing gains on investments as stock prices rise rather than when they are sold.The wealthy need not fear; eliminating corporate taxes would lead to a jump in business earnings and, consequently, stock prices. That would encourage similar actions by other countries. Otherwise, their companies might move here to enjoy a zero corporate tax rate.Higher stock prices would also help pension funds, foundations and other tax-exempt institutions focused on social betterment.While eliminating corporate taxation would be branded a giveaway, properly engineered reforms would provide a huge uplift to ordinary Americans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Economics Failed", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI don\u2019t mean that economics was useless to policy makers. On the contrary, the discipline has had a lot to offer. While it\u2019s true that few economists saw the crisis coming \u2014 mainly, I\u2019d argue, because few realized how fragile our deregulated financial system had become, and how vulnerable debt-burdened families were to a plunge in housing prices \u2014 the clean little secret of recent years is that, since the fall of Lehman Brothers, basic textbook macroeconomics has performed very well.But policy makers and politicians have ignored both the textbooks and the lessons of history. And the result has been a vast economic and human catastrophe, with trillions of dollars of productive potential squandered and millions of families placed in dire straits for no good reason.In what sense did economics work well? Economists who took their own textbooks seriously quickly diagnosed the nature of our economic malaise: We were suffering from inadequate demand. The financial crisis and the housing bust created an environment in which everyone was trying to spend less, but my spending is your income and your spending is my income, so when everyone tries to cut spending at the same time the result is an overall decline in incomes and a depressed economy. And we know (or should know) that depressed economies behave quite differently from economies that are at or near full employment.So why didn\u2019t we use the economic knowledge we had?One answer is that most people find the logic of policy in a depressed economy counterintuitive. Instead, what resonates with the public are misleading analogies with the finances of an individual family, which is why Mr. Obama began echoing Mr. Boehner.Whatever the reasons basic economics got tossed aside, the result has been tragic. Most of the waste and suffering that have afflicted Western economies these past five years was unnecessary. We have, all along, had the knowledge and the tools to restore full employment. But policy makers just keep finding reasons not to do the right thing.An earlier version of the web summary with this column\u00a0pointed out\u00a0that few economists saw\u00a0the fiscal crisis coming.\u00a0The crisis should have been referred to as a financial crisis.Advertisement"}

But economists have found several ways to try to get around the problem. Many of these studies look for natural experiments in which otherwise similar people have different rates of college attendance and graduation.Other studies have examined twins and siblings, who obviously have a great deal in common. Yet those with more education earned more.But the detailed research on the value of college comes to the same conclusion as the straightforward data comparing the pay of graduates and nongraduates. For the vast majority of people, college pays off. Correlation and causation, in this case, run in the same direction.I\u2019d argue that you do not need complicated academic research to demonstrate this point, either. Just look at market behavior.

{"Headline": "Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and Lately, Coding", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILL VALLEY, Calif. \u2014 Seven-year-old Jordan Lisle, a second grader, joined his family at a packed after-hours school event last month aimed at inspiring a new interest: computer programming.\u201cI\u2019m a little afraid he\u2019s falling behind,\u201d his mother, Wendy Lisle, said, explaining why they had signed up for the class at Strawberry Point Elementary School.There are after-school events, too, like the one in Mill Valley, where 70 parents and 90 children, from kindergartners to fifth graders, huddled over computers solving animated puzzles to learn the basics of computer logic.It is a stark change for computer science, which for decades was treated like a stepchild, equated with trade classes like wood shop. But smartphones and apps are ubiquitous now, and engineering careers are hot. To many parents \u2014 particularly ones here in the heart of the technology corridor \u2014 coding looks less like an extracurricular activity and more like a basic life skill, one that might someday lead to a great job or even instant riches.The spread of coding instruction, while still nascent, is \u201cunprecedented \u2014 there\u2019s never been a move this fast in education,\u201d said Elliot Soloway, a professor of education and computer science at the University of Michigan. He sees it as very positive, potentially inspiring students to develop a new passion, perhaps the way that teaching frog dissection may inspire future surgeons and biologists.But the momentum for early coding comes with caveats, too. It is not clear that teaching basic computer science in grade school will beget future jobs or foster broader creativity and logical thinking, as some champions of the movement are projecting. And particularly for younger children, Dr. Soloway said, the activity is more like a video game \u2014 better than simulated gunplay, but not likely to impart actual programming skills.Some educators worry about the industry\u2019s heavy role: Major tech companies and their founders, including Bill Gates and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, have put up about $10 million for Code.org. The organization pays to train high school teachers to offer more advanced curriculums, and, for younger students, it has developed a coding curriculum that marries basic instruction with video games involving Angry Birds and hungry zombies.The lessons do not involve traditional computer language. Rather, they use simple word commands \u2014 like \u201cmove forward\u201d or \u201cturn right\u201d \u2014 that children can click on and move around to, say, direct an Angry Bird to capture a pig.Across the country, districts are signing up piecemeal. Chicago\u2019s public school system hopes to have computer science as a graduation requirement at all of its 187 high schools in five years, and to have the instruction in 25 percent of other schools. New York City public schools are training 60 teachers for classes this fall in 40 high schools, in part to prepare students for college.\u201cThere\u2019s a big demand for these skills in both the tech sector and across all sectors,\u201d said Britt Neuhaus, the director of special projects at the office of innovation for New York City schools. The city plans to expand the training for 2015 and is considering moving it into middle schools.Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive, Mr. Pearce said. \u201cWe have any number of parents who say, \u2018I can\u2019t take my kid playing one more hour of video games,\u2019 \u201d he said. But if the children are exploring coding, the parents tell him, \" \u2018I can live with that all night long.\u2019 \u201dThe concept has caught on with James Meezan, a second grader. He attended one of the first \u201cHour of Code\u201d events sponsored by MV Gate in December with his mother, Karen Meezan, the local PTA president and a former tech-industry executive who now runs a real estate company. She is among the enthusiastic supporters of the coding courses, along with several local principals.Her son, she said, does well in school but had not quite found his special interest and was \u201cnot the fastest runner on the playground.\u201d But he loves programming and spends at least an hour a week at CodeKids, after-school programs organized by MV Gate and held at three of Mill Valley\u2019s five elementary schools.James, 8, explained that programming is \u201cgetting the computer to do something by itself.\u201d It is fun, he said, and, besides, if he gets good, he might be able to do stuff like get a computer to turn on when it has suddenly died. His mother said he had found his niche; when it comes to programming, \u201che is the fastest runner.\u201dOther youngsters seemed more bewildered, at least at first. \u201cThe Google guys might\u2019ve been coders, and the Facebook guys \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Sammy Smith, a vibrant 10-year-old girl, when she arrived at the coding event at Strawberry Point.But well into the session, she and her fifth-grade friends were digging in, moving basic command blocks to get the Angry Bird to its prey, and then playing with slightly more complex commands like \u201crepeat\u201d and learning about \u201cif-then\u201d statements, an elemental coding concept. The crowd had plenty of high-tech parents, including Scott Wong, director of engineering at Twitter. His 7-year-old son, Taeden, seemed alternately transfixed and confused by the puzzles on the laptop, while his 5-year-old brother, Sai, sat next to him, fidgeting.The use of these word-command blocks to simplify coding logic stems largely from the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab, which introduced a visual programming language called Scratch in 2007.

She heard about the idea late last year at a professional development meeting and, with her principal\u2019s permission, swapped a two-month earth sciences lesson she was going to teach on land masses for the Code.org curriculum.\u201cComputer science is big right now \u2014 in our country, the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my kids aren\u2019t exposed to things like that, they could miss out on potential opportunities and careers.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article last Sunday about a national movement to teach computer programming referred incorrectly in some editions to the founder of Code.org, who favored the instruction.

{"Headline": "Piketty\u2019s Arguments Still Hold Up, After Taxes", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToday's EconomistI call these arguments the transfer defense. Such critics acknowledge that Mr. Piketty shows large increases in income and wealth inequality. But in the United States, and even more so in other advanced economies, progressive systems of taxes and income transfers, like Social Security or Medicare, at least partly offset these inequalities. The primary distribution (market incomes) is considerably more unequal than the secondary distribution (taxes and transfers).Second, the implications of this critique are politically unsustainable. If the argument is \u201cdon\u2019t worry about market outcomes \u2014 we\u2019ll fix the inequalities of the primary distribution in the secondary one,\u201d then every year that market inequality goes up, we\u2019ll have to ratchet up the redistribution function. It is theoretically conceivable that a beneficent top 1 percent might be fine with that, but practically speaking, there\u2019s a limit to such an aggressive strategy of income redistribution.In fact, comprehensive income data assembled by the Congressional Budget Office show that for middle-income households, transfers and lower taxes explain the vast majority of their income growth in recent decades. Their earnings have declined in real terms 7 percent from 1979 to 2010, but Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and lower taxes have more than made up the difference.The C.B.O. data include not just market income (wages, interest, dividends, capital gains) but government transfers and also the value of employer-provided health benefits (since the latter are favored by the tax code, they are a close cousin of more direct transfers).After accounting for taxes, middle incomes rose about 36 percent, from 1979 to 2010. But here\u2019s the kicker: 90 percent of that increase came from higher transfers (74 percent) and lower taxes (16 percent). And remember, we\u2019re talking middle-class families here, not poor ones.Medicare and Medicaid also play increasingly large roles in the incomes of the middle class, though part of this is an artifact of C.B.O.'s methods, which credits families\u2019 incomes with excesses in health care spending that don\u2019t actually improve their well-being, like overpriced drugs and high physician salaries.Finally, while the progressive taxes and transfers that don\u2019t show up in Mr. Piketty\u2019s data reduce the level of inequality at any point in time, they don\u2019t have that much impact on its growth. The share of comprehensive income going to the top 1 percent grew 6 percentage points before taxes and transfers from 1979 to 2010, and 5.4 points after taxes and transfers. (If one stops at 2007, before the recession, the same comparison yields an increase of 9.8 points before tax and 9.3 after).So, yes, critics are correct that inequality analysts, including Mr. Piketty, should look at the impact of taxes and transfers. But if they\u2019re fact driven, what they find will not alter their view about the upward trajectory of inequality. Instead, the extent of wage stagnation and its corollary, the increased role of transfer income and tax cuts in raising middle-income living standards, should alarm them. Instead of hacking away at the safety net, the data reveal the need to preserve it while increasing the quantity and quality of employment opportunities and the real growth rate of earnings for the majority of the work force.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "42 and 45 Overpower 44", "Date": "2014-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 THE First Family is all over the news, discussing the management of the economy, income inequality, raising the minimum wage, the vicissitudes of press coverage and the benefits of healthy eating.Everywhere you look, the Clintons rule.Bill popped up on the front page of The Times giving a speech at his alma mater, Georgetown University, in which he defended his economic policies and chastised the press for its tendency to create a \u201cstoryline\u201d that doesn\u2019t match reality. (Sort of like the storyline the Clintons created about Monica Lewinsky being a delusional stalker.)Hillary\u2019s Apache dance with the press is detailed in the new issue of Politico Magazine, a piece that got a lot more buzz than the news the White House was excited about on Friday: a sharp drop in the unemployment rate.Chelsea is serenely smiling from the cover of Fast Company for a story on how \u201cthe product of two of the most powerful brands in the world\u201d is \u201ccarving out her own identity \u2014 by joining the family business,\u201d as vice chair in charge of shaping up the tangled finances of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Her impending baby is being treated with enormous fanfare and exhaustive political analysis, like America\u2019s answer to Britain\u2019s bonny Prince George. Obamaworld was even paranoid that Hillaryland would hijack the B-list festivities associated with the annual White House Correspondents Dinner this weekend.The former and future Democratic regime is clearly itching to get back in the saddle and relieve a president who is stalled on every front, and who never really got any joy from working the joystick of power or appreciated the value of the carrot-stick approach that helped Lincoln and L.B.J. bend history.Both President Obama and Hillary have recently referred to leadership as a relay race. And if a fatigued and fed-up Obama looks ready to pass the baton early, the ravenous and relentless Clintons look ready to grab it \u2014 and maybe give him a few whacks over the head with it.Obama\u2019s reign has become increasingly bloodless, and while the Clintons are not new blood, they do convey more vitality than the formerly electrifying politician in the White House.Things have now reached the point where it feels as though 42 and 45 have already taken over the reins of Washington power from 44, who is fading Snapchat-fast.The Clintons now have Obama, as one top Democrat said, \u201ctotally at their mercy\u201d because they \u201ctake the oxygen out of the room.\u201dHillary\u2019s stock is so high \u2014 almost as high as her speaking fees \u2014 that in The Daily Beast, Tina Brown urged the front-runner to skip the campaign and simply go straight to becoming \u201cpost-President.\u201dJust to make the Clintons feel completely at home as they ramp up to the restoration, there is even a congressional investigation spurred by the vast right-wing conspiracy. House Speaker John Boehner announced Friday that he would call a vote to set up a select committee to look into the Benghazi debacle, and whether Congress was misled by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others in the Obama administration.As Slate\u2019s Dave Weigel tweeted, \u201cThe nice thing about having a Benghazi select committee is you can roll it over into the Hillary presidency.\u201dMany of those who aroused the Clintons\u2019 opprobrium and well-known taste for vengeance by supporting the rookie Barack Obama in 2008 thought they were headed to a fresh era in politics, moving past the gnarly braiding of the personal and political that led to chaos in the Clinton era. But the Clinton machine, once described by David Geffen as \u201cvery unpleasant and unattractive and effective,\u201d has a Rasputin resilience. And now those who broke away are in the awkward position of having to make nice with the woman they helped vanquish.Samantha Power recently said that she regretted calling Hillary a \u201cmonster\u201d and offered her new view: \u201cShe just brings such rigor and conviction to everything she touches.\u201dClaire McCaskill, who endorsed Obama in 2008 and said she didn\u2019t want her daughter near Bill Clinton and confided to a friend that she was nervous to be alone in an elevator with Hillary, announced in June that she is \u201cReady for Hillary.\u201d Caroline Kennedy, whose endorsement in 2008 comparing Obama to her father was pivotal, told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd: \u201cI would like to see her run if that\u2019s what she wants to do. I think she would be great.\u201dAnd Geffen, who gave Obama his first big Hollywood fund-raiser in 2008 and broke with the Clintons because he felt they lied \u201cwith such ease, it\u2019s troubling,\u201d now says he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d support Hillary in 2016, calling her \u201can extraordinary, smart, accomplished woman.\u201dElizabeth Warren, who criticized Hillary in a 2003 book for an unprincipled stand on a bankruptcy bill, siding with the big banks she needed to bankroll her political career, lets Hillary off the hook in her new book.Leon Panetta, who served as chief of staff for Bill Clinton and secretary of defense for Obama, told The Times that Obama had not yet defined America\u2019s 21st-century role in the world.\u201cHopefully, he\u2019ll do it,\u201d Panetta said, \u201cand certainly, she would.\u201dThe president who dreamed of being \u201ctransformative\u201d seems bummed, and that\u2019s bumming out Americans.But when you talk about batting singles, you\u2019re just asking to be overshadowed by the next big draft pick. If you\u2019re playing small ball and you\u2019re articulating your diminished expectations, it\u2019s only natural that someone is going to fill the void. Some Obama aides get irritated when Hillary distances herself from Obama and when her advisers paint her as tougher than Obama, someone who wouldn\u2019t be afraid to drop the hammer and sickle on Vladimir Putin. And some in Obamaworld think she could have skipped her $200,000-plus speeches to Goldman Sachs and helped the stumbling president make his push on health care, given that the push was focused on moms and kids, an area of interest for the woman who would be the first woman president.But they were hoisted on their own petard. It was the lone-cat President Obama who ignored the usual practice in politics \u2014 dancin\u2019 with those who brung ya and dismantling your bitter rival\u2019s machine \u2014 and encouraged the view of Hillary as the presumptive nominee over his unfailingly loyal vice president, Joe Biden. Three of his key political advisers \u2014 Jim Messina, Jeremy Bird and Mitch Stewart \u2014 have gone to super PACs supporting Hillary.David Plouffe, the president\u2019s former top political adviser, said Hillary could call him for advice and told Bloomberg\u2019s Al Hunt that \u201cthere\u2019s very little oxygen\u201d for another Democrat to challenge her.As Obama has learned, to his dismay, there\u2019s now very little oxygen for him, too.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In a Shift From Deficit Concerns, the Senate Will Take Up Tax Breaks", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday shrugged off the deficit concerns that were once an animating force on Capitol Hill, voting 96-3 to take up a package of business tax breaks without offering any way to pay for them.The procedural vote presaged final passage as early as this week and followed the House\u2019s overwhelming approval last week of legislation that would make permanent the research-and-development tax credit for businesses and raise the deficit by $156 billion over the next 10 years. On that vote, 62 House Democrats joined virtually every Republican in ignoring President Obama\u2019s veto threat because of the deficit implications.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a deficit watchdog group. \u201cIt\u2019s a shift from, \u2018This is a huge problem\u2019 \u2014 and if anyone looks at the long-term problems, it clearly still is \u2014 to \u2018We\u2019ve made so much progress on the budget deficit\u2019 to doing things that actually hurt the debt. It\u2019s as though members of Congress tried out fiscal discipline, didn\u2019t like how it felt and are falling back to bad habits.\u201dAs the deficit continues to fall, it loosens the policy reins in Washington for the first time since Mr. Obama rammed through his stimulus law in the opening weeks of his presidency.Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that tax receipts were up 8 percent over the first seven months of the fiscal year, which began in October. Spending was down around 3 percent, and at $301 billion, the federal budget deficit is $187 billion lower than at this time last year.\u201cWe will not pull the plug before our nation\u2019s recovery is complete,\u201d said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the majority leader. \u201cLet\u2019s work together to give America\u2019s families a fair shot.\u201dThe Senate\u2019s Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency Act, or Expire, renews more than 50 tax credits through 2015, including the research and development tax credit, tax credits for investments in depressed areas, tax breaks for energy-efficient home improvements and tax breaks for higher education expenses.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, had pledged to pare back the routinely extended tax breaks as a dry run for a broader overhaul of the tax code. In the end, nothing was pared back, not the \u201ctemporary\u201d tax break for rum producers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, not the ability for moviemakers to write off the first $15 million of film production costs for films made in the United States, not the much maligned but longstanding tax breaks for racehorses and Nascar racetracks.Heritage Action, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, called it \u201cone of the most egregious examples of Washington using its power to prop up well-connected interests.\u201dYet only the staunchest deficit hawks, Republican Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Mike Lee of Utah, voted against beginning debate on the bill.And Congress\u2019s actions over the last few days are only the beginning. In the coming weeks, the House is likely to make permanent five more corporate tax cuts, costing $301 billion through 2024. That would virtually wipe out all the deficit reduction last year, when Bush-era tax cuts were allowed to expire on upper-income households.The White House noted that the House\u2019s expanded and permanent tax credit for research and development would cost more than 15 times as much as renewing and extending unemployment benefits, which Republicans insist must be paid for.\u201cThe administration wants to work with Congress to make progress on measures that strengthen the economy and help middle-class families, including pro-growth business tax reform. However, making traditional tax extenders permanent without offsets represents the wrong approach,\u201d the White House said in extending a veto threat.A large majority in Congress appears to disagree, potentially setting up the first veto of consequence of the Obama presidency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Timothy Geithner Really Thinks", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThis is kind of like a hearing,\u201d Timothy Geithner said, swaying uncomfortably, face scrunched and hair perfectly tousled. \u201cDo you guys always do it this way?\u201dThe former Treasury secretary was looking up from behind a long desk at his audience \u2014 a few dozen Harvard undergraduates, members of Larry Summers\u2019s economics course, sitting in elevated rows of chairs and staring back at him like senators at a Capitol Hill hearing. Geithner, 52, is 5-foot-9 with a naturally boyish look that he maintains in part by running six miles several mornings each week. He looked hardly older than the teaching assistants in the front row.Early in his talk, Summers \u2014 himself a former Treasury secretary (as well as a former Harvard president and a director of Barack Obama\u2019s National Economic Council) \u2014 reminded his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 that many of the students in the room probably had little idea of the role he played during the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cThere are many people in this room who were in eighth grade when this was happening,\u201d Summers said, and soon enough a number of students were summoning up Geithner\u2019s Wikipedia page on their laptops and iPads.Geithner may have given hundreds of news conferences during his four years as Treasury secretary, but he remains an awkward public speaker, even if his audience consists of college students in hooded sweatshirts. On this morning, as was the case many times before, his responses generally coalesced around the plan that defined his tenure: the wildly unpopular authorization of $700 billion in taxpayer money, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to bail out Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks. \u201cTo oversimplify it, and I think this was Jon Stewart\u2019s framing,\u201d Geithner told the students, \u201cwhy would you give a dollar to a bank when you can give it to an American? Why not give them a dollar to help them pay their mortgage?\u201dSix years later, this question still lingers \u2014 in angry debates between economists and in the political rhetoric of candidates (on both the right and the left) and in the minds of many Americans who feel that the inequality they hear so much about (and experience firsthand) is a direct result of Geithner\u2019s actions. There are those on Wall Street and in the plutocracy who feel that Geithner is a hero who deftly steered the country from economic ruin. To many ordinary Americans, however, he is considered a Wall Street puppet and a servant of the so-called banksters. And as much as Geithner hates to explain, he very much wants to be understood.When the housing bubble burst in 2008, Geithner was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Along with Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Henry M. Paulson, the Treasury secretary at the time, Geithner was charged with essentially saving the economy from sliding into the abyss. The so-called troika devised the plan to inject billions of the government\u2019s dollars directly into the banking system, effectively turning taxpayers into shareholders of massive, failing institutions. When he then ascended to Treasury secretary in 2009, Geithner became the public face of an economic-recovery program that, in Paulson\u2019s words, \u201cpolled worse than torture.\u201d The far-left labeled him an Ayn Rand capitalist, the far-right a socialist. Sheila Bair, the former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, called his appointment to Treasury a \u201cpunch in the gut.\u201d The Daily Kos, a left-leaning blog, published a story titled, \u201cWhy Tim Geithner Should Go to Jail.\u201d At the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2009, even President Obama joked that a goal of his second hundred days would be to house-train his new dog, Bo, \u201cbecause the last thing Tim Geithner needs is someone else treating him like a fire hydrant.\u201dThrough it all, Geithner has maintained that saving the banks was the only way to protect the U.S. economic system and, by extension, its taxpayers. \u201cI would say that there\u2019s lots of messiness and unpleasantness and awkwardness and a lot of unjust collateral beneficiaries of our rescues,\u201d he told the students at Harvard. \u201cNo doubt about it. It would be nice if it were otherwise.\u201d But there was a more salient point he wanted to convey. \u201cPeople think we gave the banks this free gift of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, using the taxpayers\u2019 money that we would never see again,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople thought we would lose $2 trillion on our financial rescues.\u201dHe paused and looked out at a crowd that, it\u2019s safe to say, probably did not fully appreciate how intense the anger around the financial bailouts had been and how close the country was to the precipice of a full-on depression. \u201cWe are going to earn, all in, a couple hundred billion dollars,\u201d Geithner said. And six years after the bailouts, the too-big-to-fail banks and the insurance giant A.I.G. have since repaid the money they took from the government. Even the rescues of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-lending companies that once had to borrow $187.5 billion, have turned profitable. \u201cMuch of the dominant view about the strategy,\u201d Geithner said, \u201cis the inverse of the truth.\u201dTo clarify his perspective on all of that \u201cmessiness and unpleasantness and awkwardness,\u201d Geithner has spent the past year writing a book \u2014 \u201cStress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises\u201d \u2014 that will be published on May 12. It is filled with revealing and sometimes gripping behind-the-scenes anecdotes. Geithner acknowledges for the first time, for instance, that he was initially at odds with Paulson and Bernanke over whether to bail out Lehman Brothers in advance of the famous weekend meeting in which they sought to find a solution before the firm collapsed. (\u201cI sensed their advisers pulling them toward political expedience,\u201d he writes, \u201ctrying to distance them from the unpalatable moves we had made and the even less palatable moves I thought we\u2019d have to make soon.\u201d)Geithner also discloses that some members of the administration talked openly about nationalizing some banks like Citigroup. (\u201cIf you want to go in, you better be sure there are W.M.D.'s,\u201d Lee Sachs, an economic adviser, said during a meeting with Obama in the Roosevelt Room.) And Geithner discloses that he refused to fire Ken Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, who was near retirement. (\u201cTim, I\u2019m trying to look out for you,\u201d Geithner reports Gene Sperling, a counselor to him at the time, saying that he didn\u2019t owe Lewis any favors. \u201cIf he\u2019s going anyway, why don\u2019t you push him out?\u201d) He even concedes that he and Summers were initially opposed to the Volcker Rule, the widely popular regulation barring commercial banks from proprietary trading. His support, he writes, was \u201ccertainly political.\u201dBut \u201cStress Test\u201d is also surprisingly personal. Geithner confides that he actually didn\u2019t want the Treasury job in the first place and that he tried on multiple occasions to resign, but Obama wouldn\u2019t \u201cliberate\u201d him. He is also forthcoming \u2014 albeit in the somewhat unemotional language of the technocrat \u2014 about his own regrets. (\u201cBefore the crisis, I didn\u2019t push for the Fed in Washington to strengthen the safeguards for banks, nor did I push for legislation in Congress to extend the safeguards to nonbanks,\u201d he writes. \u201cI wish we had expanded our housing programs earlier, to relieve more pain for homeowners.\u201d)Geithner likes to say that all the criticism and the second-guessing and the vitriol directed his way never got to him. \u201cI try to pay no attention to that,\u201d he told me over lunch one afternoon in New York. Almost indignantly, he added, \u201cOur job was to fix it, not to make people like us.\u201d Later, though, he softened and qualified the statement. \u201cI\u2019m human, and I like to be liked,\u201d he said, \u201ceven if I didn\u2019t expect to be liked in this.\u201dLittle of this personality emerged when Geithner was in office. A career public servant, whose work often took place behind the scenes, he seemed an unlikely fit for a high-profile position in the Washington fishbowl culture. When his name was floated for the Treasury job in the fall of 2008, he was busy helping stave off, as the president of the New York Fed, the collapse of Citigroup. Geithner had moved for work before, during the 1990s \u2014 from Washington to Tokyo and back to Washington for jobs at the Treasury Department \u2014 and now wanted to stay put in Larchmont, N.Y., a comfortable suburb a half-hour from Manhattan. \u201cI felt guilty that I was even thinking about relocating again,\u201d he writes in his book. \u201cI had also promised Carole\u201d \u2014 his wife \u2014 \u201cthat we would never again live apart, not for anything, and I knew we couldn\u2019t move the kids in the middle of the school year.\u201d Carole Geithner, a social worker and author, was openly resistant to the idea of her husband\u2019s becoming the next Treasury secretary. \u201cCarole didn\u2019t just have reservations,\u201d Geithner writes. \u201cShe was opposed.\u201dWhen he was summoned in the fall of 2008 to see Barack Obama, then a candidate, at a W Hotel in Manhattan, Geithner offered a series of arguments to disqualify himself from the job: He looked deceptively young; he had little media experience; and, he recalls, \u201cin a period of turmoil and uncertainty, the public would want to see a familiar and reassuring face in charge of the country\u2019s finances.\u201d (Geithner, after all, had spent his career with titles like \u201cdeputy assistant secretary for international monetary and financial policy.\u201d) Perhaps most crucial, he writes, he told Obama: \u201cI\u2019ve been up to my neck in this crisis. You\u2019re going to have a hard time separating me from these choices if you ask me to work with you.\u201d The implication was that by appointing Geithner, one of the main architects of the rescue strategy, the president would essentially be forced to endorse the bailouts, which could have negative political consequences. He suggested to Obama that Summers or Robert Rubin, his mentors, would be fitter for the job.But Geithner and Obama had a somewhat natural rapport. Geithner, like Obama, had an itinerant childhood. His father worked for U.S.A.I.D., and the family lived in India, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Thailand. In the conversation, they discovered that Geithner\u2019s father ran the Ford Foundation\u2019s Asia grant-writing program in the 1980s at the same time that Obama\u2019s mother was at its office in Indonesia. It was a nice coincidence, Geithner says, but it still didn\u2019t make him want the job.That didn\u2019t stop Obama from inviting him for another meeting after the election, this time in Chicago. On his way to meet with the president-elect, Geithner bumped into Summers, whose name had also been floated for the Treasury job, at O\u2019Hare International Airport. \u201cI ran into Larry, who was, I\u2019m pretty sure, in the process of checking the Intrade odds on Obama\u2019s choice for Treasury,\u201d Geithner writes, referring to the online market where investors bet on political outcomes. \u201cIt was kind of awkward for both of us. I told Larry I had not sought the job and had urged Obama to choose him as secretary, which didn\u2019t really make the situation less awkward.\u201dOn his way back to the airport after his meeting with Obama, Geithner received a call from Rahm Emanuel, who had been appointed the president-elect\u2019s chief of staff. Emanuel wanted to know whether Geithner would accept either the Treasury job or a job as the director of the National Economic Council, a less-prestigious post, if one of them were offered to him. \u201cI said I would not do N.E.C., but if you asked me to do Treasury, I would do Treasury,\u201d he said that he replied. In Emanuel\u2019s telling, Geithner was not drafted into the job with such reluctance. \u201cI\u2019m not here to disagree with Tim,\u201d he told me. \u201cHe said he wasn\u2019t going to lobby for the job or put a campaign on for it, but obviously, if asked, he would serve.\u201d He was asked, and he did choose to serve, and in a role reversal, Summers accepted the N.E.C. post.The last part of his acceptance was breaking the news to his wife. \u201cI remember the moment,\u201d Carole Geithner recounted to me. \u201cHe walked in the door, and I just saw it in his eyes. He couldn\u2019t tell me verbally, because we had a friend visiting who just before said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you need to worry, I really think it\u2019s gonna go to Larry Summers.\u2019 And we had to wait till everyone went to bed, and he told me, but I could tell just when he walked in. And there\u2019s this pit in your stomach.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019d already had a taste of the fishbowl, and I\u2019d also seen other people\u2019s relationships, what happens to them when they\u2019re in the fishbowl. So I really had a sense of dread.\u201dThat dread materialized quickly. During his nomination hearing, questions emerged about why Geithner had not properly filed his tax returns in 2001 and 2002. Geithner, who after a career in Civil Service was probably one of the least wealthy nominees in the history of the office, told the senators that he used TurboTax to calculate his filings. The perception that he was overmatched for the position was strengthened when he responded to a congressman\u2019s question at a second hearing by saying: \u201cI just want to correct one thing. I have never been a regulator, for better or worse.\u201d The flub, his critics said, was revealing. Geithner had run the New York Fed, whose job is to supervise and regulate financial institutions, at the very moment when Wall Street\u2019s largest banks were gorging on debt and packaging toxic assets.But Geithner\u2019s refusal to condemn the bankers became a recurrent theme during his time at Treasury. According to Bernanke, \u201cI didn\u2019t and Tim didn\u2019t go very far in lambasting individuals in Wall Street, maybe partly because we were more focused on the problem than on the politics.\u201d Others, however, have suggested that Geithner was simply too cozy with Wall Street. He had never worked as a banker himself, but he grew up inside the bubble of elites. (Before going into government, his first job was working for Henry Kissinger at Kissinger Associates.) He was tutored at Treasury by Summers, who later worked for the hedge fund D. E. Shaw & Company, and Rubin, who came up through Goldman Sachs and eventually joined the board of Citigroup, where he has been blamed in some circles for its taking on excessive risky debt that nearly caused the firm to collapse. Each man played a significant role in deregulating the financial industry in the 1990s by supporting the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking; they also pushed to limit future regulation of derivatives.This criticism that he was too close to Wall Street was also fueled by the fact that Geithner, with his English spread-collar shirts and his perfectly coifed hair, just looks like a banker. He often tells a story about how Emanuel\u2019s wife, Amy Rule, once told him at a dinner party, \u201cYou must be looking forward to going back to that nice spot you have waiting for you at Goldman.\u201d During an April 2009 hearing about the financial-bailout program, Damon A. Silvers, a panel member, seemed almost incredulous that Geithner had never worked on Wall Street.\u201cYou have been in banking \u2014 \" Silvers said.\u201cI have never actually been in banking,\u201d Geithner interrupted. \u201cI have only been in public service.\u201d\u201cWell, a long time ago. A long time \u2014 \u201c\u201cActually, never.\u201d\u201cInvestment banking, I meant \u2014 \u201c\u201cNever investment banking.\u201d\u201cWell, all right,\u201d Silvers conceded. \u201cVery well then.\u201dWhat is certain, however, is that for all the malfeasance of the biggest banks, Geithner had a predisposition that Wall Street, even as it was, remained essential to the functioning of the U.S. economy in just about every sector. \u201cI did not view Wall Street as a cabal of idiots or crooks,\u201d he writes in \u201cStress Test.\u201d \u201cMy jobs mostly exposed me to talented senior bankers, and selection bias probably gave me an impression that the U.S. financial sector was more capable and ethical than it really was.\u201d During his first few months in the job, Geithner fought with Summers, who felt that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 had become overly solicitous of the banks. Geithner dismissed Summers as espousing \u201cthe hedge-fund view.\u201d (\u201cHedge-fund executives tended to see the banks as dumb, lumbering giants,\u201d Geithner writes.) He disagreed when Summers suggested to Obama that the administration pre-emptively nationalize banks like Citigroup or Bank of America or even to try to embarrass them into changing their compensation structures. \u201cI feared that the tougher we talked about the bonuses, the more we would own them,\u201d Geithner writes, \u201cfueling unrealistic expectations about our ability to eradicate extravagance in the financial industry.\u201dGeithner\u2019s stance often came off as aloof, or worse. For all the time he spent focusing on how the financial industry functions, and for all his knowledge of past crises, critics wondered how someone with his experience could be surprised that some bankers might operate less than ethically. In many ways, Geithner\u2019s first year validated the reservations he shared with Obama. His first public speech, as he described it, \u201csucked.\u201d (As he spoke, the Dow Jones began a near-400 point drop.) Geithner offered his resignation, but Emanuel told him he had to stay. \u201cGiven what we were facing, three months into the administration,\u201d Emanuel told me, \u201cfinding a new Treasury secretary wasn\u2019t the solution.\u201d Instead, Emanuel says he instituted a quick primer in politics for Geithner, holding a daily meeting with him and Summers in his office to go over talking points and strategy. \u201cWe did that for about six to nine months. The answer was not resigning; the answer was building.\u201dThe job, meanwhile, was exacting the personal toll that he feared it would. Geithner, who lived at a friend\u2019s house in Washington, tried commuting to Larchmont for the weekends with the Secret Service in tow (his code name: Fencing Master) but rarely made it. \u201cWe did not see much of him then, I can tell you that,\u201d Carole says. \u201cAnd when he was home, it was for really brief times.\u201d When the family decided to relocate to Washington, in the summer of 2009, John Oliver, then of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d reported on the family\u2019s unsuccessful effort to sell their home. (\u201cHold on. Timothy Geithner, the man responsible for getting us out of this [expletive], cannot sell his house?\u201d Oliver said. \u201cOh, God.\u201d He referred to the home as \u201ca toxic asset.\u201d) Geithner told his wife that she might want to tone down her media consumption. \u201cHe discouraged me from doing it, but I couldn\u2019t not,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like, Well, our friends are reading this, and people are reading this, and this is what they think about you.\u201dAround this time, Geithner consulted his predecessor, Henry Paulson. In recalling the conversation, Paulson says that Geithner confided to him that \u201cCarole is not of this world. I remember that very well because he might as well have been speaking of Wendy\u201d \u2014 Paulson\u2019s wife. \u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount of hypocrisy in Washington. Before a tough hearing, you\u2019ll sometimes have the congressional committee chairman say to you, \u2018I love you, you da man!\u2019 But when the cameras are on and the lights go on, they\u2019ll rake you over the coals for the benefit of the voters back home. And while you may learn to accept this and deal with it, understandably your wife and your kids never do, you know? They take it more personally.\u201d After just two years in Washington, Carole moved the family back to Larchmont.As such, it has left him open to endless criticism that he was a prisoner of \u201ccognitive regulator capture\u201d by Wall Street or suffered so greatly from \u201cLehman Syndrome\u201d that he became soft on the industry. Simon Johnson, an economist at M.I.T., has argued that bailouts were necessary but executed in the form of a great giveaway. He has compared Geithner to Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord, the French statesman \u201cwho served the Revolution, Napoleon and the restored Bourbons \u2014 opportunistic and distrusted, but often useful and a great survivor.\u201d Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and creator of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has written in her new book, \u201cA Fighting Chance,\u201d that Geithner \u201cbelieved the government\u2019s most important job was to provide a soft landing for the tender fannies of the banks.\u201d It\u2019s an opinion shared by Neil Barofsky, the former special inspector general of TARP. He told me in an email that Geithner and his team \u201cconsistently put the interests of the banks over those who were supposed to be helped, like struggling homeowners.\u201d While Barofsky acknowledges that TARP \u201cundoubtedly helped save the system,\u201d he also says, \u201cit was supposed to do so much more.\u201dThat remains Geithner\u2019s fundamental problem. Even those who concede TARP\u2019s success can find fault with it. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know whether the economy would have bounced back more quickly and we would be closer to full employment now without the bailouts, since none of us know what other policies would have been pursued,\u201d Dean Baker, an economist and co-founder of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, has written. \u201cWe do know that we would have been freed of the albatross of a horribly bloated financial sector that sucks the life out of the economy and redistributes income upward to the very rich. For that fact, Timothy Geithner bears considerable responsibility.\u201dGeithner waved off much of this criticism. \u201cThe argument that there was a way to somehow protect people without doing things that looked like you were protecting the banks \u2014 was deeply confused and mistaken,\u201d he said, anger rising in his voice. \u201cAnd the accusation or the charge that our motivations were to help banks is kind of offensive to the people who worked with me and definitely to the president.\u201d But perhaps the more stinging criticism comes from Bair, who has said that Geithner basically made a gamble. \u201cTim had no idea whether the government\u2019s money would be lost,\u201d she told me. \u201cTaxpayers will never be adequately compensated for the tremendous risks he took with their money.\u201dI repeated the charge to Geithner. \u201cHow could you be certain?\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just go through the natural experiment. The British tried a couple things that I think are good counterexamples.\u201d He referred to the British government\u2019s lending targets, which were intended to show that the bailouts were keeping credit flowing to regular people. \u201cNot to be unfair to them, but those are largely fake, and they were sort of ridiculous, because their economy was way overleveraged, too, and lending was going to fall even in the best sort of circumstances. And did it help the British in terms of taking some of the sting out of the public anger? No.\u201d Then he brought up the British government\u2019s decision to cap executive compensation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really designed to change comp,\u201d Geithner said. \u201cIt was designed to create the impression that they were changing comp. Did it significantly diminish the popular version of what they did and make them more popular for doing it? No. Was it effective? No.\u201dAs for the argument that he didn\u2019t focus on the homeowners, Geithner said that\u2019s a myth, too, listing TARP housing programs, a lending program to state and local housing-finance authorities and the mortgage-modification-guarantee program. But when I mentioned the passage in \u201cStress Test\u201d in which he regrets that he hadn\u2019t done more and asked him to elaborate, he became feisty. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of too unicorny to frame it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if you suspended disbelief and say: \u2018If we had no constraints on resources or authority, could we have done more?\u2019 If we had no constraints on resources or authority, yeah, we could have done more. And we could have done more, quickly.\u201d He added that if they had full control over the government-sponsored enterprises and the Federal Housing Administration, which insures many mortgages, \u201cabsolutely, we could have done dramatically more.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the real world. In the real world we had to act within the constraints we faced and the limits of the authority we had.\u201dCongressman Barney Frank, whose name is on the signature, if limited, reform bill that emerged from the crisis, once said, \u201cYou don\u2019t get any credit for disaster averted.\u201d But Geithner\u2019s explanation recalled how almost pre-emptively he forfeited the public relations battles at Treasury. When he had the chance to jump on popular issues, like supporting the Volcker Rule, he declined, because he never believed that proprietary trading led to the financial crisis. The big institutions that failed \u2014 Fannie, Freddie, Bear Stearns, Lehman and A.I.G. \u2014 weren\u2019t the types of banks the legislation was designed to regulate, he told me. (He later changed his mind on the Volcker Rule after he determined that it would help make the Dodd-Frank reform legislation easier to pass. Still, he was happy to leave the impression he was against it so as to make it more palatable to the Democratic left, he writes.) When outrage erupted over A.I.G.'s decision to give bonuses, Geithner said they had signed contracts, and the government couldn\u2019t rip them up. These decisions lent credence to the impression that he started with the idea of saving Wall Street instead of the people who needed it most \u2014 that he gave a dollar to the banks rather than the homeowners.Geithner is confident that the empirical data has already vindicated his decision. And while there is some debate over how to calculate the proceeds from the various bailouts \u2014 TARP, the auto companies, the F.D.I.C. programs and Fannie and Freddie, among others \u2014 the evidence is persuasive. ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative organization, which keeps a tally of the bailout, puts the current profit at $32 billion. The White House Office of Management and Budget estimates that Fannie and Freddie will turn a profit of $179 billion over the next decade. (Critics might contend that these figures don\u2019t include the costs of the stimulus or the Federal Reserve\u2019s quantitative-easing programs.) And regardless of the math, a larger point is indisputable: While the returns were never the goal \u2014 saving the system was \u2014 they are indeed evidence of its success and support, to some degree, Geithner\u2019s counterfactual argument. If the system had been allowed to collapse or TARP had failed, there would have been enormous taxpayer losses.On some level, though, data cannot settle the argument. During our time together, Geithner spoke about the \u201ccollateral beneficiaries\u201d of the bailout, by which he meant the inconvenient fact that certain investors and institutions came out of the crisis better off. And for some, that is direct proof of another counterfactual argument. To believe that the bailout worked, they would argue, you would have to believe that the system itself was worth saving in the first place.But it is now clear that Geithner never believed his own talking points. To him, too-big-to-fail and the so-called moral hazard, or safety net, that it would create can\u2019t really ever be fully taken away. During his lecture to Summers\u2019s class, one student asked a question about \u201cresolution authority,\u201d a provision of the reform laws that is supposed to let the government wind down a complex financial institution without creating a domino effect. The question prompted Geithner onto a tangent about too-big-to-fail. \u201cDoes it still exist?\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, of course it does.\u201d Ending too-big-to-fail was \u201clike Moby-Dick for economists or regulators. It\u2019s not just quixotic, it\u2019s misguided.\u201dGeithner paused for a moment. \u201cCan you design a system ever that allows you to be indifferent to the failure of any institution, in any state of the world?\u201d he asked aloud before answering his own question. \u201cYou can design a system, and I think we have, that allows you to be indifferent in most states of the world: the five-year flood, the 15-year flood, the 30-year flood, maybe even the 50-year flood,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are constellations of storms, of panics, of fires that are so bad that it\u2019s very hard to imagine that you could be indifferent to the failure of the financial system.\u201dOne exception to that moral hazard, however, seems to be Lehman Brothers. Some have speculated that Geithner, Paulson and Bernanke let the bank fail in order to send a political message about their vigilance. The troika have long said they were always in agreement to find a partner for Lehman Brothers and were prepared to use government funds to make a deal, as they had when they matched Bear Stearns with JPMorgan. All have repeatedly said, under oath, that they tried to do all they could, but that by late Sunday, Sept. 14, with no credible buyer (Barclays and Bank of America, Lehman\u2019s two last suitors, dropped out), an analysis of Lehman\u2019s assets indicated that they couldn\u2019t legally lend money to the company.Yet in \u201cStress Test,\u201d Geithner reveals a crucial tactical rift between the three men going into that weekend. Geithner writes that he was worried that Paulson\u2019s public insistence that there would be no taxpayer bailout was being driven by politics, not pragmatism, and that he believed that a \u201cno bailout\u201d message could undermine the government\u2019s further ability to pursue a rescue if one were needed. Instead, Geithner preferred to send the impression that a bailout might be available, if necessary, which could have made the bank more desirable to a suitor. We\u2019ll never know if that would have saved the bank, and Geithner won\u2019t play that guessing game, either. Later, he writes: \u201cThese disagreements did not turn out to be consequential. Hank and Ben would have the courage to change course and do what needed to be done.\u201dWhen I ran the earlier passage by Paulson, he paused for a moment. \u201cWhile we discussed and sometimes debated tactics, we were unified in our resolve to avoid the failure of systemically important institutions and that certainly included Lehman Brothers, where we worked hard right up until the end to prevent a failure,\u201d he said. In his own account of the financial crisis, \u201cOn the Brink,\u201d Paulson explained why he was so insistent that the public believe there was no bailout coming. \u201cThe New York Fed would be inviting Wall Street C.E.O.'s for a meeting, and we didn\u2019t want them to arrive thinking that we would be there waving a government checkbook.\u201dBernanke suggested they \u201cwere very much on the same page,\u201d but he made another point regarding the popular opinion about Lehman\u2019s failure. \u201cIronically, the conventional wisdom now is that it was obvious that Lehman should be saved but that the Fed and the Treasury went ahead and made the big mistake of letting it go,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe truth is actually quite the opposite. Conventional wisdom at the time was overwhelmingly in favor of letting Lehman fail, but Tim, Hank and I were very much convinced that we should do everything possible not to let it fail. But then of course we ran out of options.\u201dAfter much back and forth, Obama eventually appointed his chief of staff, Jack Lew, to the job. Geithner returned to Larchmont as an empty-nester, in the same house he could not sell, where he has spent the last year writing his book, working out of the Council on Foreign Relations and giving speeches for six-figure sums. While he claims he is through with government, he still maintains an intimate relationship with Obama, who was rumored to have recruited him to succeed Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve.When I asked him about it over lunch, Geithner originally glossed over the point, as if he declined the post. But as lunch continued, he stopped himself. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me whether \u2014 I didn\u2019t say that I declined it, I just said I was not interested in it. Just to clarify.\u201d When I asked if he officially declined, he responded: \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to that question, I was just saying that I didn\u2019t. You said that you \u2014 you phrased my thing as if I had declined. I wasn\u2019t interested.\u201dGeithner admitted that he struggled over what to do next. He didn\u2019t want to go back into government, and he wasn\u2019t inclined to go into academia, but he worried about the optics of going into finance. \u201cI think the perception problem \u2014 first of all it\u2019s very damaging to me as I was trying to do some tough things, and I think it\u2019s kind of very damaging to the country at the moment because it sees this basic loss of faith in government,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought the only thing I could really do about that was to make sure I didn\u2019t go work for a bank or a firm that we\u2019d regulated or that we\u2019d rescued directly.\u201dLast month, Geithner officially began a new job as president of a modestly sized private-equity firm, Warburg Pincus. It may not be investment banking, but it\u2019s possibly finance\u2019s second-most-vilified industry, given how Mitt Romney\u2019s Bain Capital experience played out in the 2012 presidential campaign. It\u2019s very unlikely that Geithner will be using TurboTax anytime in the near future, though; he is likely to make millions if not tens of millions of dollars over the next decade if he stays in the business.As we spoke, it became clear that this new job was one Geithner actually wanted. \u201cThe private sector is what most people do for a living,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that the possibility some people would criticize me for not staying a public servant was not a good reason not to go try and learn something new.\u201d It was also clear he had finally learned some public relations pointers from Treasury.On a Saturday in late April, I called Geithner for the last time to talk about the Volcker Rule and a few personal facts. (\u201cI\u2019m almost 5-9, just below 5-9. 5-8-and-\u00be, something like that. You can round down, you can say 5-8. I\u2019m relatively secure in my height.\u201d) He told me he was enjoying his new job and that he was preparing to take a flight to Asia later that day for work.I asked if the job meant that he had finally given up socialism, which his more severe detractors had accused him of, and embraced capitalism.\u201cNo,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t claim that yet.\u201dAn article on May 11 about former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner paraphrased incorrectly from a statement by Neil Barofsky, the former special inspector general of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In an email, Barofsky criticized Geithner and his team \u2014 not Geithner, Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson \u2014 for consistently putting \u2018\u2018the interests of the banks over those who were supposed to be helped, like struggling homeowners.\u2019\u2019 The article also misidentif ed the position Lee Sachs held in the Obama administration. He was an economic adviser, not an assistant Treasury secretary.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thai Military Faces Tough Economic Challenge", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Thailand\u2019s trade shrank in April and factory output fell for a 13th straight month, data showed Wednesday, underscoring the damage from political unrest and the tough job the new military government faces in reviving the economy.Exports, which account for more than 60 percent of Thai gross domestic product, fell 0.9 percent in April compared with the previous year, according to Commerce Ministry data.Imports fell less than projected last month, by 14.5 percent, compared with a Reuters poll\u2019s median of 18.2 percent. But the decline is worrisome, as many of Thailand\u2019s imports go into finished goods that are later exported.The trade deficit was $1.45 billion, more than twice the forecast $600 million.Industrial output in April was 3.9 percent lower than a year earlier, the Industry Ministry said. The 13-month streak of annual declines in output is the longest since Industry Ministry data first became available in 2001.Exports in April to China were 9.5 percent lower than a year earlier, and exports to Japan were down 4.5 percent. Shipments to the United States rose 0.6 percent and those to Europe were up 5.4 percent.The Commerce Ministry said that in the second quarter, exports could still increase 4 to 4.5 percent from last year, even though shipments for January to April were 1 percent lower than in the first four months of 2013.The junta faces an uphill struggle to revive Thailand\u2019s economy, one of the biggest in Southeast Asia. The economy contracted 2.1 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months, and some economists say a recession is unavoidable.Growth forecasts for Thailand have been cut steadily since the unrest began in November. But some economists think the outlook could improve under the military council, which this week started paying money owed to rice farmers. The council said it would speed up spending and that a new state budget would be created on time.\u201cIts actions on the rice-buying scheme, the budget and investment plans should bode well for the economic outlook, at least in the short term,\u201d said Thammarat Kittisiripat, an economist with TMB Bank in Bangkok. \u201cWe expect better economic activity in the second half, especially in the fourth quarter, along with improving external demand.\u201dTim Condon, chief economist for Asia at ING in Singapore, wrote on Wednesday that after the first quarter\u2019s 2.1 percent contraction from the prior period, \u201ca recession looks unavoidable.\u201d He added: \u201cHowever, the coupmakers are trying to put the economy on the front burner and have paid rice farmers, extended tax cuts and announced accelerated spending on infrastructure projects.\u201dThe output and trade numbers released on Wednesday were the first government data for April. Earlier, the Federation of Thai Industries said that vehicle sales in April had dropped 33.2 percent from a year earlier.The vital auto sector has slowed since mid-2013 following the end of a state subsidy for car purchases in 2012, when sales surged 81 percent. The unrest has added to carmakers\u2019 problems, and more than 30,000 jobs have been lost this year.The Thai unit of Honda Motor said last week it had cut production at its Ayutthaya plant to 60 percent because of weak domestic demand. Officials there voiced concerns that sales might fall short of the company\u2019s target this year after months of prolonged political unrest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gary Becker, 83, Nobel Laureate, Dies; Applied Economics to Everyday Life", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn original, prolific and sometimes provocative scholar, Professor Becker was widely regarded as a towering figure in his field. Like his teacher and then colleague at the University of Chicago, Milton Friedman, he held to a free-market orientation.President George W. Bush bestowed the Medal of Freedom on Professor Becker at the White House in 2007, saying, \u201cProfessor Becker has shown that economic principles do not just exist in theory.\u201dIn applying his work to public policy, the president added, Professor Becker had become \u201cone of the most influential economists of the past hundred years.\u201dProfessor Becker was best known for his work in labor economics. Starting from the assumption that all elements of society are rational economic agents, he focused on the motivating factors of human behavior rather than on the study of broad economic trends.The work inspired researchers in other fields, including anthropology and political science. He himself also held a joint appointment in the economics and sociology departments at the University of Chicago.Professor Becker\u2019s inquiries cast fresh light on social phenomena previously regarded as having little or no economic dimension. Households, for example, were long seen simply as entities intent only on maximizing consumption, but Mr. Becker saw them as small factories that also produce valuable, though nonmarketable, basics of life, like leisure and sleeping.One of his early works, \u201cThe Economics of Discrimination,\u201d which grew out of his doctoral thesis, attracted little notice when it was first published in 1957, but it won acclaim with the rise of the civil rights movement.In the book, Professor Becker asserted that to better understand any form of discrimination, one needs to quantify what people are willing to pay to avoid one another\u2019s company. He concluded that the perpetrator of discrimination is harmed as well as the victim.\u201cEvery time I discriminate \u2014 if I decline to hire a black and instead hire a white, when they\u2019re equally productive, but the black is cheaper \u2014 I\u2019m losing,\u201d he said in a 1993 interview with Modern Maturity magazine.Among many other things, he sought to explain why family size has tended to decline as income rises, finding that wealthier parents were choosing to invest more in quality at the expense of quantity. Women\u2019s time became more valuable as they swelled the work force and earned more money, he found.One of the best-known elements of the book was the \u201crotten kid\u201d theorem. \u201cChildren have an incentive to act altruistically toward each other as their parents want them to, even if children are really egotistical,\u201d he wrote.In another study, in 1991, he sought to explain why extremely popular restaurants or Broadway plays often do not expand or raise prices as much as demand might suggest. He concluded that social influences provided the answer. Consumers may value the access to a scarce product \u2014 sometimes called a positional good \u2014 or enjoy the camaraderie of lines. Providers also realize that public taste can be fickle and demand may ultimately slacken.Professor Becker was rarely tied formally to political candidates; an exception came in 1996, when he was an adviser to Senator Robert Dole, a Republican, during his presidential campaign. But his views, expressed monthly in Business Week for nearly two decades and then in the Becker-Posner Blog, were reliably consistent with free-market conservatism.His work led him to favor school vouchers, a volunteer army, pay for college athletes, legalization of drugs, stiffer criminal sentences and relaxation of minimum-wage laws.Gary Stanley Becker was born on Dec. 2, 1930, in the coal-mining city of Pottsville, Pa., where his father owned a small business, and moved with his parents, his brother and two sisters, to Brooklyn as a child. There, he took an interest in the stock market and financial news, which he read to his father, who was losing his sight.At 16, as a student at James Madison High School, he faced a choice between the math team and the handball team, which met at the same time; he chose math, even though he considered himself better at handball.He went on to attend Princeton University, graduating in 1951. In 2008, the Princeton Alumni Weekly ranked him No. 11 on a list of most influential Princetonians in its 261-year history. (James Madison, class of 1771, was first.)After taking graduate degrees at the University of Chicago, he moved to Columbia University, where he became a professor of economics at age 30. He returned to Chicago as a visiting faculty member but was persuaded by Professor Stigler to stay.In 2011, the University of Chicago named a research institute in honor of Professor Becker and Milton Friedman, the Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics. Professor Becker was named its chairman.Beginning in 1973, he was also affiliated with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he became a senior fellow in 1990 and spent a few weeks each year. He summered on Cape Cod.Professor Becker\u2019s first wife, Doria Slote, died in 1979.In addition to his daughter Judy, from his first marriage, he is survived by his wife, Guity Nashat, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a professor of Islamic and Middle Eastern history at the University of Illinois at Chicago; another daughter from his first marriage, Catherine Becker; two stepsons, Cyrus Claffey and Michael Claffey; a sister, Natalie Becker; two step-grandchildren; and two grandchildren.Professors Becker and Nashat collaborated in 1997 on \u201cThe Economics of Life: From Baseball to Affirmative Action to Immigration, How Real-World Issues Affect Our Everyday Life.\u201d She persuaded him to write the column for Business Week, where he held forth from 1985 until 2004.In his 1992 Nobel lecture, Professor Becker described how he employed economics to analyze social issues outside the discipline\u2019s traditional range of vision.He said that, unlike Marxists, he rejected the assumption that individuals were motivated solely by the prospect of selfish, material gain. Rather, he insisted, \u201cbehavior is driven by a much richer set of values and preferences\u201d that can also include altruism, loyalty and spite.Actions are constrained by various factors, but the most fundamental is limited time, he argued. \u201cSo while goods and services have expanded enormously in rich countries,\u201d he said, \u201cthe total time available to consume has not. Thus wants remain unsatisfied in rich countries as well as in poor ones.\u201dAn obituary on Monday about the economist Gary S. Becker referred incorrectly to the cause of his death. He died from complications of ulcer surgery, not \u201cafter a long illness.\u201d It also misstated the year his first wife, Doria Slote, died. It was 1979, not 1969. And the obituary erroneously attributed a distinction to Professor Becker and his colleague Milton Friedman. They were the first two people to receive both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2014 not the only two. (Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel in 2002 and was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Announces Pullback From Ukraine Border", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin, faced with rising violence in southeastern Ukraine that threatened to draw in the Russian Army at great cost and prompt severe new Western economic sanctions, pressed pause on Wednesday in what had started to look like an inevitable march toward war.But it remained unclear to analysts and political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic whether he was truly reversing course on Ukraine or if this was just another of his judo-inspired feints.Using a far less ominous tone than in previous remarks about Ukraine, Mr. Putin told a news conference at the Kremlin that Russia had withdrawn its troops from along the border and that he had asked separatists to drop plans for a referendum on sovereignty this Sunday. Russia would even accept Ukraine\u2019s presidential election on May 25, he said, if demands for autonomy from the country\u2019s east were recognized.Mr. Putin said Russia wanted to spur mediation efforts led by the Europeans. He said he did not know whether talks between the warring sides in Ukraine were \u201crealistic,\u201d but was determined to give them a chance, in particular a suggestion from Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany that the factions engage in a round-table discussion.\u201cI simply believe that if we want to find a long-term solution to the crisis in Ukraine, open, honest and equal dialogue is the only possible option,\u201d he said.While Western governments welcomed Mr. Putin\u2019s apparent about-face, there was also abundant skepticism, based in part on his record in Crimea. Mr. Putin repeatedly denied that Russia\u2019s soldiers were involved in the region, only to admit later that they were.A White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters traveling with President Obama aboard Air Force One that while the United States would welcome a Russian military pullback, \u201cthere has been no evidence that such a withdrawal has taken place.\u201d NATO officials confirmed that on Wednesday, saying they saw no troop movements.Senior British officials also reacted warily to Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement, noting that he had once before announced a sizable troop withdrawal from the border, in a phone call with Ms. Merkel, but moved only one battalion a modest distance. One official said that satellite photos that would better verify Mr. Putin\u2019s assertions would take a while to come through.Nevertheless, British officials regarded Mr. Putin\u2019s comments as positive. They suggested that he wants to avoid a larger economic confrontation with the United States and the European Union and that some of the concerns of Russian businessmen may finally be getting through to the tight circle around Mr. Putin.While the world was caught off guard by Mr. Putin\u2019s sudden peace offensive, analysts in Moscow cited several robust military, economic and political reasons he might be inclined to switch tracks.First, there has been an increasing sense here, as elsewhere, that conditions in Ukraine were rapidly approaching the situation in Yugoslavia in 1991, when that country broke into pieces. The violence among various factions was creating facts on the ground, they said, that nobody could predict or manage.Paradoxically, some added, this dynamic was nurtured in large part by round-the-clock reports on Russian state television that Ukraine was heaving with violence instigated primarily by neo-fascist cells emanating from western Ukraine. But with the notable exception of some 40 deaths in riots last week in Odessa, far from the separatist hotbeds of Slovyansk and Donetsk, the violence was mostly confined to small skirmishes.There were worrying signs that was changing, however.\u201cThe problem is that in all these types of conflicts, once the black swans have started to fly, you will never control the situation,\u201d said Sergei A. Karaganov, dean of the School of International Economics and Foreign Affairs at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow and a periodic adviser to the Kremlin on foreign policy.In modern international relations and finance, \u201cblack swans\u201d refer to random, unexpected events with unforeseeable consequences. \u201cLaw and order was beginning to fall apart, and more and more groups were fighting each other,\u201d Mr. Karaganov said.The other reasons follow a certain logic. Mr. Putin wants to shape Ukraine\u2019s future, but an invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Army would be wildly expensive, bloody and unpredictable. Even a nominally successful invasion could breed an insurgency in the east by pro-Ukrainian militants, while the partition of the country would stick Russia with a failed state in southeast Ukraine that would take tens of billions to restructure. It would also create an implacably anti-Russian and pro-European state in western Ukraine that would most likely join NATO as fast as it could.And an invasion would almost certainly galvanize the European Union into joining the United States in imposing much tougher sanctions that might target entire sections of the Russian economy, like banking, energy or steel.The Russian aim in Ukraine has always been clear, analysts said. Mr. Putin wanted to annex Crimea with minimal cost, which he appears to have done. Generally, Washington and the European capitals have been so focused on the possible dismemberment of Ukraine that Crimea was shunted to a back burner.Mr. Putin wants to maintain the ability, they say, to manipulate events in Ukraine to keep the country out of a full embrace by the European Union and, worse, NATO. Toward that end, Russia has been pushing for regional autonomy, a slippery concept that leaves plenty of room for maneuvering at a later date. If he can get European mediators to push through an autonomy plan that keeps southeast Ukraine in Moscow\u2019s orbit \u2014 without risking his army or sanctions \u2014 so much the better.\u201cHe really promised nothing,\u201d noted Kirill Rogov, an economic analyst and political commentator in Moscow. \u201cHe demonstrated that he controls the level of tension in Ukraine. He can return the situation to the high levels of violence at any moment. He did not refuse the referendum, but only proposed delaying it.\u201dAbove all, perhaps, Mr. Putin is known to loathe chaos, and southeast Ukraine was staggering in that direction.Analysts suggested that if eastern Ukraine were to vote in the referendum Sunday to join Russia, or for independence, or if they demanded Russian protection in some orchestrated way, Mr. Putin would be forced to react, given his past statements about Russia\u2019s responsibility to ensure the safety of ethnic Russians beyond its borders.\u201cThe decision was taken not to increase Russian involvement in Ukraine, and not to increase the chances of major violence there,\u201d said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political analyst and a commentator for Kommersant FM radio.Most analysts believe that Mr. Putin wanted to avoid war, and say that a minor armed incursion into Ukraine would not have been enough to resolve the crisis. Instead, it could easily have developed into a long, bloody and expensive slog, bruising the reputation he gained from annexing Crimea with virtually no bloodshed.\u201cThis one would not have been bloodless,\u201d Mr. von Eggert said. \u201cThis would have been a real war, not by stealth, not by new methods, but a real old-fashioned war, and this is something that Mr. Putin does not want.\u201dThe intense public support generated in recent months, all the glow about renewed Russian strength, would have evaporated.Mr. Putin repeated Russia\u2019s longstanding demands. He said the authorities in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, should immediately halt all military actions in southeast Ukraine. He demanded the release of all prisoners linked to the uprising. He also expressed sympathy for the goals and actions of the rebels in the southeast, where armed men have paralyzed most of the major cities by seizing government buildings and barricading themselves inside, with just enough weapons to fend off government attempts to recapture them.\u201cI can understand the people in southeast Ukraine, who say that if others can do what they like in Kiev, carry out a coup d'\u00e9tat, take up arms and seize government buildings, police stations and military garrisons, then why shouldn\u2019t they be allowed to defend their interests and lawful rights?\u201d Mr. Putin told the news conference, according to the official Kremlin transcript of his remarks. The Kremlin has for months referred to the interim government as a \u201cjunta,\u201d called it illegitimate and warned of its infiltration by neo-fascists.The reaction in Kiev and among separatists in southeast Ukraine was a combination of suspicion and mistrust.In Kiev, Andriy Parubiy, the head of Ukraine\u2019s national security council, said that Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks were \u201cclear evidence\u201d of what Moscow had been denying all along, that the separatist movement was directed from Russia.\u201cWe understand that the center of the Ukrainian crisis is not in Slovyansk, not in Donetsk, not in Luhansk,\u201d Mr. Parubiy said. \u201cThe center of the Ukrainian crisis is coordinated in the Kremlin.\u201dHe added that the call to delay the referendum in Donetsk was not surprising given that it was illegal and impossible to carry out because the separatists control only a few public buildings in the center of a dozen or so cities.On Wednesday, the militants seemed perplexed by the Kremlin\u2019s announcement. Both Moscow and the militants have repeatedly said that their actions are not coordinated, despite the shadowy presence of well-trained, well-armed men Ukraine accuses of being part of the Russian military or special agents.In Slovyansk, the ground zero of some of the toughest, most militarily experienced opposition to Kiev, the separatist mayor, Vyachislav Ponomaryov, first claimed that he had not heard Mr. Putin\u2019s announcement and then confessed confusion.\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly who he is appealing to with this request,\u201d Mr. Ponomaryov said.He added that the militants were still ready to hold the referendum, that the ballots were prepared and polling stations were being set up. \u201cIf a collective decision is made not to hold the referendum, then we won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we\u2019re ready.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the date on which President Viktor F.

{"Headline": "Full Recovery Still Years Away for Many in Euro Zone", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Despite recent optimism that Europe\u2019s economy is finally turning a corner, a stark reality remains: The situation is still fragile.By many accounts, the euro zone has been rebounding from a wrenching double-dip recession that began in 2008 after the fall of Lehman Brothers. Financial markets have been in a celebratory mood, driving down borrowing costs for even the most troubled economies in recent months, while politicians have declared the worst of the crisis is over.But the uneven nature of the recovery \u2014 between a group of strong countries in the north and a larger swath of weak nations in the southern rim \u2014 has made it difficult for the overall economy to gain momentum.Growth in the currency union rose 0.2 percent in the first quarter, which translates to an annual growth rate of 0.8 percent, according to data released on Thursday by Eurostat, Europe\u2019s statistics agency. While it was the fourth straight quarter of expansion, it was half what economists expected. The growth is so feeble that it could be years before Europe truly recovers. The overall euro zone economy is still more than 2 percent smaller than it was before the crisis hit. And the pace of recovery, economists say, is even slower than it was after the Great Depression of the 1930s.The differences at the country level are stark. While Germany\u2019s economy is chugging along at a decent clip, expanding by 0.8 percent in the first quarter, France slipped back into stagnation in the quarter. And Italy, Portugal and Greece shrank yet again.Of the 18 European Union member countries that use the euro, only Germany and, to a lesser extent, France have returned to precrisis levels of growth. The United States, despite a spotty recovery, hit that marker in 2011.\u201cUnless growth in the euro zone really picks up, then the prospect of a lost decade is very real,\u201d Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said ahead of the report. \u201cIt matters because it permanently shifts the political power center of the euro toward the stronger countries of Northern Europe, and in the southern countries, it means a decline of living standards that may well last beyond a decade.\u201dThe dynamics are putting increased pressure on the European Central Bank to follow through on a pledge to stimulate the economy next month. With the economic picture continuing to look weak, analysts now expect the E.C.B. to cut interest rates close to zero and charge interest to banks that store funds at the central bank.As economies in Northern Europe show signs of improvement, the southern rim nations continue to struggle. The uneven nature of the recovery has weighed on the overall European economy, which will probably take years to truly recover.Any economic stimulus could not come fast enough for Mina Giannandrea, 68, the owner of clothing stores in the center of Rome that sell expensive Max Mara dresses \u2014 luxuries that fewer people can afford.As the crisis and government-imposed austerity measures have sapped the Italian economy, Ms. Giannandrea has closed two of her four shops and laid off eight employees since 2012. Many had worked with her for decades but have now joined the growing number of people she knows who are without jobs. Unemployment in Italy, the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy, has risen to 13 percent, higher than the euro zone\u2019s overall level of about 12 percent.\u201cPeople here need hope,\u201d Ms. Giannandrea said. \u201cHow can my business pick up, if half of the families I know are unemployed?\u201dReasons for optimism in the euro zone do exist. Investment and industrial activity have been rebounding since last autumn. Consumer confidence has ticked up of late. Spain, the fourth-largest euro zone economy, has gone from a painful recession to three straight quarters of growth.But other dark clouds are on the horizon. The fallout from the crisis in Ukraine, for example, threatens to spill over into the broader European economy. Already, it is wreaking havoc on Russian growth, which slowed to an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first quarter.The growth potential of many European economies has also been stifled by the effects of austerity measures imposed in response to high government debt. Greece, for example, has struggled to make up for a near 25 percent economic contraction since 2008, as it pushes spending cuts and tax increases.France, which has battled two shallow recessions in two years, slipped back to zero growth in the first quarter from a 0.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter. The Netherlands, also under the grips of an austerity plan, had a drastic contraction in the first quarter, as the economy shrank 1.4 percent from the preceding quarter.In many cases, countries that pledged major policy overhauls for labor markets, spending and taxes during the crisis that were meant to stoke recoveries have yet to see those initiatives bear fruit. The worry now, economists say, is the likelihood that governments will not press ahead with reforms, which could further impede the rebound.Output in most euro zone countries would have to take big leaps now and in coming years to make up for growth lost during the downturn, economists say.\u201cThe question is, What\u2019s Europe\u2019s future for the 21st century?\u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. \u201cWill they still be able to grow and compete with Asia and more dynamic regions?\u201dNearly six years since the onset of the crisis, Germany is still one of the few euro zone countries to have fully bounced back. Its economy is now around 4 percent bigger than it was in 2008, said Richard Boxshall, an economist at PwC, the consulting firm, in London.Industrial powerhouses like Freudenberg Group have driven the nation\u2019s growth. Its 11,000 employees in Germany make fabrics, metal and chemical technologies, machinery seals and a range of other sophisticated products. On a recent day, workers in one factory hovered near complex machines that rolled out narrow strips of metal, which were separated by a laser and then welded to form metal seals. In 2008, Freudenberg \u201canticipated an imminent crisis and began to initiate capacity adjustments,\u201d said Mohsen Sohi, a member of the management board. The company, whose sales rose 4.8 percent last year to 6.6 billion euros, or about $9 billion, invested \u20ac246 million last year in research and development on new products.\u201cWe saw the crisis as an opportunity for change, and we were able to use it to lay the foundations for our success today,\u201d Mr. Sohi said.In other countries, though, big challenges remain. Italy\u2019s gross domestic product has shrunk more than 8 percent in six years. The economy would need to grow at least 3.7 percent for each of the next two years \u2014 much faster than its current 0.6 percent annual pace \u2014 to return to where it was in 2008, according to calculations by PwC.Ms. Giannandrea, the dress shop owner, doubts that will happen any time soon. When the crisis hit, politicians everywhere, including in Italy, promised structural economic changes to fuel a recovery and help businesses like hers rebound.Matteo Renzi, the new Italian prime minister, has vowed a fresh approach to reinvigorating the economy and cutting joblessness, including revising the tax system and simplifying corporate regulations. But after six years of similar promises from earlier governments, few changes have materialized.Revisions to many rigid Italian labor laws that make it expensive to hire and keep employees remain \u201ca pipe dream,\u201d Ms. Giannandrea said, adding to her costs. Higher taxes were levied to pay for the Italian government\u2019s huge debts. And consumers have all but stopped spending on the pricey coats and dresses she stocks.Ms. Giannandrea tried to remain positive when she shut her stores. But she struggled to get past feelings of pain, not only for a business that had been part of her life for 40 years but for her country as a whole.\u201cWill Italy make it?\u201d she asked. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question.\u201dGaia Pianigiani in Rome contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Leviathan Turns Philippine Fishermen Into Desperate Darters", "Date": "2014-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMasinloc Journal11 PhotosMASINLOC, the Philippines \u2014 On a scorching recent afternoon, fishermen from this sleepy Philippine town hauled blocks of ice onto a rickety, wooden fishing boat bobbing just off the shore. By nightfall, the boat would be on its way to coveted fishing grounds, and to a cat-and-mouse game with the Chinese Coast Guard.The 30-foot boat, with bamboo outriggers to keep it stable in the often rough waters of the South China Sea, was bound for a reef known as Scarborough Shoal. Claimed by both the Philippines and China, the area has long been the stuff of local legend \u2014 a haven for blue marlin, red grouper, lobster, skipjack, yellowfin tuna and more.\u201cIn Scarborough, you don\u2019t have to catch the fish,\u201d Jerry Escape, the town\u2019s fisheries officer, said with a grin. \u201cThey just swim up to you and greet you and let you take them out of the water.\u201dFish tales aside, the beleaguered boatmen here in Masinloc have found themselves caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight that their country appears to be losing, at least for now. For the past two years, the shoal has been controlled by the Chinese Coast Guard, and the Philippine fishermen who made their livings there find themselves mostly shut out of fisheries they depended on for decades.\u201cThe fishermen have no choice,\u201d Mr. Escape said. \u201cThey fish there until the Chinese chase them away.\u201dThe shoal is just one of a number of places in the South China and East China Seas caught in a tug of war between a rising China claiming vast swaths of resource-rich ocean and the other Asian nations that claim many of the same waters as their own.This particular conflict came to a head in April 2012 when the Philippines accused Chinese fishermen of poaching protected coral and giant clams from the area, about 124 miles off the west coast of the Philippine island of Luzon. A Philippine Coast Guard ship and several Chinese government ships were locked in a tense standoff for more than a month before the Filipinos withdrew. But the Chinese ships never left, instead setting up regular patrols to block entry and protecting Chinese fishing boats in the area.These days, the fishermen of Masinloc return to port with fewer fish and more tales of trying to edge as close to the triangle of azure water as possible and hauling in as many fish as they can before they are chased away. Mario Forones, 54, who returned in late March from a trip, said several Chinese Coast Guard ships constantly circled the reef while one planted itself inside, blocking any boats that might get past the first line of defense.\u201cIf you get too close,\u201d he said, \u201cthey come at you in rubber boats and yell in English: \u2018Go away! Go away!\u2019\u00a0\u201dAccording to the Philippine military, some fishermen have gotten rougher treatment. During prime fishing season in January, officials said, Chinese ships used water cannons to drive off some of the Philippine boats.Though fishermen from more distant parts of the Philippines venture into these waters, they need larger, more expensive vessels to reach the area, load their catch and make it home, so they rely on it less. But for the people of Masinloc, the closest point in the Philippines to the shoal, the reef is considered an extension of the town.From Masinloc, a 30-foot fishing boat with a single engine can reach the shoal in about 18 hours. That had allowed the small-time fishermen to regularly take in more than a ton of fish a day even with their minimal resources. The catch is especially crucial because the town has so far missed out on the economic surge that has made the Philippines one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. The moribund town center features an open-air market and a mostly abandoned shopping mall. Vendors sell slippers and hot dogs from makeshift stalls, and customers are scarce.Mayor Desiree Edora said the town of about 45,000 was struggling to absorb the loss of business as fishermen returned from the shoal with smaller catches, affecting everyone from ice vendors to truckers to restaurant owners. Although she said she did not add up the losses in what is a lightly regulated industry here in Masinloc, she said they were substantial. The local economy is based on fishing, rice farming and a coal-fired power plant that feeds electricity into the national grid. There are no factories or call centers to absorb the fishermen if they can no longer make a living off Scarborough.The Chinese claim Scarborough Shoal based on ancient maps that identify most of the South China Sea as their territory. The Philippine government has produced its own maps, showing the shoal to be part of the Philippines since at least 1734, when the islands were ruled by Spain.China has recently increased its pursuit of territorial claims in nearby seas, leading to tense exchanges with neighboring countries. A map of some of the most notable disputes.Philippine officials say their country maintained unbroken jurisdiction over the shoal since independence in 1946, and note that the shoal is well within its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. The country has taken its claims \u2014 over Scarborough and other contested South China Sea areas \u2014 to a United Nations tribunal for arbitration, where they are wending their way through a review that is expected to take years. So far, China has refused to participate.In the last two weeks, the Philippines continued its campaign to expose what it describes as Chinese encroachment on its territory. First it seized nine Chinese fishermen it said it had caught poaching in another disputed area of the South China Sea, leading to angry condemnation from Beijing. Then it publicized photos of what it said was land reclamation at yet another reef, suggesting the work was China\u2019s way of solidifying its claims to that area.Despite the government-to-government hostility, here in Masinloc there is little talk among townspeople of a Chinese threat, as there is, for instance, in Japan. Instead, they voice tired resignation. They are used to being poor; even before the Chinese took over the shoal, they said, there were few signs of prosperity here.While the town hopes to regain access to the shoal, Mayor Edora has taken other steps to try to help the fishermen. She has worked with the national government to provide them with artificial reefs that can be anchored to the ocean floor to attract fish, but she said the so-called aggregators had attracted far fewer fish than the natural reef.\u201cThat area is ours,\u201d said Mr. Escape, the fisheries officer. \u201cBut the Chinese are strong, so they can do what they like. We are weak, so there is nothing we can do.\u201dTolomeo Forones, Mario\u2019s brother and a part-time fisherman himself, said the solution was clear: Bring back American bases. He noted that when the United States military maintained bases in the Philippines, the Chinese Coast Guard was never seen near the country.In the short term, that looks unlikely. The United States and the Philippines recently forged a deal that would establish military facilities \u2014 mostly on the coastlines facing China \u2014 that are expected to host large American warships and possibly squadrons of United States fighter jets. But it could take several years to get those facilities up and running.Tolomeo Forones said he felt that the best chance for his weaker nation to stand up to China had been squandered years ago, when the Philippines in the 1990s ejected the Americans from their former naval base at Subic Bay, just 70 miles south of Masinloc.\u201cIf Subic was still a U.S. Navy base, those Chinese would not be there,\u201d Mr. Forones said. \u201cNow that the Americans have moved out, the Chinese have claimed our islands.

{"Headline": "North Korea Will Investigate Fate of Abducted Japanese ", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 North Korea has agreed to open a new investigation into the fate of Japanese citizens abducted by its agents during the Cold War, the two countries said Thursday, signaling a possible diplomatic breakthrough in an emotional issue that has divided Japan and the North.At talks held in Stockholm, North Korean negotiators agreed to Japanese requests to investigate what happened to more than a dozen Japanese believed to have been kidnapped by the isolated Stalinist regime decades ago, reversing the North\u2019s earlier insistence that the issue had been settled.The top Japanese government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, said that in return, Japan would start lifting sanctions that it had imposed on the North over the abduction issue. Those include a ban on travel between the two countries, on the transfer of money, and also on visits by North Korean ships to Japanese ports, he said.\u201cWe expect this to yield concrete results in quickly resolving problems involving Japanese, including the return of any surviving abductees,\u201d Mr. Suga told reporters.The deal could lead to a resolution of a problem that had driven Japan to cut off virtually all ties with North Korea ever since the North admitted in 2002 that it had kidnapped Japanese citizens, and returned five of them alive. The Japanese public was outraged by the revelations, and by the vague and often puzzling accounts that the North Korean government gave of the fate of several other abductees, who it said had died. Most of them were snatched by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s as they relaxed on the beach or walked home from school. Their fate had been a mystery until the North\u2019s sudden admission.Japan has been pressing North Korea ever since to produce a fuller account of what happened to the other abductees, amid unconfirmed reports that some had been seen alive even after 2002 in the North, one of the world\u2019s most closed and secretive countries. North Korean diplomats had rejected those demands, saying it had disclosed all the information on them that it had.The North\u2019s willingness to reverse that stance may signal a new desire by the dictator Kim Jong-un to open his impoverished nation ever more slightly to the outside world, either to bolster its decrepit economy or to reduce its dependence on China, its main trading partner. For Japan, the possible breakthrough is a rare diplomatic success for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a conservative who has presided over a souring of ties with other neighbors, China and South Korea.\u201cThe complete resolution of the abductee issue is one of the top priorities of the Abe administration,\u201d Mr. Abe said in announcing the deal. \u201cOur mission is not over until all the families of abductees can once again hold their children in their arms.\u201dAs part of Thursday\u2019s deal, Mr. Suga said, North Korea agreed to set up a committee to conduct an internal investigation into what happened to the abductees. The committee will also examine the fate of other Japanese in the North, including those who accompanied their Korean spouses to the country in the 1950s, and search for the remains of Japanese who died there in the chaotic final days of World War II.Mr. Suga also said that North Korea had agreed to return any surviving abductees that it found. Though it is unclear if any could still be alive after so many years, and after the North had already declared them all to be dead, the statement reflected the hopes of Japanese families to be reunited with their missing loved ones.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Budget Woes May Hurt Christie More Than Bridge Scandal", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor months, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has kept a low profile, waiting for new headlines to distract from the George Washington Bridge scandal. Now they have: The news has been a dire drumbeat about his state\u2019s economy.Facing a $2.7 billion hole in his budgets, Mr. Christie announced this week that he would not pay the state\u2019s full pension obligations for the next two years, reneging on a bipartisan agreement that had made him into a national star, and had become a central boast in his 2012 keynote speech to the Republican National Convention. Credit agencies have downgraded the state\u2019s bond rating six times \u2014 making him tied for the record among New Jersey governors, and giving the state one of the lowest credit ratings in the nation \u2014 and have threatened that they may do so again because of the pension plans.The state\u2019s unemployment rate remains above the national average, its growth, below, and slower than its neighbors. Its foreclosure and mortgage delinquency rate are the nation\u2019s highest. And New Jersey has recovered only about 40 percent of the jobs lost during the recession, even as the country as a whole has recovered nearly all.Mr. Christie was asked at a Republican Governors Association news conference on Wednesday whether he would step down as the group\u2019s chairman \u2014 as he had been asked five months ago because of the scandal surrounding the lane closings to the bridge. This time it was about his state\u2019s economic woes, at a time when the group is trying to argue that Republican governors are more responsible financial stewards.Appearing at a fiscal conference last week, the day after Moody\u2019s Investors Service issued the sixth downgrade for New Jersey, Mr. Christie found himself defending his economic record in an interview with Bob Schieffer of CBS News. \u201cIt was not so long ago people were talking about the New Jersey miracle,\u201d Mr. Schieffer said, adding, \u201cBut now suddenly the news is not so good about New Jersey.\u201dIf the governor might have cast aside the bridge scandal as minor \u2014 \u201ca footnote\u201d in his legacy, he told Mr. Schieffer \u2014 the problems of the economy would seem to say more about the job he has done as governor as he pushes ahead with plans to run for president in 2016. It might have been easy to dismiss the bridge scandal as manufactured by Democrats looking to score points; it will be harder to dismiss concerns about his financial management, particularly among primary voters who consider themselves fiscal conservatives.Mr. Christie is not the only one to blame for the fiscal problems. He argues that he is making the best of bad choices handed to him by previous governors who failed to pay the annual pension obligations. The ratings agencies, Mr. Christie said on Wednesday, \u201cdowngrade people who continue to act responsibly.\u201d The other options for balancing the budget \u2014 cutting aid to hospitals, schools or higher education \u2014 could have caused as much or more outrage.Mr. Christie argued that the problem with the pensions would not be solved until public employees contributed more toward soaring health care costs.\u201cI\u2019d love to give people tax relief,\u201d he said, announcing his plans to fill the budget gap on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019d love to also be able to fund programs that are priorities and that matter a great deal to me and to the people of this state. But until we decide to be adults and deal with the problem we know we have, we\u2019re not going to be able to do that.\u201dOn Wednesday afternoon, when asked at a news conference in Trenton whether he was \u201cnervous and intimidated\u201d by the prospect of lawsuits from unions who have vowed to sue to force him to make the payments on public employee pensions, Mr. Christie deadpanned: \u201cTwo words that are often associated with me, \u2018nervous and intimidated.\u2019 Listen, I know that some people think that now\u2019s the time where you can pile on. You know, I make the decisions that I believe are the right thing to do.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would happen this quickly,\u201d the governor added, referring to the hole the pension payments had created in the budget.But a host of independent reports and the ratings agencies have warned about the problems for years: The governor\u2019s projections for economic growth have been too optimistic, resulting in midyear cuts to the budgets three years in a row. He has not kept enough of a cushion against bad economic news \u2014 the state\u2019s surplus is about .9 percent of the total budget, the lowest in a decade, and below the national average of more than 8 percent. Connecticut, for example, was like New Jersey in suffering lower than expected tax revenues this year, but was not forced to adjust the budget because it maintains a bigger rainy day fund.The ratings agencies have warned that his reliance on \u201cone shots\u201d to fix budget holes \u2014 a practice Mr. Christie himself railed against when he ran against Gov. Jon Corzine in 2009 \u2014 was making the budget structurally unsound, and that he would have to either raise taxes or cut programs to restore health.\u201cThis has been a multiyear trend that has now reached a very weak position,\u201d said Baye B. Larsen, who wrote the report that accompanied the Moody\u2019s downgrade.Mr. Christie was widely praised in 2011 when he and Democratic leaders in the Legislature agreed to increase payments on the state\u2019s pension obligations, which had been almost entirely ignored by governors since Christie Whitman. (Mr. Christie told Mr. Schieffer that Mr. Corzine made \u201czero\u201d payments; in fact, he paid as much or more than Mr. Christie for two years, then reverted to the previous model when the recession hit.)In return, employees had to contribute more toward their benefits, and won the right to sue if the state reneged on its payments. It made him seem the adult on the national stage, daring, as he said, \u201cto touch the third rail of politics in order to bring reform to an unsustainable system.\u201d This year, the payment was to be $1.6 billion; Mr. Christie said this week he would pay $696 million. In the fiscal year that begins July 1, he was to pay $2.25 billion; he will pay $681 million.Paul A. Sarlo, a Bergen County Democrat who is chairman of the budget committee in the State Senate, argued that the governor had failed to make tough choices, instead basing his budgets on unrealistic expectations for tax revenue.\u201cHe blamed the pension payment for his fiscal troubles, but conveniently left out the fact that his revenue projections collapsed as most predicted,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should stop blaming the one group who has actually made sacrifices to help solve the state\u2019s budget problems and point the finger back at himself.\u201dCutting the pension contributions will add $2 billion to the unfunded liability in the system. And the credit ratings will make it harder for the state to borrow money.An article on Saturday about New Jersey\u2019s budget problems and the effect they may have on Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s political prospects misstated projections of New Jersey\u2019s budget surplus relative to surpluses of other states. The projection for New Jersey is 0.9 percent of the budget, compared with a national average of more than 8 percent. It is not 3 percent in New Jersey, compared with a median of 5 percent in other states.Kate Pastor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany Taps Universities in Its Push for Green Energy", "Date": "2014-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationBERLIN \u2014 Germany has set an ambitious goal: to run its economy almost entirely on renewable energy by 2050.The energy push, known as the Energiewende, or energy transformation, is often compared in scope to the country\u2019s postwar reconstruction. It will require wide-ranging changes in German society \u2014 not just in energy supply but in architecture and agriculture, urban planning, and economic markets. Treading onto this unknown territory, Germany has called on its universities to help make the transformation work.While Germany is supporting university research into solar power and other clean energy, perhaps the biggest innovation in higher education is how the Energiewende has triggered the creation of new interdisciplinary approaches, pushing institutions to develop new courses, degrees and departments.Green technology is not necessarily where the breakthroughs need to happen, said Karl-Friedrich Ziegahn, head of the renewable energy department at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology\u2019s School of Energy. In terms of the transformation, Germany\u2019s biggest challenges today, he said, \u201care socioeconomic in nature: public awareness, cost and community involvement.\u201dThis is the thinking, for example, behind the University of Freiburg\u2019s master\u2019s in renewable energy management, one of several hundred sustainability-related degree programs offered in Germany. Almost all of them have been added over the past six years.The degree, which is offered through the university\u2019s Center for Renewable Energy, is designed to close the gap between the technical aspects of renewable energy and a broader vision of the future of sustainable development.\u201cThis combination of skills is urgently needed right now,\u201d said Stefan Adler, the center\u2019s managing director. Since it was first offered, in 2008, the degree has grown in popularity. In the first year, the center received 70 applications for 30 spots. In 2013-14, more than 500 people worldwide applied for the same number of places. The center will offer more spots next year.Germany has already made enormous strides in clean energy generation. In roughly a decade, it has expanded its green power supply to account for a quarter of its electricity \u2014 which is twice the United States\u2019 share of renewables. On especially sunny and windy days, when wind farms and solar parks churn out power at peak volume, more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s electricity needs are covered by renewables.There are 180 universities and polytechnic colleges in Germany involved in the energy transition, with the federal Research Ministry providing $2.65 billion in competitive grants from 2011 to 2013.\u201cThe ethos of sustainability is now integral to all of Germany\u2019s universities these days,\u201d said Thomas Schomerus, a professor of environmental and energy law at Leuphana University, in L\u00fcneburg, and director of the university\u2019s Institute of Sustainability Governance. \u201cIt\u2019s not an extra anymore in the curriculum or something exceptional for research.\u201dLeuphana, for example, has an entire school dedicated to sustainability science, with a 25-member faculty recruited from both the humanities and natural sciences.\u201cSustainability means that everything is connected, so much so that dividing it up into traditional disciplines means losing the big picture. Sustainability is the big picture, and we need to go deeper into it,\u201d Mr. Schomerus said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new level of doing research.\u201dLeuphana University practices what it preaches: It has run on renewable energy since 2012, and a planned new research, seminar and conference facility will be a net-zero-emission building. It is being designed by Daniel Libeskind, the American-Polish architect who designed the master plan for the rebuilding of the World Trade Center in New York.Germany\u2019s Research Ministry has also supported collaborations between universities and the private sector. In Berlin, for example, the Technical University is teaming up with Schneider Electric, an electrical-engineering firm, and other companies, to test innovations in electric mobility and urban smart grids on a new campus.The campus is a \u201cliving lab,\u201d said Kai Strunz, a professor of electrical engineering involved in the project. It will eventually employ electrical engineers, computer scientists, mechanical engineers, sociologists, behavioral psychologists and others.To be sure, the steps that universities have taken to support the energy transition have not always been easy.\u201cMany universities had to catch up with the fast tempo of the changes happening,\u201d said Miranda Schreurs, a professor of comparative politics at the Free University Berlin and director of its Environmental Policy Research Center, which advises the government on policy issues.She said German universities have had to overcome rigid departmentalization and turf wars. \u201cThey had to reach out, which was a challenge at first, to collaborate between departments and with nonuniversity actors,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cEngineers had to talk to sociologists, and sociologists had to understand something about applied science.\u201dWhile federal funds have paid for research, they do not necessarily cover the costs of offering new courses or degrees. The budgets for instruction at the University of Freiburg, for example, have remained largely constant, despite the new work in sustainability studies and ever more students. \u201cOur academic staff has taken on a lot of pro bono work because they believe in what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Mr. Adler of the university\u2019s Center for Renewable Energy. \u201cBut they\u2019re heavily taxed by this overload.\u201dDespite the problems, several German academics involved in Energiewende-related work say they have encouraged their counterparts in the United States to follow suit.Mr. Schomerus of Leuphana, for example, has been a guest lecturer at the University of Texas-Pan American for 20 years. His American colleagues and the university\u2019s administration, he said, are \u201cextremely interested\u201d in Germany\u2019s energy experiment and have begun \u201cgreening\u201d their campus.\u201cBut there\u2019s still a big difference,\u201d Mr. Schomerus said. \u201cWhile in Germany sustainability is central to universities today, in the U.S. it\u2019s still something exotic. It hasn\u2019t been integrated into the curriculum and research priorities.\u201dMr. Adler said that the political backgrounds in Germany and the United States were very different. In Germany, for example, there is a broad consensus that hydraulic fracking and nuclear power are not options for the future. The country\u2019s research agenda reflects a commitment to renewable energy and a concern about climate change shared broadly by political parties, academe and the public.\u201cThe priorities are simply different,\u201d said Mr. Adler, who noted, however, that collaboration can take place. He said his university was working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Fraunhofer Center for Sustainable Energy Systems, in Boston, to expand its online master\u2019s program in photovoltaics.\u201cThis is just beginning now\u201d in the United States, said Mr. Schomerus, who thinks that American universities could be a catalyst in promoting the principles of sustainability. Still, German academics could not tell their Americans counterparts \u201cjust to do what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t work. They have to figure out their own way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On the first floor are a living room with tall French windows; a television room with exposed stone walls and a fireplace; and a dining room and a breakfast room, each with a fireplace. The kitchen has half-timbered walls, recessed lights in the floor and ceiling and high-end appliances by Liebherr, Bosch and Mercury.Upstairs, the master bedroom has a chestnut wood floor and a fireplace, as well as an en-suite bathroom with a separate claw-foot tub and a stone wash basin. On the same level are two guest suites, one with a balcony; a library with a parquet floor and a fireplace; and an office. A spiral staircase leads to a third guest suite. There is also a barrel-vaulted studio and a cavernous unfinished attic for storage.Other structures on the property include a former pigeonnier, or pigeon house, that sits atop the arched entrance to the property, and two garages, one of which is attached to the main structure. The grounds include a broad lawn and a swimming pool.The property is about two miles from\u00a0Puy-L\u2019\u00c9v\u00eaque. The Dordogne River valley is about an hour\u2019s drive, as is the airport in Bergerac, which serves some continental destinations including Paris. A larger airport in Toulouse is about an hour and a half away by car.MARKET OVERVIEWThe most desirable areas of the region, which is also known as the P\u00e9rigord, are in the southern Dordogne department, around Sarlat and what is known as the Valley of the Five Chateaux along the Dordogne River. The market extends southward from the river to include the northern parts of the Lot and Lot-et-Garonne departments; properties farther from the river tend to be less expensive, agents said.The range of properties is broad, agents said, with small older homes, perhaps in a village, available for around $500,000. Buyers wanting land and possibly a pool should expect to pay at least $1 million. Significant historic properties with several acres of land in sought-after areas start at about $1.5 million and top out at around $4 million. The few actual chateau in the valley rarely change hands, Mr. de Lafontaine said. Prices have fallen since the recession, with agents citing declines of 10 percent to 40 percent.\u201cIt was crazy, to be honest, in 2007 and 2008,\u201d Mr. de Lafontaine said. \u201cAny property was a million-euro property. The crisis helped put the prices back to where they should be.\u201dMr. Norris said: \u201cLast year was probably the bottom of the slide. We think in 2014 it has started to pick up; we think that\u2019s a reflection of prices that are now very reasonable, good value for money, and also that the economy in the U.K. has started to pick up quite rapidly.\u201d\u00a0WHO BUYS IN THE DORDOGNE REGION?A number of her potential buyers are cross-shopping in Provence, she said, where prices for comparable properties are about a third more expensive.Mr. de Lafontaine said about 70 percent of his clients were French, with the rest from Britain and other Anglophone countries, especially Australia. For French buyers, he said, the appeal of the Dordogne is a historic one \u2014 they can buy a small chateau or old farm and restore it. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a cultural coming back to the region,\u201d he said. While most French buyers come from Paris or other large cities, he said, a small percentage have come to the Dordogne after selling their houses on the Cote d\u2019Azur, seeking more peace and tranquillity. Agents said the majority of their buyers were in their 40s or 50s, and looking for a property that they could eventually use as a retirement home. \u201cIf you buy something here you will want to keep it for your retirement, or you\u2019re already retired,\u201d Mr. de Lafontaine said.\u00a0BUYING BASICSThere are no restrictions on foreign ownership in France. Transactions are handled by a notary, who oversees negotiations, legal documents and tax payments related to the sale. Buyers can choose to retain their own notary and a lawyer, though most agents say this is not necessary.Ms. Pollard of Home Hunts said buyers should budget about 7 percent over the selling price to cover taxes and notary fees. She also cautioned that buyers with complex financial situations should consult with a tax planning specialist, as French inheritance and capital gains taxes can be relatively high.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCIESFrench; euro (1 euro = $1.38)TAXES AND FEESProperty and habitation taxes total about $8,800 (6351 euros) a year, Mr. Norris said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Into Africa: China\u2019s Wild Rush", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 For nearly a decade, as China made a historic push for business opportunities and expanded influence in Africa, most of the continent\u2019s leaders were so thrilled at having a deep-pocketed partner willing to make big investments and start huge new projects that they rarely paused to consider whether they were getting a sound deal.China has peppered the continent with newly built stadiums, airports, hospitals, highways and dams, but as Africans are beginning to fully recognize, these projects have also left many countries saddled with heavy debts and other problems, from environmental conflict to labor strife. As a consequence, China\u2019s relationship with the continent is entering a new and much more skeptical phase.The doubts aren\u2019t coming from any soured feelings from African leaders themselves, most of whom still welcome (and profit from) China\u2019s embrace. The new skepticism has even less to do with the hectoring of Western governments, the traditional source of Africa\u2019s foreign aid and investment (and interference). In a 2012 speech in Senegal, Hillary Rodham Clinton, then secretary of state, implicitly warned Africa about China. The continent needs \u201ca model of sustainable partnership that adds value, rather than extracts it,\u201d she said, adding that unlike other countries, \u201cAmerica will stand up for democracy and universal human rights even when it might be easier to look the other way and keep the resources flowing.\u201dSome Africans found Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks patronizing. What\u2019s most remarkable, however, is how pass\u00e9 this now seems, given skepticism about China from Africa\u2019s own increasingly vibrant civil society, which is demanding to know what China\u2019s billions of dollars in infrastructure building, mineral extraction and land acquisition mean for the daily lives and political rights of ordinary Africans.This represents a tricky and unfamiliar challenge for China\u2019s authoritarian system, whose foreign policy has always focused heavily on state-to-state relations. China\u2019s leaders demonstrate little appreciation of the yawning gulfs that separate African people from their rulers, even in newly democratic countries. Beijing is constitutionally uneasy about dealing with independent actors like advocacy groups, labor unions and independent journalists.After a decade of bland talk about \u201cwin-win\u201d partnerships, China seems finally aware that it needs to improve both the style and substance of its push into Africa. Last week, at the start of a four-country African trip, Prime Minister Li Keqiang acknowledged \u201cgrowing pains\u201d in the relationship, and the need to \u201cassure our African friends in all seriousness that China will never pursue a colonialist path like some countries did, or allow colonialism, which belongs to the past, to reappear in Africa.\u201dThis language came in belated response to a sea change that arguably began with an op-ed essay last year in The Financial Times by Lamido Sanusi, who was recently suspended as Nigeria\u2019s central bank governor. He wrote: \u201cIn much of Africa, they have set up huge mining operations. They have also built infrastructure. But, with exceptions, they have done so using equipment and labor imported from home, without transferring skills to local communities. So China takes our primary goods and sells us manufactured ones. This was also the essence of colonialism.\u201dMr. Sanusi\u2019s commentary prompted critical assessments of China\u2019s involvement in countries like Botswana and Namibia, over issues like the takeover of local construction industries, or the proper execution of building projects, working conditions, and the proliferation of Chinese newcomers \u2014 many of them illegal migrants \u2014 who have begun to dominate low-level commerce in a number of countries.In Ghana, an estimated 50,000 new migrants, most of whom are said to have hailed from a single county in southern China, showed up recently to conduct environmentally devastating gold mining. This set off a popular outcry that forced the Ghanaian government to respond, resulting in arrests of miners, many of whom are being expelled to China.In Tanzania, labor unions that have historically been close to the ruling party have strongly criticized the government for opening the floodgates to Chinese petty traders.In Senegal, neighborhood associations blocked a giant property deal that would have handed over a prime section of downtown real estate to a Chinese developer with a scant track record.Independent media have played an important role in demanding more scrutiny of government deals with Beijing. A recent op-ed article in one of Kenya\u2019s leading newspapers, The Daily Nation, questioned whether a huge new Chinese investment in a railroad that would run from the coast all the way to landlocked Uganda and beyond was truly a good deal. The project\u2019s first phase will increase Kenya\u2019s external debt by a third.The writer, David Ndii, noted that Kenya could have sought the financing for a project like this through the World Bank, which would have cost as little as a third of the Chinese commercial loan. But that would have required time-consuming processes, from competitive bidding to rigorous environmental and feasibility studies. Kenya\u2019s Constitution insists on \u201cintergenerational equity,\u201d but also requires that \u201cpublic money be used in a prudent and responsible manner.\u201d Mr. Ndii asked whether the deal with the Chinese was consistent with either provision.As someone who recently spent a year traveling widely in Africa to research a book about Beijing\u2019s relations with the continent, I find Mr. Sanusi\u2019s assessment too pessimistic. Yet a dose of caution for Africa, and of public scrutiny about the high-level deal-making underway, was clearly long overdue.The booming, fast-changing China offers potentially extraordinary upsides to Africa. Without question, the continent is badly in need of more and better infrastructure. Competition among foreign investors holds the prospect of better returns for African states. Immigration, which is the central topic of my own reporting, has begun to create serious tensions between China and its new African partners, but even this is insufficiently recognized for its potential dividends. The spread of trading and business diasporas throughout history, including that of China, have a deep and proven track record for wealth creation, and properly managed, this could prove true for Africa as well.But because China seems to be in such a hurry, and is so often seen to be looking out for itself, the potential downsides for many Africans have begun more and more to stand out: accelerated environmental destruction via mining and other activities; disregard for labor rights; the hollowing out of local industry; and even the stalling of the continent\u2019s democratization.This isn\u2019t simply a matter of Beijing\u2019s doing business with odious dictators, whether Omar al-Bashir of Sudan or Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe. From Zaire to Equatorial Guinea to Rwanda, the West clearly has its own deep and insufficiently acknowledged history of doing much the same.Rather, the problem (though not limited to China) is relying on shady arrangements made at the very top of the political system, often in the president\u2019s office itself. Contracts are greased with monetary bribes and other enticements like expense-paid shopping trips to China and scholarships there for elite children. Adding to the opacity, China typically favors its state-owned companies for African projects and bypasses open, competitive bidding procedures.The best way for the United States and other rich countries that have economic and political interests in Africa to respond is not by warning Africans about the advance of China \u2014 but rather, helping to strengthen African civil society and, thereby, governance. Washington should also encourage China and other up-and-coming players in the international economy, from Brazil to Turkey to Vietnam, to abide by higher transparency standards \u2014 and to rigorously abide by them, too.In the end, though, what will minimize any downsides of China\u2019s involvement in Africa is the deepening of African democracy. Grass-roots activism and vibrant independent media are, everywhere, the ultimate check on corrupt legislators and on foreigners who get lucrative but unsound deals by handing over bags of cash.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fine Line Seen in U.S. Spying on Companies", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The National Security Agency has never said what it was seeking when it invaded the computers of Petrobras, Brazil\u2019s huge national oil company, but angry Brazilians have guesses: the company\u2019s troves of data on Brazil\u2019s offshore oil reserves, or perhaps its plans for allocating licenses for exploration to foreign companies. Nor has the N.S.A. said what it intended when it got deep into the computer systems of China Telecom, one of the largest providers of mobile phone and Internet services in Chinese cities. But documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former agency contractor now in exile in Russia, leave little doubt that the main goal was to learn about Chinese military units, whose members cannot resist texting on commercial networks. The agency\u2019s interest in Huawei, the giant Chinese maker of Internet switching equipment, and Pacnet, the Hong Kong-based operator of undersea fiber optic cables, is more obvious: Once inside those companies\u2019 proprietary technology, the N.S.A. would have access to millions of daily conversations and emails that never touch American shores. Then there is Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the antitrust commissioner of the European Commission. He runs no company, but has punished many, including Microsoft and Intel, and just reached a tentative accord with Google that will greatly change how it operates in Europe. In each of these cases, American officials insist, when speaking off the record, that the United States was never acting on behalf of specific American companies. But the government does not deny it routinely spies to advance American economic advantage, which is part of its broad definition of how it protects American national security. In short, the officials say, while the N.S.A. cannot spy on Airbus and give the results to Boeing, it is free to spy on European or Asian trade negotiators and use the results to help American trade officials \u2014 and, by extension, the American industries and workers they are trying to bolster. Now, every one of the examples of N.S.A. spying on corporations around the world is becoming Exhibit A in China\u2019s argument that by indicting five members of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, the Obama administration is giving new meaning to capitalistic hypocrisy. In the Chinese view, the United States has designed its own system of rules about what constitutes \u201clegal\u201d spying and what is illegal. That definition, the Chinese contend, is intended to benefit an American economy built around the sanctity of intellectual property belonging to private firms. And, in their mind, it is also designed to give the N.S.A. the broadest possible rights to intercept phone calls or email messages of state-owned companies from China to Saudi Arabia, or even private firms that are involved in activities the United States considers vital to its national security, with no regard to local laws. The N.S.A. says it observes American law around the globe, but admits that local laws are no obstacle to its operations.\u201cChina demands that the U.S. give it a clear explanation of its cybertheft, bugging and monitoring activities, and immediately stop such activity,\u201d the Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement released on Tuesday. It was part of a broad Chinese effort to equate what China\u2019s Unit 61398 does \u2014 the cyberwar operation named in the indictment of five unit members that was announced Monday \u2014 with what the N.S.A. does.Petrobras is a case in point. In the American view, Brazilian energy policy is made inside the state-run company, which is indistinguishable from the government. Thus, under the same rationale that the United States intercepted the phone calls of the country\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff, it had the authority, as a collector of foreign intelligence, to delve inside the company. Ms. Rousseff, denouncing the N.S.A. at the United Nations last September, said that the agency\u2019s activities amounted to \u201ca breach of international law and an affront\u201d to Brazil\u2019s sovereignty.In fact, state-run oil companies are a fascination to the N.S.A. just as American high-tech firms are a Chinese obsession. State oil companies in Saudi Arabia, Africa, Iran and Mexico have often been intelligence targets for the United States. American officials say that digging inside corporations for insights into economic policy is different from actually stealing corporate secrets.\u201cWhat we do not do, as we have said many times,\u201d James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, said after some of the initial N.S.A. revelations last year, \u201cis use our foreign intelligence capabilities to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of \u2014 or give intelligence we collect to \u2014 U.S. companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line.\u201d One reason for that policy, officials say, is that unlike the Chinese they would not know which companies to help: Apple but not Dell? Google but not Yahoo?But in the case of Mr. Almunia, the stream of data intercepted by the N.S.A. was most likely highly company-specific. Mr. Almunia was dealing with antitrust issues involving Apple, Motorola Mobility, Intel and Microsoft. It is unclear what, if anything, those companies gleaned from American officials who had access to the resulting intelligence. But former intelligence officials say the companies are walled off from any intelligence that might help them compete.American officials sometimes dig into corporations because they are suspected to be witting or unwitting suppliers of technology to the North Koreans or the Iranians. Siemens, the German telecommunications firm, was the chief supplier of the factory controllers that ran the centrifuges in Iran\u2019s main nuclear enrichment plant at Natanz. The Stuxnet computer worm, designed by the United States and Israel, was designed to attack Siemens equipment \u2014 and it has never been clear whether the company knew that its machines were under American and Israeli attack. But in that case, American officials could argue that national security, not corporate competitiveness, was the goal. In contrast, when Unit 61398 went after Westinghouse and Alcoa, it was to steal trade secrets and strategies to enter the Chinese market.But other elements of the indictment, some outside experts say, could give the Chinese the opportunity to turn the rationale of the Justice Department against its own government. Some of the supposed Chinese online espionage against the United Steelworkers union and a solar energy firm, SolarWorld, appeared intended to gain intelligence about trade complaints. Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who served in the Justice Department under the George W. Bush administration, wrote on the Lawfare blog on Tuesday that that \u201csounds a lot like the kind of cybersnooping on firms that the United States does.\u201d Andrew W. Lehren contributed reporting from New York and James Glanz from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukraine Faces Hurdles in Restoring Its Farming Legacy", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUkraine was once the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, known for its rich soil where grain, sunflowers and livestock flourish. The village of\u00a0Zibolky is the site of a former Soviet collective farm, where crops and livestock were farmed.\u00a0ZIBOLKY, Ukraine \u2014 Like many of her neighbors in this old Soviet collective farm, Maria Onysko prefers to be paid in grain instead of cash for the modest plot of land she rents out.\u201cI have two cows and four pigs, many chickens,\u201d said Ms. Onysko, 62. \u201cSo we use it for them.\u201dAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, farmland in newly independent Ukraine was divided among villagers, acre by acre, creating a patchwork of agricultural endeavors that are often inefficient or unprofitable. Some land is rented to fruit growers, grain operators or large-scale farming businesses. Some locals work small plots on their own. Some acreage sits fallow, stuck in legal limbo after the owner has died.Ukraine was once the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, known for its rich soil where grain, sunflowers and livestock flourished. But farming production dropped sharply in the chaotic decade after the collapse of communism, and recovery has come in fits and starts. Production is only now returning to peak levels of the 1990s, stymied by the corruption, red tape and inefficiencies that have plagued the broader Ukrainian economy for years and left the villagers living humble existences.The potential became clear last year when a strong harvest helped Ukraine avoid a drop in output. \u201cIt was just because of agriculture,\u201d said Pavlo Sheremeta, Ukraine\u2019s minister of economic development. \u201cOtherwise, it would have been a decline.\u201dAgainst the backdrop of the crisis with Russia, Western interests are pressing for change. The European Union is moving forward with a plan to bolster trade by lifting custom duties on Ukrainian agriculture. As part of a deal with the International Monetary Fund for up to $18 billion in loans, the country\u2019s government must push through business reforms that would help alleviate the problems with farming and other businesses.The hope is that such initiatives will also bolster the confidence of foreign investors as the crisis abates. Big multinationals have expressed tentative interest in Ukrainian agriculture, but they have largely remained on the sidelines, unwilling to invest in an industry hampered by structural deficiencies and, more recently, the uncertainty with its eastern neighbor.\u201cIf cheap capital comes in along with foreign investment, and you have a good government without roadblocks, Ukraine can close to double its production in the future,\u201d said Roman Fedorowycz, a Ukrainian-American who returned here years ago and now runs a farming company that grows mainly corn, sunflowers and soybeans.Even small improvements would make a big difference in a highly inefficient industry starved for money. While roughly 70 percent of Ukraine\u2019s land is considered suitable for agriculture, it has not been fully cultivated. The country\u2019s yield per hectare of grain is about half that of the United States, according to the World Bank.Change won\u2019t come easy, given the challenges. Previous governments have tried to restrict what crops farmers grow and when they rotate crops, as well as limiting exports. Some state inspectors lack cars to conduct on-site inspections, so farmers must bring grain to them before shipping.Selling farmland is also forbidden in Ukraine, a legacy of its communist past. So fields remain cut up \u201clike chessboards,\u201d said Georgiy Vaydanych, land manager for Agrokultura, a Stockholm-based agricultural company that rents 173,000 acres in many such villages. \u201cFor the moment we have 40,000 active landlords,\u201d Mr. Vaydanych said. \u201cForty thousand!\u201dMaking matters worse, paperwork is costly and many villagers never officially inherit the farmland after their parents die. \u201cThere is uncertainty on how to farm this land, because we have the dead souls in the middle of our fields,\u201d Mr. Vaydanych said, in a reference to Nikolai Gogol, whose 19th-century classic, \u201cDead Souls,\u201d is required school reading here.Even as the crisis in the east intensifies, life in the agricultural west remains much the same.A dirt road straddling tilled fields leads into this village, with potholes so deep that drivers zigzag past each other. There are horse-drawn carts, roosters crowing, elderly women in kerchiefs and a church painted pale green topped by bulbous spires.Few in this pro-European area of Ukraine are nostalgic for Moscow. Still, Oleg Gusak, head of the village council, said life had not improved.\u201cWhen it was a collective, the level of life was better,\u201d he said, explaining that it was once a larger operation that harvested crops, had livestock and made clothing, furniture and jams.\u201cPeople even came from other regions, because we had so much work,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cNow, it\u2019s not the same.\u201dTrouble raising capital at reasonable prices makes it difficult to start or expand farms.\u201cI have to pay up to 12 percent if I borrow in euros,\u201d said Taras Barshchovsky, an entrepreneur who founded T.B. Fruit, which makes fruit juices and whose rented orchards cover thousands of acres. He has expanded into Poland, where he said he could borrow for less than 3 percent.\u201cThose who work with Ukrainian banks in hryvnias,\u201d the national currency, \u201cthey pay up to 20 percent or more. I don\u2019t believe you can profit and return money on that percentage,\u201d he added.And while other former Soviet bloc neighbors like Hungary, Romania and Poland began easing their land sale restrictions after joining the European Union, Ukraine has repeatedly delayed lifting its moratorium, considering the move politically risky in its agrarian society. In 2013, the government of Viktor Yanukovych, the deposed Ukrainian leader, extended the moratorium until 2016, after he expected to stand for re-election.\u201cI\u2019m afraid if I sell my land in the future my children will say their old grandfather drank away all their money,\u201d Hrynchyshyn Myroslaw, 62, said as he cleared a willow field near another village.With a laugh, he added: \u201cIt depends how much you will pay me. If there are enough zeros, you can pay me.\u201dVolodymyr Baran, 43, a tractor mechanic, said he would never sell his six acres: \u201cThe land is our bread.\u201dSuch dynamics deter foreign investment, which has been tepid for years. Despite some interest from China and multinationals, large agricultural enterprises tend to be Ukrainian owned, and recent prominent deals have been less than they seemed. For example, Cargill paid a reported $200 million for a stake in UkrLandFarming, an agricultural holding company. But a Cargill spokeswoman emphasized that the shares were collateral for a loan rather than a long-term investment.The rules make \u201cit so much more difficult to understand, and to bring in investment,\u201d said David Sedik, a senior official at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. \u201cIt\u2019s not that a foreigner or a company has to buy the land, but it breeds opaqueness in the sector. You need transparent land laws.\u201dAt his office, Mr. Vaydanych pulled out a village map and showed how its 2,500 acres were divvied up among 507 villagers.\u201cEvery field is split, by little, little plots,\u201d he explained.Being a land manager requires a political touch. Mr. Vaydanych goes from village to village handing out favors, fending off competitors trying to outbid his rental contracts.A village chief, he said, \u201cmay call us and tell us, it\u2019s the wintertime, we have a lot of snowfall, so give us a forklift to clean the road. O.K., well, we do that.\u201d\u201cHe may say this electricity substation is broken so we need urgently to repair it, or he\u2019s calling because the water pump at school broke, so we replace it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the commitment that comes with the land.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised by any request,\u201d Mr. Vaydanych said. \u201cIt is about keeping everyone happy. That\u2019s my work.\u201dSofiia Kochmar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Africa", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cAlways use the word \u2018Africa\u2019 or \u2018Darkness\u2019 or \u2018Safari\u2019 in your title,\u201d Wainaina advised. \u201cNever have a picture of a well-adjusted African on the cover of your book, or in it, unless that African has won the Nobel Prize. An AK-47, prominent ribs, naked breasts: use these. If you must include an African, make sure you get one in Masai or Zulu or Dogon dress.\u201dWainaina had other tips: The people in said book should be depicted as hungry, suffering, simple or dead. The children should have distended bellies and flies on their faces. The animals, on the other hand, should be depicted as wise and filled with family values. Elephants are caring and good feminists. So are gorillas. Be sure to show how profoundly you are moved by the continent and its woes, and how much it has penetrated your soul. End with a quote from Nelson Mandela involving rainbows. Because you care. There\u2019s been something similarly distorted to some of the social media reactions to the Boko Haram atrocities over the past week. It\u2019s great that the kidnappings and the massacres are finally arousing the world\u2019s indignation. But sometimes the implication of the conversation has been this: Africa is this dark and lawless place where monstrous things are bound to happen. Those poor people need our help.But this is more or less the opposite of the truth. Boko Haram is not the main story in Africa or even in Nigeria. It is a small rear-guard reaction to the main story. The main story in Africa is an impressive surge of growth, urbanization and modernization, which has sparked panic in a few people who don\u2019t like these things.Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa are growing at a phenomenal clip. Nigeria\u2019s economy grew by 6.7 percent in 2012. Mozambique\u2019s grew by 7.4 percent, Ghana\u2019s by 7.9 percent. Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa as a whole is predicted to reach 5.2 percent this year. Investment funds are starting up by the dozen, finding local entrepreneurs. In 2011, roughly 60 million African households earned at least $3,000 a year. By next year, more than 100 million households will make that much. Trade between Africa and the rest of the world has increased by 200 percent since 2000. Since 1996, the poverty rate has fallen by 1 percent per year. Life expectancies are shooting up.Only about a third of this new wealth is because of commodities. Nations like Ethiopia and Rwanda, which have no oil wealth, are growing phenomenally. The bulk is because of economic reforms, increased productivity, increased urbanization and the fact that in many countries political systems are becoming marginally less dysfunctional. Africa should not be seen as merely the basket case continent where students, mission trips and celebrities can go to do good work. It has become the test case of 21st-century modernity. It is the place where the pace of modernization is fast, and where the forces that resist modernization are mounting a daring reaction. We are seeing three distinct clashes. They\u2019re happening all over the world, but they exist in bold contrast in Africa. The first is the clash over pluralism. Africa has seen an explosion of cellphone usage. It\u2019s seen a rapid expansion of urbanization. In 1980, only 28 percent of Africans lived in cities, but today 40 percent do. This has led to a greater mixing of tribal groupings, religions and a loosening of lifestyle options. The draconian anti-gay laws in Nigeria, Uganda, Burundi and many other countries are one reaction against this cosmopolitan trend. The second is a clash over human development. Over the past decade, secondary school enrollment in Africa has increased by 50 percent. This contributes to an increasing value on intellectual openness, as people seek liberty to furnish their own minds. The Boko Haram terrorists are massacring and kidnapping people \u2014 mostly girls \u2014 at schools to try to force people to submit to a fantasy version of the past. The third is the clash over governance. Roughly 80 percent of Africa\u2019s workers labor in the informal sector. That\u2019s because the formal governmental and regulatory structures are biased toward the connected and the rich, not based on impersonal rule of law. Many Africans are trying to replace old practices with competent governance. They are creating new ways to navigate between the formal and informal sectors.Too many of our images of Africa are derived from nature documentaries, fund-raising appeals and mission trips. In reality, Africa faces in acute forms the same problems that afflict pretty much every region these days. Most important: Individual and social creativity is zooming ahead. Governing institutions are failing to perform the basic, elementary tasks. Advertisement"}

The three- to five-minute shorts will explain concepts in five areas: markets, money, globalization, inequality, and debt and credit.\u201cWe want to have a real impact by taking something abstract \u2014 something that people are embarrassed to admit they don\u2019t know much about or don\u2019t have time to thoroughly understand \u2014 and make it more concrete,\u201d said Carole Tomko, Vulcan\u2019s creative director and general manager.Directors and writers who have signed up to participate include Gary Ross (\u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d), Catherine Hardwicke (\u201cTwilight\u201d), Mary Harron (\u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d), Akiva Goldsman (\u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d) and Mr. Spurlock. Roughly 10 economic advisers have agreed to help vet information, including Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Cinelan, a film company co-founded by Mr. Spurlock, will distribute the shorts in a single burst in the fall through the Internet, on-demand systems and mobile platforms. A related educational curriculum will be made available to schools.

Improves, Poll Finds", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe results, part of Pew\u2019s annual survey of attitudes toward the bloc, were another sign that the project for European integration, conceived more than six decades ago as an effort to bind a continent together after World War II, has become, for many Europeans, a symbol of unwelcome meddling and of economic mismanagement.Even so, the poll showed that a median 52 percent of people surveyed held positive views of the union as economic conditions have improved. That represented a rise of six percentage points from 2013.\u201cThe euro crisis that began in 2008 dealt a savage blow to the image of the European Union,\u201d the report said. But there has \u201cbeen a marked decline in hopelessness\u201d and \u201ca new public sense that the worst is now over.\u201dThe poll, conducted among 7,022 adults in Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland and Spain from March 17 to April 9, was released by Pew 10 days before elections that will be the first under the Lisbon Treaty, which went into force in 2009. The poll, done by telephone and in person, has margins of sampling error that range between plus or minus three and four percentage points, depending on the country.The Lisbon Treaty gave the European Parliament additional powers, including the right to veto international agreements with countries like the United States. It also suggested a greater role for the Parliament, the only institution that runs the union that is directly elected, in selecting the next president of the European Commission. The commission, which is based in Brussels, proposes laws in broad areas including climate protection and financial services.To bolster interest in the elections, which will be held from May 22 to 25, the Parliament has named leading candidates for the presidency of the commission and the candidates have held live televised debates and public rallies. But the results of the Pew poll suggested that low voter-participation rates could continue. Turnout declined to slightly above 40 percent five years ago, from more than 60 percent a quarter of a century earlier.In the Pew survey, 36 percent of Europeans surveyed said they saw the Parliament in a favorable light.The poll called Germany \u201ca nation apart,\u201d where respondents were far more likely than those from other countries to say their economy was doing well or to say that their prosperity had been strengthened by membership in the union.But more than half of Germans agreed that the bloc does not understand the needs of German citizens, and Pew said that may explain why half of the Germans surveyed, compared with 44 percent last year, were opposed to giving more decision-making powers to the union to deal with economic problems.The only country to show an increase in support for transferring more authority to Brussels was Poland, where 44 percent of respondents were favorable, compared with 38 percent last year.The qualms about giving more responsibility to Brussels are somewhat at odds with the stance taken by Martin Schulz, a German Social Democrat and a candidate for the commission\u2019s presidency, who has called for reinforcing the role of the union as a means to deepening economic integration and defending the bloc against foreign competition.Jean-Claude Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg and the center-right candidate for the presidency of the commission, has said that some powers could eventually be transferred back to member states like Britain, where 76 percent of those surveyed said they opposed giving more power to the bloc. Mr. Juncker has also called for simpler regulation.France, which showed the strongest gain in positive attitudes toward the union, also showed that issues like immigration are divisive, a factor that could help the far-right National Front in the coming election.Nearly 60 percent of those surveyed in France favored tighter restrictions on immigration, and nearly 30 percent were unfavorable to Muslims, according to the poll.\u201cThe fact that anti-Muslim sentiment is strongest among people on the right of the spectrum helps explain some of the appeal of the National Front in France and the populist, Euroskeptic parties in a number of other countries,\u201d said Bruce Stokes, director of global economic attitudes for Pew.The deepest discontent with the bloc was in countries hit hardest by the crisis, including Italy and Greece, where high levels of resentment against immigration and minorities have also bolstered support for extremist groups.In Greece, 47 percent of those surveyed expressed anti-Jewish sentiments, and a slightly higher percentage expressed negative views of Roma and Muslims. In Italy, an overwhelming majority of those surveyed were critical of Muslims and Roma.Advertisement"}

Utilities stocks typically pay big dividends and have been popular with investors as bond yields have fallen this year, said Kristina Hooper, United States investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors. \u201cInvestors have been starved, when it comes to traditional sources of income,\u201d Ms. Hooper said.Financial stocks were the day\u2019s biggest losers.

Other banks with big bond-trading businesses, such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, also fell.Among the stocks on the move, Tyson Foods slumped $4.21, or 9.9 percent, to $38.44 after its outlook for full-year earnings fell short of analysts\u2019 predictions.The drug maker Pfizer fell 79 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $29.96 after it said that its first-quarter profit had dropped 15 percent despite sharp cost-cutting. The decline reflected competition from cheaper generic drugs. Pfizer has been trying unsuccessfully since January to get its British rival, AstraZeneca, to discuss Pfizer\u2019s offer to buy the company.Walgreen rose 99 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $69.85 after reporting revenue from established drugstores jumped 7.6 percent last month, topping analysts\u2019 predictions. Sales were helped by a later Easter.In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, said Monday that its service sector index rose to 55.2 in April from 53.1 in March. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.A measure of sales and production in the institute\u2019s report surged 7.5 points to 60.9 and a gauge of new orders jumped 4.8 points to 58.2. Both are the highest since August. The increase in new orders suggests business will continue to grow in the coming months.In the bond market, interest rates edged up Monday.

It was the era of the Haymarket riots and Upton Sinclair\u2019s \u201cThe Jungle.\u201d Workers staged 1,500 strikes in 1886 alone.Ultimately, though, the disparities in wealth and income led to an age of ferment that came to be known as the Progressive Era.And crucially, a progressive federal income tax was enacted by Constitutional amendment, overcoming the opposition of not only the steel lobby and the establishment press, but a Supreme Court that had struck down the income tax law of 1894 as unconstitutional.\u201cThe present assault on capital is but the beginning,\u201d wrote Justice Stephen J. Field in a concurring opinion against the 1894 law. \u201cIt will be but the steppingstone to others, larger and more sweeping, till our political contests will become a war of the poor against the rich; a war constantly growing in intensity and bitterness.\u201dThe United States has come a long way over the last century. Still, it remains a strikingly similar place in a couple of important respects.The income of a typical American family has barely risen since the 1970s. The share of national income captured by the richest 1 percent of Americans is even higher than it was at the dawn of the 20th century.Basic models of political economy hold that inequality self-corrects. As income concentrates among a smaller group of voters, majorities will vote for more redistribution.But that isn\u2019t quite how the world works. For starters, the poor vote less than the rich. And they don\u2019t vote exclusively based on their economic self-interest. Many Americans, rich or poor, mistrust government. They support free-market capitalism and view the distribution of the nation\u2019s economic fruits as roughly fair.What\u2019s more, disparities in income seem to produce political polarization and gridlock, which tend to favor those who receive a better deal from the prevailing rules, says Francesco Trebbi, an expert on political economy at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.The American political system may eventually act against the interests of the fortunate few at the very top of the pyramid of success. But that may be only because many affluent, powerful people just below the top notch see themselves as losers from the nation\u2019s economic dynamics.\u201cThe really upset people are those that are well in the top of the distribution,\u201d said Nolan McCarty, a political scientist at Princeton. \u201cThere could be a populist uprising, but that is less likely than a battle within the top 1 percent.\u201dThis is, indeed, reminiscent of the Progressive movement, which was led not by pitchfork-wielding populists, but by lawyers, college professors and others in the upper middle class who saw their future prosperity and social standing at risk.\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been the immiseration you would associate with a revolution,\u201d Professor McCarty said. \u201cBut people are concerned about fairness and the way the game has been rigged.\u201dIs this alignment of forces enough to stop America\u2019s income chasm from growing?Historical precedent, however, doesn\u2019t justify unbridled optimism. For all the egalitarian initiatives of the Progressive Era, it did little to curb the concentration of income at the top.\u201cThe Progressive era established the basic grammar and vocabulary and syntax of the American policy discussion for a century,\u201d said David Kennedy, the prominent Stanford historian. \u201cAll the main themes of equity and access to democratic institutions and workplace regulations came up then.\u201dBut in terms of real redistribution, Professor Kennedy added, \u201crelatively little was accomplished.\u201dThe bold new income tax affected only a tiny share of Americans. And while the top rate for a married couple was 7 percent, to reach it they had to make more than $500,000, nearly $12 million in 2014 dollars. In 1913, it raised a grand total of $28 million, a mere $668 million in today\u2019s dollars.Justifying hefty taxation of the wealthy required a more compelling argument than inequality. The immiseration caused by the Great Depression helped. But winning the argument required war. Only the prospect of many thousands of poor young men contributing their lives to the national project could justify taking more of the elite\u2019s money in the service of the national good.\u201cThe idea was conscription of wealth and income,\u201d said Kenneth Scheve, a political scientist at Stanford. \u201cThe term was used in party manifestos, in speeches to Congress. It came up everywhere.\u201dBut what does this historical precedent say about our ability to deal with inequality today?Is this as good as it gets? For all the struggle on the part of the White House, the income gap keeps growing. Maybe this means that, in the absence of war, democracy can\u2019t do much more.Email: eporter@nytimes.com;\nTwitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}

That is a particularly worrisome fact at a time when more young people are entering the job market than ever before.Global unemployment remained stuck at 6 percent in 2013. In the developed world, long-term unemployment continued to rise, and in Africa and Asia, informal employment accounted for as much of 50 percent of all jobs.Take India, for instance. One million Indians are due to join the labor market every month for the next 15 years. But the nation\u2019s economic growth rate sank to 4.8 percent in 2013 and is expected to inch to just 5 percent this year.The report, prepared by the U.N.'s Department of Economic and Social Affairs, cited notable trouble spots. The Russian economy, it said, is expected to grow very slowly in 2014, adding that \u201cthe conflict around Crimea and the possibility of economic sanctions targeting broader sectors of the Russian economy have led to a massive outflow of capital and further weakening of business and consumer confidence.\u201dDisruptions to Libya\u2019s oil output will probably dampen North Africa\u2019s growth.

{"Headline": "E.U. Debates Which Nation Will Regulate Web Privacy ", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rules, which have been discussed since 2012, would be stricter than those in the United States. They would create one law across the European Union to protect several aspects of online privacy, which is enshrined as a fundamental right in Europe, including restrictions on what information could be shipped overseas. And they would impose multimillion-dollar fines on any company that misuses Europeans\u2019 data.Still, a crucial question remains: Which European regulator will have the final say in enforcing the rules?Under the proposals, companies will be able to operate throughout the region if they fulfill the requirements \u2014 and the interpretation \u2014 of European rules from only one country\u2019s privacy authority. Companies currently must comply with the regulator in each of the 28 countries in the union in which they operate.Lawmakers in favor of the proposals say that leaving the oversight with one country\u2019s office gives companies more clarity about the rules. But consumer groups in Europe have warned that if the current proposal stands, technology companies \u2014 including American giants like Microsoft, Amazon and Google \u2014 could set up shop in the European country with the most lenient interpretation of data privacy.\u201cThis issue has become more political than technical,\u201d said Raegan MacDonald, European policy manager for the digital rights group Access in Brussels. \u201cWho gets to decide on these matters is very important.\u201dThe legislation is expected to be completed in the first half of next year. It has gained momentum since the revelations from Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, about the spying activities of American and British intelligence agencies. Before the rules go into effect, though, each country in the union must reach a final agreement with the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive arm, and the European Parliament.The proposals build on existing rules from the 1990s, providing citizens with greater control over what data is collected, where it is kept, and which companies and governments have access to it. The rules also restrict what information can be sent to countries that do not replicate Europe\u2019s data protection laws.To police the new rules, international companies with European customers \u2014 even if they do not have offices in the region \u2014 would have to comply with the controls or face fines totaling 2 to 5 percent of their global revenue, or $137 million, whichever is greater.\u201cThe reforms in Europe will affect companies\u2019 global operations,\u201d said Wim Nauwelaerts, a data protection partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams in Brussels. \u201cThe fines are Europe\u2019s big stick to ensure people take this seriously.\u201dFaced with the prospect of tougher privacy rules, companies like Facebook and eBay have lobbied hard since the proposals were first outlined to limit the legislation\u2019s impact, saying that Europe was creating strict laws that make it difficult for companies to invest in the region\u2019s lackluster economy.Industry groups have raised fears that the new laws would add extra costs, because companies must explicitly tell consumers on a regular basis how their data is used, and limit what information is sent to countries that do not comply with Europe\u2019s privacy rules. Yet companies have supported giving one regulator sole control over interpreting European rules. That, they say, adds regulatory certainty because companies will be responsible to just one authority across the region.\u201cWe\u2019re concerned that the new rules will remain as fragmented as they are today, but it will cost more to comply,\u201d said John Higgins, director general of Digital Europe, a trade body in Brussels whose members include Microsoft and Apple.Some national governments, however, have balked at these changes. Countries like Germany believe their domestic privacy rules, which are some of the most stringent in the world, may be watered down if other regulators gain greater control.European lawmakers also have criticized the rules because citizens may not have the money, or even the language skills, to bring complaints against companies in other European countries.This so-called right to be forgotten, which is an important part of Europe\u2019s new data protection legislation, allows individuals \u2014 European Union citizens and others \u2014 to force global tech companies to remove links to their past activities, as long as people are not deemed to be public figures like celebrities or politicians.\u201cData protection can\u2019t survive on a national level,\u201d said Peter Schaar, a former federal data protection commissioner in Germany. \u201cWe need to have an international approach.\u201dIf the final privacy decisions will eventually rest with an individual regulator, many consumer groups expect Ireland to become the de facto arbiter on privacy matters for the union. Many American technology companies are based in Ireland because of low tax rates, and digital rights advocates say that Ireland is already known for taking a more moderate view on online privacy issues than are regulators in places like Germany and France.Others have called on individual countries\u2019 regulators to continue to play a role by acting as intermediaries between individuals and the privacy authority that holds the main responsibility for policing each company. That, industry lobbyists say, may lead to national regulators\u2019 continuing to vie for control over privacy matters, despite regulatory efforts to make it easier to deal with individual complaints.Whatever the outcome, European politicians say their policies will have more bite than the current rules \u2014 as well as those on the books in the United States. \u201cLobbyists need to understand that we\u2019re creating a global digital standard,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German politician and a leading supporter of the new privacy rules. \u201cThis is important for all of our citizens.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Retail Sales Rise Slightly, Far Below Expectations", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Retail sales barely rose in April, tempering hopes of a sharp acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that retail sales edged up 0.1 percent last month, held back by declines in receipts at furniture, electronic and appliance stores, as well as restaurants and bars, and online retailers.Retail sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, rose by a revised 1.5 percent in March. That was the largest increase since March 2010 and reflected pent-up demand after a brutally cold winter.\u201cYou really had a spectacular March,\u201d said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Conn. \u201cYou are now having an April hangover. The reality of the economy is decent but not great.\u201dEconomists had forecast sales\u2019 advancing 0.4 percent last month after a previously reported 1.2 percent surge in March.Data like employment, as well as manufacturing and services industries surveys, had suggested the economy regained strength early in the second quarter. Growth was held down to a 0.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter by bad weather and a slow pace of restocking by businesses.However, growth will probably be revised down to show a contraction. A second report from the Commerce Department showed that retail inventories excluding automobile stocks barely rose in March.The government had assumed a big increase in these stocks when it made its advance growth estimates last month for gross domestic product. March trade, construction spending and factory inventory data, which the government did not have in hand for the G.D.P. estimate, have also suggested downward revisions to output.In April, a gauge of consumer spending slipped and economists said the economy\u2019s weak performance at the start of the year had probably made households more careful about spending.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that consumers are being a bit more cautious in their spending habits as they await confirmation that the economy is, in fact, poised to reaccelerate,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Mich.So-called core sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the G.D.P., dipped 0.1 percent in April.That followed a revised 1.3 percent advance in March. Core retail sales had previously been reported to have risen 0.8 percent in March.In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices fell 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in March. Economists had forecast prices to be up 0.3 percent last month. In the 12 months through April, import prices fell 0.3 percent.Last month, retail sales were restrained by a 2.3 percent drop in receipts at electronics and appliance stores. Sales at furniture stores fell 0.6 percent, while receipts at food and drinking spots dropped 0.9 percent.Sales at nonstore retailers, which include online sales, fell 0.9 percent.Receipts at building materials and garden equipment stores rose 0.4 percent, however, and sales at auto dealerships increased 0.6 percent. There were also increases in sales at gasoline stations, reflecting higher pump prices.Excluding gasoline and autos, retail sales fell 0.1 percent.Receipts at clothing stores rose 1.2 percent.

{"Headline": "Once Bustling, Syria\u2019s Fractured Railroad Is a Testament to Shattered Ambitions", "Date": "2014-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDamascus JournalDAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 For Younes al-Nasr, a lifelong train lover, the Hejaz railway station here in the heart of the Syrian capital is a repository of shelved ambitions.Every day, Mr. Nasr, 68, a Transportation Ministry employee, pads around his offices in the Ottoman-era building, where light filters through red, yellow and blue stained glass. He imagines the past \u2014 the few short years a century ago when the place bustled with travelers headed for Mecca. And he pictures the future \u2014 the grand plans to connect the site to an expanded suburban railway network, allowing commuters to disembark in the center of town and restoring the landmark station to life.But that will have to wait until after the war. For now, the only evidence of those ambitions is an enormous pit out back. There, workers dug tunnels from outlying stations and began the foundation of a 12-story shopping mall over the tracks, before the country convulsed in conflict three years ago, bringing construction, and eventually Syria\u2019s entire railway system, to a halt. Even here at the Hejaz station, the war has encroached; a few months ago, a mortar shell fired by insurgents struck the busy square just outside, killing 12 people.To Mr. Nasr, the shutdown is only the latest contraction of the region\u2019s horizons. As borders and conflicts proliferated over the past 100 years, they cut rail ties that symbolized the lost links of business and society that once knitted the Levant, and the wider Middle East, together.\u201cRailways are the most sociable form of travel,\u201d he said, recalling his own train trips through Turkey to Romania, Bulgaria and Iran, along a route now made impassable by fighting in northern Syria. \u201cThey connect societies and economies. There would have been no United States without railways, and Europe is Europe because of trains.\u201dThe Hejaz railway was completed in 1908 to much fanfare, reaching Medina in Saudi Arabia, and cutting travel times to Mecca, the most important Muslim pilgrimage site, to five days from 40. The Damascus station opened in 1913.But that line did not survive World War I. British-backed Arab fighters sabotaged the tracks to weaken Ottoman supply lines during World War I, an episode immortalized in the film \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d Later, in 1920, Syrian independence fighters gathered at the Hejaz station before heading west to Maysaloon for a suicidal stand against the French, now remembered as a heroic act of resistance.\u201cThe Hejaz railway is part of the Arab memory,\u201d Mr. Nasr said. \u201cIt should stay alive.\u201dBut periodic efforts to \u201crestore the glory,\u201d as government brochures put it, of the line to Medina foundered over the decades because of regional rivalries and shifting priorities. Syrians rebuilt their section of track, but Saudi Arabia never signed on to reviving the whole route.The railway became an attraction for history buffs. Before the current war, visitors to Syria could take a vintage, narrow-gauge coal-powered train on a scenic trip toward the border with Lebanon. The Damascus station, its towering hall crowned with an enormous damascene chandelier, became a museum, where tourists inspected antique wooden telegraph equipment and heard tales of a visit by Agatha Christie.Now, Syrians occasionally pass through to gaze at a new exhibit: photographs of the destruction of the country\u2019s railroads. They show stations burned and shattered, bridges collapsed and antique steam engines wrecked along with the Qadam depot, on the capital\u2019s outskirts, where they were stored. Others show the derailment, in 2012, of a passenger train to Aleppo, which Mr. Nasr said insurgents accomplished with a kitchen pot stuffed with explosives. The engineer and his assistant were killed, but the 500 passengers were saved by \u201cdestiny,\u201d he said.Plaques list the names of railway workers killed, injured and kidnapped. The tracks that had carried millions of passengers and millions of tons of freight annually are quiet.Mr. Nasr, like the government, blamed insurgents who he said systematically sabotaged the lines; government opponents say that the government bombed stations and depots after insurgents took them over. Few combatants have heeded calls to refrain from attacking crucial parts of Syria\u2019s infrastructure or using them for military purposes. Syria\u2019s historic sites have similarly suffered.Ministry employees still report for work every day in the offices tucked inside the Hejaz station, their workaday desks absorbing a bit of grandeur from stained-glass windows. They still draw their salaries, but there is little to do.In one office, decorated with a map that shows the old routes extending into the Galilee, workers sipped tea and stared at advertisements scrolling by on a government television station. A dentist promised a Hollywood smile; solace was offered with a mood medicine called \u201cWell\u201d; and a restaurant announced that it was opening a branch in Latakia, probably chasing customers who have moved to that more secure coastal city.But Mr. Nasr wanted to make one thing clear. \u201cWe are not bored,\u201d he said. \u201cNot bored! The Syrians are doing their duties, and we will win.\u201dDown the hall, the director of railways, Hasanin Mohammed Ali, showed off mock-ups of the proposed mall and spoke of plans to open a new line through Iraq to its southern port of Basra, with connections to Iran; both countries have provided critical support to the Syrian government. Even the lines to Turkey, whose prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been a foe of the Syrian government, will someday reopen, Mr. Ali said.\u201cSooner or later Erdogan will be leaving and the relations will return,\u201d he said, adding that he thought Syria\u2019s role as a hub had also made it a target for Western designs on the region. \u201cSyria is the connection between Asia and Europe and all the world, and this whole war is because of this.\u201dBut reconstruction will be expensive. Given the widespread damage across the country, and continued insurgent control of wide swaths of territory, it remains unclear whether Syria\u2019s railroads will remain, like Lebanon\u2019s, just a memory.Outside, the tiles on the underside of the portico are pockmarked by shrapnel from the mortar attack. The shells hit while workers were sandblasting the front of the station, and one fell to his death. It was only a matter of luck that more people were not killed, Mr. Nasr said, because the station\u2019s steps are a common meeting place.Still, Mr. Nasr allowed himself a hopeful railway metaphor. \u201cThere is light,\u201d he said, \u201cat the end of the tunnel.\u201dHwaida Saad contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia\u2019s Weimar Syndrome", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Sergei Karaganov, a prominent Russian foreign policy expert at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, recently provided a useful summation of his vast country\u2019s sense of humiliation and encirclement. Because explosions of nationalist fervor like the one fostered by Vladimir Putin are dangerous and slow to abate, it is worth quoting this analysis at some length.\u201cThe rupture is due to the West\u2019s refusal to end the Cold War de facto or de jure in the quarter-century since the collapse of the Soviet Union,\u201d Karaganov wrote in the daily Izvestia. \u201cIn that time, the West has consistently sought to expand its zone of military, economic and political influence through NATO and the E.U. Russian interests and objections were flatly ignored. Russia was treated like a defeated power, though we did not see ourselves as defeated. A softer version of the Treaty of Versailles was imposed on the country. There was no outright annexation of territory or formal reparations like Germany faced after World War I, but Russia was told in no uncertain terms that it would play a modest role in the world. This policy was bound to engender a form of Weimar syndrome in a great nation whose dignity and interests had been trampled.\u201dThe country being discussed here, it should be recalled, is the world\u2019s largest, a Eurasian power whose Communist empire extended as far west as Berlin for more than four decades after World War II, subjecting peoples to the mind-numbing, soul-poisoning oppression of totalitarian rule under regimes that coerced and confined. The Gulag-littered Soviet imperium was a crushing universe, a \u201cconspiracy of silence,\u201d in the poet Czeslaw Milosz\u2019s words, where \u201cone word of truth sounds like a pistol shot.\u201dRussia is also a nation that, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was ushered by the West into the group of leading industrialized countries known as the G-8 (before its recent Crimea-related exclusion). It has been the object of outreach from Washington and NATO since 1991, including initiatives that resulted in Russia joining the Partnership for Peace program and the NATO-Russia council. (NATO-Russian cooperation has been suspended since Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea; yes, there was cooperation to suspend.)What the United States and Europe were not prepared to do, however, was to eviscerate the Atlantic alliance in the name of some dreamy \u201cUnion of Europe\u201d \u2014 Karaganov\u2019s phrase \u2014 that would bring about \u201cthe merger of European soft power and technology with Russia\u2019s resources, political will and hard power.\u201d If this for Moscow was what was meant by the end of the Cold War, it was a nonstarter and still is.Nor, rightly, was the West prepared to turn its back on the desire of former Soviet vassal states from Poland to Estonia to secure the guarantee against renewed subjugation and the prospects of new prosperity that, in their eyes, only membership in the European Union and NATO afforded. Abuse breeds caution. These nations, long blotted out, wanted their security, freedom and the rule of law underwritten in steel.Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the ongoing rampage in eastern Ukraine by the Russian fifth columnists of the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d demonstrate the wisdom of their choice. The expansion through NATO and the E.U. of a free Europe was the greatest American and Western diplomatic achievement since 1989.What now? A sense of national humiliation, whether based in fact or not, is a tremendous catalyst for violence. It was in Weimar Germany, where the reparations and concessions stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 created an explosive mood. It was in Serbia at the time of the break-up in 1991 of Yugoslavia, a country Belgrade always regarded as a Serbian extension of itself. The blinding fever drummed up by Slobodan Milosevic was based in a supposed need to reassert Serbian greatness; the means then was the ravages of his fifth columnists in Bosnia.That delirium took a decade to dim. It is unlikely that the Russian version will take less. Putin\u2019s nationalist upsurge is the mask for all sorts of problems \u2014 demographic decline, corruption, a coopted judiciary, a cowed press, an oligarchic resource-based economy that has failed to diversify \u2014 but no less virulent for that.In the face of this assertive Russia, nothing would be more dangerous than American weakness.So when President Obama, in response to a recent question about whether his declaration that the United States would protect the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea risked drawing another \u201cred line,\u201d gave an evasive answer including the hypothesis that America might not want to \u201cengage militarily,\u201d he did something profoundly dangerous. In Asia, as in the Baltic, the Article 5 commitment to a joint military response to any attack on an ally is critical.The U.S. treaties must be words of truth that sound \u201clike a pistol shot,\u201d or violent mayhem could spread well beyond East Ukraine.Advertisement"}

The most commonly cited measure is a price-earnings ratio that compares the current price of stocks to the earnings of the underlying companies over the past year.The problem with this measure (which also shows that stocks are expensive, but less severely) is that a year isn\u2019t a very long time. Judging a company\u2019s long-term future based on the last 12 months puts too much weight on fleeting factors, like the current state of the economy or a company\u2019s latest product.The 10-year price/earnings ratio has as good a record of any stock-market measure in warning about excess. More broadly, when the ratio reaches 25, roughly where it is now, disappointment tends to follow. The average inflation-adjusted return since 1871 (the first year for which Mr. Shiller has data) in the five years after the ratio equals 25 or higher is negative 12 percent. After stocks get expensive, a correction typically follows.I\u2019m not predicting that the market is going to fall 12 percent or 50 percent. (And if I did, you should stop reading this column.) As Mr. Shiller says, \u201cThere is no way to predict the future.\u201dSometimes, the economy really can change in important ways. Maybe stock prices will be somewhat higher in the 21st century than in the 20th. Mr. Campbell, for example, notes a couple of plausible explanations for higher stock prices: the lack of recent world wars, for example, and the spread of stock ownership to a larger group of investors, which distributes risk more broadly.But none of these changes are likely to rewrite the rules of economics in a fundamental way. Based on history, stocks look either very expensive or somewhat expensive right now. Mr. Shiller suggests that the most likely outcome may be worse returns in coming years than the market has delivered over recent decades \u2013 but still better than the returns of any other investment class.So don\u2019t be tempted (or terrified) by the siren song of a rising market. For most people, the sensible path is still to find a low-cost way to save for retirement, typically through diversified index funds. And given where the market now is, you should err on the side of conservatism.The fact that the last three decades have witnessed one bull market after another shouldn\u2019t fool you into thinking that the next three decades will.The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.\n\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Unbundling Cable Would Not Save You Money", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsIt would be great if you could pay just for the channels you actually use, right? That\u2019s the idea behind \u201cunbundling,\u201d which some consumer groups have advocated. Cable companies would sell you individual channels rather than vast packages of them. It\u2019s an easy idea to get behind when cable companies, never the most lovable of service providers, are raising prices and merging.But surprisingly, unbundling cable channels wouldn\u2019t make consumers materially better off. The most likely result would be people paying about the same amount for fewer channels.Think about what you would do if your cable service were unbundled. Maybe you watch a lot of CNN, Comedy Central, Bravo, A&E and TLC, so you would buy just those five channels. Or maybe you think A&E and TLC are pretty similar. Given a cable system that includes both, you watch some of each, but if you had to pay separately for each, you\u2019d just make do with one. So, now you\u2019d just be buying four channels.You\u2019d lose some things of value here. Along with TLC, you would drop some channels you used to watch occasionally, like Discovery and Esquire. If your brother used to come over and watch a couple of football games a year on ESPN, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do that anymore. But you\u2019d be paying a lot less with so few channels on your bill, so you\u2019d be happier despite the loss of some content \u2014 assuming prices per channel stayed the same.But now consider what would actually happen to prices. The cost of maintaining the wires to your house and keeping the lights on at the cable company wouldn\u2019t go down, even as you order fewer channels. After all, it costs just as much for the cable company to deliver four channels as it does 189. There is good reason to expect your cable company to raise your basic service charge to cover those expenses, offsetting part of your per-channel savings.And consider how the cable channels would react to losing so many subscribers. The networks make money in two main ways: They get per-subscriber carriage fees from the cable companies that distribute them, and they sell advertising. Ad revenue would fall a little, as some viewers would drop channels they used to watch occasionally. The number of customers subject to carriage fees would plummet as consumers chose to order fewer channels.Meanwhile, each cable channel would know its remaining subscribers are mostly people who actually watch the channel, meaning they have a high willingness to pay. Knowing this, they would raise carriage fees \u2014 a lot.On the other hand, some people who currently don\u2019t get bundled cable at all would take the opportunity to buy a few channels. Since those new entrants would be better off, Mr. Crawford and Mr. Yurukoglu estimate that unbundling would slightly benefit consumers, raising the value of the typical cable service by 0.2 percent. But they note that\u2019s before accounting for the fact that unbundled packages would cost more to market and deliver than bundled ones.Another economist, Dmitri Byzalov of Temple University, takes an even more pessimistic view. He finds that unbundling would make consumers modestly worse off, in part because he does not think as many current nonsubscribers would sign up for a few channels as Mr. Crawford and Mr. Yurukoglu do.Not everyone would lose out. For example, if you never watch sports, you might be better off not having to pay for ESPN, which charges the highest carriage fee of any basic cable channel. But Mr. Byzalov estimates that sports channel carriage fees would more than triple under unbundling, as most subscribers opt out and only die-hard sports fans buy in. Consumers who don\u2019t care about sports at all would be better off, but casual sports fans would be worse off: They wouldn\u2019t find it worth paying $37 for an unbundled cluster of sports channels, even if they would have paid the roughly $9 that it costs to get those channels as part of a bundled package.All of this is counterintuitive. Packaging a product so you\u2019re mostly buying stuff you don\u2019t want seems as if it should be bad for consumers. And I\u2019ve pointed out the advantages of unbundling in other areas of the economy.Think of it this way: If I put my bag in an overhead luggage bin, you can\u2019t put your bag in the same spot, so it makes sense to charge me personally for my use. But if I watch Bravo, that doesn\u2019t stop anyone else from watching the same show. When a good is \u201cnonrivalrous\u201d like a cable signal, giving it to me doesn\u2019t stop anyone else from using it or add production costs at the margin. In those cases, it can make sense to throw lots of stuff into one package, whether or not I\u2019ll actually use it.With other media, we don\u2019t blink at this. A newspaper is a bundle of information services. You don\u2019t expect to go to a newsstand and buy just the Business Day section of The New York Times.In fact, you paid for this article, regardless of whether you were interested in reading it. And since the unit cost for this article is near zero \u2014 once it\u2019s been written and edited, creating more copies is just a matter of paper and ink, and on the web even that cost is skipped \u2014 that bundled pricing structure works fine.The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}

Partly it\u2019s the normal human tendency to make excuses, to argue that you did the best you could under the circumstances. And Mr. Geithner can indeed blame much though not all of what went wrong on scorched-earth Republican obstructionism. But there\u2019s also something else going on. In both Europe and America, economic policy has to a large extent been governed by the implicit slogan \u201cSave the bankers, save the world\u201d \u2014 that is, restore confidence in the financial system and prosperity will follow. And government actions have indeed restored financial confidence. Unfortunately, we\u2019re still waiting for the promised prosperity. Thanks to this financial recovery, bailing out Wall Street didn\u2019t even end up costing a lot of taxpayer money: resurgent banks were able to repay their loans, and the government was able to sell its equity stakes at a profit.But where is the rebound in the real economy? Where are the jobs? Saving Wall Street, it seems, wasn\u2019t nearly enough. Why?In the end, the story of economic policy since 2008 has been that of a remarkable double standard. Bad loans always involve mistakes on both sides \u2014 if borrowers were irresponsible, so were the people who lent them money.

{"Headline": "Dealing With Debt Collectors", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour MoneyIf you\u2019ve ever been dunned by a debt collector, you\u2019re not alone: Roughly one in seven American adults is being pursued by a collector, for amounts averaging about $1,500.Complicating the situation is that debt collection has become a larger, more complex industry. If you have trouble paying a personal debt \u2014 whether it\u2019s a credit card balance, a student loan, a utility bill or a medical bill \u2014 and you are deemed to be in default, your account is likely to be handled eventually by someone other than the original creditor. Banks, hospitals, utilities and other businesses often sell debts at a steep discount to third-party buyers, who try to collect the payment themselves or hire outside firms to do so; often, the same debt is resold multiple times, and sometimes debts are packaged and sold in bulk.Along the way, details of the original debt may be lost or become outdated, meaning that collectors may try to demand payment of debts that have already been settled or belong to someone else. It\u2019s unclear exactly what proportion of consumers is wrongly pursued, said Leslie Parrish, deputy director of research with the Center for Responsible Lending and a co-author of the report. But the report notes that as little as 6 percent of debts purchased by the largest debt-buying firms in 2009 came with any sort of documentation.\u201cWhat people don\u2019t know is that their debt can be sold to a debt buyer, who may sell it to another, and another,\u201d said Ms. Parrish.Here are some questions about debt collections:The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act bars abusive and deceptive collection tactics, which means that collectors can\u2019t threaten you, trick you or harass you with late-night phone calls. But for now, the law applies only to third-party collectors and not to businesses, like banks or hospitals, collecting their own debts. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is considering, as part of an update of debt-collection regulations, whether creditors that are collecting their own debts should face similar restrictions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Financial Hazards of a Fugitive Life", "Date": "2014-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewYou may think of being on the run as a quandary for only a small group of recalcitrant, hardened criminals. But in her study of one Philadelphia neighborhood, Professor Goffman shows that it is a common way of life for many nonviolent Americans. These people often face charges related to possession or sale of small amounts of drugs, or offenses like hiding relatives from the law. Whatever the negative moral implications of such crimes, they don\u2019t merit having one\u2019s life ruined.A core point of \u201cOn the Run\u201d is that \u201cyoung men\u2019s compromised legal status transforms the basic institutions of work, friendship and family into a net of entrapment.\u201d For instance, the police round up fugitives by monitoring and contacting their relatives \u2014 and that frays family relations. A young man might avoid showing up at the hospital to witness the birth of his child because he knows he could be caught or turned in. Family gatherings become another hazard, so in-person appearances are often surprise visits. People stuck in this kind of limbo are also reluctant to visit hospitals when they need treatment, and a result, the book says, is a \u201clifestyle of secrecy and evasion,\u201d driven by the unfavorable incentives set in motion by the law.For all the recent talk of a surveillance state created through the National Security Agency, an oppressive low-tech surveillance state has been in place for decades \u2014 and it\u2019s been directed at many of America\u2019s poorest people.As every friend or relative becomes a potential informant, cooperation plummets and life degenerates into a day-to-day struggle to remain outside the reaches of the law. Professor Goffman offers a chilling portrait of tactics used to encourage relatives to turn in possible lawbreakers: For example, the police may tell mothers that if they don\u2019t report their errant men, the authorities will yank their children, a threat that may be backed by a charge of harboring or aiding and abetting a fugitive. \u201cSquealing\u201d thus becomes more likely. A community becomes divided between those who are on the clean side of the law and those who are not. And trust breaks down in personal relationships.For people on the run, attending or finishing school is usually out of the question, and finding and keeping employment is tough. Fugitives avoid jobs that require legitimate identification or that can make their whereabouts known to the authorities. The alternatives are unemployment, black-market or gray-market jobs, or, at best, low-paying part-time jobs in the service sector. Professor Goffman shows that \u201cto be on the run is also to be at a standstill,\u201d for reasons that may be seen as negative economic incentives.The lives of those on the wrong side of the law become dominated by market transactions, but not the kind that accumulate into useful business experience for the future. Local underground markets supply the goods and services that help people stay clear of the law and buy themselves some secrecy and protection. Business may boom for those selling false identification papers and driver\u2019s licenses; other entrepreneurship may be directed, for example, toward helping people pass drug tests by providing bags of \u201cclean\u201d urine, to be taped to a leg before a test is taken.The book can be read as an indictment of the war on drugs, though Professor Goffman doesn\u2019t stress this implication. People who run afoul of drug laws face economic burdens and losses of liberty that are extremely destructive and go well beyond the risk of a prison sentence. The author refers to the American ghetto as \u201cone of the last repressive regimes of the age.\u201d Current drug laws have helped to create and maintain these social structures without appearing to have done much to limit substance abuse.It\u2019s an urgent situation, because Professor Goffman\u2019s book shows clearly that the microeconomics of a life on the run are grim indeed.TYLER COWEN is a professor of economics at George Mason University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letting the Market Decide on Pfizer-AstraZeneca Deal", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe French always protect their national champions, while the British have a laissez-faire approach to foreign takeovers of their top companies, right? That is certainly the caricature. Witness how France deterred PepsiCo from bidding for Danone in 2005 on the grounds that yogurt was a strategic industry, while Britain allowed the United States-based Kraft to move ahead with its hostile takeover of Cadbury, the confectioner, in 2010.Recent events, though, show that the picture is more complex. When news first leaked that General Electric, the United States industrial giant, was negotiating to buy Alstom\u2019s power generation business, the French government\u2019s knee-jerk reaction was hostile. But by last week, Alstom had reached a deal to sell its power unit to G.E. for 11.4 billion euros, or $15.81 billion, and Paris had softened its opposition. The main reason is that Alstom was determined to do the deal, because it considered its energy business too small to thrive on world markets and was worried about its debt load. Meanwhile, G.E. has softened the blow to Gallic pride by promising to maintain high levels of employment in France and to respect French control of its nuclear power business, which arguably is strategic. Alstom has also agreed to let a board committee scrutinize the deal for a month. During that period, Germany\u2019s Siemens may firm up its rival plans for taking over the French group\u2019s power business, paying for it partly by giving Alstom its train unit. That plan might appeal more to Paris because it would create two European champions \u2014 one in energy and the other in trains. But, at present, it looks as if the G.E. option will win favor with Alstom, and market forces will prevail.Now look across the English Channel, where an even bigger deal is being concocted: Pfizer\u2019s proposed $106 billion offer for its fellow pharmaceutical giant, AstraZeneca. The British government has not been as laissez-faire as one might have expected. Stung into action out of fear that Britain\u2019s science base might be eroded, it negotiated a series of reassurances from the American-based Pfizer, including a promise that at least 20 percent of the combined group\u2019s research staff would be based in Britain for the next five years unless circumstances changed.At first blush, it might look as if London is trying to defend a national champion. But on further examination, it looks as if Britain may have unintentionally made it easier for AstraZeneca to fall into foreign hands. This is because Pfizer\u2019s approach is a hostile one \u2014 unlike G.E.\u2019s friendly approach to Alstom. Statements by various ministers welcoming the assurances they have wrung out of Pfizer have given the impression that the takeover has the government\u2019s blessing.Some AstraZeneca directors are furious, saying the government intervened behind its back. Compare this with France, where Arnaud Montebourg, the minister of the economy, was angry because he said he had been kept in the dark about Alstom\u2019s talks with G.E.The British government seems to have realized that it made an error, putting out a statement Friday that it was up to shareholders to decide whether to accept the proposal. So, at the end of the day, both AstraZeneca\u2019s and Alstom\u2019s futures are likely to be decided by market forces \u2014 which is as it should be. This is not because the market is perfect. There are lots of cases of companies\u2019 overpaying when they take over other businesses. There may also be examples of shareholders in target companies selling out too cheaply because they are do not appreciate the long-term value \u2014 although such cases are harder to come by.AstraZeneca could be one of these latter examples, given that it has some cancer treatments in its pipeline that could become blockbusters. Its job now is to convince its shareholders that its independent future is really valuable.But if the British group does fall to Pfizer, that should be the end of the matter. That is partly because, although markets are imperfect, governments are even worse at picking winners. Protected industries tend to become inefficient.What about Britain\u2019s science base? Wouldn\u2019t that be damaged if Pfizer slashed research spending? Not necessarily. In such a scenario, the scientists would be free to work elsewhere or even start their own biotech companies. The main role for governments in these situations is to help foster entrepreneurship and encourage investment.There are, of course, exceptions to the rule \u2014 when the target company is genuinely strategic and the predator may not have the country\u2019s interests at heart. But except in extreme cases, governments should stay neutral, neither erecting barriers to protect their champions nor selling them down the river.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Greeks, the Parliamentary Vote in Europe Is a Test of Their Own Direction", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 This time, there are no predictions of doom, no anguished fretting out of Washington or Berlin that Greek national elections could unravel the European economic order. That was the mood in 2012, when the fate of the euro seemed to hang on the whims of an angry Greek electorate that, in the end, voted to stay the course in the euro zone.The dynamics seem reversed as Greeks return to the polls this weekend for European parliamentary elections. The balloting, from Thursday through Sunday, is supposed to represent another developmental step in the broader European political project, but an expected protest vote across Europe means that the impact may be greater on national politics.In Greece, the vote has become a de facto referendum on the governing coalition and a test of whether ordinary citizens believe the government\u2019s assertion that the country is finally on the upswing. Polls are showing the left-wing opposition party, Syriza, with a slight advantage over New Democracy, the center-right party that leads the government.\u201cIf the margin is large, on the order of 5 percent or more, this could be destabilizing,\u201d said Harry Papasotiriou, a political science professor at Panteion University in Athens, adding that voters may use the European parliamentary races to send a message to the Greek government. \u201cPeople can vent their emotions in a protest vote.\u201dEuropean leaders, concerned with political stability in Greece, are watching warily. The Greek stock and bond markets have wobbled in recent days amid concerns that a subpar showing by New Democracy could bring pressure for new national elections, which are not scheduled until 2016.Greek politics is still defined by the bailout from the so-called troika of foreign creditors: the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. The bailout prevented the country from going bankrupt but inflicted punishing terms that have contributed to record unemployment.Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has argued that Greece is now clawing its way toward recovery, with some economists forecasting a return to growth by the end of the year.On the campaign trail, New Democracy leaders say Greece must maintain political stability or the sacrifices made during the bailout \u2014 and the seeds of recovery \u2014 could be jeopardized.\u201cInstability is bad for the economy,\u201d warned Health Minister Adonis Georgiadis, arguing that a Syriza victory could be destabilizing. \u201cYou have to explain to people the consequences of their choice.\u201dNow, with Syriza in a tight race, the party\u2019s telegenic leader, Alexis Tsipras, is again framing the European election as a referendum on the bailout agreement, brushing off talk of possible political instability. Mr. Tsipras is running for a seat on the European Commission, though analysts say he does not expect to win and is instead trying to cultivate a leftist, anti-austerity movement across Europe. His real goal is to win in Greece, where he says a Syriza victory would be a no-confidence vote in the government and in New Democracy.\u201cWe are confident that the results in the European elections will show they are far behind Syriza,\u201d said Yiannis Milios, a top strategist and Syriza lawmaker, who argues that the government\u2019s economic program has punished ordinary people but rewarded the wealthy. \u201cWe have the concentration of wealth in a few hands. We have wage earners losing their rights.\u201dThe shape of the election in Greece is especially unpredictable because of the range of parties pushing starkly different populist messages. Pasok, the party that dominated Greek politics for decades, is trailing badly in the polls; many analysts believe it is in a death spiral that could endanger the government coalition.A new centrist party, To Potami, or \u201cThe River,\u201d has emerged in recent months, led by a popular television journalist, Stavros Theodorakis. After a flurry of news media attention, To Potami has hit a plateau in polls. But Mr. Theodorakis has tried to tap into the broad public disgust with the established parties.\u201cThe people have been exhausted from this and do not listen anymore,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey are tired of these dogmas.\u201dThe biggest wild card is Golden Dawn, the far-right party with an anti-immigrant, neo-fascist ideology. Last year, the government led a sweeping crackdown, labeling the group a criminal organization (rather than a political party) and arresting its leader and five members of Parliament. The crackdown was expected to prevent Golden Dawn from competing in the European elections \u2014 except that this month Greece\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that the party could.With its angry, nationalist message, Golden Dawn has tapped into the broad public fury over the country\u2019s economic collapse. Two years ago, it stunned the political establishment with a strong fifth-place finish and has been polling in third or fourth place this time.\u201cIt will be terrible if they end up being the third party,\u201d said Professor Papasotiriou, who also works for a think tank linked to New Democracy. \u201cIt would be very bad for Greece.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South African Army Called In to Crack Down on Post-Election Unrest", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJOHANNESBURG, South Africa \u2014 South African police arrested 59 people and the army was called in overnight to quell post-election protests in a Johannesburg slum, the police and news media said Saturday, as the government clamped down on disorder after the victory of the African National Congress at the polls.The police used rubber bullets and stun grenades on Friday to disperse protesters in the impoverished black township of Alexandra who had burned tires and barricaded roads, a police spokesman, Brig. Neville Malila, said. Alexandra was \u201ccalm this morning,\u201d he said, adding that security forces remained in the area.The South African Press Association reported earlier that the army had been called in overnight to restore calm, quoting the premier of Gauteng Province, Nomvula Mokonyane.Although the ruling African National Congress remains popular with South Africa\u2019s black majority after it dismantled the apartheid system in 1994, there is rising discontent among the millions stuck in grinding poverty and without access to running water or electricity.The A.N.C. won the election with 62.16 percent of the votes, according to a provisional tally.After the vote, as many as 400 people gathered on Friday outside a court in Alexandra to demand the release of other protesters arrested a day earlier, Brigadier Malila said.At least 39 people were arrested Thursday after an electoral commission office was burned in Alexandra.Both groups of those detained are due to appear in court on Monday.By calling in the army, the African National Congress government is taking a harder tack against public unrest than it has in the recent past.When violent labor unrest swept through the country\u2019s platinum belt in 2012, the government put the army on standby, but did not dispatch it.Burdened with sluggish economic growth and damaging strikes in his first term, South Africa\u2019s scandal-plagued president, Jacob Zuma, is at pains to soothe investor concerns about Africa\u2019s most sophisticated economy, and push through pro-business reforms.Over the past year he has devoted less and less time to the wishes of unions, whose long walkouts have hurt confidence in the economy. Mr. Zuma hinted last week that the African National Congress needed to take a more pro-business stance, accusing the main union for platinum workers of irresponsibility for dragging out a four-month wage strike.

{"Headline": "As Goes Greece, So Goes Europe?", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Greece has been at the epicenter of the European debt crisis, and in many ways, the political fallout here reflects the surge of extreme-left and extreme-right forces that the Continent witnessed in the elections for the European Parliament. As in Greece, the center-left and center-right groups that form the core of national and European Union politics have seen their power eroded by the rise of extremist parties very different from one another, united only by their rejection of the way things are, both at home and in the European Union. While Europe struggles to cope with the economic crisis, and voters\u2019 focus on domestic issues is seen as a swelling tide of opposition to an \u201cever closer union,\u201d debate on issues like banking and fiscal union, integration and keeping borders open could stall. If the center wavers, Europe\u2019s great project may fall apart. The drama playing out in Greece over the past four years may hold useful lessons for Europe. Not every vote lost by the center is a vote against the Union. In Sunday\u2019s election, a coalition of the remnants of the two pro-European Union parties that dominated the Greek political center for decades was hit by a pincer movement from left and right. Syriza, a radical left party, won the most votes (26.6 percent), while the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn finished third, with 9.4 percent. The senior coalition partner, the center-right New Democracy, won 22.7 percent, while its junior partner, the center-left Pasok (running as part of the \u201cOlive Tree\u201d alliance), got 8 percent. This confirmed opinion polls that Syriza was the party with the strongest support since national elections in June 2012. Syriza is opposed to the austerity program imposed on Greece in 2010 but is not anti-European Union. Golden Dawn is against austerity but also strongly against the European Union. The two parties represent the often bloody historical divide between Greece\u2019s left and right and would never agree on anything besides attacking the government.Greece is not the first country to witness a protest movement against economic austerity, nor the first where xenophobic extremists have made their presence felt. But nowhere have the two extremes grown so influential so quickly, as formerly fringe groups fed off voters\u2019 anger and insecurity and wore down the credibility of mainstream parties. In national elections in 2009, before the crisis, Syriza won just 4.6 percent of the vote, while Golden Dawn barely registered, with 0.3 percent (just 19,624 votes). But their recent strong showing, and the coalition government\u2019s weakening, suggests that if these had been national elections the results would have rendered Greece ungovernable, as no party could have formed a viable coalition with any like-minded group. With the economy still on life support, such political instability would be devastating.The popularity of extremist groups not only undermines the political system\u2019s cohesion but also threatens their own future: Thrilled by the success of their simplistic rejection of the state of things, these parties are unwilling or unable to compromise. They will either remain on the fringe or tear themselves apart. It\u2019s the existence of a government with unpopular policies that in part empowers them. After six years of recession and four years of austerity in Greece, Syriza has been unable to break through the ceiling of 26.9 percent that it won in 2012, while the coalition has not fallen so far as to make governing untenable. The political system limps on. The aggrievement and disillusionment that fuel such extreme movements can arise from real causes or perceived ones. People may feel fear and deprivation because of the impact of recession, unemployment and higher taxes. They may feel threatened by immigration, or by the idea of immigration. Nationalism can be provoked by outside factors, such as a belligerent neighbor or a sense of national humiliation and loss of control. All have played a role in Greece, though they are common in many other countries as well. In what turned out to be a triumphant campaign, the U.K. Independence Party urged voters to \u201cTake back control of our country.\u201d In France, the anti-immigration, anti-European Union winner issued a similar call. \u201cThe people have spoken loud and clear,\u201d proclaimed the National Front leader, Marine Le Pen, on Sunday. \u201cThey no longer want to be led by those outside our borders, by E.U. commissioners and technocrats who are unelected. They want to be protected from globalization and take back the reins of their destiny.\u201d A day later, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande urged the European Union to change, accusing it of being \u201cremote and incomprehensible, even for governments.\u201dSocieties are united by a common past and common interests, by feelings of familiarity among their members (even when they disagree) and belonging expressed through their leaders. Losing that, or seeing it weakened, makes people angry and insecure. They cast blame and look for a group that comforts them. In Greece, the target is the government, and beyond that the creditors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The lesson that this troika should draw from the Greek crisis is that loans in exchange for austerity and reform may look good on paper, but unless the reforms are first carried out, austerity will lead to depression, and the backlash will not only worsen the economic crisis but might also undermine the political legitimacy of the reformers. Reforms will not work unless they offer justice and hope and the possibility of an easier life for citizens.When policies result only in strengthening extremists\u2019 sense of anger and self-righteousness, no solutions can be found. Domestic problems will become European problems. For now, centrist, pro-European Union parties are still in the majority in Europe and its Parliament. It is up to them to show leadership, remain calm and save the Union. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Tells Ukraine: Cash in Advance for Gas", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia said on Thursday that it would stop supplying gas to Ukraine at the end of the month unless the country paid for it in advance, increasing the pressure on Kiev\u2019s financially pressed government as it struggles to contain a growing rebellion in the country\u2019s east.In a letter to European leaders on Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said that Ukraine\u2019s gas debt had ballooned in the last month and that Russia had received \u201cno specific proposals\u201d for Ukraine to \u201cmeet its contractual obligations and ensure reliable transit.\u201d\u201cGiven the circumstances, the Russian company has issued an advance invoice for gas deliveries to Ukraine, which is completely in accordance with the contract, and after June 1 gas deliveries will be limited to the amount prepaid by the Ukrainian company,\u201d the letter, which was released on the Kremlin\u2019s website, read.Mr. Putin first warned that Gazprom, the Russian state energy company, would demand payment in advance for deliveries to Ukraine in a letter to European leaders in mid-April.\u201cUndoubtedly, this is an extreme measure,\u201d he wrote at the time.On Thursday, Mr. Putin said that Ukraine\u2019s debt to Gazprom, had grown from $2.237 billion in early April to $3.508 billion by mid-May.The new numbers reflected a sharp and controversial increase in gas prices for Ukraine that has been seen as a punitive reaction to the ouster of President Viktor F. Yanukovych in February.In a deal signed by Mr. Putin and Mr. Yanukovych in December, Russia agreed to sell gas to Ukraine at a price of $268 for 1,000 cubic meters. Last month, after Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s ouster, Gazprom raised the price to $385 for 1,000 cubic meters, the standard measure for gas in Europe and a severe blow to the fledgling government as Ukraine teetered on the verge of bankruptcy.Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, Ukraine\u2019s interim prime minister, said earlier this month that Ukraine would be willing to repay its gas debt under the strict condition that it pay the lower price.At a news conference in Kiev earlier on Thursday, Ukraine\u2019s deputy energy minister, Igor Didenko, said the country was ready to pay $4 billion for gas to Gazprom by the end of May but only at $268.50 for 1,000 cubic meters, the Interfax news service reported.In his letter, Mr. Putin noted that Ukraine\u2019s failure to pay the debt came despite the country receiving $3.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund as the first tranche of a $17 billion loan to the country.\u201cI would like to emphasize once again that we were forced to make this decision,\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cWe also hope that the European Commission will more actively engage in the dialogue in order to work out specific and fair solutions that will help stabilize the Ukrainian economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retailers Feel Economy\u2019s Effects on Their Shoppers ", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA growing chorus of retailers partly blamed the unusually harsh winter for a disappointing quarter on Thursday. But the sluggish results of chains like Walmart also underscored the sustained financial struggles of a lower-income customer base, while retailers that serve higher-income shoppers performed better.\u201cWe have a customer, in the middle and down, that\u2019s still very cautious,\u201d said William S. Simon, chief executive of Walmart U.S. \u201cThey\u2019re very resilient, but they\u2019re very cautious.\u201dBy comparison, at the high end, Nordstrom reported first-quarter sales that were up 6.8 percent over a year ago. Several other major retailers across the spectrum reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday, and more are expected to do so next week. J.C. Penney surprised many with better-than-expected figures. The retailer, which is trying to reverse a disastrous slide under the management of the former chief executive Ron Johnson, said sales at stores open at least a year increased 6.2 percent and its gross margin improved, and it announced that it had secured a new credit facility. Executives also said the company counted positive store traffic in April for the first time in 30 months.\u201cDespite a difficult retail environment, our strong performance during the Easter holiday period and other key promotional events enabled us to deliver better-than-anticipated sales results,\u201d Myron E. Ullman III, Penney\u2019s chief executive said in a statement.Penney\u2019s stock was up about 20 percent in after-hours trading.Walmart\u2019s core customers tend to be people with lower incomes, and that segment of the population has struggled throughout the slow, uneven economic recovery. In February, Mr. Simon said that cuts to the federal food stamp program had hurt results, and on Thursday, he said that had continued. Walmart also said its performance was thwarted by a higher-than-expected effective tax rate and currency exchange rates.During this quarter, traffic in Walmart\u2019s United States stores decreased 1.4 percent, a problem Walmart has reported in several recent quarters. Sales at smaller Neighborhood Market stores that have been open at least a year grew 5 percent, however, and its e-commerce sales, which increased 27 percent during the quarter, were another bright spot. The company reported that bad weather reduced earnings by about 3 cents a share.\u201cWhat was really interesting and unusual about this quarter was supply-chain disruption\u201d because of winter storms, Mr. Simon said. \u201cFor the first time that I can recall, the entire supply chain in the U.S. got backed up for a period, and we needed to spend money to expedite that.\u201dWhile Nordstrom\u2019s earnings of 72 cents a share beat its outlook of 60 to 70 cents a share, quarterly profits slipped to $140 million from $145 million the year before. The retailer said that decrease was due to investments in technology and infrastructure to lay the groundwork for its expansion into Canada.For Walmart, this quarter was only the latest in a run of disappointing earnings reports. During its last fiscal year, Walmart\u2019s total revenue rose 1.6 percent to $476 billion. According to the World Bank, that was a bit larger than the gross domestic product of Argentina in 2012. But the company\u2019s operating income declined to $26.9 billion, a decrease of 3.1 percent from the year before.\u201cThe middle-income and lower-income consumer is faring slightly better, but they\u2019re not seeing enough income growth to generate increased spending,\u201d said Ken Perkins, founder of Retail Metrics. \u201cThat has weighed on Kohl\u2019s and Walmart in particular, and we\u2019ll likely see sluggish reports from others who are in the lower- to middle-tier space.\u201dThis quarter is the first at Walmart under the leadership of C.

{"Headline": "The Wild Children of Yesteryear", "Date": "2014-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionPHILADELPHIA \u2014 DINNER with your children in 19th-century America often required some self-control. Berry stains in your daughter\u2019s hair? Good for her. Raccoon bites running up your boy\u2019s arms? Bet he had an interesting day. As this year\u2019s summer vacation begins, many parents contemplate how to rein in their kids. But there was a time when Americans pushed in the opposite direction, preserved in Mark Twain\u2019s cat-swinging scamps. Parents back then encouraged kids to get some wildness out of their system, to express the republic\u2019s revolutionary values.American children of the 19th century had a reputation. Returning British visitors reported on American kids who showed no respect, who swore and fought, who appeared \u2014 at age 10 \u2014 \u201ccalling for liquor at the bar, or puffing a cigar in the streets,\u201d as one wrote. There were really no children in 19th-century America, travelers often claimed, only \u201csmall stuck-up caricatures of men and women.\u201d This was not a \u201ccarefree\u201d nation, too rough-hewed to teach proper manners; adults deliberately chose to express new values by raising \u201cgo-ahead\u201d boys and girls. The result mixed democracy and mob rule, assertiveness and cruelty, sudden freedom and strict boundaries.Visitors noted how American fathers would brag that their disobedient children were actually \u201cyoung republicans,\u201d liberated from old hierarchies. Children were still expected to be deferential to elders, but many were trained to embody their nation\u2019s revolutionary virtues. \u201cThe theory of the equality\u201d was present at the ballot box, according to one sympathetic Englishman, but \u201crampant in the nursery.\u201d Boys, in particular, spent their childhoods in a rowdy outdoor subculture. After age 5 or so they needed little attention from their mothers, but were not big enough to help their fathers work. So until age 10 or 12 they spent much of their time playing or fighting. The writer William Dean Howells recalled his ordinary, violent Ohio childhood, immersed in his loose gang of pals, rarely catching a \u201cglimpse of life much higher than the middle of a man.\u201d Howells\u2019s peers were \u201calways stoning something,\u201d whether friends, rivals or stray dogs. They left a trail of maimed animals behind them, often hurt in sloppy attempts to domesticate wild pets. And though we envision innocents playing with a hoop and a stick, many preferred \u201cmumbletypeg\u201d \u2014 a game where two players competed to see who could throw a knife closer to his own foot. Stabbing yourself meant a win by default. Left to their own devices, boys learned an assertive style that shaped their futures. The story of every 19th-century empire builder \u2014 Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt \u2014 seems to begin with a striving 10-year-old. \u201cBoy culture\u201d offered training for the challenges of American manhood and a reprieve before a life of labor.But these unsupervised boys also formed gangs that harassed the mentally ill, the handicapped and racial and ethnic minorities. Boys played an outsize role in the anti-Irish pogroms in 1840s Philadelphia, the brutal New York City draft riots targeting African-Americans during the Civil War and attacks on Chinese laborers in Gilded Age California. These children did not invent the bigotry rampant in white America, but their unrestrained upbringing let them enact what their parents mostly muttered.Their sisters followed a different path. Girls were usually assigned more of their mothers\u2019 tasks. An 8-year-old girl would be expected to help with the wash or other physically demanding tasks, while her brother might simply be too small, too slow or too annoying to drive the plow with his father. But despite their drudgery, 19th-century American girls still found time for tree climbing, bonfire building and waterfall-jumping antics. There were few pretty pink princesses in 19th-century America: Girls were too rowdy and too republican for that.So how did we get from \u201cdemocratic sucklings\u201d to helicopter parents? Though many point to a rise of parental worrying after the 1970s, this was an incremental change in a movement that began a hundred years earlier. In the last quarter of the 19th century, middle-class parents launched a self-conscious project to protect children. Urban professionals began to focus on children\u2019s vulnerabilities. Well-to-do worriers no longer needed to raise tough dairymaids or cunning newsboys; the changing economy demanded careful managers of businesses or households, and restrained company men, capable of navigating big institutions. Demographics played a role as well: By 1900 American women had half as many children as they did in 1800, and those children were twice as likely to live through infancy as they were in 1850. Ironically, as their children faced fewer dangers, parents worried more about their protection.Instead of seeing boys and girls as capable, clever, knockabout scamps, many reconceived children as vulnerable, weak and na\u00efve. Reformers introduced child labor laws, divided kids by age in school and monitored their play. Jane Addams particularly worked to fit children into the new industrial order, condemning \u201cthis stupid experiment of organizing work and failing to organize play.\u201d There was good reason to tame the boys and girls of the 19th century, if only for stray cats\u2019 sake. But somewhere between Jane Addams and Nancy Grace, Americans lost track of their larger goal. Earlier parents raised their kids to express values their society trumpeted. \u201cPrecocious\u201d 19th-century troublemakers asserted their parents\u2019 democratic beliefs and fit into an economy that had little use for 8-year-olds but idealized striving, self-made men. Reformers designed their Boy Scouts to meet the demands of the 20th century, teaching organization and rebalancing the relationship between play and work. Both movements agreed, in their didactic ways, that playtime shaped future citizens.Does the overprotected child articulate values we are proud of in 2014? Nothing is easier than judging other peoples\u2019 parenting, but there is a side of contemporary American culture \u2014 fearful, litigious, controlling \u2014 that we do not brag about but that we reveal in our child rearing, and that runs contrary to our self-image as an open, optimistic nation. Maybe this is why sheltering parents come in for so much easy criticism: A visit to the playground exposes traits we would rather not recognize.There is, however, a saving grace that parents will notice this summer. Kids are harder to guide and shape, as William Dean Howells put it, \u201cthan grown people are apt to think.\u201d It is as true today as it was two centuries ago: \u201cEverywhere and always the world of boys is outside of the laws that govern grown-up communities.\u201d Somehow, they\u2019ll manage to go their own way.A National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the Massachusetts Historical Society who is writing a book on the role of young people in 19th-century American democracy.

{"Headline": "7 Republicans Named to Panel Investigating Attack in Benghazi", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker John A. Boehner on Friday appointed seven Republicans to the 12-person committee tasked with continuing investigations into the 2012 attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi, Libya. The move forced Democratic lawmakers to struggle to overcome internal disagreements over how to handle the latest inquiry and whether or not to appoint any of their own members to the new committee.Mr. Boehner\u2019s announcement came on the House floor before the chamber departed for a weeklong break. In addition to Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, who is chairman of the committee, the speaker appointed Representatives Susan W. Brooks of Indiana; Jim Jordan of Ohio; Mike Pompeo of Kansas; Martha Roby of Alabama; Peter Roskam of Illinois, and Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia. The committee was created on Thursday on a largely party line vote.By Friday afternoon, with many lawmakers already on flights back to their districts, the two parties seemed to be at an impasse, with the Republicans forging ahead on a committee that Democratic leaders have called a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d The disagreement over even the terms of the investigative group \u2014 with letters and counterletters pinging back and forth between the leadership offices \u2014 underscores the partisan tensions already present in the inquiry.The attack on the United States\u2019 diplomatic compound in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, has become a cause of the Republican base, which contends that President Obama and the secretary of state at the time, Hillary Rodham Clinton, initially tried to cover up what they knew about the causes of the attack. The raid left four Americans dead, including J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya.After more than a year of congressional investigations, subpoenas and even a fact-finding mission to Libya, the issue returned to the spotlight this month after the White House was forced to release a new email that shows that administration officials tried to shape the way Susan E. Rice, then the ambassador to the United Nations, discussed the attack on several Sunday morning news programs, when she said the chaos in the Middle East at the time may have prompted the deadly attack.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, told reporters on Friday that the Republican-controlled committee was a \u201cpolitical stunt.\u201d But heading into the weekend, the Democratic leadership team remained divided over whether they should boycott the committee entirely, participate fully or find some middle ground.Participating in the committee would allow Democrats to offer their witnesses some protection from Republican questioning, and to know what subpoenas and evidence are coming. But it could also hurt Democrats by offering the committee bipartisan cover and further legitimizing what they consider a right-wing witch hunt.Earlier in the week, Ms. Pelosi and Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic whip, sent Mr. Boehner a letter requesting several concessions that they said would help make the investigation more fair and open, and those items have been part of negotiations between members of their staff. Among other things, the Democrats asked to be included on any trips and requested that Republicans would not selectively release or leak any testimony.Democrats would also like at least one Democrat to sign off on all subpoenas, but that is an area where Republicans are unwilling to budge.On Friday, Ms. Pelosi implied that the newly formed committee was a Republican attempt to move the Benghazi investigation out of the jurisdiction of Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee. Democrats said that Mr. Issa, whom Ms. Pelosi called \u201cdamaged goods,\u201d abused his power when he led the charge into investigating the Benghazi attack.Mr. Boehner sent a response to Ms. Pelosi on Friday afternoon saying that Mr. Gowdy would \u201cendeavor\u201d to consult with the minority when \u201cpracticable,\u201d but the speaker would make no promises that Mr. Gowdy would not, for instance, issue unilateral subpoenas without consulting the Democrats on the committee or exclude Democratic staff members from witness interviews, according to both Democratic and Republican leadership aides.That left Democrats unsatisfied. Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee, called Mr. Boehner\u2019s response \u201ca slap in the face.\u201d Ms. Pelosi, in another letter to Mr. Boehner on Friday afternoon, called the Republicans\u2019 counteroffer \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d\u201cThe American people deserve and expect us to work together in a fair, balanced and open manner,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote. \u201cFor the sake of the families of the brave Americans who died in this tragedy, this process must not be politicized.\u201dBut by late Friday afternoon, Republicans had made clear they were through negotiating. \u201cWe made a fair offer; we hope they will appoint members,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Boehner spokesman. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s time to get to work.\u201dA spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said, \u201cThe ball is in their court.\u201dThough Democrats are reluctant to proceed until they feel that Mr. Boehner is willing to work with them to ensure a fair investigation, they are still wrestling with how to continue.\u201cI don\u2019t know that you do yourself a whole lot of good volunteering to participate in the kangaroo court,\u201d said Representative James E.

{"Headline": "Legislation to Protect Against \u2018Patent Trolls\u2019 Is Shelved", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A yearlong effort to pass legislation protecting companies against so-called patent trolls was declared all but dead on Wednesday, when the bill was removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s agenda. Supporters of the bill said heavy lobbying by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and trial lawyers prevented the bill from advancing. \u201cUnfortunately, there has been no agreement on how to combat the scourge of patent trolls on our economy without burdening the companies and universities who rely on the patent system every day to protect their inventions,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who leads the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. The bill was meant to limit those companies, widely known as patent trolls, whose main business is to gather dormant patents, threaten infringement lawsuits against supposed violators and then offer to settle for less than the target\u2019s probable cost of mounting a defense.\u201cI have said all along that we needed broad bipartisan support to get a bill through the Senate,\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \u201cRegrettably, competing companies on both sides of this issue refused to come to agreement on how to achieve that goal.\u201dIn December, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill that would have required more disclosure about who owned a patent and who would benefit from a lawsuit, as well as requiring a judge to determine early in the process whether a given patent was valid.In the Senate, though, negotiators got hung up on a provision that would have required a patent plaintiff to put up a bond to cover the potential payment of the winning side\u2019s legal fees. That was opposed by lawyers\u2019 groups, Senate aides said.Universities and medical companies, which often have big patent portfolios, feared the new law would make it hard for them to defend their intellectual property.The effort to write a new patent law began only two years after President Obama signed into law the America Invents Act, a sweeping overhaul of the patent system enacted in 2011.That law prevented patent holders from lumping together into a single docket a lawsuit against multiple companies \u2014 a provision aimed at trolls. The result, however, was the opposite of what had been intended; it caused the number of patent lawsuits to soar.Retailers and technology and software companies, the most frequent targets of the lawsuits, expressed dismay over the apparent death of the latest patent bill. Calling the event \u201ca victory for patent trolls,\u201d the National Retail Federation said in a statement it was \u201cdeeply disappointed that groups representing the status quo have continued to stall and stymie attempts at effective patent reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Some Foreign Students, U.S. Education Is Losing Its Attraction", "Date": "2014-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational EducationSEOUL \u2014 Each fall, thousands of students from South Korea arrive on American campuses. They come from a culture that views education as the key to success, where mothers and fathers save to send their children overseas. On top of tuition, parents shell out for test prep and cram schools, supplemental English lessons and recruitment agents to shepherd them through an unfamiliar admissions process. In the past, only a small elite pursued advanced degrees internationally; today, many sons and daughters of the nation\u2019s emergent middle class go abroad.This is South Korea but the description could fit China equally well.Recently however, after years of robust enrollment increases, graduate applications from South Korea to American colleges have fallen off; and last year the number of South Korean undergraduates in the United States also dropped. Fewer South Koreans study in the United States now than did five years ago.South Korean students who study abroad often find that they lack the local connections to get a job when they return home, says Jaeha Choi, director of student recruitment and admissions at SUNY-Korea, the State University of New York\u2019s campus outside Seoul, South Korea\u2019s capital.Softening interest from South Korea, the third-largest supplier source of international students to the United States, could serve as a warning to American institutions that have grown to rely on tuition revenue from China, the largest source.The two countries differ in politics, population and economics, but they share common educational traditions and motivations for sending their students abroad, and their international mobility patterns have followed corresponding trajectories. \u201cThe Chinese market is very much like Korea 10 years ago,\u201d said Jekook Woo, an education consultant in Seoul.And recent hand-wringing in China about the return on a pricey foreign degree echoes qualms among South Korean families that overseas study is no longer the guarantee of economic security that it once was.For decades, sending top students abroad was a pragmatic choice for both countries, a recognition of the lack of educational capacity at home, particularly at the graduate level. But as their economies and educational systems changed, so did the reasons for foreign study.Growing affluence \u2014 beginning in the 1990s in South Korea and within the past decade in China \u2014 meant that more families could afford an American education. In both countries, parents bet that a foreign degree could help their children in an increasingly global and crowded job market. Many South Korean businesses, in fact, require prospective hires to submit English-proficiency scores.The decision to go abroad may also reflect a desire to opt out of rigid, highly competitive educational systems. Performance on the gaokao, China\u2019s national college-entrance exam, and its Korean equivalent, the suneung, are the sole determinants of college admission.Perhaps as a result, students from both countries are heading overseas earlier. Twice as many South Korean students go to the United States now for undergraduate study as for graduate-level work, according to the Institute of International Education. Over the past decade, the number of Chinese undergrads at American colleges has grown nearly 900 percent.But the very popularity of overseas study may be undercutting its rationale. Nearly 240,000 South Korean students went abroad last year, equal to roughly 7 percent of the college population. About one-third of that number was in the United States. With such a large share of students overseas, any edge that a foreign degree gives a South Korean graduate could be blunted.\u201cMaybe the novelty of studying in America has worn off,\u201d said Vincent Flores, an education adviser with the Fulbright Commission in Seoul.While the share of China\u2019s college-age population that goes abroad remains small, one in every three foreign students in the United States is Chinese. Some American colleges are so well known for their large Chinese enrollments that they\u2019ve spawned a joke, said Jordan Dotson, who advises students in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen about the American college-application process. \u201cIf you want to improve your Chinese, go to America, because you\u2019ll have many, many classmates from Beijing,\u201d he said.If the surfeit of Chinese students at certain institutions risks turning some students off, others may be discouraged by the difficulty of getting into elite American colleges, despite excellent grades and test scores. To put it in perspective, this year some 150 students from a single top Shenzhen high school competed for admission to a handful of select American colleges. That nearly equals the total number of international students in Harvard\u2019s freshman class.If they are rejected by leading American colleges, Mr. Dotson\u2019s students will attend highly ranked institutions outside the United States, including the University of Hong Kong, the University of Toronto and Yale-NUS College in Singapore. Next year, he said, their younger classmates might not even bother applying to America. \u201cThe top kids understand that it\u2019s tougher for them to get into U.S. universities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s insanely competitive.\u201dIf getting into college is competitive, so, too, is the job market awaiting graduates in both countries.In South Korea, the employment rate for college graduates has fallen to just 60 percent in a shaky economy. Graduates of vocational programs have better job placement. In China, it\u2019s a numbers game: With seven million graduates, the unemployment rate for the class of 2013 is nearly 18 percent, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.A foreign degree was supposed to benefit job seekers in a tight market, but now it might even be a disadvantage.Returning students often find that they lack the connections needed to land a job, said Mr. Choi of SUNY-Korea. Despite the growing numbers of international students, most career-services offices at American institutions are focused on placing students closer to home.\u201cIn Korea, kinship is important. It\u2019s a very relational society,\u201d Mr. Choi said. \u201cYou have to have a good network in your school to get a job. Those students who study in the States don\u2019t.\u201dThe first of the surge of Chinese undergraduates at American colleges are only now beginning to return home. But a study of earlier Chinese returnees working in venture capital found that they were actually less successful than their counterparts who had remained at home, a finding that the study\u2019s author, Wei Sun, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore, attributed to a possible mismatch in skills and weaker social networks.A survey last year by Zhilian Zhaopin, a Chinese recruitment firm, found that 70 percent of employers would give no hiring preference to overseas-educated applicants; nearly 10 percent said they would prefer not to hire them.The Chinese have a name for those who return home after studying or working abroad: \u201cHaigui,\u201d or sea turtles, referring to those with one foot in the homeland, another overseas. But now a new term is catching on for those who have gone abroad: \u201cHaidai,\u201d or seaweed, referring to those who float between two countries and cultures, unable to anchor in either.Of course, not all the reasons behind the declining interest in study abroad are negative. One important factor is that educational opportunities once obtainable only overseas are now more readily available at home.The South Korean government has emphasized improving English- language instruction in the schools, and many South Korean universities are now offering classes taught in English.Both South Korea and China have a growing number of joint partnerships with international universities, like Mr. Choi\u2019s employer, SUNY-Korea, that allow students to earn foreign degrees without the expense of going abroad. Educational exchanges have also picked up between the two countries, giving students an international experience while remaining in the region.Each country has also invested heavily in research, spending on top-notch laboratories and world-class faculty. It is probably no coincidence that the first signs of declining enrollments in the United States appeared in graduate courses: The number of South Korean graduate students in the United States has been dropping since 2010, and the Council of Graduate Schools recently reported that graduate applications from China were down for the second year in a row.South Korean universities have historically preferred to hire faculty members with degrees from abroad, said Jae-Eun Jon, of the Higher Education Policy Research Institute at Korea University. But that is changing and, as a consequence, particularly in science and engineering, \u201ctop students really debate between Korea and the United States for graduate school,\u201d she said.Some of the factors influencing foreign study trends are beyond anyone\u2019s control. South Korea\u2019s economy took a body blow in the recent economic downturn. The country also has the world\u2019s lowest birthrate; by next year, it could have more available slots at its universities than students. In China, because of the government\u2019s one-child policy, there will be 60 percent fewer people aged 20 to 24 by 2030 than in 2010.For American colleges, any changes in South Korea and China may not be an immediate problem. Declines in enrollment from South Korea are often offset by rising student numbers from China or elsewhere. Many observers do not expect Chinese enrollments to crater any time soon. There are still too few places at Chinese universities to meet demand and the number of programs and schools designed to prepare students to go abroad seems to keep expanding.Indeed, research by Peter G. Ghazarian, a professor of education at Keimyung University in South Korea, suggests that there may actually be untapped demand for an American education in both China and South Korea. In surveys, he found, more students list the United States as their destination of choice than actually study there.Still, few expect South Korea to return to the strong growth it enjoyed in the middle of the past decade. And many believe that it is not a matter of whether Chinese enrollments hit a speed bump, but when.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain\u2019s Discontent Lifts Populist Party to Even Stronger Vote Tally Than Expected", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Voters in Britain sent a forceful message of discontent to established political parties on Friday, as returns from local elections showed an even stronger following than expected for the anti-European Union, anti-immigration United Kingdom Independence Party.The results had an immediate impact across the political spectrum, hurting the Labour Party as well as the partners in the governing coalition, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. The outcome is likely to increase the pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron to take an even harder line on reducing the powers of the European Union.The local vote is expected to presage another strong showing for the Independence Party in elections for the European Parliament when those votes are counted late on Sunday. Some opinion polls showed the party with slightly more support than the other parties in the European voting, which took place on Thursday, the same day as the local balloting.In Britain, the strong showing for the Independence Party will not only leave Mr. Cameron, a Conservative, further embattled, but will also embolden Labour Party critics who say that their leader, Ed Miliband, has not convinced voters of his leadership capacity.The Liberal Democrats, known for their strength locally, and their leader, the vocally pro-European Nick Clegg, were hit very hard by their usual voters, who are unhappy with the compromises of a coalition government.Nigel Farage, the Independence Party\u2019s leader, said it was now \u201ca serious player,\u201d adding, \u201cThe UKIP fox is in the Westminster henhouse.\u201d He appeared on British television for interviews dressed in a sober gray suit, but he celebrated with his trademark pint of beer, and said he would run for the British Parliament in the general election next May.Mr. Wilders, whose party had been expected to top the Dutch voting, attributed his poor showing to a low turnout of around 35 percent.Still, despite its sweeping gains in the local British elections, the Independence Party will not control a single local council and does not have a single member in Parliament. Nor does it have a coherent set of economic policies. But Mr. Farage\u2019s message \u2014 British values, British beer, controls on immigration from within the European Union and a British exit from the bloc \u2014 is clearly resonating with disaffected voters from across the spectrum who are angry about the cost of living, the drop in real income and years of austerity.A similar message is echoed by other anti-Europe and more far-right parties, including the National Front in France and the Five Star Movement in Italy.The Independence Party has already proved itself to be an alternative to the status quo, being to the right of the Conservatives but trying to avoid, or repress, the racism of far-right parties like the British National Party. It has touched a nerve with Britons who believe that jobs are being taken away by immigrants from countries like Romania, Bulgaria and Poland who have the right to travel and work freely within the European Union but are willing to work for lower salaries.The party could deny the established parties an overall majority in the general election a year from now, with Tories especially concerned that the Independence Party will take away enough votes to block their victory in tight election districts.\u201cUKIP should be extremely pleased with themselves,\u201d said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cBut they still face this enormous hurdle of the electoral system, which is going to make it very difficult for them to convert even this level of support into parliamentary seats in 2015.\u201dMr. Clegg, who debated Mr. Farage twice and was considered to have been bested, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong antipolitics mood around, a restlessness and dissatisfaction with all the main parties.\u201d He said he would not resign as the leader of the Liberal Democrats.Mr. Cameron said he took away \u201ca clear message\u201d that \u201cpeople want us to deliver more on issues that frustrate them and frustrate me.\u201d He promised \u201cto work flat out to deliver more on the economy, immigration and welfare.\u201d He also vowed that he would not make any kind of electoral pact with the Independence Party.In the latest local results, with 154 of 161 councils declared, Labour had gained 292 seats, the Independence Party had gained 155, the Liberal Democrats had lost 284 and the Conservatives had lost 201.Though Labour, the main opposition party, also made gains, they were not as large as expected, and the Independence Party\u2019s advances, which included some in traditional Labour heartlands in the north, spread alarm through Labour\u2019s ranks, as well as those of the two governing parties.Despite important gains in London and some other parts of the country, Labour would normally hope to be polling better a year ahead of a general election. Mr. Miliband said he had taken note of the anxieties of those who opted for the Independence Party. \u201cI am determined that over the next year we persuade them that we can change their lives for the better,\u201d he said.But except in areas of the southeast, the Independence Party\u2019s vote appeared to be spread thinly, which means that it could emerge from 2015 with no parliamentary seats. In the British system, each election district has its own vote, and national percentages of the vote do not matter.In the past, the party\u2019s share of the vote dropped significantly in general elections. In 2010, it registered about 3 percent, a year after European elections in which it took more than 16 percent.The rise of the party seemed implausible eight years ago, when Mr. Cameron, newly elected as the Conservative Party leader but not yet in power, described it as \u201ca bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists.\u201dIn all, 4,216 seats in 161 local councils in England and 462 seats in 11 local councils in Northern Ireland were up for election.

Governors from states including Maryland, New York and Washington are pushing for ways to combat what they say are dangerous threats to their state\u2019s economic and environmental future, citing worries of rising sea levels, drought and snowmelt.Eight states so far have passed legislation calling for the reduction of carbon emissions in the coming decades, though none with plans as ambitious as California\u2019s. Nine Northeastern states along with California have adopted cap-and-trade policies for the largest greenhouse-gas-emitting industries.Last month, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington signed an executive order to create a cap-and-trade program similar to California\u2019s and updating the state\u2019s emission limits.\u201cThis is not a hypothetical thing for governors on the West Coast \u2014 this is fire alarms and floods,\u201d Mr. Inslee said Monday in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a next-century issue. This is a next half-hour issue.\u201dSome East Coast leaders have also sounded alarms: In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has praised proposals to improve state utilities to reduce emissions and has begun to issue warnings to investors in the state that climate change poses a long-term risk to the state\u2019s finances. Gathering support from other state and national leaders for stricter environmental regulations has been a cornerstone of Mr. Brown\u2019s efforts. This summer, he plans to travel to Mexico as part of a trade mission and plans to press leaders there to sign a pledge to reduce greenhouse gases.In an effort to start \u201caligning our economy and our way of life in California with the demands of nature as we now understand them scientifically,\u201d as Mr. Brown put it, he intends by 2025 to have about 1.5 million electric cars on California\u2019s roads \u2014 a fraction of the state\u2019s 32 million vehicles, but a big step nonetheless. The goal will require cooperation from other states to encourage the purchase of such vehicles.

He\u2019d ask, \u201cAre you boasting or complaining?\u201d It was excruciating, but useful. Even now, I can still hear his voice, and his question, whenever I lament something that someone else might find enviable. I\u2019ve been traveling so much I can\u2019t get any work done! The carpenters renovating our house are making so much noise I can\u2019t think! A friend calls them first-world problems, rich people problems. Low-level movie star problems.Late last year, The New Republic published an essay by Lionel Shriver that raised the bar for the boast-complaint. The author of several well-received and popular novels including \u201cWe Need to Talk About Kevin,\u201d Shriver confessed only half ironically to a longing for that vanished time when she was broke, unknown and insecure, before she was required to endure \u201cmultiple-hour interviews with Dutch and Belgian periodicals,\u201d lavish dinners, awards ceremonies and appearances at literary festivals all over England, in Bali and Singapore.I\u2019m still waiting to reach the point at which the necessity of talking about my work in idyllic tourist destinations makes it hard to get to my desk. So who knows? At that point, I may discover that Lionel Shriver is right. Poor her. Poor me.Meanwhile, the advantages of even modest success \u2014 let\u2019s call it solvency \u2014 are obvious. You can pay the rent. You can pay for food. A gifted young actress once told me she wanted, more than anything, to \u201cbe able to afford a plant.\u201d You can also write in the time you might otherwise have spent waiting on tables. We know about Kafka toiling away at the insurance company and Melville at the customs house, but nobody who has ever tried it believes that working at a job all day and trying to write a novel in the evenings and on weekends is easy.The demands that success can make on one\u2019s time are only part of the problem. Going to dinner is a choice; even the most beloved writers are rarely threatened or bullied into attending literary conferences in gorgeous holiday destinations.The bigger problem is the ease with which the public can seep into the private and poison the writer\u2019s work, like some kind of toxic spill. The more time an artist spends onstage, talking about himself, the harder it is to shed the residue of being onstage when it\u2019s time to be alone and get back to work. Even lab rats know that the more you get rewarded for doing something, the more attractive it is to do the same thing again. It\u2019s good to meet one\u2019s readers, but it\u2019s also necessary to leave them at the door of the office \u2014 whispering about what they liked or didn\u2019t, what they didn\u2019t understand or took to heart, how nice it would be if your next project were a lot like your last.Success and the lack of it, and how it affects anyone, in any field, is one of those things about which we can\u2019t do all that much. A lot of it is random: talent, work, timing, a roll of the dice and a twist of fate. It\u2019s a blessing to be able to pay the bills doing what you love. That just seems like an obvious fact, neither a boast nor a complaint.\u25c6 \u25c6 \u25c6By Mohsin HamidIn our glaringly unequal world, commercial success seems a panacea. It frees the infinitesimally few writers who achieve it to write.For writers in our thoroughly marketized global culture and economy, the draws of commercial success are clear. As Virginia Woolf wrote 85 years ago: \u201cA woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction,\u201d circumstances likely \u201cout of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble.\u201dHer words apply to men today as well. Ours is a glaringly unequal world. Money and a room of one\u2019s own are distant prospects for many young writers. Commercial success seems, therefore, a panacea. It frees the infinitesimally few writers who achieve it to write.It can also serve as a validation. In Pakistan, when a stranger asks what I do and I say I am a writer of fiction, the most common response is an expression of respect (even, or perhaps especially, when the stranger is unfamiliar with my work). Writers in Pakistan \u2014 at least when they\u2019re not being intimidated or killed \u2014 benefit from the value society has long placed on poets, who are considered spiritual, moral and emotional guides. Poetic traditions remain vitally important in places where few were historically able to read and write.But in America, by contrast, probably the most common response I receive when I say I am a writer is a query about how my books have sold. (A movie adaptation seems to reassure people; I\u2019ve taken to carrying a DVD with me to convince immigration officers of my bona fides when I travel.) Plenty of people \u2014 and not only in the United States \u2014 question whether novels matter any more. Against that backdrop, commercial success can mean not just freedom to a writer, but also relevance.And yet, for many writers, myself included, commercial success is somewhat suspect. Few can have expressed their ambivalence better than Mark Haddon, who remarked upon the bestseller-dom of his book \u201cThe Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\u201d: \u201cWhen it started to sell really well, I thought it was great. And then it started to sell really, really well, and so many people liked it, and I thought . . . it\u2019s like you want to be Radiohead, then you think, . . . I\u2019ve accidentally turned into Coldplay.\u201dAs those who have experienced it know, commercial success involves a great deal of luck. (How else to explain, for the same book, sales in Bulgaria that dwarf those in Romania, even though Bulgaria has only a third as many people?) But there\u2019s a tendency to start pretending luck is deserved when you\u2019ve had some, to believe the claque and unthinkingly measure your work by standards other than your own. We can all name brilliant writers whose brilliance evaporated right after they became rich and famous. The correlation is often so tight as to suggest causation.Writing fiction is, in many ways, like a religion. It is a daily practice, a way of life, a set of rituals, an orientation toward the universe. It is a communion with the intangible, a bridge between the finite and infinite. There\u2019s a reason religions use stories to communicate, and it\u2019s the same reason religions persecute storytellers: Stories are powerful. They are how we make sense of what cannot be known.So imagine a situation in which you were paid to pray, and in which a few of the devout were given huge payouts for their devotion. This does happen. It corrupts religions. And it corrupts writers too. In the words of the poet Jalaluddin Rumi: \u201cIf you want money more than anything, / you\u2019ll be bought and sold. / If you have a greed for food, / you\u2019ll be a loaf of bread. / This is a subtle truth: / whatever you love, you are.\u201dIt\u2019s a radical thought, but I wonder whether in some way we professional fiction writers might be better off if, like poets of old, we were to make nothing from our writing and had to earn our living elsewhere. Radical or not, it\u2019s how most writers actually live today, working their day jobs, and writing \u2014 unpaid, alone, with passion \u2014 at night.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beware the City Dolls", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOMMENCEMENT season is upon us again. In a tenuous economic recovery, many of the 1.6 million graduates at American colleges and universities will be listening intently for a bit of practical wisdom from their commencement speakers.My own graduation was devoid of this rite. I dropped out of college at 19 and spent my 20s as a traveling musician. I finally finished my degree by correspondence just before my 30th birthday. On graduation day, instead of marching across a stage, I marched out to the mailbox to pick up my diploma. My commencement address was a reminder, muttered to myself, to take my car in for inspection.In the years that followed, after a great deal of traditional graduate school, I became a university professor. Between delivering a few commencement addresses and listening to many more, here is what I believe graduates need to hear today.1. Earn everything.It\u2019s true that graduates today face a rough economy. Americans in their early 20s have to contend with a 10.6 percent unemployment rate \u2014 that\u2019s twice the rate among people age 25 and up. If still searching for a job, you might envy your classmates whose wealthy or well-connected parents can give them a comfortable life.2. Don\u2019t be a \u201ccity doll.\u201dIn his magnificent 1841 essay \u201cSelf-Reliance,\u201d Ralph Waldo Emerson scorned elite college graduates \u2014 he called them \u201ccity dolls\u201d \u2014 who wallowed in self-pity if they didn\u2019t immediately land the prestigious job to which they felt entitled. Emerson contrasted them with the \u201csturdy lads\u201d who hailed from remote civilizations \u2014 such as New Hampshire.As Emerson wrote, \u201cA sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always like a cat falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls.\u201dThe Roman philosopher Seneca wrote that \u201cdifficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.\u201d Don\u2019t meet obstacles with victimhood and self-pity. Welcome them, especially early in life, as opportunities to grow in resilience and virtue.3. Fight for people who have less than you.In John Bunyan\u2019s classic \u201cThe Pilgrim\u2019s Progress,\u201d the character Old Honest poses this riddle to the innkeeper Gaius:Gaius interprets the verse as follows:In the case of charitable giving, taking this advice is straightforward: Get out your checkbook (even if you can write only a little check). In many other areas, such as one\u2019s work, it is less clear. In my work today, I promote the free enterprise system, because I believe it has created more opportunity for the poor than any other system in history.Examine your conscience each night by asking not what others say about your work, but rather by asking yourself whether you believe your work today benefited those with less than you. Make sure your honest answer is yes.4. Think for yourself.For many graduates, life after college feels like the first time your destiny has been entirely in your own hands. Unfortunately, other people will immediately start trying to force you into a new script. Some will measure your worth by the money you earn. Others will label you a victim of inequality because you earn less than someone else.Don\u2019t let yourself be defined in these materialistic ways. Measure your life\u2019s value as you see fit. You might choose to feed the hungry, manage a firm, coach a team, or front a band. But whatever the life, boldly live it on your own terms. Put aside envy and resentment and pursue happiness.A sturdy lad \u201cwalks abreast with his days,\u201d to quote Emerson once more. \u201cHe does not postpone his life, but lives already.\u201dThere you have it. Earn everything, fail well, fight for others, and think for yourself. Live already.And don\u2019t forget to take your car in for inspection.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "There\u2019s Nothing Wrong With Being a Banker", "Date": "2014-05-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst PersonI have something unfashionable to say: Banking is a fine career choice for today\u2019s college graduates.Like a lot of people, I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do when I finished college in 2005. I was interested in politics and policy, but as I applied for jobs in Washington I found that the entry-level work was dull and poorly paid. I considered going to law school, but I was unsure I wanted to be a lawyer and didn\u2019t want to spend $160,000 on a degree I might not use. So I did what a lot of Harvard students were doing at the time: I took a job in New York with a bank that came to campus to recruit.\u201cIt makes them too risk-conscious,\u201d Mr. Roose said. \u201cIt gets them used to a standard of lifestyle they may not be able to replicate in any other industry. And it has a deleterious effect on creativity. Of the eight people I followed, a few came out very damaged by the experience. And not in a way a vacation can cure. It\u2019s not about having bags under your eyes. It destroys your ability to think in creative ways about what it means to build something of value.\u201dThat wasn\u2019t my experience. My work as a commercial real estate banker at Wells Fargo helped me develop analytical and communication skills that have served me well as a policy analyst and as a reporter. I\u2019m not a banker anymore, but I\u2019m very glad I was one.It\u2019s not that Mr. Roose is wrong; I know lots of miserable bankers. The difference between them and me was that I found the right job at the right bank. In large part that was luck, but the good choice I stumbled into can be replicated on purpose. The key is to find a job where work-life balance is good, the business strategy is responsible and the product is useful to the real economy so you can take your job skills with you if you leave finance.I did a number of different things at Wells Fargo, but the core of my work was writing memos arguing that making a loan was a good idea, either to internal approvers at the bank or to lenders at other banks who might participate in our deals. Preparing those memos involved reviewing a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative information to understand a project. I had to learn about developers, markets and types of real estate that were new to me. I had to condense that information into a concise package for an audience that was smart but busy and not always expert on the subject matter. And then I had to defend the arguments in person.I worked on 20 different real-estate transactions in my first year, which meant I learned quickly and got a lot of practice. That turned out to be extremely good preparation for my subsequent career in policy research, and for my job as a reporter. I developed writing and presentation skills and specific topic knowledge that I still use today.And at Wells Fargo, being a junior banker didn\u2019t mean a terrible work-life balance. I typically worked about 50 hours a week. For my work, I was paid at an annual rate of $85,000 in my first year and $125,000 in my third, including bonus. That\u2019s not as much as the Goldman Sachs analysts I knew were making, but it\u2019s about as much per hour, and in any case it\u2019s a lot of money for a 23-year-old.Most important, my work at Wells Fargo was both analytically challenging and socially useful. There are lots of bankers doing work that is detached from the nonfinancial economy or harmful to it. I wasn\u2019t one of them. Real estate project finance is essential for creating the built environment where we live and work, and we got to see tangible results as the buildings we financed were built.Of course, a lot of real-estate finance circa 2005 fostered bubbles and encouraged bad investment choices by businesses and consumers. But Wells Fargo\u2019s unusually conservative lending practices made it among the financially strongest large American banks during the 2008 crisis.Doing something socially useful isn\u2019t just good for a young banker\u2019s self-esteem; if you\u2019re not doing something that\u2019s useful for the real economy, you\u2019re probably not learning skills that you can take with you outside finance.Three years later, I quit banking. I wasn\u2019t passionate about lending, as I am about public policy. I didn\u2019t like talking to clients, which was going to become a problem as I advanced in my career. But mostly, I thought after three years that I had learned most of what I was going to learn from being a banker. I took a job at a think tank, writing analyses of state budgets, before eventually turning to reporting.Far from making me overly risk-averse or destroying my ability to think creatively about what it means to build something of value, banking made me a sharper thinker, a clearer writer and a better reporter. A few years in finance doesn\u2019t have to be soul-sucking; it can be great preparation for your post-finance career. The key is to be the right banker at the right bank.A domestic correspondent for The New York Times. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Battle to Overcome Euro-Skeptics", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyWhen European Union leaders dine in Brussels on Tuesday, conversation is likely to revolve around three P\u2019s: the poll that has just finished, priorities and people.Many of those sitting around the table, including President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, will have received a drubbing in the European Parliament elections. They will want to reflect on how to respond to the rise of euro-skepticism in many European Union countries. There are basically four main options: stick with the status quo; push for further European integration; unravel some of the integration that has already been achieved; and change the European Union to increase competitiveness.The main underlying source of disenchantment is the recession still gripping some parts of the European Union. Given the high level of unemployment, particularly among the young, and the likely slow pace of economic recovery, the status quo option should be quickly ruled out.Some leaders still hanker for deeper economic integration within the euro zone the way infants cling to a security blanket. But it is hard to see how ideas like pooling debts and appointing a euro zone finance minister will create jobs and growth. It is even harder to see how governments could secure democratic legitimacy for the further centralization of power \u2014 given both the rise of euro-skepticism and the hardship caused by their last big integration project, the creation of the euro currency.What, then, about unraveling some of the integration that has already occurred? Decentralizing power would speak directly to a prime concern of some euro-skeptics: that the European Union is meddling in things best left to nation-states. True, but what exactly should be decentralized? A popular demand from some sections of the electorate is to roll back the free movement of people within the European Union. But this would be a terrible mistake, as well as unpopular in other countries.The free movement of people is one policy that has actually prevented the economic crisis from getting worse. People have emigrated to places that are generating jobs. Last year, for example, 727,000 people moved to Germany from the rest of the European Union and 201,000 moved to Britain.Although there will not be a consensus on curbing the free movement of people, it may be possible to get agreement on combating so-called benefit tourism. The number of people crossing borders to claim benefits is pretty small. But politicians in countries like Britain, Germany and the Netherlands want to tighten the rules anyway. Still, this is at best a political rather than an economic priority.By contrast, a determined assault on excessive bureaucracy is an economic priority. The European Union should not make decisions in areas that are best left to nation-states. That is not just because such interference is unpopular, nor even just because it imposes unnecessary costs on the economy; it is also because the European Union gets so distracted doing things it should not be doing that it then fails to do properly the things it should focus on.Prioritization is not just about choosing what to do; it is also about choosing what not to do. The European Union\u2019s leaders need to keep this in mind when they think about the five-year mandate they wish to give the next European Commission.Meanwhile, in looking at what to do, the priority should be to increase the European Union\u2019s competitiveness. The main things that can help at the European Union level are to complete the single market, especially in services where it is currently patchy; to cut free-trade deals with the United States, Japan and China; and to build a modern financial system based more on capital markets than banks.There is a chance of reaching a consensus on such an agenda. After all, Britain, Scandinavian countries and East European states are traditionally in favor of markets; Germany is lecturing others on the importance of competitiveness; and many crisis-hit countries have been forced to embrace market reforms whether they like it or not. France is the only big country that will not like this agenda, but even its objection to free-market reforms is weakening.If the European Union leaders can agree on priorities, there will still be the question of the third \u201cP\u201d: people. Who will implement the agenda? The European Union needs a crack team to run the European Commission. Too often, the commission\u2019s president and the other commissioners have been second-rate politicians.The snag is that neither of the candidates leading in the polls before the election, the so-called Spitzenkandidaten \u2014 the center-right\u2019s Jean-Claude Juncker and the center-left\u2019s Martin Schulz \u2014 is inspiring. They might be fine if the European Union needed the status quo. They might even be fine if it needed another integration drive, as both are federalists. But neither is suited to the task of decentralizing power and increasing competitiveness.The choice of a new commission is likely to provoke a clash between the European Union\u2019s leaders and the newly elected European Parliament, as both have a role in the selection. The Parliament is likely to back one of the Spitzenkandidaten. But the leaders should reject them both and propose somebody with international stature like Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, or Pascal Lamy, until recently the director general of the World Trade Organization. The European Union needs to achieve a lot. It should aim high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Plan Aims to Draw Immigrants With Technology Skills", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama administration, looking to make adjustments to the nation\u2019s immigration system while broader legislation is stalled in Congress, announced plans on Tuesday to allow the spouses of some highly skilled temporary immigrants to work in the United States.The proposed rule changes were announced with fanfare by Alejandro Mayorkas, the deputy secretary of homeland security, and Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, who said they would help the country attract and retain immigrants with skills in technology and science, and \u201cunleash more of the extraordinary contributions that immigrants have always made to America\u2019s innovation economy.\u201dThe proposals address visa rules that have long caused difficulties for the spouses of skilled immigrants, mainly from China, India and the Philippines, who are working here on temporary visas known as H-1B. The spouses, mainly wives, often have skills and education, too, but are not authorized to work in the United States, causing their careers to languish.High-tech employers welcomed the plans. Fred Humphries, a vice president at Microsoft, one of the biggest users of H-1B visas, said they would have \u201ca positive economic impact.\u201dThe proposals will be subject to a 60-day period of public comment that could lead to changes. Homeland Security officials said they hoped to issue final regulations by the end of the year.The announcement drew criticism from several sides in the immigration debate. Some immigration lawyers and immigrant advocates said the proposals were too narrow. Republicans on Capitol Hill said the opposite, that they were a new example of executive overreach by President Obama.H-1B workers number in the hundreds of thousands at any given time. The new rules would grant work authorization only to spouses of H-1B visa holders who had taken the first steps to apply for permanent-resident green cards.Immigrants can work in the United States on H-1B visas for six years. While they have those visas, employers may apply for them to receive employment-based green cards.The proposed rule changes acknowledge the huge backlogs that have developed for those green cards. The current wait for most immigrants from India is at least 11 years. Filipinos wait as long as seven years and people from China up to six years. The immigrants can remain in the country while they wait, and with the changes, their spouses would be able to work during that waiting period as well.Mr. Mayorkas said the changes would benefit as many as 97,000 immigrants in the first year and about 30,000 a year after that.Representative Judy Chu, a Democrat who represents a California district with many immigrant communities, praised the proposals as a good \u201cfirst step\u201d that would protect immigrant families.\u201cDenying spouses the right to work is an ill-conceived policy that has gone on for too long,\u201d Ms. Chu said.But Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, accused the Obama administration of a \u201clack of compassion and understanding\u201d for American workers who have lost jobs because \u201ccompanies prefer to hire lower-paid workers from abroad.\u201dMr. Grassley also questioned whether the president had the legal authority to change the rules. \u201cWhere will this administration stop?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat other categories of individuals will be granted work authorizations?\u201dA broad immigration bill that passed the Senate last year included major changes to the H-1B program, including a provision that would allow the spouses of all H-1B visa holders to work. The House has not taken up that bill, and it remains unclear if it will move on any major immigration measures this year.Many immigration lawyers were frustrated that the administration\u2019s proposal would not grant work permits to all H-1B spouses.\u201cIt is a rather miserly grant,\u201d said Angelo Paparelli, a lawyer at Seyfarth Shaw in California. \u201cOther countries are clamoring to get the best and the brightest. Why are we not doing more?\u201dAustralia and Canada are among the countries in the global competition for highly trained workers in science, technology and engineering that have more generous policies for the families of those immigrants.Demand for H-1B visas has remained strong. This year, the annual limit of 85,000 visas was reached within one week after the application period opened.An article on Wednesday about an administration plan to attract more immigrants with technology skills referred incorrectly to the circumstances under which foreigners working in the United States on temporary H-1B visas can obtain employment-based permanent resident green cards. Employers can apply for the green cards at any time during the six-year term of the H-1B visas; they do not have to wait until the end. (Immigrants cannot apply for themselves.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forecasting a Speedup in Growth, the Fed Again Cuts Bond Purchases ", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve continued to retreat from its stimulus campaign on Wednesday, saying it was looking past the economic slowdown during an unusually cold winter because growth already was rebounding.As expected, the Fed announced after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee that it would pare its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by another $10 billion, to $45 billion a month beginning in May.The statement, while affirming the Fed\u2019s intent to stop buying bonds later this year, offered no new insight into the next decision the Fed must make: when to start raising short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008.There was, however, a hint that the Fed\u2019s deliberations were more interesting than its declaration. The Fed also said on Wednesday that its board held an unscheduled meeting Tuesday morning to discuss \u201cmedium-term monetary policy issues.\u201dThe last such meetings, in 2011, were followed by an announcement of the Fed\u2019s plans for the retreat that is now in progress. Officials have said that some adjustments are necessary, and analysts said they expected more information on the discussions in an account of the meeting the Fed will release in three weeks.The statement Wednesday from the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making group of the Federal Reserve, offers its assessment of current economic conditions. At the last meeting, in mid-March, Fed officials saw economic weakness as being driven by winter weather. This time, they affirmed that view, and now view the economy to be growing faster.\u201cThe main takeaway from this report is simply that the Fed continues to feel confident about the economic recovery, notwithstanding the disappointing growth performance\u201d in the first three months of the year, Millan Mulraine, deputy head of United States research at TD Securities, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.Markets showed little interest in the Fed\u2019s latest statement, which was largely the same as the statement the policy committee released after its last meeting in March. \u201cNothing to see here,\u201d was the summary offered by Barclays Capital.The committee has reduced monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at each meeting since December, reducing the volume of purchases to $55 billion in April from $85 billion each month last year. It is on pace to end the purchases with a single cut of $15 billion when the policy committee meets in October, or a final cut of $5 billion in December.The Fed has failed since the Great Recession to achieve its stated goals both for inflation and employment, and it is likely to be reminded of those failures in the coming days. The government will provide a new estimate Thursday of the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of price inflation, followed Friday by the April jobs report.Yet Ms. Yellen and other officials forecast that the Fed\u2019s current policies would return both to healthy levels by the end of 2016.The official unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in March, well above the minimum sustainable level, which the Fed estimates as between 5.2 percent and 5.6 percent. But officials have expressed satisfaction with the trend of declining unemployment, even as they acknowledge it most likely overstates the health of the labor market. The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively looking for work, and many people without jobs have stopped looking for new ones.In the weeks before this meeting, some Fed officials instead emphasized their concern about the slow pace of inflation. The Fed\u2019s preferred measure increased just 1.1 percent over the 12 months through February, well below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent annual target, although the Fed continues to forecast that inflation will rebound as the economy recovers.

{"Headline": "Capitalism Eating Its Children", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Guildhall at the heart of the City can be a lulling sort of place after a long day. The statuary and vaulted timber ceiling of the medieval great hall lead the eye to wander and the mind to muse on Britain\u2019s strangest quirk \u2014 its centuries of continuity. Grace is said, claret is served, glasses clink and dreaminess sets in. A keynote speech from a central banker is all that is required to complete the soporific effect.Or so one would think, until Mark Carney, the Canadian governor of the Bank of England, lays into unfettered capitalism. \u201cJust as any revolution eats its children,\u201d he says, \u201cunchecked market fundamentalism can devour the social capital essential for the long-term dynamism of capitalism itself.\u201dAll ideologies, he continues, are prone to extremes. Belief in the power of the market entered \u201cthe realm of faith\u201d before the 2008 meltdown. Market economies became market societies. They were characterized by \u201clight-touch regulation\u201d and \u201cthe belief that bubbles cannot be identified.\u201dCarney pulls no punches. Big banks were too big to fail, operating in a \u201cheads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble.\u201d Benchmarks were rigged for personal gain. Equity markets blatantly favored \u201cthe technologically empowered over the retail investor.\u201d Mistrust grew \u2014 and persists.\u201cProsperity requires not just investment in economic capital, but investment in social capital,\u201d Carney argues, having defined social capital as \u201cthe links, shared values and beliefs in a society which encourage individuals not only to take responsibility for themselves and their families but also to trust each other and work collaboratively to support each other.\u201dA stirring through the hall, a focusing of gazes \u2014 Carney has the attention of the chief executives, bankers and investors gathered here for a conference on \u201cInclusive Capitalism.\u201d His bluntness reflects the fact that, six years after the crisis, the core problem has not gone away: The deep unease and anger in developed countries about the ways globalization and technology magnify returns for the super-rich, operating in a world of low taxation and lax regulation where short-term gain becomes a guiding principle, even as societies become more unequal, offering diminished opportunities to the young, less community and a growing sense of unfairness.Anyone seeking the source of the anger behind populist movements in Europe and the United States (and the Piketty fever) need look no further than this. Anti-immigration, anti-Europe movements won in European elections because people feel cheated, worried about their children. As Bill Clinton noted a couple of hours before Carney\u2019s speech, the first reaction of human beings who feel \u201cinsecure and under stress\u201d is the urge to \u201chang with our own kind.\u201d And the world\u2019s greatest challenge is defining \u201cthe terms of our interdependence.\u201dThere is still a tendency to think politicians must do this work of definition. But in Nobody\u2019s World, driven by social media and global corporations, corporate leaders have more power to change things than elected officials. If short-termism prevails and the importance of social capital and community is dismissed, then anger will rise. Companies are not well served by boards that are too often, in the words of one participant, \u201cmale, stale and pale.\u201dCarney lays out the extent of the problem: \u201c40 percent of recent graduates in U.S. are underemployed and youth unemployment is around 50 percent in the worst affected countries in the euro area.\u201d His prescription: End through strict regulation and resilience tests the scandal of too-big-to-fail, where \u201cbankers made enormous sums\u201d and \u201ctaxpayers picked up the tab for their failures.\u201d Recreate fair and effective markets with real transparency and make every effort \u2014 through codes of conduct and even regulatory obligations \u2014 to instill a new integrity among traders (even if social capital cannot be contractual). Curtail compensation offering large bonuses for short-term returns; end the overvaluing of the present and the discounting of the future; ensure that \u201cwhere problems of performance or risk management are pervasive,\u201d bonuses are adjusted \u201cfor whole groups of employees.\u201dAbove all, understand that, \u201cThe answers start from recognizing that financial capitalism is not an end in itself, but a means to promote investment, innovation, growth and prosperity. Banking is fundamentally about intermediation \u2014 connecting borrowers and savers in the real economy. In the run-up to the crisis, banking became about banks not businesses; transactions not relations; counterparties not clients.\u201dIn other words, human beings matter. An age that has seen emergence from poverty on a massive scale in the developing world has been accompanied by the spread of a new poverty (of life and of expectations) in much of the developed world. Global convergence has occurred alongside internal divergence. Interdependence is a reality, but the way it works is skewed. Clinton noted that ants, bees, termites and humans have all survived through an unusual shared characteristic: They are cooperative forms of life. But it is precisely the loss at all levels of community, of social capital, that most threatens the world\u2019s stability and future prosperity. Advertisement"}

Geithner served as president of the New York Federal Reserve from late 2003 to 2008 and secretary of the Treasury from 2009 to 2013, and so sat near the center of the American financial system as it prepared to self-destruct. He then had a courtside seat to the global catastrophe. He has rich material to work with, and he has contrived to preserve its freshness. His inability as Treasury secretary to explain himself, or his actions, or the financial crisis, or his beliefs about financial reform, to the wider public will leave many readers, I suspect, feeling they are hearing his voice on these subjects for the first time.\u201cI had always been a backstage guy,\u201d Geithner writes by way of general explanation, but referring specifically to his first, spectacularly unsuccessful, public speech as Treasury secretary. \u201cI had spent my career behind the scenes. Ever since high school, I had dreaded public speaking. . . . I swayed back and forth, like an unhappy passenger on an unsteady ship. I kept peering around the teleprompter to look directly at the audience, which apparently made me look shifty; one commentator said I looked like a shoplifter. My voice wavered. I tried to sound forceful, but I just sounded like someone trying to sound forceful.\u201dGeithner is clearly more at ease, and more himself, on the page than on the stage or the screen \u2014 which is, for an American public figure, both odd and charming. So much so that I finished his book half wishing he had just skipped all of the public performances required of him as Treasury secretary and instead written out what he had to say and handed it to an actor \u2014 say, Denzel Washington \u2014 to perform. \u201cStress Test\u201d has surprising virtues \u2014 for instance, the skill with which Geithner draws his hard-to-describe main character. He thinks of himself \u2014 and on the evidence it\u2019s hard to disagree with him \u2014 as a fairly ordinary person thrust into a great many extraordinary situations. His mother was a card-carrying liberal; his father a Republican who spent his career working in nonprofits in poor countries, and who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 while his son was still in the Obama administration. The future Treasury secretary grew up everywhere and nowhere, a bit like a military brat, and came away from his childhood with a certain detachment from the American way of life: \u201cAt a local supermarket in suburban Virginia one summer, I was stunned to see an entire aisle stocked with pet food. It seemed bizarre in a world full of starving people.\u201dPolitically, Geithner was more or less born a left-leaning Republican and appears to have become a right-leaning Democrat. But his upbringing obviously left him with a resistance to political labels, or the need for a tribe. As a student at Dartmouth in the early 1980s, he would have called himself a Republican, but \u201cwithout much conviction.\u201d He felt faintly hostile to the frenzy around him of right-wing student political activism. \u201cAfter The Dartmouth Review . . . published a McCarthy-style list of gay students on campus, I ran into a Review writer named Dinesh D\u2019Souza at a coffee shop and asked him how it felt to be such a [expletive].\u201dIn general, Geithner comes across as the sort of young person who had no particular idea of himself until the world forced him to have one. His lack of a need for self-definition \u2014 hinting at an unusual capacity, perhaps, to live with uncertainty \u2014 extended to his career. He apparently didn\u2019t feel much personal ambition, at least in the beginning. Oddly, for a Republican Ivy League graduate of the 1980s \u2014 and even more oddly for a future Treasury secretary \u2014 he found Wall Street pointless and the business world faintly ridiculous. He had no particular interest in money. \u201cI did endure one job interview with a management consultant, whose first question was about how I would turn around a small failing beer company,\u201d he writes. \u201cI had no idea.\u201dAfter going to graduate school in international studies at Johns Hopkins, he hopscotched a path into the world of important people who float between the public and private sectors. His first square was Henry Kissinger, who gave him a job as an analyst at his consulting firm. The square that changed his life was Larry Summers, then a Treasury under secretary, who clearly saw in Geithner someone who would at least pretend not to be intimidated by him. But this part of the Timothy Geithner story \u2014 his rise in the world of important people \u2014 remains a bit vague. I found myself wishing he had spent more time exploring his magical transformation from charmingly bewildered young person to unsentimental pragmatist in a suit, who airdrops with great authority into other people\u2019s financial catastrophes.At any rate, the more or less perpetual global financial crisis that he helped deal with \u2014 the run on the Mexican peso, the run on Southeast Asian currencies, the Russian default and so on \u2014 obviously gave him his identity: crisis manager. He became one of the guys who kept their heads as others lost theirs, defined less by what he was than by what he was not: in trouble. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, joked (and as Geithner quotes him joking): \u201cTim was present at all the crises. But he didn\u2019t cause the crises. The crises caused him.\u201dFrom the bare facts of the American financial crisis, many different narratives have already been spun. They can be classified by whom they blame: Wall Street bankers, feckless American debtors, government incompetence, the Chinese. \u201cThe fundamental causes of this crisis were familiar and straightforward,\u201d Geithner writes. \u201cIt began with a mania \u2014 the widespread belief that devastating financial crises were a thing of the past, that future recessions would be mild, that gravity-defying home prices would never crash to earth.\u201d The causes of the crisis, in other words, were the same old-fashioned madness of crowds and extraordinary popular delusions responsible for every panic dating back to the Dutch mania for tulip bulbs. The entire society \u2014 including all the big banks and some nonbank financial firms, like the insurance company A.I.G. \u2014 simply ignored risk.The story Geithner goes on to tell blames everyone and no one. The crisis he describes might just as well have been an act of God. Basically no one noticed what was happening inside the financial system until after it happened. A few of the important people with a privileged view expressed concerns about the risks being taken, but most said nothing. Geithner counts himself in the minority. \u201cI began asking questions about capital: Do our banks really have enough?\u201d he writes, adding, \u201cI was more worried than many of my colleagues, but I was not nearly worried enough.\u201d His role in the run-up to the crisis was a bit like that of first mate on the Titanic, after the ship has been put on irreversible autopilot, and the captain has gone off to drink with the rich guys in first class.Once the ship hits the iceberg, Geithner becomes more central to the action. Home prices fall, the risk-takers are exposed as delusional and, in the ensuing panic, there\u2019s a run on the entire financial system. His job, as he sees it, is to do what he can to plug the hole, and to cram as many people as possible into lifeboats, without worrying too much about appearances. But he is immediately faced with an appearance problem: Before he can save any women and children, he has to rescue the drunks in first class who owned all the lifeboats. \u201cTo solve a major financial crisis,\u201d he writes, \u201cyou have to do things you would never do in normal times or even in a modest crisis. . . . What feels just and fair is often the opposite of what\u2019s required for a just and fair outcome. It\u2019s why policy makers generally tend to make crises worse, and why the politics of crisis management are always untenable.\u201dInterestingly, Geithner has little sympathy for those who wanted to see Wall Street bankers held accountable for whatever it was they had done. \u201cOld Testament vengeance\u201d is his pet phrase for such moralistic sentiments, and he argues persuasively that if he had indulged them, the crisis would only have caused more economic pain and suffering for ordinary people. He thinks it was a mistake, for example, to allow Lehman Brothers to fail in September 2008, and writes that he would have prevented it if he could have. (He claims the Treasury and Federal Reserve lacked the authority to save it.) He says President Obama very quickly grasped the merits of ignoring the desire for vengeance, and didn\u2019t ask him to pursue some other, more punitive strategy. As if to ensure that no one leaves confused about his point of view on all this, Geithner argues at the end of his book that the only serious weakness of the Dodd-Frank financial reform measures is that they don\u2019t give the federal government enough power to bail out banks in future crises.Geithner sees the government\u2019s response to the financial crisis mainly as a great success \u2014 though he of course understands that a lot of people don\u2019t agree with him. (\u201cWe did save the economy, but we lost the country doing it.\u201d) He clearly thinks people ignore the facts and judge with feeling rather than reason. He himself is careful with the facts. For example, he points out several times that most people seem to believe that the Treasury\u2019s injection of capital into the financial sector cost the taxpayer a fortune when in reality the investments yielded a projected profit of $166 billion. (But he doesn\u2019t mention that the jury is still out on the effects of the less overt but more expensive subsidies flowing from the Federal Reserve.) He finds it silly that many people believe Dodd-Frank changed nothing important. (Yet he never explains why the roughly 5 percent capital ratio it demands of the big banks is anything like a magic number for bank safety \u2014 and he does not mention the powerful case recently made by the economists Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig that the right number is at least 20 percent.)Geithner seems genuinely to believe that the details of the behavior inside the financial industry are largely irrelevant \u2014 that investors who bought subprime mortgage bonds simply suffered from the same misconceptions as everyone else. But he doesn\u2019t begin to explain why, if investors were so numb to risk, Wall Street went to such lengths to disguise that risk. Why did our financiers stuff so many bad loans into incomprehensibly complex securities that even sophisticated investors were unlikely to understand, and then pressure deeply conflicted ratings agencies to declare them risk-free? Subprime mortgage bonds, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligation synthesized from those credit default swaps, the gaming of the rating agencies, along with the screwed-up behavior of financial elites that seem to me to lie at the heart of the financial crisis, Geithner deems scarcely worth mentioning. His job as financial crisis manager was in part the psychological manipulation of financial markets. It\u2019s odd how little interest he appears to have in the people who work in them.Finally, he seems to believe that the American financial system is now more or less fully reformed. Those who think the root cause of the crisis was the bad incentives of financiers are unlikely to be persuaded. They made vast fortunes from their colossal failure. There\u2019s no reason they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t try to fail so well all over again.But that\u2019s the wrong note to end on. There\u2019s hardly a moment in Geithner\u2019s story when the reader feels he is being anything but straightforward \u2014 a near-superhuman feat for someone who spent so much time in public life defending himself from careless and dishonest personal attacks. The decisions he made are easier to criticize than they are to improve upon. I doubt many readers will put his book down and think the man did anything but his best. On his feet he might have stammered and wavered. That in itself was always a sign he was unusually brave.STRESS TESTReflections on Financial CrisesBy Timothy F.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Here: Climate Change in America", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:America is finally waking up to the reality and the magnitude of the climate crisis. Climate-related disasters will continue to affect our communities as warming increases, and people will continue to wake up. It\u2019s not going to just go away.At some point, soon I hope, a revenue-neutral carbon tax will become politically possible. Revenue would be returned to taxpayers, rewarding those who emit less carbon and stimulating change throughout our economy and infrastructure.It\u2019s too late to stop global warming, but how bad it gets is still up to us.Let\u2019s leave something for our children. Let\u2019s do what we need to do. To those who keep bringing up jobs: If we innovate a world beyond coal, oil and natural gas, our economy will benefit enormously.If we continue chasing the nightmare of fossil fuels, we will certainly continue to decline. A revenue-neutral carbon tax is the best way to jump-start innovation.\u00a0The writer is a postdoctoral scholar in climate science at the California Institute of Technology.To the Editor:In recent months the scientific community has acknowledged that the worst-case scenarios are increasingly likely, and that past projections were far too conservative. Yes, we will likely see three feet of sea-level rise by the end of this century. Yes, even six feet cannot be ruled out.One reason that people are so ambivalent about climate change is that previous warnings were far too tentative, making the problem seem both small and remote. In fact, the problem is dire and immediate. I hope that people will start to listen now that climate change is literally right in front of our eyes, and the melting of the ice in Greenland and Antarctica is already occurring much faster than initially projected.To the Editor:Most people accept that climate change is occurring and that the consequences over the next 100 years will be devastating for agriculture, water supplies and for coastal cities. Whether we can prevent climate change is more debatable. But we should be taking steps now to mitigate future anticipated damage. Why aren\u2019t we?California is prone to periodic droughts, deluges and infrastructure-destroying earthquakes. Yet we have delayed projects like the Bay Delta Conservation Plan that would ensure a steady supply of water from the north to the dry south. Why? Because of the same mentality that prevents us from becoming more proactive in mitigating climate change: short-term cost concerns and politics.We are cursed with the intelligence to see the future, but not the emotional maturity to do much about it.To the Editor:Our nation and planet need leaders who are informed about climate change if we are to stand a chance of addressing the problem. Mr. Huntsman\u2019s anecdote about the North Carolina congressional debate in which all the Republican candidates denied the fact of climate change illustrates our failure to ask the right questions.Everyone needs to answer: \u201cOn what climate studies or data is your belief based?\u201d This will help voters judge whether this is an informed opinion or simply a surrender to ignorance. I call on the press to help us better vet those who wish to lead us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin's Game Could Redraw Asia Politics", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 \u201cCheckmate.\u201dAs Vladimir V. Putin signed Russia\u2019s historic $400 billion gas-supply agreement with China, he must have felt the satisfaction of a chess grandmaster revealing the inexorable outcome of a complicated endgame. In theory, the next phase of the chess game between Russia and the West in Ukraine will begin with the Ukrainian presidential election on Sunday, but Mr. Putin\u2019s positioning of the pieces means the outcome is preordained, no matter who emerges as the next president in Kiev. No wonder that the Russian stock market and the ruble have both rebounded, with the MSCI Russia index gaining 20 percent in dollar terms since its low point on March 14. Having secured the territorial windfall of Crimea in March, Mr. Putin went on to achieve his main tactical objective in April. This was to destabilize Ukraine to the point where nobody could seriously contemplate the country\u2019s joining the European Union, much less NATO. Just as important, from Mr. Putin\u2019s standpoint, the combination of internal chaos and improvised referendums with Russian military exercises on the Ukrainian border distracted Western attention from the Crimean issue. They also deflected the threat of additional sanctions.Now that a presidential election looks as if it will pass without major violence, it is hard to see what arguments the West would present for tightening sanctions or how Western countries would find the unity to do this, if they did try. Thus the incorporation of Crimea into Russian national territory has, in effect, been accepted by the world as an irreversible fait accompli. Given the strategic significance of the Crimean city of Sevastopol as a naval base, not to mention the Russian people\u2019s affection for Crimea as a vacation, retirement and cultural destination, the restoration of Crimea would, on its own, guarantee Mr. Putin\u2019s political popularity for many years to come. But this week the news for Mr. Putin got even better.Russia\u2019s strategic gains in Crimea and Ukraine were already apparent by early May, which was when the Moscow stock market and the ruble started rapidly rising. But now the United States and Europe have delivered Mr. Putin another, even bigger, economic and geopolitical windfall: the prospect of a Chinese-Russian partnership to balance NATO and the American alliances in Asia.A few months ago, neither Moscow nor Beijing would have imagined a Eurasian partnership possible or even desirable. And against a different diplomatic background, this week\u2019s Chinese-Russian gas agreement might have been just another trade deal, with no great geopolitical significance apart from its effects on energy prices in various parts of the world. But things look very different in the light of recent global confrontations, not only between the West and Russia over Ukraine, but also between the United States and China over Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines and, most recently, cyberespionage. When we consider the Western diplomatic ineptitude responsible for these events, culminating in Washington\u2019s decision to issue arrest warrants for leading Chinese military figures the very day Mr. Putin arrived in Shanghai, the energy deal between Russia and China becomes potentially much more important. Perhaps Mr. Putin\u2019s trip to Shanghai could even be the start of a strategic realignment between nuclear superpowers comparable to the tectonic shifts that began with President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to China in 1972. Although such a suggestion may seem far-fetched and grandiose, there are five reasons Western leaders are overoptimistic and shortsighted simply to dismiss this idea, as they have invariably done in the past.The first is that China is obviously a rising superpower while Russia is a declining one. This means both will inevitably experience frictions with the hegemonic powers that currently dominate global politics and economics. Since Russia is declining, its frictions will mainly involve encroachments on what Russia sees as its economic or territorial prerogatives by United States allies in Europe (which is how Russians see the present confrontation over Ukraine).Since China is a rising power, it will create frictions by encroaching on American allies in the Pacific. In both cases, Russia and China will find themselves opposed by the United States.A second reason to worry is the decline of American dominance, not because the United States is becoming economically or technologically weaker but because the American public is disillusioned with foreign adventures and no longer willing to act as the global police. This means that United States allies can no longer realistically rely on the United States to deter Russia and China, especially in minor territorial disputes, even if American protection is theoretically \u201cguaranteed\u201d by treaties on mutual defense. A third reason to take a Chinese-Russian axis seriously is the natural fit between these two countries\u2019 economies, military capabilities and even their demographics. Russia has excess resources but a shortage of manpower; China faces the opposite problems. Russia is strong in advanced military technologies, aeronautics and software but very weak in mass production of consumer goods and electronic hardware. China has the converse strengths and weaknesses. Fourth, a strategic partnership between China and Russia, the world\u2019s second-largest and sixth-largest economies (based on the purchasing power parity of their currencies), could attract other countries, especially in Asia, that are unable or unwilling to commit themselves to Western standards of political democracy, corporate governance, trade and financial openness and safety of consumer products. Fifth, and perhaps most important, a new element has suddenly been injected into superpower relationships by the events in Ukraine, combined with President Obama\u2019s unexpected belligerence to China during last month\u2019s trip to Asia.While Chinese and Russian leaders have historically distrusted and even disliked one another, they are starting to dislike the United States even more. Russia\u2019s reasons are obvious. In the case of China, there was less distrust until the United States suddenly turned up the heat on cyberespionage and territorial disputes in the China Seas. Perhaps Washington\u2019s confrontational behavior is just a brief aberration. But if Mr. Obama continues to needle and provoke China, he will not just be making a historic blunder \u2014 he will be playing straight into Mr. Putin\u2019s strategy. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everything You Need to Know About Thomas Piketty vs. The Financial Times", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast Friday afternoon, The Financial Times released an expansive report accusing Thomas Piketty of doing shoddy analysis of data on wealth inequality for his best-selling book, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d In the six days since, economists and writers around the world have produced many thousands of words on the controversy. Outsiders have weighed in on the newspaper\u2019s case, the newspaper responded, and Mr. Piketty, on Thursday, provided his first detailed defense.So where do things stand? How much do the criticisms by The Financial Times hold up, and should \u201cCapital\u201d continue to be viewed, as many reviewers have argued, as a definitive volume on inequality of income and wealth in advanced nations?Here, we review the claims and counterclaims and conclusions one can draw about L\u2019Affaire Piketty.Who is Thomas Piketty, and why should anyone care about this book?He is a French economist who has done groundbreaking work parsing old tax data and other historical records to try to discern the (very) long-term trends around inequality of wealth and income. He and other scholars, notably his frequent collaborator Emmanuel Saez, have helped answer questions that society previously had few good answers to. Namely, how much of the wealth in various advanced nations has been held by the top 1 percent at various times in history?In \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d published in the United States in March (and in France last year) Mr. Piketty combined that data work with some literary criticism, philosophy, theory and prognostication for a sweeping look at the past, present and his expected future of inequality of wealth and income. It has been on the New York Times best-seller list for six weeks, including three in the No. 1 spot. This is not common for a book about economics, and this one happens to be 696 pages.What is in dispute?Some of its critiques centered on what the newspaper characterized as mistakes and modifications to data that appear arbitrary and without consistent justification \u2014 but do not undermine the core findings of his work.A response from Mr. Piketty, published on his website on Thursday, said that these were not in fact mistakes, but choices he made to try to make the data more accurate, and which were cataloged (along with his reasons for making them) in technical notes accompanying his data.Another line of criticism is that Mr. Piketty cherry-picked a source of data for British inequality that gave a distorted picture of the trend there in recent decades. The data source Mr. Giles argues would be more reliable paints a very different picture, indicating that the share of wealth held by the top 1 percent in Britain is 44 percent, not 71 percent, and has been flat in recent decades.Mr. Giles takes issue with Mr. Piketty\u2019s use of estate tax data from British authorities, writing that the authorities producing that data explicitly say it is best not used for purposes of comparing wealth trends over time. He argues instead for a survey of wealth in Britain, which he concludes is more reliable evidence.If the data Mr. Piketty relies on for Britain is indeed deeply flawed \u2014 and Mr. Giles\u2019s preferred approach more accurate \u2014 it would undermine Mr. Piketty\u2019s broader argument.Mr. Piketty acknowledges that the data he used to measure British inequality, from estate tax returns, is imperfect. But he says that using Mr. Giles\u2019s preferred data source isn\u2019t a good way to go, because it is not comparable to data from earlier periods. The data for decades past are based on estate tax data, not surveys. Moreover, he notes that other research using different methods has also pointed to rising inequality in Britain in recent decades, making the result from Mr. Giles\u2019s approach inconsistent with other evidence.What can we be comfortable in concluding about wealth inequality?The evidence for one of Mr. Piketty\u2019s key points is overwhelming: Income inequality has risen significantly in the last few decades in both the United States and Europe. Data on the concentration of wealth is less reliable, and that is the crux of the dispute. Even with wealth, though, we can be reasonably confident that it is becoming more concentrated in the hands of the top 1 percent in three of the four countries Mr. Piketty studies most closely (the United States, Sweden and France). It is British wealth inequality that is in dispute.Has Mr. Piketty acknowledged any errors?Not really. Mr. Piketty concedes no outright errors in his original work, though he acknowledges that many of his choices can and should be subject to debate and are worth refining further.And he says he could have done a better job disclosing his methods and reasons for data adjustments. For example, in addressing one piece of early 20th-century Swedish inequality data that Mr. Giles argued was in error, Mr. Piketty wrote, \u201cI agree that this adjustment should have been made more explicit in the technical appendix and Excel file.\u201dWhat broader lessons can be drawn from this controversy about the nature of social science, historical research and the search for truth?Quite a few! But this is the biggest one: The work by Mr. Piketty and others trying to study economic history is challenging for a lot of reasons, not least that good economic data is generally unavailable for anything more than the most recent few decades. So researchers must use whatever sources available, frequently old tax filings, to try to come up with some estimate of how things were in an earlier era.The problem is, to make that data useful \u2014 and particularly to make it comparable to more recent data that is collected in a rigorous and transparent way \u2014 scholars have to make hundreds of adjustments to account for various factors that could throw off the numbers. To cite one of many adjustments that was at issue in the recent controversy: If you want to know what the level of wealth inequality was in 1930s France based on estate tax data, you must use some mechanism to deal with the fact that the people paying the estate tax are, well, dead, and probably don\u2019t precisely line up with the wealth trends of all people who were alive at the time.Because scholars must make countless assumptions to find useful data, there are countless opportunities for either conceptual error or willful manipulation. In that sense, the casual reader is trusting the researcher to make those judgments in a consistent, logical way that is not intended to tilt the data one way or another.Any other points?Is this debate over?We hope so. The Financial Times vs. Piketty back-and-forth began last Friday afternoon, and now has spanned about a dozen separate articles, posts and ripostes. That doesn\u2019t even count the commentary on their dispute around the Internet (including here at The Upshot). The point of diminishing marginal returns of further debate around these relatively narrow issues seems to have set in.So who won? Is \u201cCapital\u201d a reliable guide to the past, present and future of global inequality, or is it a schlocky polemic based on cherry-picked data?If we had to summarize the consensus that has emerged on L\u2019Affaire Piketty, it goes something like this. Mr. Giles raised worthwhile issues about Mr. Piketty\u2019s methods that are fair to debate. But Mr. Piketty\u2019s response also makes clear that Mr. Giles\u2019s approach has flaws of its own and shows less inequality in Britain than there actually is.Indeed, Mr. Giles\u2019s results point to a world at odds not just with Mr. Piketty\u2019s data, but also with that by other scholars and with the intuition of anyone who has seen what townhouses in the Mayfair neighborhood of London are selling for these days. That doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Giles is wrong \u2014 the whole point of academic research is to gain something more solid than intuition \u2014 but the idea that the whole of Mr. Piketty\u2019s argument rests on a few shaky assumptions seems unfair to the Frenchman.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forget 1960, the Golden Age Is Now", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the RoadIf you fly a lot, you have heard the nostalgia about a long-gone Golden Age of air travel. During this fabled time, which is said to have occurred as commercial aviation expanded through the 1950s into the jet age of the 1960s, passengers dressed up to fly on airplanes where glamorous stewardesses wearing white gloves served beef bourguignon on fine china.Baloney.The Golden Age of air travel is actually today \u2014 if you are among the lucky ones flying in first class or business class on a premium international airline. Even as you read this, air travelers around the globe are slumbering contentedly through a night at 37,000 feet, having been tucked into bed by doting flight attendants on airplanes where the food is haute cuisine, the wine is vintage and the price ... well. O.K., consider the price.If you wish and are a person of means, you can fly first-class round trip in luxury between Los Angeles and Dubai on an Emirates Airline A380 superjumbo jet. You will enjoy superb food and drink and be cosseted in a private compartment with a sliding door, a lie-flat seat with mattress, a vanity, a personal minibar and flat-screen television set, and a luxury bathroom down the aisle where you can take a shower. The fare: $32,840.\u201cIf you have the money, you can buy more choice,\u201d said Rene Foss, who has been a flight attendant for a major airline since 1985. \u201cSo if you choose to spend $10,000 or $20,000 or however more, you can have that private berth. And if you don\u2019t have the money, you have a different choice in service. It\u2019s called main-cabin cattle car,\u201d said Ms. Foss, who wrote \u201cAround the World in a Bad Mood,\u201d a book of humorous observations, mostly from the cattle-car section.Ms. Foss\u2019s late mother, Maxyne, was a flight attendant on the old Northwest Orient Airlines during the putative Golden Age of the 1950s. Ms. Foss still has her mother\u2019s mementos, including menus of multicourse meals available throughout the plane, and even a pair of those white gloves. She also has a brochure for the legendary two-deck Pan Am Stratocruiser Clipper service on four-engine propeller airliners. Amenities included a women\u2019s lounge with \u201clovely leather walls,\u201d seven-course meals catered by Maxim\u2019s of Paris and \u201cfor the ladies \u2014 orchids.\u201dAt a time of anxiety about flying, airline advertisements emphasized customer service and safety. A 1958 ad for United Air Lines, reproduced in \u201cCome Fly With Us: A Global History of the Airline Hostess\u201d by Johanna Omelia and Michael Waldcock (Ailemo Books, 2013), shows a stewardess fixing the necktie of a small boy and boasts of extra personal attention \u201cwhen a traveler needs a hand.\u201d The ad continues: \u201cThe extra care is evident, too, in the fact that there is radar on every plane.\u201dOn the other hand, flying at all in this former Golden Age was mostly limited to those who could afford high prices, before intense competition and fare-cutting accompanied deregulation of the industry in 1978. Technology, including elaborate premium cabin and in-flight entertainment innovations, began more sharply delineating first and business class from coach when British Airways and Virgin Atlantic introduced lie-flat beds in luxurious new international business-class cabins in the mid-\u201990s.\u201cSince then, it\u2019s astonishing how much money and research has gone just into the development of new seats,\u201d Ms. Foss said. \u201cBack in the \u201950s there was none of that. It was more like, here\u2019s a drink with a paper umbrella in it and a nice meal; enjoy yourself while we get this plane up in the air and down again.\u201dIn recent years, as global airlines scrambled to attract the lucrative high-end business travel market, many international airlines shrank or even eliminated cabin space for first class, in favor of expanding and upgrading business-class cabins. So while some people do still choose to pay for that $32,840 private compartment, much of the high-end market now is in business class, where airlines have been spending huge sums to compete.\u201cWe were the first airline to introduce in-seat entertainment for business-class passengers; a spa in the airport lounge; limo transfers \u2014 and now some of these things are the industry norm,\u201d said Craig Kreeger, the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, which, like some other airlines, provides chauffeur-driven cars to and from the airport for passengers in international premium cabins.His airline, which is making final cabin touches on a fleet of new Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes, invites some of its top frequent fliers to participate in discussions on luxury amenities in development, and even had some of them \u201cstay overnight in our test facility to test out the onboard beds,\u201d Mr. Kreeger said.Virgin is among the global airlines that routinely turn up on travel-media lists of the top 10 business-class services. Others usually include Singapore, Cathay Pacific, British Airways, Emirates, Etihad, Korean, and Qatar. Airlines based in the United States seldom appear on such lists, but all of the major domestic carriers are investing heavily to upgrade premium cabins.They are also increasing luxury amenities in premium cabins on long domestic flights. Edward H. Bastian, president of Delta Air Lines, said, \u201cAll of our New York-Los Angeles flights will feature our premium flatbed products starting July 1.\u201d Delta plans to increase its premium-class revenue stream by $500 million a year in the next three years, he said.As luxury expands, competition has helped limit prices, at least in business class. Round-trip business-class fares across the Atlantic have fallen from highs in the $10,000 range six or seven years ago. A recent check on Orbitz showed remarkable uniformity. Whatever the airline, round-trip business-class fares between Kennedy Airport in New York and Heathrow in London were $6,474. Coach fares were $1,471. Fares for premium economy, or economy plus \u2014 a better class of coach \u2014 were about half of business-class prices.After airlines introduced premium economy fares, many business travelers whose companies would not pay for international business-class travel found it easier to get approval for that higher level of coach travel, with extra legroom and better service. But rather than eroding the far more profitable business-class market, premium economy has mostly elevated business travelers from the deprivations of basic coach.The International Air Transport Association says the number of passengers who flew in first class and business class on world airlines grew 4.1 percent in February from February 2013. Premium passengers now account for about 8.3 percent of all passengers, though that is down from about 9.5 percent in 2007.Paul Metselaar, the chief executive of Ovation Corporate Travel, said premium-class travel strengthened late last year. \u201cMy clients are mostly the high-end corporate deal makers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur clients across the board are traveling much more globally, and much more in general. Most, I would say, are flying business, with all the top folks still flying first class.\u201dThe new Golden Age of air travel will include spacious enclosed first-class compartments on Etihad Airways\u2019 A380 aircraft, each with a reclining armchair and an 80-inch long bed, the airline announced recently.Today, luxury is not confined to the plane. Airlines and airports have introduced premium services for the affluent, including a sumptuous private terminal in Frankfurt, where a private limousine drives first-class Lufthansa passengers across the tarmac to the plane, and the new $15 billion Hamad International Airport in Doha, managed by Qatar Airways, a leader in premium flying.She was recently upgraded to luxury business class on an international Qatar Airways flight and was driven in a private car from the plane at Doha to the terminal. \u201cYou can make the argument that for select fliers on select top-tier carriers, this is definitely the Golden Age \u2014 if you\u2019re wealthy,\u201d Ms. Kirby said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the top 1 percent at most. For most of us, we have this kind of race to the bottom in economy class.\u201d She said she feared that the back of the plane on international flights might become even more unpleasant as airlines consider buying slimmer seats to cram more customers into coach.Ms. Foss, the flight attendant, says that economics drive the rapidly growing inequality in air travel. As competition grew and fares fell after deregulation, air travel became \u201caffordable for everybody \u2014 which in a sense was wonderful,\u201d she said.With their intense focus on attracting the relatively small number of fliers who pay top prices for levels of luxury never before seen in air travel, airlines are simply following the money, Ms. Foss said. But no matter what, all fliers are sharing a small aluminum tube miles above the earth.Because they can pay for luxury service, \u201csome people are V.I.P.s,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be pampered; they\u2019ll get a special this, a special that. I don\u2019t get into that mind-set. My job as a flight attendant is primarily to ensure safety.\u201dIn a crisis, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not pulling out the V.I.P.s first, not when my job at the door is to get everybody out in 90 seconds or less. At that point, everybody on the airplane is a V.I.P. to me.\u201dA picture caption on Thursday with the On the Road column, comparing the amenities of modern luxury air travel to those of past decades, misidentified the destination of the Panagra DC-6 airliner shown. It was going to South America, not to South Africa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top State Judge Tightens Rules on Debt Collection", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York State\u2019s chief judge announced on Wednesday that he would institute new court rules and protocols that would make it more difficult for debt collection companies to win default judgments and would offer more protection to debtors.In a speech in Albany, the chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, said the more than 130,000 debt collection lawsuits filed each year in the state were rife with problems that undermine the due-process rights of debtors, the majority of whom lack legal representation. As a result, many debtors are never served papers and learn they have a judgment against them only when their bank accounts are frozen or their wages are garnished, the judge said. In addition, he said, the mass-produced lawsuits all too often rest on flimsy documentation because the debts have been bought and sold several times on a vast secondary market.\u201cYou wind up with big judgments against people that half the time have no basis in fact,\u201d the judge said in an interview. He said the changes were intended to make debt collectors \u201creach certain evidentiary standards under the law.\u201dConsumer lawyers have long criticized the legal tactics of debt buyers, who purchase large portfolios of delinquent credit card or auto-loan debt, often for pennies on the dollar, then file multiple suits with boilerplate language and a spreadsheet of the debts. Such suits usually lack proper documentation of each debt\u2019s origin, history and amount. Those companies also excel at what Judge Lippman called the \u201cnefarious practice of sewer service,\u201d consumer lawyers say. That is when debt collectors falsely claim the debtor has been served with papers and then win a default judgment when the person fails to come to court. More than half of the consumer credit cases in New York State end in default judgments.The new rules would make those practices nearly impossible, Judge Lippman said. To win a default judgment, creditors will now be required to submit documents detailing the chain of ownership of the debt, as well as affidavits from people having personal knowledge of that history. \u201cNo more robo-signing,\u201d Judge Lippman said. \u201cNo more affidavits riddled with hearsay allegations.\u201dThe courts will also now require a creditor to attest in a sworn statement that the statute of limitation has not expired on a debt. To cut down on \u201csewer service\u201d abuses, creditors will now have to give the court a stamped envelope bearing the debtor\u2019s address, and the court will send out a notice of the lawsuit, Judge Lippman said.The state\u2019s administrative board of the courts, led by Judge Lippman, has approved the new rules and published them for public comment. They are expected to go into effect on June 15. Mark Schiffman, a vice president at ACA International, the trade association for the debt collection industry, said debt buyers were hamstrung in legal proceedings by the documentation the original lenders provided them. Still, he predicted debt collection businesses in New York would adapt to Judge Lippman\u2019s reforms, which will not be retroactive. \u201cWe have got to be careful that none of this takes consumers off the hook for rightfully owed debts,\u201d Mr. Schiffman said. But Susan Shin, a staff lawyer for New Economy Project, a nonprofit that provides aid to debtors, said that because the business model of many debt-buying companies depended on filing a large number of lawsuits and winning default judgments, the companies did not always do enough due diligence to ensure that mistakes were not made. Virginia Jenkins, 75, a retired department store employee from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, received an alarming pair of letters in March: JPMorgan Chase informed her that the bank account containing her life savings had been frozen; Midland Funding, a debt buyer, wrote to say it had a court judgment against her for $6,000.Mrs. Jenkins had never borrowed that amount on her credit cards, which she paid off religiously, her family said. Neither had she ever been served with court papers, even though Midland Funding later claimed in court that it had delivered papers to a middle-aged woman at her address. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know what it was about,\u201d Ms. Jenkins\u2019s daughter, Michelle, said. \u201cHer first thought was, \u2018I have lost everything.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Michelle Jenkins sought help for her mother from a legal services organization. A month later, a court ruled that Midland Funding\u2019s evidence was too thin, threw out the judgment and dismissed the suit. \u201cYou have creditors who know the law like the back of their hand, who know how to manipulate it,\u201d Michelle Jenkins said. \u201cAnd you have people that don\u2019t know these things.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobless Claims Fall More Than Expected ", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, indicating that the labor market was strengthening despite a run-up in initial applications in previous weeks.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 319,000 for the week ended May 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday.The decline reversed three weeks of increases in jobless claims.Economists had forecast first-time applications for jobless benefits falling to 325,000 last week.The four-week moving average for new claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market conditions as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,500, to 324,750. It remained at levels consistent with an improving labor market.Employment growth averaged more than 200,000 jobs per month in the first four months of the year, with employers in April adding 288,000 jobs to their payrolls, the most since January 2012.\u201cClaims, in conjunction with Friday\u2019s employment number, show that we continue to see an incremental improvement in the labor market,\u201d said Ron Sanchez, director of fixed-income strategies at Fiduciary Trust Company International, referring to the Labor Department\u2019s May 2 report on April employment figures. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3 percent last month, compared to 6.7 percent at the end of 2013. The decline has also been aided by people dropping out of the labor force.The Federal Reserve\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said on Wednesday that conditions in the labor market had improved \u201cappreciably,\u201d but she added they still remained far from satisfactory.Economists said starting May with a downward trajectory in jobless claims raised the chances of another month of employment gains above the 200,000-job threshold.\u201cIn fact, we expect the level of filings to fall back to the 300,000 mark within the next few weeks, which will be broadly consistent with the economy creating jobs in the 200,000-to-225,000 range on a sustained basis,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.The report showed the number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid fell 76,000, to 2.69 million, in the week ended April 26.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Seek Issues to Lure Midterm Votes After Races Buoy G.O.P.", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats could build on this distrust, the research showed, by emphasizing support for policies such as equal pay for men and women, ensuring that corporations pay a fair share of taxes, and increased job opportunities in the United States.The research also found that an effort to increase the minimum wage \u2014 a recent top priority of congressional Democrats and the White House \u2014 is not by itself enough to motivate swing voters to go to the polls and back Democrats in the fall.Mr. Israel presented the extensive findings to a meeting of House Democrats on Wednesday morning, the day after six states \u2014 Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Oregon and Pennsylvania \u2014 held primaries. The primaries showed that incumbent Republicans in the House and Senate are beating back challenges from the right in this election cycle, leaving Democrats fewer opportunities to take on either weakened incumbents or more conservative contenders who can be vulnerable in the general election.If the pattern continues, it will reduce the playing field for Democrats and increase the need for them to make their strongest case in races where they are competitive.Following the presentation to Democrats, some incumbents pressed for more guidance on how to move ahead with the strategy, while others expressed their belief that the minimum wage increase needed to remain a central part of their appeal.The Democrats\u2019 six-figure research project, begun to help the party find a way to spur midterm turnout, will shape the party\u2019s strategy over the coming months. It involved four separate pollsters and included a special focus on Hispanic and African-American voters, going well beyond previous efforts by the campaign organization. It covered 67 House districts, included 16 focus groups, and tested various advertising attacks and themes.Democrats say the most heartening finding was that economic themes that rally committed Democratic voters also serve to encourage unaffiliated voters and the so-called drop-off Democrats, those who voted in the presidential election but might not vote this year. In contrast, the research suggested to Democrats that the conservative issues that stir committed Republican voters tend to turn off centrist voters both parties are fighting over.\u201cWe are fortunate that we can use messages to both universes of people,\u201d said Jefrey Pollock, the president of the Global Strategy Group, a Democratic pollster who worked on the project, noting that Republicans \u201ccan\u2019t talk to their right wing\u201d without alienating independent voters.Republicans say that they believe they have the upper hand in the overall battle for the House and that Democrats remain on the defensive over the Affordable Care Act and the continuing slow recovery of the employment market.\u201cI\u2019m confident that with so many outstanding recruits in districts all across the country, and with the wind at our backs, that we will continue to expand the playing field and rise to this challenge,\u201d Mr. Walden said.Democrats expressed surprise that he would put down such a definitive marker months before the election and said that their new data helped them formulate a game plan that should keep them competitive, given some advantages at the field organizing level and in party fund-raising. Democrats this week reported again that they had outraised House Republicans and that they retain an edge of more than $11 million in available cash.Republicans have their own research programs, and on Thursday, a group of conservative scholars and writers are to present a manifesto in Washington in an effort to prod the party into offering policies that are more attractive to middle-class voters.Democratic consultants, in their research, tested several advertisements with voters and found that the most effective one featured a fictitious Republican congressman who backed the government shutdown but continued to collect his check while the House gym remained open. It accused the make-believe House member of being more interested in the perquisites of office than representing his constituents.Democrats said the advertising response showed that while the shutdown seems like history in current political terms, it remains a powerful negative for Republicans when it is linked to the benefits of office.\u201cYou can expect to see a pairing of the two, Republicans protecting their perks while turning their backs on the middle class,\u201d Mr. Israel said.While the minimum wage was not a driver for swing voters, the polling of Hispanic voters showed that a wage increase was a winning issue with that constituency, which saw the economy as its most important issue.On health care, Democrats said the research reinforced their view that Republicans have been unable to make it the defining issue of the campaign.

{"Headline": "Poor Angry Magnetic Europe", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Europe at the centenary of the war that devoured it is voting in elections for the European Parliament that will no doubt reflect the anger, disillusionment and boredom of people inclined to cast their ballots for an array of protest parties, many from the xenophobic right, some from the pander-to-Putin left.Political sentiment across the Continent has converged at a grumpy and small-minded nadir. There is anger about high unemployment. There is pessimism over the future. There is irritation at immigration. There is alienation from the European Union. What, the chorus goes, has Brussels ever done for me? The answer, of course, is that it has brought peace, removed borders and spread once unimaginable prosperity. But this achievement is no longer enough or no longer deemed relevant.In some ways Europe\u2019s mood resembles America\u2019s. Focus has narrowed and solidarity atrophied. Europe, like America, does not want to die for anyone else. It has turned inward, wanting its own problems solved, and damn the Libyans and Syrians and Ukrainians and whoever else may be making demands through their plight.Anyone who believes the spread of freedom, democracy and the rule of law matters is a \u201cwarmonger.\u201d The sharing economy is in vogue because it affords a better deal on a car ride or a room. Sharing politics is not because it may involve sacrifice for faraway people with strange names.So the National Front in France, and the U.K. Independence Party in Britain, and Jobbik in Hungary and Die Linke (the Left) in Germany \u2014 parties from right and left that have expressed varying degrees of admiration for President Vladimir Putin and his homophobic irredentism (Russian-speaking gays need not apply for admission to the imperium) \u2014 are all likely to benefit from a diffuse anger, in which anti-Americanism mingles with general spleen.Never have the idea and the ideal of the 28-member European Union been so weakened, at least within its borders, to the point that several fringe parties take Putin\u2019s Eurasian Union with its promise of good times in Belarus seriously. Just outside the Union it is a different story. Europe is magnetic still. The dissonance between the Union as perceived by many of its more than 500 million citizens, and the Union as it is idealized and ached for by millions on its fringes or in faraway lands, is complete.On Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, known as the Maidan, where Ukrainians died in numbers to escape the rule of an incompetent kleptomaniac backed by Putin, the European Union flag flies in several places. It is equally visible on surrounding streets. It is draped down the facade of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. It stands for something important in Kiev, something that seems almost unimaginable to Europeans in the confusion of their bile: the glowing possibility of freedom and dignity and pluralism, the possibility of a normal life.\u201cEurope is a promise of liberty,\u201d said Nataliya Popovych, an activist in the Maidan movement. \u201cAs for Putin\u2019s Eurasian Union, we have been in that cage before. Why would we go back? Through Maidan Ukrainians killed Homo Sovieticus in themselves. In Russia and some parts of the east of Ukraine, Homo Sovieticus is still alive.\u201dBut Europe is suddenly full of what Germans now call the Putinversteher \u2014 literally someone who understands Putin, more loosely a Putin apologist. Europeans of different stripes see him standing up to America, incarnating \u201cfamily values,\u201d countering a loathed European Union, and just being tough. Germans in surprising numbers are discovering their inner sympathy for Russia, a complex emotion in which anti-Americanism, romanticism, guilt and gratitude for Moscow\u2019s acceptance of unification all play a part. The old temptation in Germany to look eastward is not entirely overcome after all.Europeans would do well to lift their gaze from the small world of their current anger toward those blue and gold flags fluttering on the Maidan, the better to recall what freedom means and with what sacrifice it has been attained.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Consumer Spending Drops Slightly", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American consumers cut back on spending in April for the first time in a year, taking an unexpected pause after a big jump during the previous month. The results, however, are unlikely to derail an expected spring rebound in the economy.\u201cIt is obvious that after an unseasonably colder January and February, consumers came out with a vengeance in March,\u201d Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients. \u201cSo, April\u2019s poor showing on the spending front is payback for a strong March.\u201dAlso on Friday, the University of Michigan said that its index of consumer sentiment fell in May as Americans grew more pessimistic about future pay increases, though they remained optimistic about the broader economy. The index dropped to 81.9 this month from 84.1 in April.Still, Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said that confidence in the first five months of this year had been at the highest level since 2007, before the recession began.Nearly half of all households expect their inflation-adjusted income to decline over the next 12 months, the survey found. And among those that did anticipate gains, most expect increases of just 1 or 2 percent.The figure from the Commerce Department reflects reductions in durable goods purchases and in services like utilities. While disappointed, analysts say the results do not change the broader upward trajectory of the economy and predict consumer demand to bounce back in May.An \u201cimproving job market should support stronger spending in coming months,\u201d Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.The Commerce Department report also showed that income rose 0.3 percent in April after advancing 0.5 percent in March. That was the fourth consecutive monthly climb. The economy has been generating jobs at a solid pace in recent months, including a gain of 288,000 jobs in April, the strongest uptick in hiring in two years.With spending down and Americans earning more, the saving rate rose in April to 4 percent of after-tax income, up from a saving rate of 3.6 percent in March.Inflation, as measured by a gauge tied to spending, showed prices rising 1.6 percent from a year ago, up from a 1.1 percent year-over-year price gain in March. However, even with the increase, inflation remains below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target.In April, consumers reduced spending on durable goods like autos by 0.5 percent. The drop followed a big 3.6 percent jump in durable goods spending in March. Consumers spent more on nondurable goods, a slight 0.1 percent increase, while trimming spending on services by 0.1 percent. Spending on services, which includes utility bills, had been rising rapidly during the winter, reflecting higher heating costs because of the severe cold in many parts of the country.Consumer spending remained strong through the first quarter, rising at an annual rate of 3.1 percent. But much of that strength came from increased health care spending, reflecting new enrollments through the Affordable Care Act.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Playing Down Any Alstom Move, Siemens Reorganizes and Makes Other Deals", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The head of the German electronics and engineering giant Siemens said on Wednesday that the company would not be strong-armed into acquiring the power units of its French rival Alstom, displaying notably less ardor for a deal than was shown by its rival General Electric.But Joe Kaeser, the Siemens chief executive, also acknowledged that the global energy business was undergoing radical changes that helped prompt the company to announce a sweeping reorganization on Wednesday that included eliminating a layer of management and shifting the headquarters of its own power units to the United States, where G.E. is based.During its most recent quarter, Siemens reported a 12 percent increase in profit and a flurry of activity, including the acquisition of the turbine and compressor units of the British company Rolls-Royce and a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan to supply equipment and services to producers of steel and other metals.While adopting a pose of studied coolness toward Alstom, Mr. Kaeser announced a widespread reorganization of Siemens that reflected huge shifts in the energy market and the balance of power in the world economy.G.E.'s bid for Alstom also reflects these changes. Countries around the world are reacting to global warming by trying to increase production of solar and wind energy. Countries are trying to make their power distribution networks more efficient and more flexible, creating a market for so-called smart grids. Big suppliers like G.E. and Siemens are trying to position themselves to take advantage of growth while also defending against new competitive threats, such as an aggressive push by Chinese companies into renewable energy.\u201cThe U.S. is the place to be for oil and gas,\u201d Mr. Kaeser said, \u201cand all the roads in the U.S. lead to gas.\u201dDuring a news conference in Berlin, Mr. Kaeser deflected numerous questions about Siemens\u2019s interest in competing with G.E. to buy units of Alstom that make equipment to generate and transmit electricity.G.E. has offered $13.5 billion for Alstom, which analysts say would strengthen the American conglomerate\u2019s position in markets like China and India, and in wind power.\u201cIt might turn out to be a significant advantage to have gained access to Alstom\u2019s customer base,\u201d Roberto Pozzi, a vice president at Moody\u2019s who follows the companies, said in an e-mail.But G.E. has met with interference from the French government, which has asserted what it sees as its right to broker any deal. After initially seeming to favor a deal with Siemens, the French this week instead pressed G.E. for better terms.Mr. Kaeser said that Siemens would carefully study whether it would make sense to acquire Alstom. But he added, \u201cWe will not be pushed by someone.\u201d Mr. Kaeser did not say who might be doing the pushing, but he may have been referring to political pressure for an intra-European deal that would swap Alstom\u2019s power businesses for Siemens\u2019s train unit. Alstom and Siemens compete in producing high-speed passenger trains.\u201cYou can rest assured that we are pretty cool about the process,\u201d Mr. Kaeser said, indicating the company would not be drawn into a bidding war. \u201cWe are not transferring the old Roman gladiators into modern Paris,\u201d he said.The German government on Wednesday denied that it was meddling in the negotiations over Alstom, but acknowledged that Mr. Kaeser and Chancellor Angela Merkel had discussed the issue, Reuters reported.Mr. Kaeser, who took over as chief executive less than nine months ago, has been trying to address concerns that Siemens is too unwieldy and not profitable enough. The reorganization announced on Wednesday will abolish a layer of top management and give more freedom to individual business units, Siemens said.\u201cThe second quarter showed that we still have a lot to do to improve our operating performance,\u201d Mr. Kaeser said, though he added that the company would still meet its financial targets this year.From January through March, which is Siemens\u2019s second financial quarter, sales fell 2 percent to 17.5 billion euros, or about $24.4 billion, from a year earlier as an increase in revenue from China was not enough to compensate for a decline in Europe and in the company\u2019s energy division.Alstom, which reported its annual results on Wednesday, said its sales were flat at \u20ac20.3 billion in its latest financial year, which runs from April to March. Net income fell 28 percent to \u20ac556 million in the latest period, while new orders fell 10 percent to \u20ac21.5 billion. Alstom did not provide quarterly figures.At Siemens, new orders slumped 13 percent to \u20ac18.4 billion in the latest quarter, compared with the same period in 2013, when the company received large orders for trains and offshore wind parks. Those orders a year ago skewed the comparison in the most recent quarter, Siemens said.Net profit rose 12 percent to \u20ac1.2 billion because of an increase at the unit that makes medical scanners used to diagnose illnesses. Profit from the energy division slumped by more than half, to \u20ac255 million before taxes, as Siemens absorbed the cost of delays in completing a high voltage transmission system in Alberta, Canada, the company said.The company also had to absorb the cost of replacing defective bearings in offshore wind turbines, an example of how the shift to renewable power generation presents risks as well as opportunities to Siemens.Profit in a division that provides public infrastructure like trains increased to \u20ac325 million before taxes after barely breaking even a year earlier. The division, known as Infrastructure and Cities, avoided charges that burdened profit a year earlier.Siemens reaffirmed that it expected net profit per share to rise 15 percent in the current fiscal year, to \u20ac5.08. The company said it would soon begin a \u20ac4 billion share buyback that it had previously announced.As part of the reorganization, Siemens will eliminate the four so-called sectors \u2014 energy, infrastructure and cities, health care and industry \u2014 which had formed the top layer of the organization. The aim is to reduce internal bureaucracy and make it easier for individual units to react to changes in the market, Siemens said.Siemens also said it would pay 785 million pounds, or about $1.3 billion, to acquire most of the energy business of Rolls-Royce, the British company that is separate from the maker of luxury automobiles. The units being acquired make turbines and compressors used by the oil and gas industries and in power generation.In addition, Siemens said it would spin off a unit that makes hearing aids in an initial public offering.Mr. Kaeser said Siemens planned to expand a division that supplies equipment for liquefying and transferring natural gas, a business that has taken on new importance against the backdrop of the conflict in Ukraine. The European Union draws about 30 percent of its gas from Russia, but the Umited States plans to begin issuing permits next year for the export of liquefied natural gas with an eye to competing for the European market.When Ms. Davis takes up her position as head of the energy businesses on Aug. 1, she will be the only woman serving on the management board at Siemens. The government led by Ms. Merkel\u2019s has been pushing for passage of a law that would require publicly traded companies to have women fill at least 30 percent of the board seats.Some analysts have warned that G.E.'s acquisition of Alstom would weaken Siemens\u2019s advantage in markets like China, where it has operated for decades. Mr. Kaeser acknowledged the threat, but also said that G.E. might be doing others in the industry a favor by reducing the number of competitors.\u201cIf someone pays for consolidation,\u201d he said, \u201cthen everyone else doesn\u2019t need to.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Mr. Putin Can\u2019t Control", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIf there were questions about the legitimacy of the separatist referendums in eastern Ukraine, the farcical names of the entities on which people were asked to vote \u2014 the self-declared People\u2019s Republics of Donetsk or Luhansk \u2014 surely answered them. But the gathering rumble of violence accompanying the votes is serious and is driving the Ukrainian crisis in a direction that before long no one \u2014 not President Vladimir Putin of Russia, not authorities in Kiev, not the West \u2014 will be able to control. A \u201cround table\u201d of Ukrainian politicians and civil groups and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, and the O.S.C.E. is reported to be preparing a \u201croad map\u201d to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. But unless Mr. Putin can and does rein in the secessionists in southeastern Ukraine, and unless nationwide presidential elections can take place in Ukraine as scheduled on May 25, the talks will have little meaning.The fact that the referendums were held despite Mr. Putin\u2019s urging last week that they be postponed suggests that events are already developing a momentum of their own. There is talk now among the pro-Russia secessionists of another referendum, this time on joining Russia. The Kremlin\u2019s response to the referendums was ambiguous, saying that Moscow \u201crespects the will of the population of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions\u201d while urging that any follow-up be through dialogue between the government in Kiev and the separatists.Mr. Putin has given every indication that his real goal is not to annex any more Ukrainian territory but to transform Ukraine into a federation under a weak and neutral Kiev government permanently dependent on Russia. What that means is that even if the talks get underway, Kiev and its Western backers may well be confronted with unacceptable demands. Mr. Putin is likely to seek recognition of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea; a level of regional self-government tantamount to partition; and guarantees against political and economic linkages to Europe. Though some devolution of power from the center to the regions is unavoidable, Kiev must come out of the negotiations with a reasonable degree of central control and the freedom to forge normal relations with the West.That will not be easy. Ukraine is broke, and Russia is claiming unrealistically large payments to continue supplying natural gas. The Ukrainian authorities have very few options at this point \u2014 any military action against the secessionists is certain to cause civilian casualties, which would invite Russian military intervention, but not responding to the separatists\u2019 actions would encourage them to expand their control. Yet Mr. Putin\u2019s hand is not all aces. He must be aware that any Russian military drive into southeastern Ukraine would entail bloody resistance, serious trade sanctions, enormous costs and, if it led to annexation, a truncated but virulently anti-Russia and pro-West Ukraine. While the Ukrainian crisis has sharply raised Mr. Putin\u2019s standing at home, this could quickly change if actual fighting broke out. Even the modest sanctions already in place are provoking capital flight, choking foreign investment and slowing an already creaky Russian economy. And however hard he tries to shrug off Western opprobrium, Mr. Putin is not immune to the damage being done to his reputation, especially in Germany, the European country he seems to care most about. In the end, there is no alternative to negotiations for either side. At this late stage, they cannot be another exercise in futility, like the last meeting in Geneva. The O.S.C.E. must set out its road plan as soon as possible, and the Germans, above all others, must make clear to Mr. Putin that they won\u2019t be lulled by more false promises; that unless he clears the way for presidential elections on May 25, gets his minions in southeastern Ukraine in line and really pulls back his armies, the European Union and the United States will impose sanctions that will cut Russia off for a long time from Western sources of technology, arms and finance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Slightly Less Wealthy Circles, Too, Interest Rises in Private Equity", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersAS a young lawyer in New York, Robert Rich sometimes bought stocks based on tips he received while playing squash at the Yale Club. Most of them did not do well, so eventually he chose to put his money into mutual funds and focus on his work.But then the itch for more control and the potential for bigger gains got the best of him and now, at 76, Mr. Rich has put nearly a fifth of his wealth into private equity \u2014 an illiquid, risky asset class with returns that range from double digits to a complete loss of principal.But in the last five years, the custodians for self-directed I.R.A.s report an increasing interest in private equity. Equity Trust, in Westlake, Ohio, said private equity now accounted for 10 to 15 percent of the $12 billion it holds as a custodian. The Pensco Trust Company, based in San Francisco, said 60 percent of new accounts in the last three years had been opened by people who wanted to invest in private equity.Kelly Rodriques, chief executive and president of Pensco, attributed the increase to the financial crisis. People left or lost jobs and converted their 401(k)\u2019s to retirement accounts, and many of them lost confidence in the stock market and became more interested in investing directly in companies.\u201cIt\u2019s more comforting to be in a business or tangible asset that you know,\u201d Mr. Rodriques said.Mr. Rodriques says his firm, which holds just under $11 billion as a custodian, focuses on people who are accredited investors \u2014 meaning their annual income has exceeded $200,000 for two consecutive years or they have assets greater than $1 million, not including a primary residence. He said the average account was $250,000.Self-directed accounts are still a niche. Equity Trust said they accounted for only 2 percent of all money held in I.R.A.s. But the growing interest in private equity shows a shift in some investors\u2019 mind-set toward what Pensco calls \u201cchoose and control.\u201dToday Mr. Rich, for example, has investments in separate funds invested in technology, health care and biotechnology as well as different financial strategies. His most recent investment was in a fund focused on hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking\u201d \u2014 a controversial method for obtaining natural gas. The opportunity came to him like the others.\u201cThe fracking fund was a man I had known for years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me the opportunity to join it if I wanted to.\u201dThis may sound as reckless as getting stock tips on the squash court. But Mr. Rich said he had been part of the vetting process for the fund in his role as a trustee for a trust. \u201cIt\u2019s a different story from the average guy who wouldn\u2019t have access,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was someone who hadn\u2019t had that access I\u2019d have been a little more cautious.\u201dMr. Rich\u2019s candor points to an important issue for anyone investing in this world: Do your homework, understand the investment and ask why you are being offered it.\u201cYou have to be fully versed in what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said Robert M. Hofeditz, who works in private equity and also has 40 percent of his wealth invested in private equity, with three-quarters of that in his retirement account. \u201cYou have to have a level of expertise to do something like this. It\u2019s not for everyone. It\u2019s for people who have the time to study the asset class.\u201dCustodians like Equity Trust and Pensco make investing I.R.A. money in private equity fairly easy. They assess the validity of an investment by Internal Revenue Service standards. They also hold the investments, as a traditional custodian would, and process forms, like the ones calling for money.\u201cOur role is to figure out if something is administratively feasible,\u201d said Eileen Loustau, senior vice president and head of marketing at Pensco. \u201cIs this a going concern? Is your paperwork in order?\u201dRed flags for private equity investments through an I.R.A. revolve around who owns the company \u2014 ownership by you, your parents or your children would disqualify the investment \u2014 or whether the opportunity to invest is part of a compensation package. Knowing someone does not disqualify you.But making sure an investment will not run afoul of I.R.S. regulations is not the same as assessing whether it is a good investment. Custodians don\u2019t do this. Mr. Rodriques said, for example, that his firm approved a retirement account investment in an underwater pet cemetery. (The man making the investment owned several pet cemeteries and saw this investment as the next wave, as it were.)Jeffrey A. Desich, chief executive of Equity Trust, said his firm told clients it was up to them to make sure they understood the investment. \u201cPrivate equity provides a lot of opportunity but one has to do their homework and understand what they\u2019re getting into,\u201d he said.With smaller retirement accounts, people tend to make direct investments in a local business \u2014 a different level of risk and compliance. William Humphrey, co-founder of New Direction I.R.A., which is a custodian for $800 million in 8,500 self-directed retirement accounts, said while the firm had noticed an uptick in private equity, the increase had been in direct investments into small, private companies.\u201cWith real estate you can drive by and make sure it\u2019s still standing,\u201d Mr. Humphrey said. \u201cWith private equity you need to make sure whoever is running the company sends a report telling you what is going on.\u201dDespite the risks and responsibility of assessing the investment, a self-directed account that is not someone\u2019s sole source of income could be a good match of retirement money and private equity investments. Mr. Hofeditz said that earlier in his career he invested in private equity deals from his personal account, until he realized how hard it would have been to get that money if he needed it. \u201cThat\u2019s why I use my retirement account for a lot of the illiquid stuff because you can\u2019t touch it anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of my money is invested in index funds and exchange-traded funds.\u201dMr. Rich has converted 80 percent of his retirement account to a Roth I.R.A., which will pay out distributions tax-free, with plans to leave it to his children. But he still brings to bear a certain cautiousness in selecting private equity managers. \u201cI go with organizations that seem conservative,\u201d he said, \u201cand not ones that are trying to hit a home run.\u201dAn earlier version of this column misspelled the surname of the chief executive of Pensco. He is Kelly Rodriques, not Rodrigues.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Home Prices Start Easing, to the Relief of Experts", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut analysts said that the softening of price gains, rather than a worrisome trend, may actually be welcome news. Double-digit increases cannot go on forever, and many economists are using words like \u201csustainable\u201d and \u201cstable\u201d to describe the slowdown, saying the market is becoming healthier.Foreclosures make up a smaller percentage of sales, and the higher prices have caused investors to back off, leaving the bigger question of whether housing is affordable and mortgages are accessible to average families that want to buy. First-time home buyers still make up less than 30 percent of the market, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the number of all-cash buyers \u2014 not just investors, but older people who are downsizing after the sale of a larger home \u2014 has remained elevated.Those factors will help curb any potential new bubbles, said Mark H. Goldman, a real estate expert at San Diego State University. \u201cHere in San Diego, we have a real shortage of inventory, yet prices are softening,\u201d he said, adding that houses in the area may have been priced too aggressively. \u201cA big factor on home price appreciation is affordability.\u201d Prices in San Diego rose 18.9 percent between March 2014 and March 2013, according to Case-Shiller. More moderate increases may give buyers\u2019 incomes a chance to catch up.Of the 20 cities that Case-Shiller tracks individually, all had double-digit price increases in that time period except Boston, Charlotte, Cleveland, Denver, New York and Washington, which had single-digit increases. In some cases, the cities hit hardest in the housing bust had the biggest gains. Las Vegas, where home prices rose 21 percent, led the list. Cities where demand has accelerated and housing supply is sharply limited by geography and other factors, like San Francisco, also posted large gains. Prices soared there by 21 percent, according to the measure.Eighteen cities are still below their peak prices during the housing bubble; only two \u2014 Denver and Dallas \u2014 have returned to the previous levels.An interactive graphic showing how home prices have changed since you bought your home.But analysts say that the prices at the height of a bubble should not be considered a benchmark. Compared with March 2004, a decade ago, home prices in 14 of 20 cities are now higher. That trend was good news for the four million families who regained some equity in their homes last year, according to CoreLogic. But for the 6.5 million families who still owe more than their home is worth, many of whom bought or refinanced at the height of the market, the current slowdown is likely to delay the point at which their homes will be above water.Month-to-month price changes are much more volatile than year-over-year changes, so economists were skeptical when Case-Shiller showed a much larger-than-expected gain between February and March. Nineteen of 20 cities showed higher prices, while prices in New York actually contracted 0.3 percent. \u201cThe Case-Shiller numbers contradict all the other housing market numbers we follow, which show activity and home prices slowing or falling outright since mortgage rates surged last spring,\u201d Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote.Indeed, price growth appears to have peaked in several cities, particularly in the South and West, where large inventories of foreclosures have already been absorbed, economists at IHS Global Insight wrote. They predicted that in response, builders would step up the construction of new homes.Analysts at Capital Economics also forecast positive effects from the slowdown.\u201cSlowing house price appreciation should not be seen as a sign that the housing recovery is hitting the buffers. In fact, it will have the opposite effect,\u201d they wrote. \u201cA slowdown in price gains closer to the rate of income growth will prevent housing becoming overvalued, and therefore support a further rise in home sales and housing starts.\u201dStill, home buyers have pulled back sharply from the market since rock-bottom interest rates began to rise about a year ago, even though they remain low by historical standards. In April, the number of sales of existing homes rose for the first time in four months, and the uptick was only modest. The pending home sales index declined for nine months before inching into positive territory in March, the most recent month available. Sales of new homes declined sharply in March, but bounced back in April. On Tuesday, Zillow said mortgage rates had fallen below 4 percent for the first time since last October.But housing experts emphasize that the biggest drivers of the market are more fundamental than prices, mortgage rates or things like student loan debt, often cited as a reason more young adults are unable to buy for the first time. People buy homes when they have good jobs and rising incomes, they said.\u201cPeople can only buy,\u201d Mr. Goldman said, \u201cwhat they can prove that they can afford.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Employers added 288,000 jobs, bringing the average for the last three months to a respectable 238,000. But let\u2019s keep this milestone in perspective: wages remained flat, nearly 10 million unemployed people are looking for jobs, and millions more have become so disenchanted that they have given up on finding work altogether. That the unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent in April from 6.7 percent a month earlier is due mainly to the fact that the number of people looking for jobs fell. The percentage of Americans 16 and over who are working or looking for work was just 62.8 percent, the lowest level since the late 1970s.Moreover, even if job growth continued at last month\u2019s solid, steady pace, the country would not have a labor market as healthy as the one it had before the recession started in December 2007 until the end of 2016, according to calculations by Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Put differently, it would take the economy nine years to recoup the jobs lost during the recession plus those needed to employ new workers during the slow recovery. People like Mr. Cole and Mr. Alexander speak as if the formal end of the recession five years ago put everything right.

And it turns out it\u2019s not a bad place to shop for home furnishings, either.Frederico Duarte, a design critic and curator based in Lisbon, who consulted on the Design: Portugal collection produced by the Museum of Modern Art and teaches at the university here, recently offered a reporter a tour of his city\u2019s offerings.He began with Ana Salgueiro, a design shop in the Chiado neighborhood, where he pointed out two pendant lamps: Planet, by Mood, a simple light that is nevertheless \u201cmade of so many different elements,\u201d he said, that \u201cI am thinking it would cast good shadows,\u201d and Raio, a suspension lamp by Marco Sousa Santos, founder of the Lisbon Design Biennale.\u201cSometimes I think design gets overwrought,\u201d said Mr. Duarte, 35. \u201cMarco\u2019s designs are not about creating a weird concept. They just work. I think this would be a great lamp for public spaces or places with double-height ceilings.\u201dThe relatively new A Vida Portuguesa store in Intendente also proved to be a trove of Portuguese d\u00e9cor. \u201cThis is a place that definitely makes you want to buy stuff,\u201d said Mr. Duarte, adding that although he isn\u2019t usually an avid shopper, \u201cI bought those pillow cases, that bath mat, I almost bought those melamine dishes.\u201dNear the entrance, the ceiling was covered with ceramic birds, handmade replicas of the andorinhas, or swallows, that have become a symbol of the country. The store sells two versions: one made in collaboration with Bordallo Pinheiro, the centuries-old ceramics factory, and a less-expensive version for those who prefer symbolism over provenance.Another symbol of Portugal, Mr. Duarte noted, is cork. It can be a trap for local designers, he said, who feel the need to make something \u2014 anything \u2014 out of it, often with substandard results. But he found a couple of exceptions at the Cork & Co shop in Bairro Alto: a \u201cvery elegant\u201d wine cooler by Ana Mestre of Corque Design and the shapely Vinco chair by Toni Grilo, made from a single corkboard.And at Vista Alegre, a porcelain manufacturer founded in 1824, he made a beeline for the Transatlantica plate by Brunno Jahara, created by the Brazilian designer during his stint at the company\u2019s designer-in-residence program. What makes it interesting, Mr. Duarte said, is that the pattern appears to be a traditional Portuguese tile motif \u2014 but only at first.\u201cWhen you look closer,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see a gun, a Popsicle and other things that add a whole other layer.\u201d\u00a0Advertisement"}

The book attempts, rather, to explain why Mr. Geithner and his colleagues made the choices they did \u2014 something Mr. Geithner acknowledges he \u201cnever found an effective way\u201d of doing at the time (in much the same way that many say the Obama administration failed to communicate the goals and benefits of health care reform). Mr. Geithner suggests that the administration\u2019s failure to make a strong case for its economic plan in real time meant \u201cwe lost the country\u201d while trying to steady the financial ship. Some critics of the Obama administration would say that its economic policies \u2014 not its articulation of those policies \u2014 were the problem. And while Mr. Geithner clearly and patiently explains the reasoning behind pivotal decisions here, \u201cStress Test\u201d is unlikely to change the minds of those, on both the left and right, who contend that he and his colleagues gave away too much to Wall Street, did too little for Main Street and carried out too few (or too cumbersome) reforms to prevent a future catastrophe. Mr. Geithner says he understands why the American public was outraged that some of the arsonists who had set the financial fire of 2008 were getting bailouts and bonuses, but argues that \u201ca lot of firms that didn\u2019t deserve saving still needed to be saved\u201d because, in his view, their implosion could have set off another series of tumbling dominoes. The former Obama economic policy adviser Lawrence H. Summers and other colleagues, Mr. Geithner writes, \u201cwould say I suffered from \u2018Lehman Syndrome,\u2019 a kind of financial post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d He says he pleads guilty to that charge: \u201cLetting systemic firms fail, nationalizing them, haircutting their creditors \u2014 it all sounded alluring when you hadn\u2019t lived through the consequences. I preferred to err on the side of avoiding another calamity.\u201d Of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Mr. Geithner says he does not think the government could have rescued it \u201cwithout violating the legal constraints placed on the Fed.\u201d He also writes that \u201cwe hadn\u2019t chosen to draw a line\u201d with Lehman as a corrective to moral hazard, but instead \u201chad been powerless\u201d to prevent \u201ca catastrophic default.\u201d Mr. Geithner has almost nothing but praise for Mr. Obama and counters charges that the president\u2019s decision to pursue health care reform early in his first term distracted attention from fixing the economy. He has one small criticism of his former boss: \u201cSometimes I thought he wore his frustration too openly. He harbored the overly optimistic belief that since his motives and values were good, since his team was thoughtful and well-intentioned, we deserved to be perceived that way.\u201dIn this book, Mr. Geithner, with an assist from Michael Grunwald of Time magazine, demonstrates that he can discuss economics in an accessible fashion, making the situation the country faced in 2008 and 2009 tactile, comprehensible \u2014 and harrowing \u2014 to the lay reader. Along the way, he also gives us a telling portrait of himself as \u201cthe most worried person in the room\u201d \u2014 the administration\u2019s Eeyore, who in the early days of 2009 (when so many in the White House were still high on the idea of hope and change) felt \u201cweary and dark,\u201d explaining in meetings \u201cwhy the awesome new ideas weren\u2019t that awesome, and how the storm we were sailing into was even worse than we thought.\u201d Students of the causes of the cataclysm of 2008 may also question Mr. Geithner\u2019s reluctance to examine the role played in the run-up to that crisis by the anti-regulatory policies of his former mentors Mr. Summers and Robert E. Rubin (both of whom he had worked under in the Treasury Department during the Clinton administration) and the low-interest, easy-money policies of the Fed under Alan Greenspan \u2014 policies that many economic historians believe fueled market excesses and out of control risk-taking. Among Mr. Geithner\u2019s regrets: he wishes that he \u201chad persuaded Congress to create more authority for the Fed and the Treasury in the financial reform legislation\u201d and that \u201cwe had expanded our housing programs earlier, to relieve more pain for homeowners.\u201d He writes that he and his colleagues went into the Great Firestorm of 2008 with an inadequate toolbox (\u201cat times it felt like we were fighting World War III with General Washington\u2019s army\u201d), and adds that he hopes lessons from the 2008 crash \u201cwon\u2019t have to be rediscovered in the fires of the next crisis.\u201d \nSTRESS TEST\n\nReflections on Financial Crises\n\nBy Timothy F.

{"Headline": "Piling On the Luxury", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness TravelFor most travelers, flying in style may be a thing of the past, but airlines are determined to bring back some glamour to air travel, at least for those sitting in the front of the plane. Flat beds and fluffy pillows, fancy wines and four-course meals, designer-brand pajamas and luxurious vanity kits \u2014 these options have become the staple of business-class travel these days. And after a couple of sluggish years, business travel spending in the United States is forecast to grow by 7.1 percent to $293 billion in 2014, according the Global Business Travel Association. Spending on international travel is expected to increase almost twice as fast, at 13 percent, to reach $37 billion. With this pickup in corporate travel, airlines are taking extra steps to offer ever more personal services and benefits to compete for high-value business passengers, even as they squeeze more travelers in the back. \u201cCorporate passengers are definitely being fought over by all the airlines,\u201d said Claudia Sender, the chief executive of TAM Airlines, the Brazilian carrier. \u201cThey have never been so important because of their willingness to pay more.\u201d Airlines have always treated their business-class passengers a little better than the rest. But in today\u2019s era of mass travel, the extra attention to the front of the cabin has increased disparities in the air as never before. \u201cThe gap between what\u2019s going on at the front of the plane and in the back has never been wider,\u201d said Tim Winship, publisher of the FrequentFlyer.com website. He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re one of the lucky few who flies first or business class these days \u2014 it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s all about profitability. Given the disproportionate contribution from high-yield customers, it would be financially irrational for the airlines not to take this into consideration.\u201d Airlines typically charge six to eight times as much for business class as for coach on long-haul, international flights, and two to three times as much for first class as for business class. For a passenger booking a month in advance, Cathay Pacific, for instance, can charge $900 for a round-trip economy ticket from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, $6,400 in business class, and nearly $16,000 in first class.(The difference in prices on domestic flights is not as wide as on international flights, meaning coach passengers contribute a far higher share to the flight\u2019s total revenues.)Corporate accounts get discounts in exchange for a commitment to buy business-class seats, and airlines will often throw in a few first-class seats as incentives to sweeten the deal. About a third of the passengers on a plane, generally those flying in the premium cabins or paying full fare for economy tickets, account for roughly two-thirds of an airline\u2019s revenue. So it\u2019s no surprise that airlines are redoubling efforts to please these corporate passengers even at a time when business travelers are trying to stretch their travel budgets. They get speedier service at the airport, their bags come out of the carousel first, they can use faster security lanes and their check-in counters are less crowded. They are also the first to board and get off the plane. Some airlines have dedicated terminals for first-class passengers and provide limousine transfers on the tarmac between flights. Delta Air Lines, for instance, picks up some of its connecting elite passengers in New York, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Minneapolis and takes them to their next flight in a Porsche Cayenne. United Airlines offers a similar service at Chicago O\u2019Hare, Newark Liberty, San Francisco International and George Bush Intercontinental in Houston, with a Mercedes GL-Class, and plans to expand it to Los Angeles International in May and Washington Dulles and Denver International later this year. \u201cWe know, because our business customers tell us, that what matters most to our passengers are speed and efficiency, and that\u2019s what we try to provide,\u201d said Mike Henny, Delta\u2019s director of customer experience. \u201cWe try to think about the entire journey.\u201dInside the plane, the most visible sign of this attention is the latest generation of business-class seats. The standard today are comfortable seats that can be turned into flat beds, not angled ones, where passengers complain of sliding down as they sleep. Many airlines now favor seats that have direct-aisle access for passengers, meaning travelers do not have to climb over a sleeping neighbor if they want to get out of their seats in the middle of the night. Air France is the latest of the big global carriers to realize that these features have become indispensable in the battle for corporate accounts. The airline recently announced that as part of a $500 million investment to upgrade its cabins, it will install new flatbed seats in business class. Each costs at least $68,000, and Air France will begin fitting them in June on its fleet of Boeing 777s. The investments, says Alexandre de Juniac, the airline\u2019s chairman and chief executive, have become necessary for Air France to compete against Asian and Middle Eastern carriers that long-ago started lavishing the most luxurious amenities on their business-class and first-class customers. \u201cOur only weapons, since we can\u2019t lower our costs to the same level as theirs, is to fight back with our own quality services,\u201d said Mr. de Juniac.Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier, has two showers inside its flagship fleet of Airbus A380s for its first-class cabin. Korean Airlines has a spacious bar and lounge for its first-class passengers on its own A380s. Even egalitarian JetBlue Airways is getting in on the act. The low-cost airline is introducing new first-class and business-class seats on its Airbus A321 jets operating transcontinental routes starting this year. Delta last month announced it had just finished installing full flatbed seats with direct-aisle access in its business-class cabin across its entire international wide-body fleet, which includes its Airbus A330s and Boeing 767s, 747s and 777s.Airline executives say these expensive amenities are worth the cost because of the much higher fares they can charge for business class. And airlines have realized that offering a real opportunity for a good night\u2019s sleep while aboard has become a competitive tool, particularly with the advent of new jets that can fly longer distances without stopping for fuel. These include the Boeing 777, which has become a flagship aircraft for the world\u2019s longest routes, and the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which can provide nonstop flights between the East Coast of the United States and Japan, or between Europe and Australia. Given the limited real estate in an airline cabin, the downside of these seats is that they take up more space. \u201cFor the business class to be profitable you need to be able to generate significant fare premiums to justify the extra real estate,\u201d said Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and Spain\u2019s Iberia. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting balancing act.\u201dThis has forced seat makers to come up with innovative designs to increase seat density in business class without sacrificing comfort.Tomorrow\u2019s business seat will most likely offer movie suggestions based on passengers\u2019 preferences stored in their mobile devices. Seat headrests will come with a surround-sound system to provide an immersive experience. And television screens will be even bigger, rivaling what many people have at home. Airline seats are borrowing tricks from the hotel industry, too, which has long focused on improving a guest\u2019s sleep experience. Japan Airlines, for example, is offering a selection of different pillows similar to what\u2019s found in many high-end hotels. It is also working with a mattress company to develop extra padding for its seats to make the beds more comfortable. But competing with seats alone can be a tricky business. The best seat on the market can only be unrivaled for a short while before another airline comes up with a new product, fueling an expensive arms race. And since seats remain on a plane for about seven years, investments can quickly become outmoded.\u201cIt\u2019s a catch-up game,\u201d said Ms. Sender, TAM\u2019s chief executive. \u201cYou can have the best seat ever for two years. But guess what? Someone else will come up with a better seat.\u201dAirlines may have started to reach the limits to innovations with seats and cabin space, said Raymond Kollau, the founder of Airlinetrends.com, which looks at the latest industry developments in product and service. So airlines are increasingly turning their attention to customer service to complement investments in hardware. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot more you can do once you\u2019ve provided a fully flat bed,\u201d Mr. Kollau said. \u201cAfter that, it all comes down to customer service.\u201dSince the whole point of providing flatbeds is better and longer sleep, airlines are rethinking their approach to in-flight service, particularly during night flights, to allow passengers more uninterrupted time to sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s about attention to the tiniest details,\u201d Mr. Kollau said. \u201cIt becomes less about the single product and more about the entire package.\u201dVirgin Atlantic, for instance, which flies between London and the United States, offers business passengers the option to have their dinner in the terminal before boarding. Those who pick that option are then assigned seats in the \u201csnooze,\u201d or quiet section of the cabin, where flight attendants will not bother them. SAS, the Scandinavian carrier, hands out a takeout breakfast bag upon arrival for passengers who wish to sleep right up to landing. That option is soon coming to British Airways, too. Lufthansa has installed humidifiers in the first-class cabin of its newer Airbus A380s, which increase the relative humidity of the cabin to around 25 percent; it ranges from 5 to 10 percent in the rest of the plane. The technology promises to \u201cimprove sleep, reduce jet lag and tiredness and alleviate dehydration of the eyes, skin and linings of the mouth and nose,\u201d according to CTT Systems, the Swedish manufacturer. Etihad Airways, based in the United Arab Emirates, recently outlined a sleep initiative that it described as a result of a two-year partnership with sleep experts from the American Center for Psychiatry and Neurology, an Abu Dhabi-based clinical center. Passengers in coach get noise-canceling headphones, as well as beverages conducive to sleep, like hot chocolate and herbal teas. First-class passengers get \u201csleep-inducing camomile tea,\u201d the airline says, as well as luxury sleep suits.To make sure travelers remain loyal, airlines are also going the extra mile on the ground as well as in-flight. In Frankfurt, Lufthansa has an entire terminal dedicated just to first-class passengers that offers an array of services, including fine dining and baths. Passengers facing a long connection time can rent a Porsche 911 for 99 euros \u2014 about $137 \u2014 for three hours to cruise German highways.At its Paris hub at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Air France offers a similar high-end experience. Its first-class lounge delivers red-carpet treatment from the airport\u2019s main gate all the way to the plane. It includes a spa and massage service, and food prepared by Alain Ducasse.First-class passengers do not have to stand in line to get their passport stamped. An immigration official will come to the lounge to do so. Passengers are then taken to their flight by car \u2014 German luxury models initially used were recently replaced with French cars.Even when they do not get their own terminals, perks in the United States are still good for elite passengers. At Delta\u2019s new Terminal 4 in New York\u2019s Kennedy International Airport, the airline has built a viewing deck inside the business-class lounge for the exclusive enjoyment of a select few. All this preferential treatment has changed air travel. Critics say the airlines are increasingly mirroring some of the worst inequalities found elsewhere. \u201cThe difference between the worst and the first has never been wider,\u201d said Charlie Leocha, who leads the Consumer Travel Alliance in Washington and is a frequent industry critic. \u201cPassengers in the front of the plane travel in a totally different system.\u201dDelta, for instance, recently announced it would change in 2015 the way passengers are awarded frequent-flier miles by moving to a system that takes into account how much they spend, dropping the previous standard of how far they fly. Passengers going round trip from New York to Los Angeles in coach now get 4,930 award miles, whether they paid $500 or $1,000 for their ticket. Under the new SkyMiles program, the lower fare will get 2,500 award miles while the higher fare will net 5,000 miles. (Business passengers usually spend more and so are likely to benefit from this approach.) And while the front of the plane has been significantly upgraded, the traditional economy class has become more cramped as coach passengers pay the price to make more room for premium passengers. The average seat pitch \u2014 the industry standard for the space between two seats, currently about 31 inches \u2014 has been reduced by about 10 percent over the last decade. Airlines are also using slimmer economy seats that allow them to add more rows and passengers on their planes. Some are also trying to increase the number of seats they can fit into each row. For instance, American Airlines has introduced a new seating plan for some of its refurbished Boeing 777s that fits 10 passengers abreast, instead of nine. The move to more seats has been brisk. In 2010, fewer than 15 percent of the 777s Boeing manufactured had 10 seats abreast. Today, nearly two-thirds of them do, says Mr. Kollau.\u201cCoach is pretty much the seat and the seatbelt these days,\u201d said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst in San Francisco and founder of Atmosphere Research Group. Airlines argue that ticket prices remain historically low, once they are adjusted for inflation, and that passengers for that reason are generally better off today than when the industry was deregulated. But some executives see risk in that strategy. Economy passengers, they warn, may not be willing to accept increasingly bad traveling conditions. It might also hurt the brand with premium passengers, since business travelers also often fly coach.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can offset the profitability of business class by squeezing more people into economy,\u201d Mr. Walsh of British Airways and Iberia said. \u201cPassengers will simply not tolerate it. They will go elsewhere.\u201dThere are one or two areas, however, where a sort of trickle-down theory of flying may be at work, to the benefit of the traveling masses. As today\u2019s business class is comparable to what first-class travel used to be 20 years ago, a new class of service on some long-haul carriers, known as premium economy, is offering many of the amenities once found only in business class. And over the last decade, airlines have vastly improved their in-flight entertainment systems. Individual television screens, first introduced in first class and business class, have become pretty much standard on long-haul flights in economy as well. Passengers have also come to expect them. Cathay Pacific provides on-demand audio and video and its economy seats each have nine-inch personal screens. Passengers can connect their electronic devices and stream their own movies. Each seat also has a USB port, and 110-volt power sources are widely available on board.Airline executives are now turning to improving connectivity on board. Many airlines provide Wi-Fi on domestic flights, and the industry is rapidly moving to over-the-water connections for international flights, using satellite transmissions instead of ground networks. The speed of technology improvements has been rapid in this area. When Gogo began offering in-flight Internet service five years ago, the peak speed available on the company\u2019s air-to-ground network was 3.1 megabits per second. Last year, it installed new service that took the speed to 9.8 megabits a second. At the recent Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, Gogo presented its latest offering, known as a ground-to-orbit system, that will increase the top speeds to 70 megabits per second. The system will be installed first by Japan Airlines for trials and should be available starting next year, according to Gogo.\u201cPeople are now expecting to remain connected in flight,\u201d said Mr. Walsh. \u201cThat\u2019s a little surprising since many people used to view flights as the only time to disconnect.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Contracted in a Frigid First Quarter", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was an economic quarter no one wants to repeat.Even as the winter fades in the rearview mirror and growth shows signs of picking up, it is becoming clear just how weak the economy was in the first quarter of 2014.The Commerce Department said on Thursday that the nation\u2019s overall output shrank at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first three months of the year, revising downward its initial estimate from late April, which showed a very slight gain for the period. It is the first quarter in three years in which the nation\u2019s output of goods and services has contracted.The figures are bad news for the White House as well as for Democrats running for Congress in November\u2019s midterm elections. Although there\u2019s still time for growth to rebound before then \u2014 and recent data on hiring has been more encouraging \u2014 little room remains on the runway for an economic takeoff this year.Republicans were quick to seize on Thursday\u2019s report as more evidence that President Obama\u2019s policies are not working.\u201cThe president promised the American people an economy \u2018built to last,\u2019 but instead he\u2019s got us caught in a game of Chutes and Ladders: one step forward, two steps back,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cAmericans asking \u2018Where are the jobs?\u2019 deserve better than this new normal of fits and starts.\u201dOther G.O.P. members of Congress, like Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority whip, had even more acidic comments.\u201cIt appears that the imperceptible recovery has now dipped into another economic downturn,\u201d he said. \u201cThis administration has done more to hinder than promote growth. The American economy does not wallow for six years on its own.\u201dMost economists on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve blame a very cold winter for much of the slowdown. Experts are now predicting that the annual pace of growth will rise to between 3 percent and 4 percent in the current quarter, and data so far for April and May appears to be much more robust.For example, in a separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday, initial claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped more sharply than expected. The four-week moving average of 311,500 for claims, which is more closely followed by economists than the volatile week-to-week number, is now lower than it has been since before the recession in 2007, an indication that the labor market may finally be on the mend. Reinforcing that point, the bulk of the downward revision in gross domestic product for the first quarter was driven by businesses\u2019 adding less to their inventories \u2014 suggesting that another inventory adjustment won\u2019t weigh on growth in the second quarter. Businesses aggressively added to their inventories in the second half of 2013, one major reason they didn\u2019t need to restock their warehouses and back rooms as quickly in the first three months of 2014.Still, the 1 percent contraction rate was twice as steep as what economists had expected the Commerce Department to report.\u201cThe only bright spot is that this was from last quarter,\u201d said Tara M. Sinclair, a professor of economics at George Washington University and an economist at Indeed.com, one of the nation\u2019s largest sites for job postings. \u201cThis is about a period that ended two months ago, and we can let it go and move on.\u201d Other experts agreed that although the first-quarter contraction represents a serious pothole, it doesn\u2019t show a recession on the horizon.\u201cThe first-quarter numbers shouldn\u2019t be read as a bad omen of a much weaker economy in the spring and summer,\u201d said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. \u201cIt coils the spring even more for a bounce-back in the economy this quarter.\u201dMr. Hoffman, who expects the economy to expand at a rate of 4 percent in the second quarter, attributed much of the weakness in inventory growth last quarter to slower auto production and sales in early 2014. He noted that auto sales picked up in March and April and said new data for May car sales, due next week, should also be encouraging.For the second half of 2014, Mr. Hoffman predicted the economy would grow at a rate of roughly 3 percent. But the longer-term growth rate in this recovery, he noted, remained well below the pace of past rebounds.Even if his prediction of a 4 percent rate of expansion this quarter proved right, when averaged with the 1 percent contraction rate of last quarter, Mr. Hoffman said, \u201cit\u2019s not a breakout.\u201dIndeed, the on-again, off-again pattern of economic expansion helps explain why so many Americans remain skeptical that things really are getting better, despite an improving job market, strong corporate profits and a robust stock market. While the growth rate has swung sharply from quarter to quarter, the underlying pace hasn\u2019t changed as much.\u201cIn sum, there is little in the G.D.P. report to suggest anything other than a reiteration of the economy\u2019s 2 percent to 2.5 percent real-growth rut,\u201d said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. \u201cThe weak Q1 growth number sets up for a strong Q2 growth rate, but neither this nor the Q1 decline reflect the middling path along which this economy travels.\u201dBoth the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq rose by half a percent in trading on Thursday, in spite of the disappointing growth figure. The S.&P. 500 hit 1,920.03, a fresh high, and is up nearly 5 percent so far this year. In 2013, the S.&P. 500 rose almost 30 percent. Despite the likelihood of a pickup this quarter, economists have been reassessing the prospects for growth over the next year or two, said Michael Hanson, a senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\u201cMany market participants are pricing in lower growth than they expected six months ago,\u201d said Mr. Hanson, adding that these concerns about the potential of the economy to sustain faster growth over time may help explain why investors have recently piled into Treasury bonds, driving yields sharply lower.At 2.47 percent on Thursday, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond is near lows last seen a year ago, when the Federal Reserve started to signal that it would begin easing back on its efforts to stimulate the economy.Treasury bond yields typically rise when economic growth picks up, but yields are half a percentage point lower now than they were at the start of 2014. Officials from the Fed have said they plan to keep reducing their stimulus efforts through the end of 2014 and have indicated that they may begin raising short-term rates as soon as the second half of 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Auto Market Continues to Recover at Slow Pace", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European car market expanded in April for the eighth straight month, industry data showed on Friday, continuing its climb from the depths it reached last year.Car sales are unlikely to return to precrisis levels before the end of the decade, analysts say.Among major markets in the 28-nation European Union, only Germany declined from a year earlier, contracting 3.6 percent. Spain, lifted by government incentives, posted an increase of nearly 29 percent in sales; Britain, where buyers can finance on easy terms, posted growth of 8.2 percent. Sales in France were up a healthy 5.8 percent.According to the German Association of the Automotive Industry, known as V.D.A. for its initials in German, the decline in that country was solely the result of the timing of Easter, which was a month earlier than last year.Carlos Da Silva, an analyst at IHS Automotive, said in a research note that it appeared the recovery was becoming increasingly solid, though he cautioned that it remained too early to declare victory because comparison with last year\u2019s weak figures means that \u201canything other than growth today would be quite abnormal.\u201d \u200b \u200b\u201cWe must keep in mind that, in absolute terms, the level of sales is and should remain at a very low tide,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is still a long way to go before the E.U. turns into a healthy market.\u201dThe picture in Europe contrasts with the worldwide market. BMW, the German luxury carmaker, reported on Tuesday that its January-April sales rose 7.5 percent from the same period in 2013, putting it on track for global sales this year of two million vehicles \u2014 the most ever. But BMW\u2019s European sales were up just 2.4 percent in the same period, weighed down by the weak showing of its Mini brand.Ford\u2019s sales gained 9.1 percent, and Fiat-Chrysler\u2019s gained 1.8 percent.Volkswagen Group, the largest European automaker, posted a 4.4 percent sales gain in April from a year earlier, led by Seat and Skoda marques.PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the No. 2, posted a 5.2 percent gain, while its French rival Renault reported a 16.1 percent increase, on the back of a nearly 35 percent annual increase in its ultra-low-cost Dacia brand.Advertisement"}

This was as much his strategy on the opening tune, a soulful processional titled \u201cThe Last Chieftain,\u201d as on \u201cWest of the West,\u201d which closed the set over a deep, asymmetrical funk groove. For that, it turned out, he had the band.

{"Headline": "Thailand Says It Will Try to Hold an Election in July", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Thailand\u2019s election commission on Wednesday said it would try to hold a vote in July but opposition leaders refused to say whether they would participate, underlining the country\u2019s political paralysis.Puchong Nutrawong, the secretary general of the Election Commission, said he would propose that elections be held July 20 in a decree that will be submitted to the king next week.Amid continued protests and a sagging economy, Thailand has been without a fully functioning government since December. The caretaker administration of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has been short of cash and has failed to make payments to about one million farmers.Anti-government protesters seeking to oust Ms. Yingluck obstructed a first round of elections in February and on Wednesday renewed a pledge to seize power and appoint a prime minister. The standoff has been periodically punctuated by violence including the assassination of a prominent government supporter last week.Suthep Thaugsuban, the main leader of the protest movement, did not mention the election date in an address to his supporters late Wednesday, but said protesters would \u201cregain sovereign power\u201d and appoint a prime minister.\u201cWe are not going to compromise with the thieves of the country,\u201d Mr. Suthep said.The political crisis centers on the polarizing rule of Ms. Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, a tycoon who built up a sweeping political movement in northern Thailand that antagonized the Bangkok establishment, which accuses Mr. Thaksin of monopolizing power.The crisis has evolved into a standoff between supporters of the governing party pushing for elections that they are confident they will win, and a protest movement skeptical of electoral democracy and trying to handpick a leader.Legal proceedings against Ms. Yingluck may further complicate the picture: a court is scheduled to decide in the coming weeks whether to remove her from office on the grounds that she illegally transferred a top civil servant.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Populist Party Gaining Muscle to Push Britain to the Right", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGATESHEAD, England \u2014 Before winning power, Prime Minister David Cameron once called them \u201cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists,\u201d and a cabinet minister, Kenneth Clarke, dismissed them last year as \u201cclowns.\u201d But the U.K. Independence Party is showing that it cannot be laughed off.Polls suggest that the party, which emerged from the right-wing fringes of British politics to call for sharp limits on immigration and for exiting the European Union, will perform strongly in the European Parliament elections that start on May 22. It appears poised to outpoll Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party, and it may even vie with the Labour Party for first place in Britain.From Amsterdam to Athens, populists are seeking to capitalize on discontent with mainstream politicians and with European integration, which many voters now associate more with austerity than prosperity. Even in Germany, arguably the nation most committed to the European Union, one fringe party is campaigning to scrap the shared euro currency.Pressure from the right in Britain has already elicited promises from Mr. Cameron to restrict immigration, curb welfare entitlements for newcomers and hold a referendum in 2017 on whether to quit the European Union.Speaking to 1,200 supporters who gathered in April in Gateshead, an industrial town in northern England, Mr. Farage urged Britain to get \u201cup off its knees\u201d and take a path independent of the European Union. He predicted that across the 28-nation bloc, political parties skeptical of greater integration would win about one-quarter of the vote.For his party, Mr. Farage declared, the \u201cdays of mockery are over.\u201dIn that climate, Mr. Farage has provided what to some Britons are appealing targets of blame.\u201cHe\u2019s giving a very simple message to voters: Say \u2018no\u2019 to immigration, say \u2018no\u2019 to Westminster, say \u2018no\u2019 to Brussels,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Nottingham, referring to the seats of national and European power.Professor Goodwin said UKIP has evolved from \u201can anti-Europe, single issue pressure group\u201d into a \u201cbroad radical-right force that is winning support not just from ex-Conservatives, but people we call the left behind: blue-collar, working-class voters who, under a period of harsh fiscal austerity, might otherwise be expected to support the center-left Labour Party.\u201dUKIP caused a sensation by grabbing one-quarter of the vote in local elections last year. And unlike British elections, those for the European Parliament use a proportional system that benefits smaller parties.The Conservatives worry that they will lose crucial voters to UKIP, perhaps enough to deny the Tories a new term in power in the British general election next year. But the insurgents threaten Labour as well with its appeal to working-class voters. In Gateshead, Mr. Farage asserted that immigration was \u201cgood for rich people, because it means cheaper nannies and cheaper chauffeurs and cheaper gardeners, but it has been a disaster for millions of ordinary, decent families.\u201dFor all its success, though, UKIP has been handicapped by inconsistency and amateurishness. Mr. Farage has criticized other leaders as elitists, but he, too, went to private school. After complaining about foreigners taking British jobs, he has had trouble justifying hiring his German wife as a secretary at taxpayers\u2019 expense.He is often embarrassed by things his party colleagues say and do, like the statement by a local-government council member that the serious floods this year were divine retribution for Britain legalizing same-sex marriage. One supporter was suspended from the party over xenophobic comments he posted on Twitter; a member of the European Parliament resigned from UKIP after referring to women as \u201csluts.\u201dMany commentators say Mr. Farage got the better of two televised clashes over European policy with Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats who is Mr. Cameron\u2019s coalition partner. But Mr. Farage also gave voters reason to question his judgment when he said in an interview that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was the statesman he most admired.Still, by fusing the issues of Europe and immigration, Mr. Farage has given the party a clear identity and an easily understood agenda.\u201cThey are standing on a tidal wave of public opinion,\u201d Professor Goodwin said.But it is clear that the party has already moved British politics to the right. The Labour Party, which moved to open the country to workers from eight ex-Communist countries when it was in power in 2004, and before it needed to, has now said that step should have been delayed. And Mr. Cameron, besides hardening immigration policy and offering a referendum on Europe, has shifted his government\u2019s stance on other issues, including the environment (UKIP opposes subsidies for wind farms).Critics say that, far from weakening UKIP\u2019s appeal, adopting this approach validates the party\u2019s agenda. And on his signature issues, Mr. Farage is hard to outmaneuver.Last year, Mr. Cameron\u2019s government sent out vans with advertisements telling illegal immigrants to \u201cgo home\u201d or face arrest. Unexpectedly Mr. Farage denounced the billboards as nasty and un-British. Not long afterward, the program was discontinued.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Arts in Britain Weather a Financial Storm", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: Front Row CenterLONDON \u2014 British chancellors of the Exchequer don\u2019t spend too much time or effort on the problems of the arts world. So when the current chancellor, George Osborne, met privately with a group of leading arts administrators back in January, it was an unusual event, sparked by unusual circumstances: a precipitous drop in public funding for the arts. The meeting was intended to convey the message that the government of Prime Minister David Cameron understood the difficulties the arts executives faced \u2014 and, for some present, the message came through. John Gilhooly, chairman of the Royal Philharmonic Society and chief executive of Wigmore Hall, recalled it as \u201cextremely positive.\u201d Mr. Osborne \u201cmade no promises, but gave us the impression he was on our side.\u201dImpressions, though, are cheap. And since that feel-good gathering, nothing much has changed to make life easier for anybody present. As the government has made deficit reduction a priority and budget cuts its weapon of choice, all sectors of the economy have been affected without exception. Public funding for the arts has fallen by 14 percent in real terms, allowing for inflation, from the 2010-11 budget year to 2013-14 \u2014 roughly in line with cuts in social welfare. And sending a chill wind along the corridors of many an arts organization is the chancellor\u2019s threat that, if his Conservative party wins the next general election next year, everyone will be in line for a share in 25 billion pounds, or $42 billion, of still more cuts by 2017-18.Adding to the cash-flow problems of orchestra managers in particular is the fact that, while audiences for concerts have increased over the years 2003-12 \u2014 a strange but standard feature of tough times, when music seems to offer solace \u2014 box-office receipts have fallen by 11 percent because so many tickets are discounted, according to a recent survey by the Association of British Orchestras, a trade group. But for all that, British arts executives display a sort of wartime spirit that refuses to admit defeat. \u201cIf you succumb to gloom, you shouldn\u2019t be in this business,\u201d said Douglas Scarfe, chief executive of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. The B.S.O. is a provincial band, far from the lights of London and easily overlooked, although it is one of the busiest orchestras around, giving 150 performances a year over a territory that stretches across six counties to the west of England. As the orchestra is on the road most of the time, its funding comes from eight different local authorities, six of which significantly cut their grants between 2009 and 2014, one by 100 percent in 2011. As a result, the orchestra has lost \u00a3400,000 a year from its operating budget of \u00a36 million and copes with that loss by running a deficit: a dangerous maneuver, financially speaking. But so far, the B.S.O. has not canceled any concerts or clawed back its artistic program. \u201cTo do fewer dates is to become less relevant,\u201d said Mr. Scarfe, whose recommended method for adapting and surviving involves \u201cgetting smarter, more ingenious in the way we work.\u201dThe orchestra has worked to increase its visibility through a relationship with the popular Classic FM radio station. It has a new website. It is exploring more flexible ways to service the region it covers, sending out smaller, more cost-effective chamber-size groups of players, rather than making every concert a full symphonic showcase. Above all, it has rethought the way it pursues private donations, doubling the size of its development team and taking more trouble to target the right people with the right projects.Spending more time and energy on fund-raising is also Mr. Gilhooly\u2019s strategy at Wigmore Hall, which was part-supported by the London Borough of Westminster until the borough council cut funding for the arts entirely: a measure that caused serious resentment in the local cultural community. Wigmore Hall has \u201cbucked the trend,\u201d Mr. Gilhooly said, by putting more effort into finding private donors. \u201cThe lesson for arts managers in these times is that, however much it impacts on the more elevated things you see as your job description, you\u2019ve got to be out there, day and night, chasing checks \u2014 and more strategically.\u201dAt the Wigmore, he continued, \u201cit\u2019s a matter of standing in the foyer, finding out who\u2019s in the audience, and getting to know them beyond the usual suspects. It can be the quiet 40-year-old who never speaks and never gets approached who turns out to be the wealthiest person in the room. But you have to know that, check the postcodes on the bookings, do your homework. And above all, be prepared to knock on doors that were closed to you last time round.\u201dKnocking on closed doors and being more direct \u2014 \u201cwe talk to people now about remembering us in their wills, which would have been too sensitive 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Gilhooly said \u2014 has paid off. Wigmore Hall has amassed \u00a31 million toward a new endowment plan, something it never had before. The London Philharmonic Orchestra which has lost \u00a3850,000 of public funding from its \u00a310 million annual budget, is trying to follow in Wigmore Hall\u2019s footsteps. The orchestra has raised private giving from \u00a3750,000 a year to \u00a32.1 million a year in the 10 years between 2003 and 2013 \u2014 an achievement its chief executive, Timothy Walker, attributes to \u201cgetting up earlier and running faster.\u201d But he added that \u201chowever hard we work on getting those checks, we\u2019re ultimately up against the problem that the U.K. government doesn\u2019t offer donors anything like the tax breaks they\u2019d get in America.\u201d In the United States, a donor can expect a 100 percent deduction on most gifts, while in Britain the deduction is a maximum of 25 percent \u2014 and nothing at all if the giver earns under \u00a340,000 a year. \u201cUntil that changes, British arts organizations will never be able to adopt the American model of reliance on private giving, because there\u2019s not enough incentive for the wealthy,\u201d Mr. Walker said. In the meantime, the London Philharmonic is trying a variety of solutions to plug its funding gap. It has changed its board structure to include fewer musicians and more business leaders in the hope of making better business contacts.And it is pursuing commercial work \u2014 recording video-game soundtracks and film scores, and promoting concerts of the kind that carry no artistic kudos but make money. \u201cAngry Birds Goes Classical,\u201d a chirpy piece of musical banality on disc, is an example Mr. Walker does not flinch from citing. And he does so knowing that the L.P.O. needs to earn 60 percent of its own operating costs. As every \u201cserious\u201d London concert makes a loss, that income has to come from somewhere.One additional solution for his orchestra is to take on more foreign tours, chasing fee levels it couldn\u2019t hope to earn at home for the simple reason that foreign promoters pay better and ticket prices tend to be higher. In 2007-8 the L.P.O. played 39 programs in London; in 2014-15 it will be down to 30. Meanwhile, the number of overseas tours per year has more than doubled, from 22 in 2006-7 to 45 in the current season. Other major orchestras have followed suit. \u201cYou can\u2019t pass through an airport these days without running into orchestral managers on their way to negotiate another tour,\u201d Mr. Gilhooly of Wigmore Hall said.For opera companies the situation is now much the same: increasingly, the only way to fund a new show is to co-produce it with an opera house abroad. Sir Nicholas Kenyon, chief executive of London\u2019s Barbican Center, said that the prestige of a venue like the Barbican allowed it to extract more value from the deals it strikes with incoming performers. Though relatively privileged, thanks to support from neighboring institutions in the City of London financial district, the Barbican nonetheless faces a 7 percent cut in its budget, which it handles by restructuring its relationship with the orchestras that play there.\u201cIn the past,\u201d Mr. Kenyon said, \u201cwe booked the players, paid for everything, then tried to recoup the money from the box office. But now we\u2019re more about sharing risk, in partnership with orchestras that can bring something to the table and develop a project, maybe in residency. We\u2019re not so interested in one-night stands.\u201dAnd like many other executives in British music, Mr. Kenyon is not interested in over-caution, either. He insists that he remains artistically ambitious, eager to bring new work into the Barbican rather than bunker down into the safety of core repertory. But composers see things differently. The national agency that represents their interests, Sound & Music, says that commissions for new work from major orchestras have decreased dramatically over the past five years, to the point where new scores are sometimes being written for nothing more than the chance of a performance. \u201cComposers are an easy target for tight budgets,\u201d said Susanna Eastburn, chief executive of Sound & Music. \u201cEven the major figures find it hard, now, to get work. And when they do, the fees are cut, rehearsals are reduced, the piece gets played just once, and they\u2019re expected to be grateful.\u201d She acknowledged, though, that there might be a silver lining to the cloud. \u201cRealizing they can\u2019t sit around waiting for the phone to ring, composers have become more entrepreneurial, setting up their own artist-led events as a platform for their work and doing the organizing, producing and promoting as well as the writing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has created a new kind of energy to which audiences are responding well, and a potential for something interesting and good to emerge from this crisis, hard as it\u2019s been.\u201d\u201cThe arts are a resilient sector, used to operating on the smell of an oily rag,\u201d Mr. Walker of the London Philharmonic said. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve been going through has really challenged us to be inventive, to come up with better ways of working.\u201dMr. Kenyon of the Barbican takes that sentiment a step further. \u201cThis had to happen, and we\u2019ll come out of it leaner and fitter,\u201d he said of the current economic crisis. \u201cNot that we weren\u2019t pretty lean to start with. But it does depend on how long the economy takes to turn around. Personally I can\u2019t see the next five years being anything but hard. So we have to hang on. And we will.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Some in Europe, High Lending Rates Hamper Recovery", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 L\u00facio Machado\u2019s small business in northern Portugal is finally starting to bustle again after his country\u2019s recession. He hoped to expand his 12-employee business, which repairs autos and creates custom mechanical equipment for trucks and tractors, with a loan.But a banker dashed his plans. For a loan of more than 100,000 euros (or about $138,000), his banker told him the annual interest rate would be around 10 percent. A smaller loan, even if secured with collateral, would cost around 7 percent \u2014 nearly double what a comparable company in Germany might pay.Other small-business owners that Mr. Machado knows in Portugal have been rejected for loans so often, he said, that they have stopped approaching banks.The same thing is happening in other euro zone countries most damaged by the long financial crisis, where small and medium-size businesses are struggling to get the loans that would help them rebuild. Such businesses typically represent two-thirds of all jobs in those countries, so a full-fledged economic recovery is unlikely to take hold as long as such lending remains tight.\u201cIt\u2019s demotivating and almost impossible for an entrepreneur to work with these conditions,\u201d Mr. Machado said. \u201cWithout investment there is no employment growth, and unemployment is the biggest scourge in our country and in Europe.\u201dFor businesses in the 18 countries of the euro zone, sharing a currency is not the same thing as having a common cost of money. In the countries where businesses need loans the most, they are the least likely to get them \u2014 or at least not at affordable rates. The problem is particularly acute in the euro zone\u2019s underperforming southern-tier economies, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece.The situation threatens one of the fundamental aims of the currency union: to create a single market with an integrated economy. The crisis, has forced banks to take a closer look at risks of individual economies, creating a lending disparity that punishes otherwise healthy companies just for being situated in the wrong country.Before the crisis, small and midsize businesses in most of the southern tier did not pay significantly higher interest rates than their northern peers. But in the last two years, as the worst of the euro crisis has passed, a lending gap has developed, at least as measured by interest rates. The scarcity of business lending in the southern tier continues even as the interest rates on sovereign debt in those same countries has come down to nearly precrisis levels and the European Central Bank has held its benchmark lending rate at a record low.The credit squeeze has eased a bit in recent months, according to a recent report from the European Central Bank. But the lending environment remains tough. More than five years after the euro zone\u2019s debt crisis started, new bank loans to businesses are still at only half their former level, the report said.The central bank report found that 66 percent of businesses in Greece, 52 percent in Italy and 43 percent in Portugal still faced a \u201cvery pressing problem\u201d in gaining access to bank credit at affordable rates. When businesses in those countries can obtain loans, they are paying interest rates two to three times as high as German businesses are paying.That environment could perpetuate the euro zone\u2019s two-speed recovery, which is already evident in higher growth and much lower joblessness in countries like Germany and Austria compared with the southern tier.\u201cIt\u2019s something that guarantees economic divergence,\u201d said Simon Tilford, deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London, \u201cand it will make it hard to generate growth in the south, without which those countries\u2019 debts will be unsustainable.\u201dIn some cases, government investment arms are partly filling the breach. In Germany, which pushed austerity on southern countries and is now trying to extend them a helping hand, the state-run development bank KfW recently announced credit facilities of at least \u20ac100 million each, earmarked for lending at affordable rates.For larger companies, the pullback has created an opening for private equity firms and hedge funds. European and Wall Street firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group and Ares Capital, are increasingly involved in direct financing or in restructurings that extend financing in return for equity stakes.In one deal, Kohlberg Kravis lent \u20ac320 million to Uralita, a Spanish building materials firm whose sales had been dragged down by the collapse of the domestic housing market. Uralita had revenue of \u20ac621 million last year, compared with more than \u20ac1 billion in 2008. The seven-year deal, struck last year, has enabled Uralita to pay off its existing bank debt and bonds, expand into more robust markets in Eastern Europe and put new emphasis on the company\u2019s profitable insulation business.\u201cWe are seeing a lot of companies that want to participate in the rebound, but they don\u2019t have the capital and banks aren\u2019t supportive,\u201d said Nathaniel M. Zilkha, co-head of credit and special situations for Kohlberg Kravis in New York. \u201cAfter wandering in the desert, they are saying \u2018We see opportunities to grow again if only we could get financing.'\u2009\u201dFor many companies with sufficient size, raising money through bond offerings is also becoming more common \u2014 a relative novelty in a region where more than 70 percent of corporate financing has traditionally come from banks. Numericable, a French telecommunications company, recently issued \u20ac7.9 billion in junk bonds \u2014 a European record amount \u2014 to help finance its acquisition of the French telecom operator SFR, which it is buying from Vivendi in a \u20ac17 billion deal.When credit is available and affordable, businesses can innovate.Fran\u00e7ois Libner, whose company in St.-Maixent-l'\u00c9cole, France, manufactures delivery truck bodies, said the bank loans he received in 2012 enabled him to develop new technologies, including an electric mini-truck that makes deliveries easier in narrow French streets. The more than \u20ac1 million in loans at around 4 percent interest rates, from France\u2019s state-run industrial bank and commercial banks, also helped him to expand his 200-employee work force to nearly 300.But for smaller companies, in weak economies, financing remains all too scarce.Tens of thousands of businesses collapsed in southern-tier countries during the crisis. The higher loan-default rates there is one reason banks are demanding higher rates now.The European Central Bank has been struggling to address the problem. There has been talk of a program, similar to one used by the Bank of England, to provide incentives to banks to lend money to small and midsize businesses. But the European Central Bank still faces legal and technical obstacles.One complication, economists say, is that the central bank adopted policies that ended up making it more attractive for European banks to spend their money buying high-yielding government bonds rather than take risks with business lending. Now, as the central bank is conducting a review of their balance sheets, banks may have all the more reason to avoid the risks of commercial loans.\u201cBanks are cleaning their balance sheets all over Europe,\u201d especially in the south, said Barbara Richter, an economist at KfW, the German development bank. \u201cThat is easier to do if you buy government bonds, which is less risky than giving loans to small and medium-sized businesses.\u201dMr. Machado wound up reinvesting a portion of the profits of his company, situated in Mondim de Basto, Portugal, to diversify its automotive and engineering operations. But that crimped cash flow, and he has still not been able to hire more workers.Eventually Mr. Machado was able to obtain a \u20ac75,000 bank loan, using his business as collateral. But the 6.9 percent interest rate left him resentful.\u201cWhen I look at the rates in Germany or even Ireland, which are a fraction of what we pay, it is a reflection of the huge problem that the Portuguese have been struggling with, and of the injustice to which we are condemned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will always be a poor peripheral country if nothing changes in Europe to make opportunities more equal.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Still Hurt by Data Breach and Losses in Canada, Target Lowers Forecast", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe performance of several retailers on Wednesday put stagnant wage growth and the uneven economic recovery on display. But all eyes were on one company in particular that has struggled under its own additional set of problems in the last six months, and continues to feel the strain: Target. The retailer lowered its profit outlook for the full year, despite what it called \u201cdramatically better\u201d store traffic than toward the end of the last quarter. Company executives also said they were \u201cpleased\u201d by sales at their United States stores open for at least a year, an important retail metric \u2014 even though those sales had decreased 0.3 percent over the same period the year before. \u201cWe\u2019re not typically pleased with a decrease, but that shows significant improvement from the trends we were seeing late in the fourth quarter,\u201d said John J. Mulligan, Target\u2019s interim chief executive. \u201cSo we made a lot of progress in just three months.\u201dOther retailers that released earnings on Wednesday included American Eagle Outfitters, which reported a difficult quarter that resulted in a plan to close 150 stores, and Lowe\u2019s, which missed analyst expectations. On the higher end, luxury retailers continue to offer the most positive results in a sluggish economy. Tiffany & Company reported on Wednesday that sales increased, and it raised its profit forecast for the year.More companies will report earnings on Thursday, including Best Buy and the struggling department store Sears. Mr. Mulligan said on Wednesday that customers had resumed using credit and debit cards at the company\u2019s stores, after initially shying away and paying cash. To draw customers back, executives said, the company offered more discounts than originally planned, which affected its margins.But Target\u2019s problems are deeper than just the data breach. The company lost $941 million last year in a bungled expansion into Canada, its first foray outside the United States. In the first quarter this year, the company reported losing an additional $211 million in Canada.In addition to its own problems, Target has to contend with a challenging overall landscape for retailers and an uneven economic recovery. A number of retailers reported disappointing earnings in the last week, across a range of categories, merchandise and formats. Mr. Mulligan said Target\u2019s aisles also provided evidence of a struggling customer base.\u201cReal income hasn\u2019t grown in quite some time for middle- and lower-income consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly see that in our stores.\u201dFor the second quarter, the company expects earnings per share of 85 cents to $1, lower than the $1.01 analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected. For the full year, the company now expects earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.90, down from the previous forecast of $3.85 to $4.15.Target\u2019s stock was up 1 percent in the day\u2019s trading. Over the last year, the retailer\u2019s stock has dropped 20 percent.The teenage apparel sector has been sliding in recent quarters, and American Eagle was no exception. Its total revenue decreased 5 percent in its first quarter, and its net income plummeted to $3.86 million from $27.97 million a year earlier.Home Depot reported a similar trend in its earnings release on Tuesday. Sales at Lowe\u2019s stores open for at least a year increased only 0.9 percent in the quarter, while net sales increased 2.4 percent over the year before.On the high end of retail, the picture looked stronger on Wednesday. At Tiffany, the company\u2019s performance was strong enough that it increased its profit guidance for the year. It now expects earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.25, up from its previous forecast of $4.05 to $4.15.Advertisement"}

Suddenly, spontaneously from below, an emergent, connected, aspiring middle class of Ukrainians \u2014 fed up both with regime corruption and how far they\u2019d fallen behind their neighbors in the European Union \u2014 demanded that Yanukovych forge closer cooperation and trade ties with the European Union. They also demanded something now common to every square: the right to be treated as \u201ccitizens\u201d with rights and responsibilities, not as the playthings of oligarchs or outside powers. Yanukovych opted instead for a closer economic relationship with Russia, so The Square People in Kiev toppled him, challenging every aspect of Putin\u2019s K.G.B.-shaped worldview. Putin does not believe any political protest can ever be spontaneous. If a large body of Ukrainians gathered in the square of Kiev to demand an end to corruption and closer ties with the E.U., it could only be because the C.I.A., NATO or the E.U. inspired or paid them to do so. Putin\u2019s whole mind-set is top-down, and the notion that the combination of globalization and the I.T. revolution might have given the \u201cpeople\u201d both the ability to see things they could never see before \u2014 and the tools to collaborate and act on them from the bottom up \u2014 is totally alien to him.Putin is looking backward, trying to restore Russia\u2019s czarist empire, using its natural resources, while the Kiev Square People are looking forward, trying to associate with the E.U., so they can develop their human resources. They believe that integrating their economy with Europe would produce from beyond the judicial reform, transparency and regulations that they could not generate from below and that their leaders would never enact from above. For the Square People of Kiev, an E.U.-Ukraine association is a vital lever for domestic renewal, but for Putin it is a direct threat to his \u201csphere of influence.\u201dDitto in Turkey. A spontaneous movement emerged to resist Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s attempt to install a mall in the only green space near Istanbul\u2019s central Taksim Square, but it quickly mushroomed into protests against his autocratic rule. Erdogan went berserk. He had created a two-party universe that included only himself and the official Turkish opposition parties and TV stations, which he had totally cowed, tamed and neutered. So Turkey\u2019s Square People created a new opposition, and, through Twitter and YouTube, their own TV network. This failure to translate their aspirations into parties that could contest elections and then govern is the Achilles\u2019 heel of The Square People \u2014 from Tahrir Square to Occupy Wall Street. Daniel Brumberg, a democracy expert at Georgetown University and the United States Institute of Peace, points out that the most successful Square People in the Arab world, who forged a whole new constitution, are in Tunisia, which is the Arab country that had \u201cthe most robust civil society institutions \u2014 especially a powerful labor union federation, as well as business, human rights and lawyers associations \u2014 that could arbitrate between the secular and religious factions,\u201d who had come together in the square to oust Tunisia\u2019s dictator. Tunisia also benefited from an army that stayed out of politics and the fact that the secular and Islamist forces had a balance of power, requiring them to be inclusive of one another.I\u2019m encouraged by the many government-monitoring civil society groups that have emerged in Ukraine to make sure that the will of its Square People will not be stolen. Whether Ukraine\u2019s Square People can also develop the inclusive politics \u2014 to respect the views of the more pro-Russia population in the East \u2014 remains to be seen. Without Square People, no change is possible in these countries, but without civil society institutions and inclusive politics, no change is sustainable.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fish Need Trees, Too", "Date": "2014-05-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorAS a resident of Sitka, in southeast Alaska, I\u2019ve worked in the local commercial fishing industry on and off for the past 17 years. This summer I\u2019ll go out on the boat once more, in search of salmon, which have become one of the drivers of the region\u2019s economic recovery. This year, though, the fishing fleet in southeast Alaska will work under the shadow of an announcement by the United States Forest Service that it intends to approve the Big Thorne timber sale, which would allow the logging industry to harvest about 6,200 acres of remnant old-growth trees in Tongass National Forest, the world\u2019s largest remaining temperate rain forest. It would be the most destructive old-growth cut in the forest in the past 20 years.The salmon need those trees to spawn. This means we need those trees. Here\u2019s how a salmon forest works. In a healthy system, the old-growth western hemlock and Sitka spruce provide a moderating influence for the stream environment; large trees along the banks help cool water in the summer and warm it in the winter. The forested hillsides absorb rainfall and snow melt, ensuring a steady flow of current for the hatching and spawning fish. But when timber companies arrive, punching in their roads and clear-cutting, gone are the trees and root wads that create a diverse stream environment. Now the water runs in flash floods down the bare hillsides, washing away the fish eggs and silting up the spawning grounds.It\u2019s sad, and it\u2019s bad business. Fishing \u2014 and tourism \u2014 are directly responsible for the recovering economy in southeast Alaska. Jobs and people trickled away for 10 years, from 1997 to 2007. But in the past two years alone, 1,800 new jobs were created, largely because of good fishing. Population in the southeast is at an all-time high, with more than 74,000 residents, and employment increased by 10 percent over the two-year period from 2010 to 2012.Last year, the salmon harvest set a record at 272 million fish. (Juiced up on coffee and peanut butter bars, my skipper and I caught about 25,000 of these.) That\u2019s good business, and the fishery, managed by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, has proved sustainable. But the Forest Service, buffeted by lobbying pressures and subject to a 1990 Congressional mandate to seek to meet demand for Tongass timber, is stuck in an outdated \u201cget out the cut\u201d mind-set that made sense back when timber was southeast Alaska\u2019s economic backbone. The era of clear-cutting old-growth stands, however, is over. Once accounting for some 3,500 jobs, timber now provides fewer than 300 jobs a year. This includes sawmills, logging, logging support and wood-product manufacturing. At one point, pulp mills and sawmills hummed away throughout southeast Alaska. Now only one major sawmill remains. To be clear, I\u2019m not anti-logging. The harvesting of young growth and second growth could play an important role in the southeast\u2019s recovery. But when the Forest Service makes a timber sale, it\u2019s geared toward larger, out-of-town companies that can exit the state quickly. Small-scale local operations can\u2019t afford the large tracts the Forest Service makes available, nor do they have the equipment to complete the cut by the required deadline. In more depressing news for the local economy, in February the Forest Service released a newsletter that concluded that as a result of a 42 percent cut in funding in the past five years, it can \u201cno longer maintain\u201d the current recreation and trail infrastructure and must reduce its inventory.There goes the tourism.The Forest Service itself has identified more than $100 million in unmet \u201cwatershed restoration work\u201d (Forest Service-speak for \u201cwe really jammed this stream up good and should probably do something about it\u201d). The agency has estimated that it will take more than 50 years to redress the problems logging in the Tongass has already caused wild salmon. Here\u2019s a crazy idea: Instead of prioritizing large-scale timber sales, what if the Forest Service protected the Tongass? What if it joined up with local groups like the Sitka Conservation Society and became a willing partner in aggressive stream restoration and cabin and trail maintenance? Salmon would have their spawning grounds, and tourists who come to Alaska to see one of the last wild places on earth wouldn\u2019t find in its place a moonscape. In a few weeks I\u2019ll pack my dry-bag with my fishing bibs and ratty Carhartts and sweatshirt with the cuffs lopped off, whistle the dog onto a salmon troller named Saturday and head out with my skipper into the open waters. Word is it\u2019s already shaping up to be a good summer. But if we get down to Prince of Wales Island, near those 6,200 acres of spruce and hemlock slated to be cut, I\u2019ll want to spend an afternoon following those majestic salmon upstream, right up to where they lay their eggs, in the shadows of those ancient trees. And I\u2019ll be thinking about the narrator in Cormac McCarthy\u2019s novel \u201cThe Road,\u201d observing fish in a stream: \u201cOn their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again.\u201dI hope the Forest Service chooses to become a partner in southeast Alaska\u2019s economic and ecological restoration, instead of its enemy, while things still can be made right.Brendan Jones is the author of the forthcoming novel \u201cThe Alaskan Laundry.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bassoon Maker Is Leaving Lower East Side for Cheaper Rent in Maine", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are not many places to sit amid the jumble of metal tools, piles of maple and boxwood boards, and bassoons crowding \u2014 and even hanging from the ceiling of \u2014 Leslie Ross\u2019s studio on the Lower East Side. \u201cThis is only about half full,\u201d Ms. Ross, 54, said recently while surveying the room, on the top floor of a small commercial building on Essex Street, where she has spent years building bassoons and inventing unusual instruments of her own.Now, after nearly three decades in New York City, she is swapping her crammed studio for a sprawling former canning factory in the tiny coastal town of Penobscot, Me., population 1,263.Like many others before her, Ms. Ross is being washed out of Manhattan by the great wave of rising rents. \u201cMy rent is over four times what it was 20 years ago,\u201d said Ms. Ross, who pays $2,000 a month for half of a floor (she shares the space with a sculptor), where a thick dusting of cat hair covers most everything and a dozen canaries in bird cages provide a constant chirping chatter. \u201cI know the rent is only going to go higher, so why wait until I absolutely can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m at the point of having to scramble?\u201dBorn in Germany, Ms. Ross grew up the second of four children in Ankara, Turkey, until age 8. The family moved briefly to France before settling in Montreal. Ms. Ross\u2019s mother, who grew up in Morocco, taught English and French, while her father, who came from the interior of British Columbia, was an airplane engineer.Ms. Ross was always musical and handy, she said. While in high school, she played bassoon in the woodwind band. \u201cThe first time I was allowed to bring my instrument home, I stripped it,\u201d she said. \u201cI took every single key off and put it in a pile. I had to stay home the next day to put it back together.\u201dIn 1985, at age 25, Ms. Ross moved to New York City to apprentice with a bassoon maker, and she soon became enmeshed in the downtown improvisational music scene. She played bassoon and fanciful instruments she gave names like \u201cteetering-plucked and circular bowed\u201d (a string-playing machine), collaborating with modern dancers and performing at small clubs like the Knitting Factory and Tonic.In 1993, Ms. Ross opened her own shop, making the dulcian, a woodwind instrument popular during the Renaissance, and bassoons from the baroque, classical and romantic periods. It is a complex, time-consuming process. While modern bassoons are made in factories, with professional models costing more than $20,000, Ms. Ross builds her instruments to order. She makes an average of just eight a year, for which she charges $3,000 to $9,000, depending on the model.\u201cTo build a historical bassoon you have to make your own set of tools,\u201d Ms. Ross said. These include reamers, which look like long drill bits, that are used to create conical-shaped bores, or holes, through the wood that help give the instrument its unique sound. The roughed out bassoon is then laid aside, sometimes for years, to allow the wood to expand and contract, before it is finished. Keys are cut from brass, and Ms. Ross also makes bocals (the thin tubes used to play the instrument) and reeds. Ms. Ross\u2019s clients, who include universities and musicians, find her mostly through word-of-mouth, with about 60 percent of her sales coming from abroad, the majority from Europe.\u201cRight now there are no other North American historical bassoon makers aside from myself,\u201d Ms. Ross said. \u201cThere used to be three of us, but with today\u2019s economy, many people are asking themselves if they really need that extra bassoon.\u201dAfter so many years in New York, Ms. Ross is excited about a shift of scenery. She used to let her canaries fly free, \u201cbut they spent their days building nests everywhere \u2014 bookshelves, door jams, on top of curtain rods.\u201d She was not the greatest housekeeper, so she decided to cage them. Now, she will finally have the space to let the birds loose. She is building an aviary that will be a cat-free zone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Building Firm Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Its Customers", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStructure Tone, one of the nation\u2019s largest construction firms, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to corruption charges and agreed to forfeit $55 million for a scheme in which the company defrauded a roster of prominent financial institutions, law firms and ad agencies out of tens of millions of dollars.The company arranged for electrical, plumbing, drywall and other subcontractors to falsely inflate their bills for Structure Tone\u2019s clients, investigators say, adding millions of dollars to the cost of building office space for Bank of America; Moody\u2019s; Bloomberg; Proskauer Rose, a law firm; and other major customers between 2005 and 2009.The plea is part of the latest scandal to erupt in the largely hidden but vastly lucrative business of designing and building the walls and guts of corporate towers in New York City, an industry in which corruption often adds to the already high cost for developers, law enforcement officials say. The continuing investigation by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office has resulted in guilty pleas or convictions against six other companies and at least half a dozen executives.For Structure Tone, the plea hearing in State Supreme Court in Manhattan was a replay of a past scandal involving interior construction contractors. In 1998, the company paid $10 million and pleaded guilty to felony charges related to its role in a $2 billion bid-rigging and bribery scheme involving Sony Corporation and other high-profile companies.But despite its checkered past, Structure Tone, the largest interior construction firm in the city\u2019s $29 billion construction industry, continues to thrive; Sony recently hired the company to build its new New York headquarters on Madison Avenue.\u201cInteriors construction is a multibillion-dollar industry in New York City and is vital to our city\u2019s economy,\u201d the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement. \u201cStructure Tone\u2019s felony plea and forfeiture of $55 million \u2014 one of the largest forfeiture penalties ever imposed on a construction company \u2014 sends a clear message that this type of criminal activity will not be tolerated. This plea agreement addresses the severity of Structure Tone\u2019s criminal conduct, while taking into consideration the remedial actions the company has implemented.\u201dMr. Vance said the construction industry \u201cshould be on alert.\u201d \u201cWe are rooting out fraud,\u201d he added, \u201cand making sure that honest businesses can compete fairly.\u201dStructure Tone officials said that they were satisfied to have the matter resolved and that the case would not affect the company\u2019s ability to work on current and future projects. It pleaded guilty to a single count of falsifying business records in the first degree.\u201cThe record-keeping issues, which form the basis of this agreement, date back to the period 2005 to 2009, and we have fully cooperated with authorities from the beginning,\u201d Structure Tone said in a statement. \u201cThe financial position of our company \u2014 which generates $3 billion annually in revenue \u2014 continues to be strong. Long before this process began, we strengthened our compliance protocols to improve transparency.\u201dIn the current case, David Szuchman, the district attorney\u2019s chief of investigations, said Structure Tone had falsified business records that allowed it to reap \u201ctens of millions of dollars from easily dozens of companies,\u201d by inflating purchase orders over the five-year course of the scheme.Mr. Szuchman said the scheme ended in 2010 after Structure Tone became aware of the investigation. Although the company has since taken remedial action to avoid illegal practices, he said his office would monitor the company\u2019s business records for the next three years to ensure that there was no wrongdoing.After pleading guilty in 1998, Structure Tone said it worried that its reputation would be forever stained. The company was the largest beneficiary of the bribery and bid-rigging, having admitted to paying a bribe to ensure that it won a $500 million contract to renovate Sony\u2019s former headquarters. Nearly three dozen companies and 40 executives pleaded guilty.\u201cThe opportunities to steal and the incentives to cheat are so huge in construction that fraud has always threatened every single building project in our city,\u201d said Mr. Thacher, chief executive of Thacher Associates, which provides a monitoring service for companies engaged in construction projects. \u201cCorruption adds many, many hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost of construction each year in this city, and that cost is passed on to the public.\u201dStructure Tone specializes in building office space, or interior construction, as opposed to erecting the core and shell of a skyscraper. In some instances, it acts as a construction manager for a firm, overseeing the work, negotiating contracts and hiring subcontractors, on behalf of a corporate client.On other jobs, the company serves as a general contractor hired to perform the work for a fixed price, or \u201clump sum.\u201dAccording to investigators, when Structure Tone acted as a construction manager it would tell subcontractors to raise their prices to account for unnecessary \u201ccontingencies\u201d under an addendum known as \u201cRider B,\u201d whose existence was never revealed to the client. At the same time, the executives would demand a discount from subcontractors on \u201clump sum\u201d contracts.\u201cRider B was the vehicle for the fraud,\u201d Mr. Szuchman said.The district attorney\u2019s current investigation began in 2009, with the Builders Group, a firm that was eventually indicted on a charge of stealing $7 million from clients at five condominium and office projects in New York.The company, as well as three executives, ultimately pleaded guilty, and the company is no longer in business.As a result of information gleaned from a second set of business records discovered at the home of a Lehr executive, the district attorney\u2019s office began interviewing 100 subcontractors about fake invoices and inflated bills. Many of the subcontractors provided information about not only Lehr, but also Structure Tone and other companies.The district attorney subsequently won convictions against Lehr and three of its top executives.Structure Tone initially denied charges of corruption.But on Wednesday, Structure Tone pleaded guilty to falsifying business records and paid one of the largest forfeiture penalties ever imposed on a construction company. \u201cHowever they want to spin it,\u201d said J. Bruce Maffeo, a former federal prosecutor who has represented subcontractors in the construction industry, \u201c$55 million is still a lot of money, even in this town.\u201dAn earlier version of this article contained several errors. The article described incorrectly what Structure Tone admitted to in a corruption case. The company acknowledged it had defrauded clients out of tens of millions of dollars; it did not say it had stolen from them. (The error was repeated in the headline and a summary capsule.) The surname of the company\u2019s executive chairman was misspelled. He is James Donaghy, not Doneghy. And the article misstated which Structure Tone executives investigators had interviewed. Mr. Donaghy was not among them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Searching for Yield, at Almost Any Price", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceWhen buyers demand something, the supply will be created.Especially on Wall Street.These days, thanks in no small part to the prolonged easing by the Federal Reserve, there is a great demand for investments that provide yield.Apple, a rich company that borrows for two reasons \u2014 to pacify shareholders and avoid paying taxes \u2014 came to market this week with $13 billion in new bonds. That was on the heels of a $17 billion offering a year earlier.It was such a smashing success that Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, promptly proclaimed that \u201cApple bonds are Giffen goods.\u201dGiffen goods, named after Sir Robert Giffen, a 19th-century Scottish statistician and economist who discovered they could exist, defy the normal law of supply and demand. Raise the price, and people will buy more.They are extremely rare.The classic example \u2014 and the only one I had heard of before Apple sold its new bonds \u2014 was potatoes at a time when they were the chief source of nourishment for Irish peasants. If potato prices fell, the peasants could afford more meat and would therefore eat fewer potatoes. When potato prices rose, they could no longer afford meat and would consume more potatoes.Last week, when Apple announced its plans to sell all those new bonds, the price of its existing bonds fell a little, which is what normal supply and demand models would predict. But this week, when the bonds were actually sold, prices rose. Apple\u2019s 30-year bonds now cost more, relative to Treasury bonds, than they did before the new borrowing was announced.\u201cApple,\u201d explained Mr. Mikkelsen, \u201cwas able to generate increased demand for its bonds at flat to higher prices. That clearly is a testament to continued inflows to credit and the precious availability of bonds, rather than your textbook supply-demand chart.\u201dIn other words, investors are desperate for yield and will flock to it. That is great for those companies that can issue bonds, but it took a while for those that depend on bank loans to see a similar development. Now banks are making more loans to companies, and even mortgages are becoming easier to obtain.\u201cThe average FICO score on new mortgages is falling and this is consistent with the anecdotal evidence that banks are easing mortgage lending standards,\u201d said Torsten Slok, the chief international economist of Deutsche Bank Securities, pointing to data on mortgages acquired by Fannie Mae. The FICO score measures creditworthiness.Just why mortgages took longer to ease up is the subject of more than a little speculation. Some say banks saw no reason to go after any but the safest borrowers as long as they were making a lot of refinancing loans to highly qualified borrowers. So they imposed what are known as \u201coverlays\u201d \u2014 requirements that were tougher than they had to be on loans that would be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u201cBased on loans we\u2019ve acquired and our conversations with lenders,\u201d said Andrew Bon Salle, an executive vice president of Fannie Mae, \u201cwe know that many lenders have been removing overlays.\u201d They need to do that to keep their mortgage businesses from shrinking.\u00a0Fixed-income investors trying to increase their income essentially have two options.\u00a0One is to extend maturities. The other is to reduce credit quality.There are risks to both. The prices of long-term bonds fall sharply when interest rates go up. Lower-quality bonds are more likely to default.These days, lower quality, rather than longer maturities, seems to be more popular. Money has poured into mutual funds that invest in bank loans \u2014 often low-quality ones. To a lesser extent, it has also gone into high-yield mutual funds that buy bonds rated below investment grade, known as junk bonds to those who are dubious of them.\u201cIt is a very favorable time for bond issuers,\u201d said Martin Fridson, the chief investment officer of Lehmann, Livian,\u00a0Fridson\u00a0Advisors and a longtime analyst of the high-yield market. \u201cThere is just a lot of money sloshing around out there. There are simply not a lot of alternatives, and money managers are under pressure to put that money to work.\u201dWhat that money will buy now is low yields, relative to risk. It also buys less protection than it used to in terms of covenants \u2014 terms put in bonds that are supposed to protect investors if conditions worsen. In normal times, extremely weak junk bonds at least come with relatively strong covenants. But Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which maintains a \u201ccovenant quality index,\u201d said in March that the lowest-quality new issues had fewer covenants than did slightly better-quality bonds.That preference \u2014 for low quality rather than long duration \u2014 is easy to understand. Worries about potential Fed tightening caused long-term bond prices to fall last summer, scaring some investors. But default rates on high-yield bonds remain low.Mr. Fridson says he thinks that investors are not being paid nearly enough for the risks they are taking and that high-yield bonds are overvalued. But he concedes that has been true for some time, and it is far from clear what will cause that to change.He noted that \u201cthe projected number of defaulting debt issuers is triple the number that defaulted in the short but severe\u00a0upsurge\u00a0of 2008-9 and nearly double the number that defaulted in the five-year\u00a0upsurge\u00a0that began in 1999.\u201dA currently hot category of fixed-income mutual funds features funds called \u201cunconstrained\u201d or \u201cstrategic\u201d by their sponsors. They can use derivatives to eliminate any risk from rising interest rates. Eric Jacobson, a mutual fund analyst at Morningstar, says some now even have \u201cnegative duration,\u201d a concept that is hard to fathom. The funds also have the freedom to move in and out of different kinds of bonds, which is supposed to produce superior performance \u2014 and will do so if the managers do turn out to be able to call market turns in advance.Good luck.Eventually, I suspect that some of those who have poured money into such funds will be surprised to learn that they have purchased lower-quality bonds, something that will be very painful if Mr. Fridson turns out to be right.All this easy credit may not do as much as it could for the economy. Loans that finance corporate acquisitions, or dividends to private equity funds, won\u2019t do anything for employment, or at least a lot less than loans that pay for the purchase of new plants and equipment.As for Apple, the yields on this year\u2019s bonds are a little higher than the ones on last year\u2019s. The new 30-year bond has a coupon of 4.45 percent, compared with 3.85 percent. The 10-year bond rate has climbed to 3.45 percent from 2.4 percent. If you bought either bond a year ago, and sold it this week, you would have a net loss.If all this ends badly, as Mr. Fridson expects, there will be a lot of blame heaped on the Fed for keeping interest rates so low for so long, thus encouraging the speculation. At least some of the criticism might be better directed at the Congress. Had it been willing to provide more fiscal stimulus, the Fed might not have been forced to follow the course it has.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great Russia\u2019s Grand Choice", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 For most of the post-Soviet years, Russia has been torn by a question that haunts its people and their rulers: Do Russians want their country to be an imperialist power feared by other nations or a land whose primary concern is its citizens\u2019 well-being?President Vladimir V. Putin has resolved the issue, or so it seems. He has decided to tip the balance in favor of ambitious expansionist politics rather than domestic development. Prosperity for the people is all very well up to a point, but it has a downside: It produces independent-minded individuals who may try to vote their ruler out of office.Pursuing grand strategies on the international stage is safer \u2014 at least for Russia\u2019s powers that be. Defending the Russian-speaking populations of the former Soviet Union creates so much tension both at home and abroad that the domestic economic agenda is dwarfed in comparison. Who cares about economic deterioration, poor public services or endemic corruption when the nation is gripped by imperialist fervor?But in pushing Russian expansionism is Mr. Putin really making a safer bet? When asked by pollsters about what Russia\u2019s priorities should be, respondents are generally divided. In a recent survey by the Levada Center, a Russian nongovernmental research organization, 48 percent favored prioritizing the country\u2019s international standing, while 47 percent said they favored a government that concentrated on creating conditions for individual prosperity.Almost a decade ago, there were indications that this dilemma was close to being resolved in favor of economic progress and peaceful nation-building. According to a poll conducted in 2005 by Levada, more than 60 percent of respondents said they would prefer to live in a nation with higher living standards, while 36 percent counted national \u201cgreatness\u201d as a priority. But that resolve proved temporary.They continued: \u201cIs the goal politics or prosperity for citizens? There is no clear mechanism to resolve these incompatible aspirations. Instead, conflicting signals threaten to cancel each other out and, even worse, create a high level of uncertainty about future policies.\u201dOne has to remember that, in a country where the mass media is under strict government control, public opinion may be easily skewed. For several years, especially since street protests erupted in late 2011 and the Kremlin was shocked to discover serious public discontent, the state propaganda machine has been busy inventing or exaggerating threats the Russians are supposedly facing. Mr. Putin embarked on a radical information offensive to divide and frighten his countrymen.The current streak of anti-Ukrainian and anti-Western propaganda \u2014 fraught with menacing imagery of Ukrainian fascists and their American puppeteers \u2014 is only a recent chapter in a larger PR-strategy. Past Kremlin agitprop has included dire warnings of vague conspiracies to overthrow the government, attacks on artists supposedly seeking to humiliate the Russian church, and warnings that homosexuals and a \u201cpedophile lobby\u201d are using the Internet to undermine the traditional family and Russian society.These threats, fomented by the state-controlled media, are an excuse to increase the security budget, push anti-gay legislation and laws against \u201cblasphemy,\u201d and establish control over the Internet.The Kremlin\u2019s current propaganda campaign, focused on the \u201cUkrainian threat,\u201d has been paraded as a justification for military activity along that country\u2019s borders, for possible covert use of force inside Ukraine and for an all-out information war against the West.Given the intensity of the media blitz, it\u2019s a sign of relative sanity that only half of Russians are choosing sovereign and military greatness over well-being.\u201cDespite all the propaganda, half of the country is resisting the imperialist temptation,\u201d says Vladimir Magun, a sociologist with the Russian Academy of Sciences.Mr. Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea appears to be overwhelmingly popular, but that is because the true cost is being hidden. The Russian public has readily bought the propaganda message that it received Crimea as a free gift, says Mr. Magun, but it\u2019s like shopping in a store with no price tags. A disappointment awaits us at the exit: Stores that don\u2019t display price tags are usually very expensive.As a result of Mr. Putin\u2019s adventure, Russians can expect higher borrowing costs and a decrease in the value of the ruble, and along with that, a decrease in the value of their savings. Mr. Putin is risking a severe economic downturn and even a regional war.The president must understand that he won\u2019t be able to avoid economic realities: We can\u2019t race ahead without fundamental improvements in Russia\u2019s global competitiveness. The economy is in recession, and though the effects have not yet trickled down to most Russians, tougher economic times lie ahead. That will bring a day of reckoning.Mr. Putin will argue that the West is punishing Russia for its international ambitions and that we, the Russian people, will have to persevere.This is the type of social contract the Soviet government used to impose on its citizens: The enemy is at the gate, and we all have to hunker down. Mr. Putin is bringing this siege mentality back because he knows very well how to work it to his advantage.The choice between \u201cgreatness\u201d on the world stage and domestic prosperity is a false one. Russia can be a formidable world power while flourishing at home.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Pollution Challenge", "Date": "2014-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsChina\u2019s national legislature has adopted sweeping changes to the country\u2019s Environmental Protection Law, revisions that have been hailed as major steps toward saving China\u2019s environment from rampant degradation. The authorities will now have stronger enforcement powers, including the right to detain persistent violators for up to 15 days and to fine polluters more heavily than before. Some legally registered civil-society organizations will now be able to initiate public-interest litigation as well. The law, approved late last month, solidifies the use of environmental targets to assess bureaucrats, who for too long have been measured primarily on economic performance. It also increases transparency by requiring major violators to disclose pollution data and local governments to release information on environmental quality and enforcement.These changes offer hope to the hundreds of millions of people exposed to the extraordinary risks of China\u2019s severe air, water and soil pollution. We believe the new Environmental Protection Law is a signal from the government that it is taking the issue seriously. Moreover, it is a victory for the countless people in China who have worked for years for environmental change. Even a decade ago, most of the amendments to the law would have been unthinkable.And yet the new law alone may end up doing little to end the impunity that polluters regularly enjoy. Only deep and fundamental changes in the organization of the party-state can bring down the extreme levels of pollution in China. Environmental law enforcement has failed across the country largely because the regulatory agencies face conflicts of interest that limit their ability to do their jobs. Local governments provide most of the budgets for local environmental bureaus, but also maintain strong economic and political ties to the companies that pollute. Moreover, a significant part of local environmental regulatory budgets comes from pollution-discharge fees. Because these fees are based on the amount of pollution, this leads to the perverse result that reduced pollution can mean the loss of crucial environmental enforcement funds. If systemic problems like these are not resolved, it is unlikely that the environmental authorities will avail themselves of the stronger enforcement powers granted to them by the new law. The introduction of more stringent environmental targets for local leaders is a step in the right direction, but it does not fully resolve the core conflict between environmental regulation and polluting industries. These problems are well known in China, as are potential solutions, such as a recentralization of enforcement authority away from local governments, further decoupling of relations between the state and the companies it controls, and full payment of the regulatory budget out of sources unrelated to pollution enforcement. Such reforms go far beyond the reach of mere environmental law, however, and will require a basic rethinking of central-local relations and the operations of state capitalism. Experience in both developed and emerging economies shows that citizens and civic organizations are necessary to oversee polluting companies as well as regulators. In this vein, China\u2019s new law promotes \u201csocietal supervision\u201d of polluters and regulators through greater transparency, public participation and the right to sue polluters.The nation\u2019s leaders nevertheless remain fearful of citizen unrest breaking out over pollution violations, and preventing social unrest remains the top priority. The government continues to restrict citizens from exercising their legal rights to help control pollution. Other laws limit the registration of civic organizations, making it nearly impossible for national or regional environmental organizations to develop. At present, petitioners and advocates for the environment run the risk of harassment and arrest. Courts often refuse to even accept difficult or sensitive cases. The Supreme People\u2019s Court has adopted rules for breaking up class-action lawsuits and relegating individual suits to co-opted lower-level courts. Citizens are therefore often unable to use the law against polluters, especially ones with strong ties to the government. As a result, citizen supervision has been blunted and pollution only grows. The new law may empower citizens, but it still fails to correct systemic barriers that restrict citizen action in practice.China\u2019s half-hearted effort at legal reform is a major risk for the party-state. It raises public expectations for a better environment, but fails to lay sufficient groundwork for improvements in environmental performance. The resulting growth in under-regulated pollution will lead to more public grievances. While many citizens may not be willing to risk aggressive action, an increasing number will conclude that only disruptive activism can force the government\u2019s hand. Ever-increasing environmental protests throughout the nation have already highlighted the costs of this approach to the party-state.In the end, protecting China\u2019s beleaguered environment will require the government to reach beyond its comfort zone and confront the limits of its economic and political model. It will require the courage of the central leadership to face down vested interests in the state and industry that oppose the creation of impartial administrative and judicial institutions to regulate pollution. It will also require the good sense to allow society the genuine freedom to act as environmental watchdog without fear of repercussion. These suggestions would touch the heart of the current power structure \u2014 but so does the country\u2019s immense environmental crisis. China\u2019s new leadership has shown the courage to confront corruption at the highest levels of power. Surely, it can now demonstrate the same commitment toward saving the nation\u2019s environment. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Around a Sardinian Table, a Fractious Debate", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverLU FRAILI, Sardinia \u2014 April was lovely, as always, in Sardinia. The summer tourists had not yet arrived; the island was covered with wildflowers and the wild asparagus was pushing up among the cork trees. This spring felt especially healing after the death and destruction wrought by cyclone Cleopatra last November. The storm had damaged my 84-year-old father\u2019s house, and I had come to deal with the repairs.Sardinia is a special autonomous region of Italy, with greater local control of legislation, administration and finance than in other Italian regions. It is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean after Sicily, with which it shares representation in the European Parliament. A hardscrabble life, shaped by the island\u2019s unique language, environment and history, has given Sardinians a strong sense of identity, which they struggle to defend against the forces of cultural and economic integration with Italy, Europe, and the rest of the world.My Sardinian friends organized a special dinner for me featuring a traditional suckling pig roasted on myrtle branches, as well as Sardinian wines, including Cannonau. Eventually, the conversation veered into the contentious realm of Italian politics and the upcoming European parliamentary elections.The men on either side of me locked into a debate in rapid-fire Italian that I, the lone American, strained to follow. One guest was a convert to the populist Five Star Movement of comedian-turned-political-activist Beppe Grillo. Both of Italy\u2019s main political parties, he argued, were beholden to the same powerful business and Mafia interests. Only the Five Star party had the courage to chart a path out of Italy\u2019s political quagmire and its enslavement to a European Union co-opted by international business interests.The other guest argued just as passionately that Mr. Grillo was a dangerous populist and that Italy\u2019s best hope lay with the center-left Democratic Party, Italy\u2019s new prime minister, the 39-year-old go-getter, Matteo Renzi, and Renato Soru, Sardinia\u2019s own Internet billionaire and the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate to represent Sardinia and Sicily in the European Parliament. One of the other guests chimed in to say the real danger was Silvio Berlusconi and his conservative Forza Italia party, along with the extreme-right Northern League.Sardinia has a rich history of invasion and exploitation by outsiders. Now the lack of jobs forces many of the island\u2019s sons and daughters to leave to seek employment on the Italian mainland and beyond. Per capita income in Sardinia is nearly 25 percent lower than the Italian average, and unemployment tops 18 percent. The traditional handicrafts industry has been eviscerated. Middle-class tourism has nose-dived.At the same time, the superrich continue to flock to Sardinia\u2019s Costa Smeralda where Mr. Berlusconi owns a multimillion-dollar estate and Qatar Holding has announced plans to build new ultraluxury hotels and an aquatic amusement park. But a tourism-dependent economy has compounded the estrangement many Sardinians feel toward their homeland and culture. Some still dream of seceding from Italy entirely, and the recent vote, largely symbolic, by Venetians to do just that has inspired them.Beyond Italy, many see global economic integration as the greatest threat Sardinian culture has ever faced. While the European Union\u2019s money is welcomed \u2014 Sardinia benefits from union designation as a region targeted for economic improvement \u2014 the additional layer of European rules imposed on the island\u2019s small business owners and agriculturalists is resented.The United States is now lobbying hard in the proposed trans-Atlantic trade deal to crack European resistance to American agribusiness products, generally characterized by European news media as hormone-laden beef, bleach-rinsed chicken and genetically modified foods. This does not go over well in Italy, and many Sardinians fear the agreement, if approved, would create a supragovernmental set of rules dictated by powerful multinational corporations that would threaten a central part of Sardinian culture: local food. Similar fears are driving the rise of euro-skepticism and secession talk elsewhere in Europe in advance of the European parliamentary elections next week.At the end of the evening, I asked one of my Sardinian friends about the movement to have the island adopted by Switzerland. \u201cToo much Cannonau can make everything seem possible,\u201d he said with a laugh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Paradox of Art as Work", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCross CutsThere are few modern relationships as fraught as the one between art and money. Are they mortal enemies, secret lovers or perfect soul mates? Is the bond between them a source of pride or shame, a marriage of convenience or something tawdrier?The way we habitually think and talk about these matters betrays a deep and venerable ambivalence. On one hand, art is imagined to exist in a realm of value that lies beyond and beneath mere economic considerations. The old phrase \u201cstarving artist\u201d gestures toward an image that is both romantic and pathetic, of a person too pure, and also just too impractical, to make it in the world. When that person ceases to starve, he or she can always be labeled a sellout. You\u2019re not supposed to be in it for the money.On the other hand, money is now an important measure \u2014 maybe the supreme measure \u2014 of artistic accomplishment. Box office grosses have long since become part of the everyday language of cinephilia, as moviegoers absorb the conventional wisdom, once confined mainly to accountants and trade papers, about which movies are breaking out, breaking even or falling short. Multimillion-dollar sales of paintings by hot new or revered old artists are front-page news. To be a mainstream rapper is to have sold a lot of recordings on which you boast about how much money you have made selling your recordings.Everyone might be sure that sales are not the only criterion of success, but no one is quite certain what the others might be, or how, in our data-obsessed era, they might be measured. In the popular imagination, artists tend to exist either at the pinnacle of fame and luxury or in the depths of penury and obscurity \u2014 rarely in the middle, where most of the rest of us toil and dream. They are subject to admiration, envy, resentment and contempt, but it is odd how seldom their efforts are understood as work. Yes, it\u2019s taken for granted that creating is hard, but also that it\u2019s somehow fundamentally unserious. Schoolchildren may be encouraged (at least rhetorically) to pursue their passions and cultivate their talents, but as they grow up, they are warned away from artistic careers. This attitude, always an annoyance, is becoming a danger to the health of creativity itself. It may seem strange to say so, since we live at a time of cultural abundance and flowering amateurism, when the tools of creativity seem to be available to anyone with a laptop. But the elevation of the amateur over the professional trivializes artistic accomplishment and helps to undermine the already precarious living standards that artists have been able to enjoy. The question of who profits and who gets paid has become a contentious one. The cultural economy has always been mixed \u2014 a volatile blend of bazaar, bureaucracy and medieval court. Some parts of it appear, at least at first glance, to function by the rules of the free market. In reality, of course, this activity \u2014 represented by quaint, in some cases obsolescent institutions like the bookshop, the record store and the movie theater \u2014 has been governed by a complex web of middlemen and corporate players: agents, producers, movie studios, publishing houses, record companies and so on.That capitalist enterprise zone exists alongside, and in practice frequently overlaps with, a realm of patronage. Individual artists subsist on grants from foundations and the government, which along with corporations and wealthy donors support the institutions that bring those artists\u2019 work to the public. When you buy your ticket and walk into a museum, a regional theater or a symphony hall, the experience you are purchasing has been subsidized by the philanthropists whose names are listed in the lobby.Everything I\u2019ve ever doneGonna give it awaySomeone hit the big scoreThey figured it outWe were gonna do it anywayEven if it didn\u2019t pay.In the years since, the big score has been realized by technology and social media companies, which have enticed users to generate content for nothing. \u201cIf there\u2019s something that you want to hear/You can sing it yourself,\u201d Ms. Welch sang. The subsequent history of the Internet has turned this \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d-like idea on its head, enshrining democratic amateurism as a cultural norm and a Utopian possibility. We can all do it anyway \u2014 make our own videos and songs, write our own poetry and personal essays, exhibit our paintings and our selves \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t pay.Digital amateurism also sells itself as an alternative route to professional riches. Competitive reality television, Kickstarter campaigns and cooperative self-publishing ventures offer the lure of fame and fortune accomplished without the usual middlemen. The idea that everyone can be an artist \u2014 making stuff that can be shared, traded or sold to a self-selecting audience of fellow creators \u2014 sits awkwardly alongside the self-contradictory dream that everyone can be a star.The result is, or threatens to become, a stratification that mirrors the social and economic inequality undermining our civic life. A concentration of big stars, blockbusters and best sellers \u2014 Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cThe Avengers\u201d and their ilk \u2014 will sit at the top of the ladder. An army of striving self-starters will swarm at the bottom rungs, hoping that their homemade videos go viral, their self-published memoir catches fire or their MFA thesis show catches the eye of a wealthy buyer. The middle ranks \u2014 home to modestly selling writers, semi-popular bands, working actors, local museums and orchestras \u2014 are being squeezed out of existence.The middle \u2014 that place where professionals do their work in conditions that are neither lavish nor improvised, for a reasonable living wage \u2014 is especially vulnerable to collapse because its existence has rarely been recognized in the first place. Nobody would argue against the idea that art has a social value, and yet almost nobody will assert that society therefore has an obligation to protect that value by acknowledging, and compensating, the labor of the people who produce it. And artists themselves, outside of unionized industries like television and movies, are unlikely to perceive defending the value of what they do as an interest they hold in common. But it is not necessarily in their nature to be any more individualistic or competitive than anybody else, and they may have a lot to teach the rest of us about the meaning of work. If the supposedly self-involved members of the creative class can organize to assert some control over what they make \u2014 the magical stuff now routinely referred to as \u201ccontent\u201d \u2014 then maybe other residents of the beleaguered middle might be inspired by their examples. Inexpensive goods carry hidden costs, and those costs are frequently borne by exploited, underpaid workers. This is true of our clothes and our food, and it is no less true of those products we turn to for meaning, pleasure and diversion. We will no doubt continue to indulge all kinds of romantic conceits about artists: myths about the singularity of genius or the equal distribution of talent; clich\u00e9s about flaky, privileged weirdos; inspiring tales of dreamers who persevered. But we also need to remember, with all the political consequences that this understanding entails, that they are just doing their jobs.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Budget Proposal Finds Critics at a Ratings Agency and in Accounting", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn unveiling his budget proposal last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio repeatedly said it toed the line between fiscal prudence and progressiveness \u2014 assuring New Yorkers that teachers and other municipal employees who had long been working without a contract could be made whole, and then some, and that the city could afford the billions of dollars their raises and back pay would cost.An analysis by the bond-rating agency Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc. said the budget could negatively affect the city\u2019s credit because rising personnel costs could soon strain city finances, widening future budget gaps. But Amy Spitalnick, a mayoral spokeswoman, stressed that there has been no change in the city\u2019s\u00a0credit rating.Then, under pressure from Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, the de Blasio administration announced that it was shifting $725 million in retroactive pay that it had sought to spread over the next four years into the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30. The money at issue was reserved for as many as 20,000 members of the city teachers\u2019 union who may retire after July 1.In several days of meetings between City Hall and his office, officials said, Mr. Stringer and his aides argued that the budget plan did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles that the city is legally bound to follow.Word of the change, however, came in an extraordinary joint announcement by Mr. Stringer and Mr. de Blasio that, in two paragraphs, repeatedly played down its own significance.The statement noted that the appropriate treatment on the balance sheet for some parts of the labor deal with the teachers\u2019 union \u201cis subject to varying opinions by expert accountants,\u201d and that the change was being made merely \u201cto ensure that the city\u2019s financial accounting reflects a preferred approach.\u201dIn an interview later, Mr. de Blasio\u2019s budget director, Dean Fuleihan, called the talks with the comptroller\u2019s office a \u201cgood dialogue,\u201d though he also stood by the city\u2019s earlier position, saying outside experts had endorsed it.\u201cAt no time did we think the treatment we used was wrong or inadequate or inaccurate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe actually thought it was fine, but the comptroller\u2019s people raised this question and there was no reason not to say, \u2018O.K., we can certainly do this.\u2019\u00a0\u201dNicole Gelinas, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, said the departure from standard accounting rules by Mr. de Blasio\u2019s staff was of concern, but she said she hoped Mr. Stringer, who like the mayor is a Democrat, would expand his scrutiny of the mayor\u2019s budget proposal.\u201cIt is troublesome and unprecedented for the city to say it will wait until 2021 to pay for teachers\u2019 work already done in 2009 and 2010,\u201d she said. \u201cStringer has made a great first start here as city watchdog. But the reality is that this is only the most obvious of the accounting problems that the budget raises, and we still have more questions than answers. Luckily, Stringer has another month or so to ask serious questions about the rest of de Blasio\u2019s first budget.\u201dThe analysis by Moody\u2019s noted that with personnel costs already consuming some 55 percent of the city\u2019s operating budget, future-year budget gaps were growing: A deficit for the 2016 through 2018 fiscal years is now forecast at $7.5 billion, up from $2 billion as recently as February.Mr. Fuleihan minimized the Moody\u2019s interpretation, saying it would not affect the city\u2019s bond rating or borrowing costs. \u201cIt\u2019s just a point, like the economy\u2019s in a downturn, that\u2019s a negative,\u201d he said.The Moody\u2019s report also highlighted the risks in tying the city\u2019s financial health to billions of dollars in savings on employee health coverage that are as yet unspecified.Kate Taylor contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Not to Be Misled by the Jobs Report", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStatistical NoiseWe obsess far too much on the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report.Think about it this way: It\u2019s the first Friday of the month, and the Labor Department has bad news. The economy has added a mere 64,000 jobs last month, a steep slowdown from 220,000 the month before. From Wall Street to Twitter, the reaction is swift and negative.The price of oil falls, as do the prices of blue-chip stocks like General Electric. The Federal Reserve faces calls to push interest rates lower. The lead headlines in the next day\u2019s papers talk of faltering job growth.But what if all the worries were based on nothing more than random statistical noise? What if the apparent decline in job growth came from the inherent volatility of surveys that rely on samples, like the survey that produces the Labor Department\u2019s monthly employment estimate?We generated those numbers with a computer, after giving it a simple set of directions: Assume that the economy is adding exactly 150,000 jobs every month, and that the monthly estimates of job growth come with exactly as much statistical noise as the Labor Department says its estimates have.The result of one of the computer simulations was a year\u2019s worth of fluctuating job growth. Two months, June and September, showed job creation below 100,000; two others, May and August, showed job growth of more than 200,000. Only three months out of our hypothetical year, January, April and July, were particularly close to the \u201ctrue\u201d level of job creation, 150,000 jobs.When traders put too much weight on data that can mislead, the stock market can soar or swoon for no good reason. Business executives may make decisions based on economic trends that don\u2019t exist. And journalists risk giving their readers or viewers a misleading view of where things stand in the American economy.Human beings, unfortunately, are bad at perceiving randomness. If you go to a baseball game and watch a commanding performance by your team, it tells you very nearly nothing about how the team will perform over the course of a season. Similarly, one month of jobs numbers doesn\u2019t tell you much of anything about how the economy is actually doing.None of this is meant to cast aspersions on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the arm of the Labor Department that faces the unenviable task of trying to discern how many jobs there are in the United States each month. The bureau does so by conducting an enormous survey of 144,000 employers who together employ about a third of all nonagricultural workers. It is one of the most important economic data releases, in no small part because it comes out quickly; results from a survey the bureau took in the middle of last month, for example, will be released on Friday, before almost any other data about the April economy is available.Even with all those survey participants, there is sampling error; the employers responding to the survey might be different from the nation\u2019s employers as a whole. And the Labor Department\u2019s initial release, coming as it does so soon after the survey, is released before all the data is in, with researchers filling in the gaps with statistical estimates that might prove wrong. Only in later weeks and months is all the data available, and the bureau then revises its initial numbers.The sampling error becomes magnified because those of us following the jobs report don\u2019t focus on the total number of jobs in the economy (more than 130 million). We focus on the relatively small change in the number of these jobs from month to month (typically a few hundred thousand, at most).Whether we\u2019re snide newspaper journalists on Twitter or hedge fund managers trying to trade currencies, we obsess over these reports because we have little choice but to care about how the economy is doing. Its condition affects whether our employers should expand, when we should buy a house or retire and thousands of other decisions. But it\u2019s worth remembering that no one report can neatly summarize the health of a $17 trillion economy of 300 million people, certainly not in something close to real time.At 8:30 a.m. on the first Friday of any given month, we all actually know a lot less than you might think. The closest thing to an accurate description of the economy\u2019s condition is a description that comes with a lot of humility.The Upshot: The Upshot, a New York Times\nventure, presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics and\npolicy.\nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "BMW to Expand U.S. Plant in Push for Lighter, More Fuel-Efficient Cars", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 BMW said on Friday that it would invest $200 million and double its work force at a factory in Washington State that makes carbon fibers as the company moves to use more of the lightweight material in cars and meet demand for a new electric vehicle.The German carmaker operates the factory in Moses Lake in a joint venture with the SGL Group, another German company, which will share in the investment. BMW said it would hire 120 new workers as part of the expansion, which is to be completed early next year and bring the total number of employees to about 200.The move reflects the effort of BMW and other automakers to make cars lighter and more fuel-efficient, as well as increased interest by German companies in manufacturing in the United States, partly because of lower energy costs.BASF, a German chemical company, said on Thursday that it would build a plant in Freeport, Tex., to produce ammonia for use in fertilizer. And Siemens, the German electronics and engineering conglomerate, said on Wednesday that it would relocate the headquarters of a unit that supplies equipment for the energy industry to the United States because of its boom in natural gas production.The factory in Moses Lake runs entirely on hydropower, according to BMW. The expansion there is also a sign that BMW is optimistic about prospects for its i3 battery-powered car, which went on sale in Europe in November and has a passenger compartment made primarily of carbon fiber.BMW said this week that it had sold about 2,000 i3s since the introduction, half of those in March. That figure does not include any sales in the United States, where BMW sold its first i3 this month, or in China, where the car will reach showrooms no sooner than July. The i3 carries a base price of $41,350 in the United States.Most of the 5,000 i3 models produced so far went to showrooms as test-drive vehicles, and BMW said it expected sales to increase as more cars become available for sale. Carbon fiber made in Moses Lake is processed into layers of carbon fiber in Wackersdorf, Germany, then made into body parts at other German BMW plants, in Landshut and Leipzig. The i3 is assembled in Leipzig.Carbon fiber is both lightweight and strong, and helps extend the range of electric vehicles and improve fuel economy in conventional cars. But carbon fiber parts are much more difficult and costly to mass-produce for automobiles than traditional materials like steel.BMW, which like other carmakers is under pressure to reduce emissions and increase fuel economy, said that mass production of carbon fiber at the Moses Lake plant would help reduce the cost of carbon components and allow their use in conventional gasoline and diesel-powered cars as well.BMW is also gearing up to introduce a second model in the i Series, a high-performance sports coupe called the i8. On Friday BMW unveiled a series of video spots for the i8 by Gus Van Sant, the director of movies like \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d and \u201cMilk.\u201dThe i8, which also features a body made largely of carbon fiber, is a plug-in hybrid that combines battery power with a turbocharged three-cylinder motor, offering Porsche-like acceleration while getting more than 100 miles to the gallon, according to BMW. BMW will begin selling the i8 in Europe in June and in the United States about a month later, with a base price of about $137,000.Advertisement"}

Among the big gainers were Twitter and Facebook, which plunged in March and April. The Russell 2000, an index made up of small companies, experienced its largest gains in two months.Investors have been more cautious this year than last, favoring big, less volatile stocks that pay rich dividends, because of concerns about the outlook for the economy. Utility and energy companies have been among the beneficiaries of this trend, and have outperformed the overall market in 2014.While interest rates remain low, investors are likely to keep being drawn back into stocks after any sell-off because holding cash isn\u2019t generating any returns, said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial, an independent wealth management company.\u201cThere is some bargain buying in some of the names that got hit hard in March and April,\u201d Mr. Courtney said.On Monday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 18.17 points, or 1 percent, to finish at a nominal record high of 1,896.65. The index last did so on April 2, when it reached 1,890.90. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.13 points, or 0.7 percent, to end at a nominal record high of 16,695.47. The Dow previously set a record on Friday.The Nasdaq composite index climbed 71.99 points, or 1.8 percent, to 4,143.86, still well below the highs it reached during the dot-com boom in 2000.The Russell 2000 index rose 26.4 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,133.65, its biggest gain since March 4. The index slumped almost 10 percent from March 4 to May 9 as investors sold riskier stocks. The index still remains down 2.6 percent for the year after surging 37 percent in 2013.Gains on Monday were led by technology and industrial companies, sectors that are expected to benefit most if the economy starts growing faster.Facebook shares rose $2.59, or 4.5 percent, to $59.83, reducing the stock\u2019s decline since March 10 to 17 percent. Twitter, another stock that has been beaten down recently, rose $1.89, or 5.9 percent, to $33.94. Stocks also got a boost from some merger news. Shares of Pinnacle Foods surged $4.02, or 13.2 percent, to $34.47 after the company agreed to be acquired by Hillshire Brands. Pinnacle\u2019s brands include Duncan Hines and Aunt Jemima, while Hillshire makes Jimmy Dean and Sara Lee products. Hillshire shares fell $1.19, or 3.2 percent, to $35.76. Even though stocks have remained largely unchanged for most of the year following a surge in 2013, investors are still more concerned about missing the next leg of a rally than a market fall, said Douglas Cot\u00e9, chief market strategist at Voya Investment Management.In the bond market, interest rates rose modestly.

In his book, Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, devotes a handful of pages to the Obama administration\u2019s mortgage relief efforts, though the writing comes across as halfhearted, not unlike Geithner\u2019s efforts while he was running the Treasury Department.Why? Because, as Bair told me in an email, \u201cIt would have been a powerful bargaining chip for borrowers.\u201d Without the ability to file for bankruptcy, underwater homeowners unable to pay their mortgages were helpless to prevent foreclosures. With it, however, servicers and banks were far more likely to negotiate the debt load. And if they weren\u2019t, a bankruptcy judge would rule on the appropriate debt to be repaid. For all the talk about the need for principal reduction, this change would have been the easiest way to get it.Indeed, although the financial services industry had pushed hard for their bankruptcy carve-out, they would have been helped, too. Knowing that a borrower can avail himself of bankruptcy court would undoubtedly have a sobering effect on lenders, making them more cautious about underwriting standards.Once he was president, however, Obama was rarely heard from on the subject. In late April 2009, with a bankruptcy bill having already passed the House, Durbin offered his amendment on the Senate side. The financial services industry pulled out all the stops, arguing that a right of bankruptcy for a homeowner would increase the cost of home loans, undermine the sanctity of contracts and promote (of course!) moral hazard.He added, \u201cThis should have been a no-brainer.\u201dWhich leads to one other unanswered question about the financial crisis. Why is it that the fear of moral hazard only applies to homeowners, and not to the banks?Advertisement"}

Though not much bigger than a closet, this facility is helping scientists confront one of the great environmental mysteries of the age.Scientists have spent decades examining all the factors that can influence the rise of the seas, and their research is finally leading to answers. And the more the scientists learn, the more they perceive an enormous risk for the United States.The detective work has required scientists to grapple with the influence of ancient ice sheets, the meaning of islands that are sinking in the Chesapeake Bay, and even the effect of a giant meteor that slammed into the earth.Tide gauges along the East Coast show a long-term increase in relative sea levels.That may not sound like much, but scientists say even the smallest increase causes the seawater to eat away more aggressively at the shoreline in calm weather, and leads to higher tidal surges during storms. The sea-level rise of decades past thus explains why coastal towns nearly everywhere are having to spend billions of dollars fighting erosion.Scientists say the East Coast will be hit harder for many reasons, but among the most important is that even as the seawater rises, the land in this part of the world is sinking. And that goes back to the last ice age, which peaked some 20,000 years ago.As a massive ice sheet, more than a mile thick, grew over what are now Canada and the northern reaches of the United States, the weight of it depressed the crust of the earth. Areas away from the ice sheet bulged upward in response, as though somebody had stepped on one edge of a balloon, causing the other side to pop up. Now that the ice sheet has melted, the ground that was directly beneath it is rising, and the peripheral bulge is falling.Some degree of sinking is going on all the way from southern Maine to northern Florida, and it manifests itself as an apparent rising of the sea.The sinking is fastest in the Chesapeake Bay region. Whole island communities that contained hundreds of residents in the 19th century have already disappeared. Holland Island, where the population peaked at nearly 400 people around 1910, had stores, a school, a baseball team and scores of homes. But as the water rose and the island eroded, the community had to be abandoned.Aside from this general sinking of land up and down the East Coast, some places sit on soft sediments that tend to compress over time, so the localized land subsidence can be even worse than the regional trend. Much of the New Jersey coast is like that. The sea-level record from the Battery has been particularly valuable in sorting out this factor, because the tide gauge there is attached to bedrock and the record is thus immune to sediment compression.Up and down the Eastern Seaboard, municipal planners want to know: How bad are things going to get, and how fast?People considering whether to buy or rebuild at the storm-damaged Jersey Shore, for instance, could be looking at nearly a foot of sea-level rise by the time they would pay off a 30-year mortgage, according to the Rutgers projections. That would make coastal flooding and further property damage considerably more likely than in the past.Even if the global sea level rises only eight more inches by 2050, a moderate forecast, the Rutgers group foresees relative increases of 14 inches at bedrock locations like the Battery, and 15 inches along the New Jersey coastal plain, where the sediments are compressing. By 2100, they calculate, a global ocean rise of 28 inches would produce increases of 36 inches at the Battery and 39 inches on the coastal plain.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fringe Parties May Gain in European Parliament Voting", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Starting with Britain and the Netherlands, Europe began voting on Thursday for a new European Parliament, an election in which fringe parties of the right and left are expected to capitalize on low voter turnout and anger over immigration and anemic economies in the wake of the financial crisis.Results will not be officially announced until Sunday night but exit polls cited by Dutch media late on Thursday indicated that the far-right Party of Freedom, led by anti-immigration maverick Geert Wilders, had performed less well than forecast. In a 10-party Dutch race, Mr. Wilders\u2019 party, weakened by campaign blunders and infighting, placed third or fourth behind solidly pro-European political forces, worse than its second place finish at the last European elections in 2009, Dutch media reported.Whether the expected success for the fringe parties elsewhere marks a lasting shift in Europe \u2014 or whether it will die away in future elections \u2014 the results may provide Europe\u2019s extremists an outsized platform to influence the politics of their home nations and beyond. With centrist groups struggling to contain radicals on both flanks, the new parliament is expected to have more populist lawmakers than ever before from parties opposed to free trade and European integration.One thing it may well do, for example, is derail a trans-Atlantic trade pact that both Washington and Brussels have been pushing as a spur to economic growth. The parliament has rejected agreements with the United States in the past, but nothing on this scale.That prospect brings into focus the growing importance of an assembly that, according to opinion polls, nonetheless may have less public support than ever and has yet to escape its reputation as a refuge for has-beens and never-will-bes who would have trouble winning office in their home countries.\u201cThe extremists risk exaggerating the reaction of the new parliament to the relative economic decline of Europe \u2014 not by making Europe more humble or cooperative \u2014 but by making it more confrontational and less willing to reciprocate,\u201d said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group in Brussels. \u201cThat is a toxic mix for provoking big commercial fights with other parts of the world, including with the United States.\u201dThe election holds the potential to sow widespread political uncertainty, and even turmoil. The four days of voting in 28 nations for the 751-member assembly could deliver significant gains for the anti-European U.K. Independence Party led by Nigel Farage. Similarly Euroskeptic parties could top the polls in France and Italy, where voting takes place Sunday, when all results will be officially announced.These far-right and far-left groups will not win anything approaching enough seats to take control. But they could get around a quarter of them, amplifying their voice in debate and giving them more opportunities to slow down measures that the Brussels bureaucracy and international economists say could help save Europe from a Japan-style \u201clost decade\u201d of anemic growth and policy stasis.These include initiatives to bind the 18 countries that use euro currency closer together and open up Europe\u2019s markets to greater competition, including from the United States.Set up in the 1950s as a common assembly to introduce an element of democracy into the nascent European project, the parliament became directly elected in 1979 as part of push to narrow the chasm between Europeans and the arcane work of integrating their economies that few ordinary people cared about and even fewer could understand.Instead, the parliament, which sits in both Brussels and the French city of Strasbourg 270 miles away, has increasingly become a forum for politicians bent on subverting, not fixing, the European Union. And while its powers have steadily grown, public interest and support have steadily waned.The elections, warned Valdis Dombrovskis, the former prime minister of Latvia and a onetime member of the European Parliament, risk empowering \u201cfringe groups which are against everything.\u201d He added: \u201cDecision-making is going to be more complicated.\u201dPassing legislation aimed at integrating Europe\u2019s economy with other parts of the world is going to be particularly hard.With moderate pro-business parties expected to lose seats, \u201cprotectionist policies are more likely to gain support when populist parties join forces with the left to form majorities against initiatives, including any trade deal with the United States,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, the director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.Unlike many national parliaments, the European assembly cannot initiate laws, and must wait for the union\u2019s policy-making arm, the European Commission, to submit draft legislation.Even so, the parliament has steadily gained powers to amend a huge range of laws \u2014 from capping bankers\u2019 bonuses to limiting greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 that Brussels enacts each year and member countries must follow.Since 2009, the parliament also wields a veto over a seven-year budget for the union worth about one trillion euros and over most international agreements, including plans for a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership announced by President Obama in February 2013 in his State of the Union address.There is much is at stake, particularly for British government, which wants a deal that could, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a research group in London, boost overall E.U. exports by as much as 187 billion euros annually to help support its case for staying in the union. Governments in the Netherlands and across Scandinavia also strongly back a deal, which could give Europe and the United States added leverage over China in trade conflicts.But politicians in countries like France are under pressure to protect their cultural and agricultural industries against American imports, while citizens in countries like Germany are balking at U.S. demands that would allow American companies to sue European governments. There is also widespread mistrust of the United States across the union following the revelation of surveillance of phone and Internet communications by American spy agencies.As a result, mainstream parties contesting the European elections are already extremely cautious.Even Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg and candidate of the business-friendly European People\u2019s Party to run the commission, has pledged to not \u201csacrifice Europe\u2019s safety, health, social and data protection standards on the altar of free trade.\u201dThe parliament already made a dramatic demonstration against the United States in early 2010 by suspending a program to track financial and bank transfers that the Obama administration says is vital to its effort to fight terrorism. The parliament agreed to reinstate the program a few months later, but only after the United States agreed to make modifications.The sudden emergence of the parliament as a decisive force in European policy-making has prompted American diplomats and lobbyists to give it far more attention.European voters, paradoxically, have grown less interested.Turnout at European elections has steadily declined, slipping from 62 percent in 1979 to 43 percent at the last election five years ago. The results of a poll by the Pew Research Center this month suggested voter-participation rates could drop further this week. Only 36 percent of Europeans in seven countries including France, Britain and Germany have a favorable opinion of the parliament, according to Pew.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Reaching Out to Tech and Creative Tenants, Starting With Lunch", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA factory district does not typically spring to mind as a prudent location for retailing, but some of Manhattan\u2019s successful food vendors have chosen the Falchi Building in a spartan part of Long Island City, Queens, for their next retail ventures.The 658,000-square-foot building at 31-00 47th Avenue was bought in 2012 by Jamestown Properties, which also owns Chelsea Market, the popular food marketplace in Manhattan that has become a tourist destination and neighborhood landmark.While Chelsea Market has evolved into an office building with a ground-floor market of dozens of food shops, it originally began as a place for food vendors to house their manufacturing facilities, with perhaps a small retail operation. Jamestown has plans to transform the Falchi Building into something resembling Chelsea Market in its earlier years, said Michael Phillips, the chief operating officer of Jamestown.\u201cAt Chelsea Market\u2019s roots, that\u2019s what I think it was: food production with a small retail component,\u201d he said. But as Chelsea grew more residential and the elevated High Line began drawing visitors from all over, \u201cit quickly became more retail and less production,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.To spur the repositioning of the building, Jamestown has also created an \u201cartisanal food fair\u201d called the Food Box in about 2,000 square feet. A handful of food purveyors that prepare their food off-site sell their goods over a line of wooden kiosks facing customer seating.Started in November, the Food Box, which has been popular with the district\u2019s office workers and students at nearby LaGuardia Community College, has rotating vendors and may move around the building, Mr. Phillips said. Currently, it offers Thai food from Khao Man Gai NY; Caribbean food from ReCaFo; Paraguayan delicacies and empanadas from Karu Caf\u00e9; soups and sandwiches by Mrs. Soupy and Friends; and baked goods by Made From Scratch.A former owner of Chelsea Market, Irwin Cohen, developed the idea of food-manufacturing businesses anchoring a thriving market and once owned the Falchi Building, Mr. Phillips said. Eventually about 70 percent of the space on the ground floor may be dedicated to food uses, he said.Jamestown has also made facade and lobby renovations, adding tables and seating for visitors along with art installations throughout the ground-floor concourse.Current tenants include the United Nations, the watchmaker Tourneau and the document processor Swiss Post Solutions, along with jewelry-making businesses, among others.With asking rents ranging from $20 to $40 a square foot, Mr. Phillips said, the building has features that could serve a variety of tenants, from showrooms to research and development to warehouses. Jamestown\u2019s plan is to attract more technology, media and creative companies with the new amenities.The Coalition for Queens, a nonprofit group supporting technology entrepreneurs, will be opening offices in about 4,200 square feet on the concourse.The factory district has seen an influx of technology companies in recent years, said Jukay Hsu, one of the coalition\u2019s founders.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth in the tech community here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so raw and industrial, which is something tech companies are attracted to.\u201dAt the incubator, Mr. Hsu and co-founder David Yang have installed a giant sliding garage door, which can be rolled open to the concourse for tech gatherings.Nearby, Artisanal Premium Cheese, which imports cheeses from around the world and ages them in high-tech cheese caves, is building out 10,500 square feet for its production and offices, and it is already holding cheese and wine tasting classes.At the Falchi Building\u2019s main entrance at 47th Avenue and 31st Street, Artisanal will open its cheese shop cafe behind large display windows, probably sometime this summer, said Daniel W. Dowe, the chief executive of Artisanal.\u201cWe thought we would do it in Manhattan,\u201d Mr. Dowe said of the cafe\u2019s opening. \u201cAnd if you had to make a pure retail decision, you probably wouldn\u2019t say 47th Avenue in Long Island City is the place you have to be, but I think there\u2019s enough population in the building to make it work.\u201dAs Artisanal\u2019s first cheese shop cafe, the site can be used as a training facility for employees who will eventually work in future cafes, Mr. Dowe said.Marcus Antebi, the chief executive and founder of Juice Press, had a similar idea. He\u2019ll use the Juice Press cafe, which is scheduled to open in about six months next to Artisanal\u2019s shop, as a training ground for the company\u2019s 20 other stores.\u201cI would never in my life take a stand-alone retail store here,\u201d Mr. Antebi said. \u201cThere\u2019s no retail here.\u201dMr. Antebi said the \u201cbombproof\u201d infrastructure of the building was ideal for a commissary, however, and its location right off two large expressways (the Long Island and Brooklyn-Queens Expressways) was advantageous for distribution into Manhattan. With Falchi\u2019s workers, office workers in the neighborhood and students, the retailing should work \u2014 particularly if some customers figure out they can stop at the store on their way out to visit the Hamptons, Mr. Antebi said.\u201cI\u2019m a gambler, so I\u2019m willing to gamble that when they see my offerings, people are going to say, \u2018It\u2019s expensive, but I\u2019ll spend more on it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.The immediate neighborhood is in the process of transforming from traditional light manufacturing uses to more creative trades, such as architecture, magazine publishing and technology companies, said Mitch Arkin, an executive director with the commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, which is leasing the Falchi Building.The No. 7 subway train is about a five-minute walk from the building and it takes 10 minutes to arrive in Midtown Manhattan, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to technology companies that want to have their work force in Long Island City, because the rents are half of what they are, particularly in Midtown South, where you find similar types of properties,\u201d Mr. Arkin said.While the Falchi Building may be at the forefront of the neighborhood transformation, particularly with the retail food uses it offers, some owners of nearby buildings are beginning to follow suit or are at least watching closely, he said. Besides offices, hotels being developed in the Court Square area of Long Island City may eventually be a source of customers.Jamestown is trying to pull off a similar repositioning of a much larger formerly industrial complex called Industry City in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. There, the company is working with partners to convert the six-million-square-foot, 16-building complex into a hub for technology and manufacturing, also using food vendors.\u201cThis is a unique concept, and it\u2019s a Jamestown brand that they bring to any of these kind of adaptive reuse projects that they do,\u201d Mr. Arkin said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merkel Signals That Tension Persists Over U.S. Spying", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama tried to mend fences with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Friday, calling her \u201cone of my closest friends on the world stage.\u201d But Ms. Merkel replied tartly that Germany still had significant differences with the United States over surveillance practices and that it was too soon to return to \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201dThe cordial but slightly strained encounter, which played out as the two leaders stood next to each other at a Rose Garden news conference, attested to the lingering scars left by the sensational disclosure last October that the National Security Agency had eavesdropped on Ms. Merkel\u2019s phone calls.It came as the two leaders sought to project a unified front against Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, threatening President Vladimir V. Putin with sweeping new sanctions if Russia disrupted elections in Ukraine later this month, even as they acknowledged that not all European countries were ready to sign on to the most punishing measures.Ms. Merkel, who last fall declared that \u201cspying between friends is simply unacceptable\u201d and that the United States had opened a breach of trust that would have to be repaired, said at the news conference that \u201cwe have a few difficulties yet to overcome.\u201d One remaining issue, she said, was the \u201cproportionality\u201d of the surveillance.Mr. Obama, pointing to his administration\u2019s efforts to restore privacy safeguards, even for non-Americans, said, \u201cWe have gone a long way in closing some of the gaps, but as Chancellor Merkel said, there are some gaps that need to be worked through.\u201dNearly a year after the first disclosures about the N.S.A.\u2019s practices at home and abroad, however, the agency is emerging with a mandate to make only modest changes: some new limits on what kind of data it can hold about Americans, and stricter White House oversight of decisions to tap the cellphones of foreign leaders. The Obama administration is now turning its attention to Silicon Valley \u2014 the subject of a major White House study released Thursday \u2014 and whether the government should intervene to protect and prevent discriminatory behavior. \u201cThese are complicated issues,\u201d Mr. Obama said of the debate over surveillance and civil liberties, as he glanced over at Ms. Merkel. \u201cWe\u2019re not perfectly aligned yet, but we share the same values, and we share the same concerns.\u201dThe depth of their differences, however, was reflected by the failure to reach a broader intelligence-sharing agreement between the United States and Germany. The two sides could not even agree on how the talks had begun, with Mr. Obama disputing that the United States had ever offered Germany a so-called no-spy agreement.\u201cWe do not have a blanket no-spy agreement with any country,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re not holding back from doing something with Germany that we somehow do with somebody else.\u201dMonths of negotiations to reach an agreement ended unsuccessfully after the two sides could not agree on its scope. According to administration officials, the Germans insisted that the United States not conduct any unsanctioned espionage on German soil, including from its embassy in Berlin, something it has not agreed to with other allies.Ms. Merkel did not address the negotiations directly, but said the debate showed the need for further dialogue between the United States and Germany, not just at the level of governments but also between lawmakers and the German and American people.Even as she highlighted differences with the White House, Ms. Merkel\u2019s government advised against inviting Edward J. Snowden, the renegade former N.S.A. contractor who leaked the information about its surveillance practices, to testify before the German Parliament.A report by a German ministry on Friday said Mr. Snowden\u2019s appearance would cause further damage to the relationship between the United States and Germany. The German officials had solicited an opinion from a Washington law firm suggesting that American authorities could seek to charge members of Parliament for complicity in Mr. Snowden\u2019s publicizing of classified information.Still, for two leaders who had bonded over thorny issues like the European financial crisis, the N.S.A. furor has taken an obvious toll. Ms. Merkel deflected a question about whether the personal trust between her and Mr. Obama had been restored.When Ms. Merkel was asked if she was satisfied with how the White House had responded, Mr. Obama jumped in to answer first, saying he knew how emotional the issue was in Germany.\u201cAngela Merkel is one of my closest friends on the world stage, somebody whose partnership I deeply value,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt has pained me to see the degree to which the Snowden disclosures have created strains in the relationship.\u201dIn their private meetings on Friday, an American official said, the chemistry between Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama was still good. They spent most of their time talking about the crisis in Ukraine, where they have emerged as the two leaders marshaling the Western response.Both kept up the pressure on Mr. Putin over Ukraine, setting a new trigger for much broader sanctions against Russian industry. Ms. Merkel noted that these measures would be imposed if Russia disrupted an election in Ukraine planned for May 25. \u201cShould that not be possible to stabilize the situation further, further sanctions will be unavoidable,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something that we don\u2019t want.\u201dMr. Obama was even more emphatic, saying, \u201cThe Russian leadership must know that if it continues to destabilize eastern Ukraine and disrupt this month\u2019s presidential election, we will move quickly on additional steps, including further sanctions that will impose greater costs.\u201dWhile administration officials say Germany and the United States have been united in their response, the Germans have balked at sweeping sanctions on the Russian energy industry because that could reverberate on their fossil fuel-dependent economy.Building European support for industrywide sanctions will be a challenge, Mr. Obama said, because \u201cyou\u2019ve got 28 countries, and some are more vulnerable than others to potential Russian retaliation. And we have to take those into account. Not every country is in the same place.\u201dSome experts on Germany said the Ukraine crisis could give Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel the foundation to rebuild their relationship, reminding them that despite the suspicion generated by the surveillance disclosures, their countries still have much in common.\u201cDespite their enormous differences in background and style, Merkel and Obama share a similar approach to crises \u2014 they react cautiously, slowly, and incrementally,\u201d said Jackson Janes, the president of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThat instinct has been on display again in recent months.\u201dDavid E. Sanger contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Recovering From a Short Sale", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMortgagesBorrowers who owe more than their homes are worth can sometimes get out from under by negotiating a short sale with their lender. But short-sellers are branded as higher-risk borrowers, so new loans won\u2019t come quickly or easily.A short sale is when a lender agrees to accept less than is owed on a property, allowing the borrower to walk away and avoid foreclosure. Fannie Mae, the federally controlled mortgage investor, sets guidelines for the minimum amount of time that must elapse before a short-seller is eligible for another loan salable to the agency. Fannie Mae requires a waiting period of at least four years for short-sellers who can only put down 10 percent on their next home. The waiting period is shortened to two years for borrowers who can come up with 20 percent. The forced waiting period is essentially a penalty on borrowers who didn\u2019t fully repay a previous loan. And lenders who sell their loans on the secondary market are unlikely to shorten Fannie\u2019s minimums, said Myron Headen, a senior vice president in the residential mortgage division of Bryn Mawr Trust in Pennsylvania. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter if you were going to put 30 or 40 percent down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still have to meet that two-year waiting period.\u201d He noted, however, that Fannie does allow the four-year period to be cut in half for borrowers who can document that their loan default was a result of \u201cextenuating circumstances.\u201d The agency defines these circumstances as one-time events that were beyond a borrower\u2019s control, such as job loss, medical bills, or a financial hit from divorce. Borrowers must also be able to show that they had no reasonable option other than to default.Short-sellers who hope to someday obtain another mortgage should pay careful attention to their credit while riding out the forced waiting period, said Tom Showalter, the chief analytics officer at Digital Risk, which provides mortgage services and risk analytics to lenders. Sometimes when people are relieved of a hefty mortgage they go into \u201cwhoopee mode\u201d and run up their credit cards or take out a car loan, he said. But shopping around for more credit after a short sale could further harm credit scores.Mr. Showalter recommends frugal management of revolving credit so that outstanding balances do not exceed 30 percent of the borrower\u2019s credit limit. And borrowers should stay current on all of their credit obligations.In preparation for applying for a new mortgage, borrowers should keep detailed records of income sources. New regulations require lenders to prove borrowers\u2019 ability to pay, and \u201cthe more documentation you can offer, the more the originator can go to bat for you,\u201d Mr. Showalter said. When it comes to liabilities, applicants should be forthcoming and not try to hide obligations like alimony or child support.Short-sellers getting back into the housing market would be wise to think smaller, especially in a still-shaky economy. And, Mr. Showalter advises, they should \u201cavoid like the plague\u201d loans requiring very little or no money down. \u201cIf the appraisal is at all off or the property suffers some depreciation, and you have an income hiccup, then you can\u2019t get out of that property,\u201d he said. At least, that is, not without another short sale. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia Keeps Its Distance After Ukraine Secession Referendums", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia stopped short on Monday of outright recognition of the contentious referendums organized by separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian-speaking provinces of southeast Ukraine, instead using the results to intensify pressure for a negotiated autonomy for those provinces.The separatist leader of the self-declared People\u2019s Republic of Donetsk wasted little time in announcing that his province wanted to join Russia, but the question seemed to be whether Moscow was interested.Russia avoided any suggestion that it would react to the results with the same alacrity seen after the Crimean Peninsula referendum in March. Within hours of that vote, President Vladimir V. Putin declared that Russia was annexing Crimea, part of southern Ukraine that had once been part of Russia.This time, the Kremlin issued a statement saying only that it \u201crespects the will of the population of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions,\u201d and that the crisis should be resolved through dialogue between representatives of the easterners and the national government in Kiev.The Russian government did not even say that it recognized the results of the voting, which the authorities in Kiev and their Western supporters all declared illegal from the start. A preliminary count from eastern Ukraine showed 89 percent of voters in the Donetsk region and 97.5 percent in neighboring Luhansk voted for greater autonomy. But the voter rolls were old, and many supporters of remaining in Ukraine said they stayed away.Denis Pushilin, leader of the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d said the results showed that the people wanted to be part of Russia.\u201cWe ask the Russian Federation to consider the issue of accession of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic to the Russian Federation,\u201d he told a televised news conference. \u201cThe people of Donetsk have always been part of the Russian world, regardless of ethnicity. For us, the history of Russia is our history.\u201dMr. Pushilin then elaborated about that history, while echoing Moscow\u2019s line that the current government in Kiev was composed of \u201cNazis.\u201d He also said the Ukrainian military had left hundreds dead in recent confrontations, although there was no evidence to support that estimate. Finally, he said the eastern regions would not hold the national presidential vote scheduled for May 25, creating the basis for another possible confrontation.From Moscow, there was no direct reaction. But soon after Mr. Pushilin\u2019s announcement, the Foreign Ministry issued another statement essentially repeating what Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov had said earlier in the day \u2014 that the crisis in Ukraine must be solved through dialogue between Kiev and the east.In possibly the most important reaction, Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine\u2019s richest oligarch and the biggest employer in the industrial eastern regions, known together as Donbass, said his main aim was the kind of happiness that comes through a strong economy and good jobs.\u201cI am strongly convinced that Donbass can be happy only in a united Ukraine,\u201d said Mr. Akhmetov, who previously had kept his position ambiguous. \u201cI am for a strong Donbass in a strong Ukraine.\u201dAnalysts have long maintained that while Crimea was long considered part of Russia, Moscow was not interested in the cost, in money or lives, to annex the east, not to mention the Western economic sanctions that would result. Should Kiev attempt to end the separatist movement by force, however, Russia might still intervene militarily.\u201cThe referendum is seen in Moscow not as a quasi-legitimate basis or reason to raise questions about secession from Ukraine,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor of Russia in Global Affairs, a foreign policy review. \u201cRather it is seen as an instrument to force other parties of the conflict to accept the People\u2019s Republic as part of the negotiations.\u201dIn another move to pressure Kiev, the head of Gazprom, the gas company controlled by the Russian government, announced it would send Ukraine an advance bill on Tuesday for deliveries in June. Gazprom\u2019s chief executive, Alexei Miller, had previously said it would send the bill on May 16, but Prime Minister Dmitri A. Medvedev demanded the bill be delivered immediately.Russia has repeatedly increased the amount it says Ukraine owes, to around $20 billion, versus $2 billion in early March. It has threatened to cut off the gas if Ukraine does not pay in advance, which could also affect deliveries to Western Europe that transit Ukraine.Russia stated its position on the referendum as the European Union intensified efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine and to allow the May 25 presidential election to proceed, with Russian agreement.The current chairman of the 57-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Didier Burkhalter, the president of Switzerland, who met with Mr. Putin last week, told European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels about a \u201croad map\u201d meant to lead to a peaceful resolution.\u201cWe have reached a pivotal moment in this crisis, both for Ukraine and for Europe,\u201d Mr. Burkhalter said. \u201cThe window of opportunity is likely to be short.\u201dMr. Burkhalter has been circulating among European capitals to discuss how mediation might work. The O.S.C.E. is the conduit because it includes both the European Union\u2019s member states and those of the former Soviet Union, including Russia and Ukraine.The Kremlin statement on the referendum repeated the position that Mr. Putin outlined in a speech last Wednesday, which basically called for a negotiated settlement. \u201cIn the interests of establishing such a dialogue, all mediation efforts will be welcome, including by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\u201d the Kremlin statement read.In Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s interim president, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, dismissed the voting in the east as an illegal sham. But Mr. Turchynov repeated that he was ready to talk with easterners \u201cwho have no blood on their hands and who are ready to defend their goals in a legitimate way.\u201dWith the overthrow of President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine in February, Russia lost its main ally in Kiev keeping the country from getting too close to Europe. Although its initial opposition to the elections has softened, Russia has still pushed instead for \u201cfederalization,\u201d which many interpret as keeping the southeast portions of the country within Moscow\u2019s orbit.Many now see the elections as a chance for Ukraine to start over with a new political leadership that could forge a compromise between the demands of the various regions.In Brussels, the European Union, eager to curb Russian support for the separatists but wary of rupturing economic relations with a major source of its energy supplies, on Monday announced a modest expansion of an asset freeze aimed at individual Russians and others it accuses of stoking the crisis. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry criticized the action saying it \u201cundermined trust.\u201dReporting was contributed by David M. Herszenhorn from Moscow, Andrew E.

{"Headline": "Scrambling for Identity in Britain", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropeLONDON \u2014 In these times of conflict and change, the talk turns often to weighty matters of identity and land, nation and belonging, from Donetsk to Dundee, from Crimea to Catalonia to Cornwall.Cornwall?Just last week the 536,000 people of that far-flung county at Britain\u2019s south-western tip secured a long-sought status as a national minority of Celts entitled to the same rights of protection under European rules as the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish components of the United Kingdom.By the most patronizing definition among other Britons, Cornwall is known for beaches, vacations, cream teas, pasties \u2014 a kind of pie \u2014 and great scenic beauty. In times past, it flourished on tin mining and fishing. Now there are famed restaurants and art galleries.It is that gnawing sense of national uncertainty that runs like an inscrutable current below the debates that has flared and fizzled in the latest episodes.Is the land, for instance, Christian or not? Prime Minister David Cameron said it was. The archbishop of Canterbury, Most Rev. Justin Welby, predictably agreed. Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Liberal Democrat junior coalition partner, avowed that Britain was not \u201cexclusively\u201d Christian, while a former archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, said the country was in \u201cpost-Christian\u201d mode.At a time when the developments in Ukraine are confronting Europe with one of its biggest challenges since the end of the Cold War and the bloodletting in the Balkans, it is easy to dismiss concerns over Cornwall\u2019s place in the scheme of things as, at best, irrelevant, and that may be part of the debate.Britain, Mr. Moore wrote, may be \u201capproaching a point, like the Holy Roman Empire, when no one knows or cares what it is, and so everyone falls to quarrelling over the spoils.\u201dThe question would be less portentous if it did not come just weeks before European elections on May 22. The vote could well illustrate whether Britain\u2019s quest for identity will translate into victory for the insurgent United Kingdom Independence Party, or UKIP, which, its title notwithstanding, draws energy from a narrow, anti-immigrant, English euro-skepticism.UKIP itself is frequently depicted as the product of a broader malaise rooted in rejection of the political elite in a post-ideological, post-imperial era defined more by uncertainties than by the clearer visions of earlier times. But, like other small rightist upstart parties in Europe, its surge to prominence exercises a disproportionate influence on the nation\u2019s mainstream politics.For decades, Britain\u2019s national profile has been changing. The country is more diverse, less deferential. Scandals have eroded trust in institutions from the press to the police to the political elite. Even the timing of the announcement of Cornwall\u2019s new status was tinged with political cynicism since it was made by a Liberal Democrat minister seeking an electoral advantage for his party in the southwest.\u201cThe Cornish threat to the U.K. appears minuscule,\u201d wrote the columnist Brian Groom in The Financial Times, \u201cbut it illustrates the way people are still groping for identity in a global economy where the British empire is a fading memory.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tasting France Through 5 Signature Dishes", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019ve always felt that a map of France reads like a menu. The very names of regions can incite ravenous pangs. Each has a signature dish, from Brittany\u2019s butter-crisped crepes, to the generous cuts of pork draped over mounds of tangy sauerkraut in the eastern reaches of Alsace. Provence bursts with a rich soup of Mediterranean fish; the bounty of Languedoc\u2019s flat, dry plains comes alive in the warmth of simmering cassoulet.My love affair with French cuisine began when I moved to Paris for four years and began to explore my new home through food. But the capital\u2019s renditions of regional dishes left me as cold as the bouillabaisse I was served at a storied establishment.\u201cWhen you move from the countryside and make yourself into a Parisian, one of the first things you ditch is your local dish, because to eat it is to show yourself as provincial,\u201d said John Baxter, an Australian writer who has been living \u2014 and eating \u2014 in France for 23 years.And yet, as Mr. Baxter explores in his book, \u201cThe Perfect Meal: In Search of the Lost Tastes of France,\u201d great French dishes still exist in their original form, most notably at the place of their birth. Whereas Parisian restaurants often rely on frozen and industrially prepared ingredients (a trend so prevalent that the French Parliament recently adopted a law requiring restaurants to clearly label the dishes they prepare from scratch), \u201cin the provinces, the food is made with local ingredients and it\u2019s labor intensive \u2014 all the things that restaurants don\u2019t want,\u201d Mr. Baxter said. \u201cThis is one reason why people should and do eat outside of Paris.\u201dTo understand French cuisine, I realized I had to visit the regions and meet the country chefs, farmers and home cooks who proudly preserve tradition. Last summer, I embarked on a tour of France through five of its signature dishes, a decadent journey that convinced me that the best, most honest food in France is found in the provinces.In the Mediterranean fishing village of Cassis, I rose early and strolled along the port, watched local chefs and fishermen haggle over the morning catch and dined on the resulting bouillabaisse a few hours later. In the Languedoc, I visited a duck farm and witnessed the late-afternoon gavage \u2014 the controversial force-feeding that enlarges the liver \u2014 before joining a farmer for a glass of rough wine and a few slices of baguette spread with p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras de canard.Travelers have been eating their way around France, at least, since the 1920s, when the French food writer Maurice Edmond Sailland \u2014 known by his pen name, Curnonsky \u2014 published \u201cLa France Gastronomique,\u201d a multivolume guide to the country\u2019s regional cuisine. In the decade that followed, Les Accords de Matignon \u2014 a pet project of the Popular Front, the 1930s leftist political party led by Prime Minister L\u00e9on Blum \u2014 guaranteed two weeks\u2019 paid vacation to French workers. Working-class travelers took advantage of the new policy and government-sponsored train tickets, streaming south to resort towns previously the exclusive domain of the bourgeois. Eventually the Guide Michelin replaced Curnonsky as the primary source for travelers, and hungry motorists ignited an interest in regional cuisine that became a French passion.During my travels, I learned a few things: The best version of any dish is found at home, usually made by a local grandmother. And the term \u201cbest\u201d is highly subjective; nostalgia, preference, mood and a hundred other elements factor in. In truth, each \u201cbest\u201d is an intersection of history and place, culture and cuisine. Deep in the French countryside, food forms a connection \u2014 between the people at the table, between the generations who have passed down a recipe, between the terroir and the meal that has sprung from it, between you, the modern diner, and the history that continues to live on the plate.Brittany: Galettes and CrepesIn the wild northwest of France, the coast is rocky, the oysters small and sweet, and the older generations still slip into Breton, a language with Celtic roots. The local cuisine is born of both the savage shoreline and interior green pastures: Seafood, butter and cream dominate, but so do paper-thin pancakes \u2014 savory and sweet \u2014 as delicate as fine lace.Brittany draws a sharp distinction between savory galettes \u2014 made of wholesome, nutty buckwheat flour \u2014 and sweet, tender dessert crepes of beau bl\u00e9, or white flour. The buckwheat galettes preserve a proud tradition of self-sufficiency. In the 15th century, Duchess Anne of Brittany saved the region from famine \u2014 and ensured its independence \u2014 by introducing crops of bl\u00e9 noir, or buckwheat, a hardy plant that thrived despite the area\u2019s poor soil. Though highly nutritious, buckwheat lacks gluten, which limits its uses in the kitchen; \u201cgalettes are one of the few ways to consume it,\u201d said Youenn Le Gall, a farmer and owner of the Ferme de Kerv\u00e9guen, a local organic farm that produces the grain. Filled galettes are popular \u2014 especially the compl\u00e8te, stuffed with ham, cheese and a sunny-side-up egg \u2014 but older Bretons prefer to eat them plain, adorned only with a generous swipe of beurre de baratte, the region\u2019s salted butter whipped from tangy, fermented cream.Lyon: Quenelle de BrochetPerched at an epicurean crossroads, Lyon, in the southeastern Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, has long rejoiced in the bounty of its surroundings: Proven\u00e7al produce, Alpine butter and cheese, Bresse poultry, Beaujolais wine and Massif Central beef. But it was the M\u00e8res Lyonnaises who officially sealed the city\u2019s culinary reputation. When the French economy crashed after World War I, these formidable female cooks shifted their talents from wealthy bourgeois mansions to the city\u2019s restaurants and bouchons, using the region\u2019s fine ingredients to prepare simple yet perfect meals. As automobile travel grew popular, word of Lyon\u2019s exceptional cuisine spread, helped in large part by Curnonsky, who in 1934 declared the city \u201cthe world capital of gastronomy.\u201dLyon\u2019s classic dining places, bouchons, have existed for centuries. These casual establishments tend to be decorated in motley bric-a-brac; strangers sit elbow-to-elbow and the menu rarely deviates from dishes like t\u00eate de veau (poached calf\u2019s head) and tablier de sapeur (a sort of chicken-fried tripe). But their most famous menu item is the quenelle de brochet, a football-shaped dumpling, similar to an oversize gnocchi, traditionally served in a coral-pink puddle of the shellfish-infused sauce called nantua.Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es: CassouletThe territory once known as the Languedoc, in the southwest, is a sun-warmed expanse where medieval villages rise in the distance and grapevines sprawl across low hills. (After the French Revolution, the region was divided into administrative d\u00e9partements, and its ancient capital, Toulouse, became part of the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.) The cuisine, rustic and slow-simmered, matches this bucolic landscape, with dishes like duck confit or the region\u2019s renowned cassoulet washed down with robust local wine.Perhaps no French dish has achieved greater mythical status than cassoulet, a hearty concoction of sausages, confit (typically duck), pork and white beans, cooked for hours. According to local legend, the dish was invented in the town of Castelnaudary \u2014 the self-proclaimed \u201ccapital of cassoulet\u201d \u2014 during the Hundred Years\u2019 War. Trapped by the English, the starving villagers pooled their last scraps of meat and beans, simmering everything in a giant caldron; after feasting on the ragout, the French soldiers regained their strength and rallied to chase the English all the way to the Channel.That long-simmering is key. \u201cAll the components must harmonize,\u201d Mr. Mal\u00e9 said. \u201cNothing is more catastrophic than a cassoulet made at the last minute.\u201d Indeed, the best versions are cooked and cooled \u2014 preferably overnight \u2014 at least three times, a slow process that yields beans redolent with the deep flavors of the confit and pork sausage, topped by a thin layer of the dish\u2019s natural juice and starches sealed in the oven. (Though cassoulet recipes often call for a topping of breadcrumbs, they are \u201cnever found on the authentic version,\u201d Mr. Mal\u00e9 said.)Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, Provence: BouillabaisseProvence famously bursts with abundance: floods of golden olive oil, pincushion-shaped goat cheeses, lavender-scented honey and dishes like ratatouille or soupe au pistou that feature the region\u2019s sun-kissed produce. The rocky coast between Marseille and Cassis marries this agricultural bounty with Mediterranean catches to create one of the great classics of French cuisine, bouillabaisse. Like cassoulet, bouillabaisse has humble origins: it began as a plat du pauvre, a humble stew cooked by the fisherman\u2019s wife that used up the unsold bits from the day\u2019s catch.\u201cThe name comes from two words, bouille\u201d \u2014 to boil \u2014 \u201cand baisse\u201d \u2014 to lower \u2014 \u201cwhich refers to the broth as it boiled and reduced,\u201d said Doudou Daoudi, a waiter who has served the dish at various Cassis fish restaurants since 1964. In 1980, a group of restaurateurs created the Charter of Bouillabaisse to protect the integrity of the dish; the document prescribes the types of fish used \u2014 among them rockfish, red mullet, St-Pierre, monkfish and conger eel \u2014 as well as the ritual of serving it.\u201cFirst we present the bouillabaisse and explain the names of the fish,\u201d Mr. Daoudi said, \u201cThen we filet them and serve them with boiled potatoes and the soup.\u201d Croutons spread with rouille \u2014 a garlicky saffron-scented mayonnaise \u2014 add an earthy richness, while a tureen of extra soup is always on hand.Alsace: Choucroute GarnieNestled between the Vosges Mountains and the Black Forest, Alsace combines two cultures into one all its own, with its bilingual street signs in French and Alsatian (a language similar to Swiss German), medieval half-timbered houses and vineyards that produce long-necked bottles of riesling and gew\u00fcrztraminer. In fact, the region has changed hands between France and Germany four times since 1870, with each new leader eager to erase the last. The cuisine reflects this cultural seesaw with soft salt-studded pretzels and yeasty cakes, a cr\u00e8me-fra\u00eeche-and-bacon-topped pizza called tarte flamb\u00e9e (in French) or flammekueche (in Alsatian), and the region\u2019s signature dish, choucroute garnie.The dish is farm fare, honest and satisfying: an array of cured pork \u2014 plump sausages, ham, slab bacon, knacks and more \u2014 accompanied by a tangy pile of slow-cooked sauerkraut, boiled potatoes and a dab of mustard. Its main component, fermented cabbage, has been part of the local diet since the 17th century \u2014 the word \u201cchoucroute\u201d is a combination of French and German that translates as \u201ccabbage cabbage\u201d \u2014 a reliable source of vitamin C during bitter winters. A generation ago, many Alsatian families stored a stone vat of fermenting cabbage in the basement; today, most choucroute is factory-produced and sold precooked, ready to reheat and serve. Traditional Alsatian home cooks and chefs, however, wouldn\u2019t dream of using anything but raw, lacto-fermented sauerkraut, and each has his or her own secret on how to simmer it into a tender, lightly tart, aromatic accompaniment to the region\u2019s sausages and other cured pork.I sat for a while after this lavish meal \u2014 the final one of my tour \u2014 attempting to digest both the food and experience. I had thought of French food as a singular cuisine, but had come to understand that it was actually a broad spectrum of dishes, each one representing a region. Each place was fiercely proud of its local history, culture and accent \u2014 and united by the determination to preserve it.Ann Mah is the author of \u201cMastering the Art of French Eating.\u201d Advertisement"}

More than 750 people have been killed this year alone in Boko Haram attacks; at least 29 boys were killed in a February school raid. This time, the government\u2019s failure in rescuing the girls, and in addressing the issue, has incensed Nigerians and, increasingly, people around the world. In the midst of the crisis, the World Economic Forum on Africa hosted a three-day summit meeting, May 7-9, bringing about a thousand delegates from around the world and Nigeria\u2019s elite to Abuja, the Nigerian capital, to discuss economic growth and development. As the .001 percent opined in air-conditioned suites, far from the hot reality of Abuja\u2019s streets and psyche, the government deployed 6,000 security officers for the event \u2014 an effort that many Nigerians half-joked, half-lamented would never be made to protect ordinary Nigerians, nor to retrieve the Chibok schoolgirls.

Its economy has surpassed South Africa\u2019s, making it the largest on the continent. But that growth has only widened economic inequality. Economic activity has slowed to a trickle in regions where terrorizing at the hands of Boko Haram has forced farmers to abandon their fields, while young people without job prospects have left for the cities. More Nigerians are poor today than at independence in 1960, with over 60 percent below the poverty line.For the past three weeks, we have been traveling the country reporting on youth unemployment, an issue consistently ignored by the government, but one that has been exploited by Boko Haram.\u201cThe abductions are only the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Tayo Olufuwa, a bespectacled 23-year-old entrepreneur from Mushin, one of Lagos\u2019s poorest neighborhoods. Mr. Olufuwa has started an online employment search company, Jobs in Nigeria. When we filmed him two weeks ago, walking on his old childhood streets for a multimedia report, plainclothes policemen detained us for four hours, confiscating our credentials and equipment. They told us they were protecting us from Boko Haram and other security threats, wrestled with our driver for a bribe and mocked a crowd of children. \u201cWe are a country sleeping with one eye open,\u201d Mr. Olufuwa said afterward in exasperation.

{"Headline": "An Awkward Show of French-German Unity", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeBERLIN \u2014 When leaders need to go out of their way to show the world they are united, it is usually a sign that all is not well.R\u00fcgen, a wind-swept island off the Pomeranian coast of Germany, where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, met for a boat tour and stroll on a pier late last week, is about as out of the way as it gets.On Saturday, at the end of their 20-hour sojourn, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande released a joint statement on the crisis in the Ukraine and promised to coordinate closely on Europe\u2019s future once upcoming elections to the European Parliament are out of the way.But their show of unity, under a drizzling Baltic sky, should fool no one. Beneath the surface, Europe\u2019s most important relationship remains awkward and strained, dogged by an economic imbalance between Berlin and Paris that has seemed to widen, even as the euro zone\u2019s financial crisis has eased.Two contentious French-German debates in the past weeks, the wrangling over the future of the French industrial group Alstom and a row over the strength of the euro currency, have only underscored the divide.A decade ago, the French government rallied to prevent Alstom\u2019s German rival Siemens from snaring the French company\u2019s choicest assets when it was on the verge of bankruptcy.Now Paris is reduced to pleading with Siemens to buy those same assets, and cajoling Berlin to go along with its plan, to avert what Paris sees as an even worse fate for the once-proud maker of TGV high-speed trains, an Anglo-Saxon takeover by the American giant General Electric.Separate complaints from Paris about the strength of the euro, which is hovering near a two-and-a-half-year high of nearly $1.40, are not new.Since the euro was introduced almost 15 years ago, France has often attributed its economic problems to the single currency and the failure of the European Central Bank to rein it in.But the latest salvos, from the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, and the economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, have a more desperate ring than usual.They come at a time when France is struggling to bring its budget deficit down to the European Union-mandated ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product, even after being granted an extra two years to achieve the target.As it has on Alstom, the German government has pushed back politely but firmly, cautioning French politicians against meddling with the currency or telling the independent European Central Bank how to do its job.\u201cBerlin and Paris are no longer playing in the same league,\u201d says Dominique Mo\u00efsi, a founder and senior adviser at the French Institute for International Relations, which is based in Paris. \u201cThis imbalance is at the very heart of the Franco-German malaise.\u201dBeyond the economic divide are two contrasting visions of European integration that could clash once the European Union elections are out of the way.Ask officials in Berlin what Europe\u2019s next priority should be and they talk about writing the budget rules that were agreed upon during the peak of the euro crisis and should be codified into law through changes in the Treaty of Lisbon, which itself amends the treaties that originally formed the European Union.But in France, there is discomfort with what is seen as a German-made rule book for Europe and strong resistance to treaty changes that risk dividing the Socialist party of Mr. Hollande and further fueling the far-right euro-skeptic National Front, led by Marine Le Pen.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mutual frustration at the moment,\u201d said Gilles Moec, the chief Europe economist at Deutsche Bank in London. \u201cEuropean rules that many in France identify with Germany are coming back to bite the French government,\u201d he said, referring to the deficit debate. \u201cAt the same time, there is a growing sense in France that Europe\u2019s problems can be traced back to German economic policies, its big current account surplus and an E.C.B. that is too German.\u201dThe appointment of the next president to the European Commission only deepens anxiety in Paris. The best-case scenario for Mr. Hollande is that Martin Schulz, a German Social Democrat who enjoys a close relationship with Ms. Merkel, gets the job.The worst-case is Jean-Claude Juncker, the former conservative prime minister of Luxembourg and a die-hard federalist, who has publicly chastised France for blaming the euro for its troubles and warned against granting Paris \u201cspecial\u201d treatment on its deficit.The Paris-Berlin relationship isn\u2019t all dark. Officials in Ms. Merkel\u2019s entourage see the appointment of Mr. Valls, a moderate Socialist, to prime minister in a government reshuffle last month as proof that France is gravitating toward Germany on policy. In private, their comments are tinged with concern about the slow pace of change in their western neighbor. But in public, German officials studiously avoid any comments that might be construed as criticism of Mr. Hollande.\u201cThe domestic political situation for Hollande is a difficult one. So external advice isn\u2019t helpful,\u201d said Michael Roth, an official in the German Foreign Ministry who is in charge of French-German relations.Mr. Mo\u00efsi of the French institute says Ukraine presents a wild card for the French-German relationship. The two countries have so far been in tune in their response to the crisis, and Mr. Mo\u00efsi says he hopes the Ukrainian situation can accomplish what the euro crisis failed to do \u2014 bring Europe and its two big powers closer together.In remarks at an Alfred Herrhausen Society event in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Mo\u00efsi mused that the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, might one day deserve a place alongside Jean Monnet as a father of European unity.\u201cThe euro crisis may be behind us, but the geopolitical crisis is right in front of us and it can force Europe to think bigger,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, Europe may come to the realization that you can\u2019t separate energy policy, foreign policy and fiscal policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Europe has slapped sanctions on Russia and sought ways to reduce its dependence on Russian energy.Mr. Putin, on a two-day visit to Shanghai, and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, oversaw the signing of the contract between Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation, the biggest natural gas deal Russia has sealed since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The contract runs for 30 years and calls for the construction of pipelines and other infrastructure that will require tens of billions of dollars in investment.The deal, which Mr. Putin called an \u201cepochal event,\u201d solidified a relationship between China and Russia that had been warming since Mr. Xi assumed power in 2012, as Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin have found common cause.\u201cThe Sino-Soviet rift that brought the two countries to the brink of nuclear war in the \u201860s has been healed rather dramatically,\u201d said Strobe Talbott, president of the Brookings Institution and the chairman of Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s Foreign Policy Advisory Board.Ostensibly on the same side during the Cold War, the Asian neighbors even then competed for global influence with their divergent brands of communism. They fought a brief but explosive border war in 1969, and later took opposite sides in conflicts in Vietnam and Afghanistan.They have similar views of the United States, however, including opposition to its unilateral military actions in Kosovo, Iraq and Libya, and wanted to \u201ctake Uncle Sam down a peg or two,\u201d Mr. Talbott said. Mr. Putin, in particular, wanted to make a point of showing that the United States and its NATO partners were in decline.The deal offered a lift for the Russian economy, he said, and for Mr. Putin, China\u2019s validation would improve Russia\u2019s world image.At the same time, Mr. Xi was unhappy with the Obama administration on issues ranging from Washington\u2019s outspoken support of its military alliance with Japan, its criticism of China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea, and its hard line on cybertheft, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.Although China had expressed neutrality over the Ukraine crisis, the strained relations with Washington in other spheres tipped that position in favor of Russia, Mr. Shi said. Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin have met seven times, he noted.Those factors appear to have pushed the two sides to an agreement, whose final sticking point had been price. The final price of the Russian gas, which will flow through a 2,500-mile pipeline from two fields in Siberia, was not disclosed, and energy markets were trying to parse who gained the bigger advantage.Russia had been holding out for a price close to what European countries pay, and China for a price akin to the cheaper gas it buys from Central Asia, energy experts who tracked the talks said.With Russia\u2019s economy near recession and the International Monetary Fund projecting 0.2 percent growth this year, Mr. Putin was desperate to get the deal done, energy experts said.The chief executive of Gazprom, Alexey Miller, said the contract called for Russia to supply 38 billion cubic meters of gas annually over 30 years, making the price about $350 per thousand cubic meters. In 2013, the average price of Gazprom\u2019s gas in Europe was about $380 per thousand cubic meters.\u201cThe pricing appears to be between European Union prices and Turkmenistan prices,\u201d said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. \u201cWe will have to wait for the next few months to learn about the details.\u201dMorena Skalamera, a fellow at the Geopolitics of Energy Project at Harvard, said Mr. Putin was more willing to concede on price than he had been before the Ukraine crisis.\u201cIf the European market was a question mark before the Ukrainian crisis, now with sanctions, Putin needed China even more,\u201d she said.\u201cPolitically, it is important for Putin to show that the \u2018Greater Russia\u2019 is back on the international scene and that it has other, non-Western options to restore its rightful place.\u201dIn exchange for a lower price, China offered a loan of about $50 billion that will finance development of the gas fields and the construction of the pipeline by Russia up to the Chinese border, Ms. Skalamera said. The Chinese would build the remaining pipeline, and gas is scheduled to start pumping in 2018, she said.In remarks after the signing, Mr. Putin stressed that the price of the gas was based on the market price for oil, just as it was for Russia\u2019s gas supplies to European countries. \u201cThe gas price formula, as in our other contracts, is pegged to the market of oil and oil products,\u201d Itar-Tass quoted him as saying.Without the oil price benchmark, Russia would be under pressure to renegotiate European prices, said Kenneth S. Courtis, a founding partner of Thames Investment. The price of Russian gas to Europe is based on fluctuations in oil prices, making it more expensive than gas that China buys from Central Asia, he said.Even under the new agreement, Europe will remain Russia\u2019s biggest market.The production of American shale gas also gave Russia incentive to rapidly complete the deal with China and to seek other markets in Asia, Ms. Skalamera said. \u201cThe rapid rise of U.S. natural gas is giving Europeans genuine market options,\u201d she said. \u201cMany are opting out of the grip of Gazprom. The result? Russia is looking for a new cash cow, turning its gaze east.\u201dChina was under no such pressure, having lined up substantial and cheaper flows of gas from Central Asia. Siberian natural gas does give China a cleaner substitute for the fossil fuels \u2014 coal and petroleum \u2014 that provide most of its energy needs, and cause much of the pollution smothering China\u2019s cities.Because of an editing error, a picture caption with an article on Thursday about the signing of a $400 billion gas deal between China and Russia\u00a0misidentified, in some editions, the city in which President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China held their conference. It was Shanghai, not Beijing.Bree Feng contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Expects Its Economy to Grow 1.6% This Year", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Commission said on Monday that growth across the European Union would gain significant momentum this year and continue through 2015, but it also warned of numerous threats that could still derail a slow, gradual recovery.The commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, also stressed the need for more robust domestic consumption, partly because of an expected weakening of demand for European exports.\u201cThe recovery has now taken hold,\u201d said Siim Kallas, an Estonian politician who is a vice president of the commission. But it is \u201cimportant to embrace structural reforms early on and to stay the course, whatever challenges may be faced along the way,\u201d he said.Mr. Kallas, standing in for Olli Rehn, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, who is on leave to campaign for election to the European Parliament, identified multiple hazards that could still affect the economy, including tensions with Russia, a prolonged period of low inflation, and an unwillingness by member governments to continue reforms.Concern about the vulnerability of the 18 countries that share the euro as their currency was highlighted by a small trimming of the growth forecast for next year to 1.7 percent from the 1.8 percent forecast issued in February.But overall there was some reason for optimism, Mr. Kallas said. \u201cDeficits have declined, investment is rebounding and, importantly, the employment situation has started improving,\u201d he said.Growth in the euro area should reach 1.2 percent this year, compared with a decline of 0.4 percent last year, the report said. Growth across the 28-member union should reach 1.6 percent this year and hit 2 percent next year, compared with a figure of only 0.1 percent last year, the commission added.Mr. Kallas played down the threat from deflation although the commission\u2019s report showed that inflation would be lower this year, at 0.8 percent, than the 1 percent it had forecast in February. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider that this problem will be a serious obstacle,\u201d Mr. Kallas said at a news conference on Monday.That inflation figure is well below the European Central Bank\u2019s target of just below 2 percent. The E.C.B. is due to hold its monthly rate-setting meeting Thursday in Brussels.Analysts said that the central bank was unlikely to lower its benchmark interest rate or to announce other measures aimed at averting deflation, such as large-scale asset purchases, at its meeting this week. \u201cWe think that the E.C.B. will once again try to buy some time with words, not with deeds,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING, wrote in a research note.The forecasts issued on Monday are also important indicators for the policies the commission will expect from France, where there have been fears that the economy will slip back into stagnation, and Italy, where a reform-minded government is seeking to loosen its debt targets.For Italy, the commission forecast growth of 0.6 percent this year and 1.2 percent next year. That is slightly lower than official forecasts from Rome, where the government expects the economy to grow 0.8 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2015.Although the long slump that took hold in 2008 is definitively over, the commission made its forecasts amid continuing concerns about a labor market that remains stagnant more than five years after Europe was racked by its worst downturn in decades.Conditions for job seekers have started to improve during the past year, but the decline in the unemployment rate in the euro area \u2014 which stood at 12 percent last year \u2014 still will be only very gradual, falling to 11.8 percent this year and to 11.4 percent next year, the report said.Across the European Union, the report said, the unemployment rate was expected to fall to 10.5 percent this year and to 10.1 percent next year. That compares with a rate of 10.8 percent last year.The stickiness in the job market in Europe, where rigid rules on hiring and firing can discourage employers from adding workers, is regarded by economists as one of the key factors impeding more robust growth in the region and holding back employers from replacing the millions of jobs lost since 2008.The report said that Greece and Spain, which were among the countries hit hardest by the economic crisis, were expected to mark small declines in joblessness this year, but that the unemployment rate still would remain at 24 percent in both countries next year.Left-leaning political leaders responded to the report on Monday by saying that many Europeans were still paying a high price for the austerity policies imposed on them during the debt crisis to shore up government budgets. At least one said that the United States had done better than Europe in climbing out of the crisis.\u201cThe clear trend of shrinking unemployment shows that the U.S. did the right thing, investing during tough times rather than cutting all expenditure until the economy is paralyzed,\u201d said Hannes Swoboda, the president of the Socialists & Democrats group in the European Parliament.\u200bAn earlier version of this article misstated the period for which the European Commission calculated a European Union unemployment rate of 10.8 percent. The rate was calculated at 10.8 percent for last year, not projected at 10.8 percent for the current year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Smutty-Metaphor Queen of Lawrence, Kansas", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust before she took the microphone one soggy night in Portland, Ore., the poet Patricia Lockwood downed a shot of cheap bourbon. She had never had a drink right before a reading, but she often enacts some private joke when she speaks in public. It might be slurping her water loudly into the microphone, or rolling (instead of stepping) onto a stage, or, in this case, ingesting something that tasted to her like a puddle in a forest \u2014 anything to erase what she calls the \u201canxiety kegels\u201d leading up to a performance.That evening, more than a hundred poetry fans \u2014 most of them in their 20s, most of them clutching cans of bargain beer \u2014 crowded into a corner of a 12,000-square-foot wood-and-metal shop as Lockwood began a 12-minute romp of a poem called \u201cThe Father and Mother of American Tit-Pics.\u201dLockwood is all large eyes, apple cheeks and pixie haircut \u2014 like an early Disney creation, perhaps a woodland creature; one of her fans recently rendered her as a My Little Pony. The contrast between how she presents and what she writes is something Lockwood delights in.\u201cEmily Dickinson was the father of American poetry and Walt Whitman was the mother,\u201d she read. \u201cWalt Whitman nude, in the forest, staring deep into a still pool \u2014 the only means of taking tit-pics available at that time.\u201dI laughed, like everyone else in the audience, and then settled in for a poem that re-envisioned two 19th-century pillars of American poetry through a kaleidoscope of contemporary obsessions. Occasionally, the sound of arc welding filled the silences between stanzas. It was, she later said, \u201cthe butchest I have ever felt.\u201dMost poets who publish with the top indie or trade publishers in the country teach at universities, and nearly all have taken advanced degrees \u2014 an M.F.A. or even a Ph.D. in creative writing. The effect of grad-school workshops on literature in the United States has been the subject of endless debate \u2014 the M.F.A. vs. N.Y.C. meme being the most recent variation on the theme. Lockwood has no M.F.A., she never even went to college. She married at 21, has scarcely ever held a job and, by her telling, seems to have spent her adult life in a Proustian attitude, writing for hours each day from her \u201cdesk-bed.\u201d Now, at 32, Lockwood finds herself on the verge of literary fame, a product of ill fortune followed by good fortune and the perhaps na\u00efve expectations of success that only an outsider can maintain.Lockwood has found that her Twitter fans have surprising patience with some of her longer and less accessible poems. \u201cThe idea about readers being too lazy to read poetry \u2014 they just need an in,\u201d she said, \u201ca voice they can trust.\u201d Though Lockwood claims not to assert her politics in her poems, Don Share, the editor of the venerable Poetry magazine, in which she has been published, says that\u2019s one of the most striking things about her work. \u201cShe\u2019s right on top of politics, the economy, social situations, sexual situations, gender issues,\u201d he says. \u201cShe converts the feed of information we get all day into these striking poems.\u201dThat summer, during a stand-up set, the comedian Daniel Tosh went into an extended riff on rape jokes, which prompted a woman in the audience to shout, \u201cRape jokes are never funny.\u201d Tosh\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be funny if that girl got raped by, like, five guys right now?\u201d \u2014 sparked a nationwide debate about taboos in comedy: Are there things we just can\u2019t laugh about, and who is the \u201cwe\u201d that gets to laugh and in what circumstances? While comedians, feminists, survivors of sexual violence and the usual pundits weighed in, Lockwood went back to the draft and finished the poem. She sent it to The Awl, an online magazine, where it sat for months.\u201cThe rape joke is that you were 19 years old,\u201d the poem begins. \u201cThe rape joke is that he was your boyfriend.\u201d And then the poem complicates itself \u2014 with a joke:The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.\u201cIt\u2019s not a well-behaved poem,\u201d Terrance Hayes, who selected the poem for the 2014 edition of \u201cThe Best American Poetry\u201d series, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s humor as we understand it from Richard Pryor, which is to say, there\u2019s a blade at the heart of the joke, but there\u2019s also a kind of suffering, and an awareness of that suffering, which gives it a kind of empathy for people who are exposed to it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole poem is a big question, isn\u2019t it?\u201dGreg Lockwood married Lockwood\u2019s mother, Karen, when they were both teenagers; he had just joined the Navy. Karen was raised Catholic, but Greg was an atheist. During one patrol, on a nuclear submarine off the coast of Norway, he underwent what he later described as \u201cthe deepest conversion on record.\u201d He claims it grew out of soul-searching following several personal setbacks, but the family legend ascribes it to the fact that he and the crew on his previous patrol watched \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d more than 70 times in 88 days. Whatever the catalyst, Lockwood became a devout Christian. He started a family, attended college and seminary and eventually was ordained as a Lutheran minister. And then one morning in 1985 he \u201cwoke up Catholic\u201d; a few years later he became a priest, with the zeal of the twice-converted.In Lockwood\u2019s telling, her father ruled the home as a loving and idiosyncratic patriarch who wore his cassock in the living room, or else very little \u2014 \u201cIt was either full regalia or nothing\u201d \u2014 watched sword-and-sandal movies obsessively, played blues guitar, ate copious amounts of sausage and fed the family a steady dose of prog rock. Her mother was a more cautious presence who instituted family diets, watched her five children for signs of allergies and had a penchant for puns. The family calls her K-Rock; she claims to have known when Tricia was in the fourth grade that she was destined to be a writer.As a child Lockwood was intensely pious. \u201cCatholicism is very beautiful,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen your father is a priest, it\u2019s invested with extra authority, and your father is invested with extra authority.\u201d As a teenager, she had a strict dress code and a very limited range of after-school activities, which included a youth group called God\u2019s Gang. \u201cThere was a lot of talk about gangs at the time,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand the idea was, what if there was a gang but it was a cool gang \u2014 for the Lord?\u201d In God\u2019s Gang they spoke in tongues, and the leaders would outline \u201call the sex you can\u2019t do.\u201dWhile in high school in Cincinnati, she encountered in an anthology a poem that was actually funny and learned that its author, Kenneth Koch, was a Cincinnati native. Koch \u2014 a fixture of the New York School, friend and contemporary of John Ashbery and Frank O\u2019Hara \u2014 came to read at a public library in town and Lockwood went to hear him, asking a question in the session that followed. She wasn\u2019t surprised that he singled her out to talk with afterward. She was 18 and a poet. \u201cYou just expect that the world will notice you,\u201d she said.Lockwood planned on studying literature at St. Johns College in Annapolis, but on Christmas Eve before her first semester, her father dropped a bombshell: they couldn\u2019t afford to send her. \u201cIt tells you something about my relationship to authority,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even think I should try to get loans. I just thought, That\u2019s that.\u201dShe moved into an abandoned convent near her parents\u2019 rectory, briefly got a job in a bookshop and hung out with what she describes as \u201ca lesbian wolf pack \u2014 I was allowed to go feral for the first time.\u201dShe also began posting on poetry message boards. It was there, online, that her poetry caught the eye of Kendall, a child of two missionaries who spent formative years in Thailand and Korea but who was by then living in Colorado and writing poems. The two corresponded and eventually began talking on the phone. At some point Kendall decided to drive to Cincinnati to meet her. \u201cThis was when it was still weird to meet on the Internet,\u201d Lockwood said. He was 20 years old. She was 19, but he thought that with a name like Patricia, she was probably older.When the distant suitor arrived and met Lockwood\u2019s family, he found her father upstairs in the TV room, cleaning his handgun. The first thing Greg Lockwood said to Kendall was: \u201cGive me your driver\u2019s license. I\u2019ve got cop friends.\u201dFather Lockwood eventually married them. The couple moved to Colorado Springs, where Patricia set to work on a novel. Their apartment looked out on a majestic park, Garden of the Gods, but she moved her desk into a closet so she wouldn\u2019t be distracted by the view. With the hubris of a 20-year-old, she sent the finished novel to the top literary agents in New York. There was interest, and soon she had major literary representation.The book was called \u201cThe History of Opposable Thumbs,\u201d and it was unusual material. \u201cGreat novels have incest; if not, they\u2019re not good,\u201d Lockwood told me. \u201cWilliam Faulkner taught us that.\u201d She and Kendall had high hopes, but the novel languished, and she was eventually told that, \u201cin the climate after 9/11, people aren\u2019t willing to take a chance on sister-on-sister action where someone loses a hand to gangrene.\u201d The book fell off the map. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t get published,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cI\u2019m like a bear leaving scat in the woods. I move on.\u201dAfter five years in Florida, the couple found a home in Savannah, Ga. Kendall was working as a features editor at The Savannah Morning News. Lockwood had recently published her first poem in The New Yorker. And then Kendall began to notice something wrong with his vision; he was having trouble reading at work. An ophthalmologist found advanced cataracts on both eyes \u2014 quite rare for a healthy 30-year-old. If they progressed, he was told, the surgery could become too risky, and he would potentially lose his eyesight. Their health insurance didn\u2019t cover the whole cost of the procedure, leaving them roughly $10,000 short. Desperate, Lockwood shared their predicament with her Twitter followers. Her online friends urged her to set up a PayPal account. At 11 p.m. one night, she tweeted that the account was up, and by 11 a.m. the next day they had raised the entire sum.\u201cIt was shocking,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cHow can people be so cool?\u201d\u201cEveryone except for a few people donated in small amounts,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cThings like $4.20 or $6.66, people with user names like theslavekitten.\u201dKendall had five surgeries. His recovery was slow, and eventually he had to face the reality that until he healed completely, he couldn\u2019t do a job that required him to stare at a computer all day. Suddenly he and Lockwood were without a livelihood.With few other options, they put their possessions in storage and moved into a 10-by-14 upstairs bedroom in her father\u2019s modest brick rectory in Kansas City: a married couple in their 30s living across the hall from the priest and his wife.With Kendall recuperating and with no income, Lockwood had to choose between finding a job or writing a book she could sell. She began a memoir, an attempt at flat-out funny prose, no 140-character limits, no line breaks. Between the interruptions of her father, dressed in his cassock and jamming on one of his left-handed guitars or shouting at the Cincinnati Bengals on TV, she traced her life thus far.She was still living in the rectory when \u201cRape Joke\u201d was published in The Awl. There is a section of the poem about the speaker\u2019s parents\u2019 response to the rape:Lockwood came downstairs one night after the poem was published to find her mother sitting in the dark in front of her computer, reading the poem and crying. Her mother hugged her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s O.K., you\u2019re still standing.\u201d But she had also read some of the ugly comments left on The Awl\u2019s website \u2014 \u201coh, get over yourself, you attention whore . . . no one feels bad for you. you\u2019re the rape joke.\u201d\u201cDo you see what these people were saying about you?\u201d her mother asked.\u201cMom, it\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the Internet.\u201dOf her parents\u2019 reaction to the rape, she later said: \u201cPeople don\u2019t necessarily respond as their best selves in the moment. The initial conversations were not totally ideal. But when you make art out of something, they get another chance.\u201dBehind the house, trees line a creek named for William S. Burroughs, the literary patron of Lawrence. Lockwood likes to sit in a room at the back of the house in the afternoons, looking out the window and going into her own head. Some evenings, a skunk emerges from the Burroughs Creek bank and locks eyes with her before disappearing under the house. She feels as if they have forged a bond and calls the animal Big Boi, after one of her favorite rappers.We took a walk along the Burroughs trail and up into the heart of Lawrence\u2019s old downtown and talked about her poetry. \u201cWhenever anyone asks me about process,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m like a cat stroked the wrong way: Get away from my belly!\u201d But she is fundamentally a sharer, a poet for the age of sharing. \u201cI\u2019m verbally incontinent \u2014 anything just pours out of me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy father\u2019s that way. He doesn\u2019t worry about it. My mother does. I got both. I say just the worst things the English language is capable of, and then later on I lie awake at night thinking, Oh, Tricia, you\u2019ve done it again.\u201dLockwood\u2019s poems are most radical in their ability to convey the essential strangeness of sex and gender. \u201cI consistently felt myself to be not male or female,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the 11-year-old gender: protagonist. Maybe it\u2019s a byproduct of reading a lot of books, of projecting yourself into different bodies. As an early teen, I thought I presented as androgynous, which was not true. But I had a short haircut, and I felt androgynous.\u201dThere was no discussion of sex in the home growing up. She ascribes the birth of her own sexual knowledge to a road trip with her aunt when they listened to Jean Auel\u2019s \u201cThe Valley of Horses.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re driving along the Grand Canyon, the hugest vagina in the world, and my aunt is playing the audiobook of cave-man sex. I just pretended to be asleep or she\u2019d turn it off.\u201dWe stopped for a moment at a picnic bench in an idyllic city park. \u201cI blush if I see people kissing in a movie,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are certain cusses I can\u2019t say. It\u2019s a private joke: I\u2019m a puritan. I was a child bride. There\u2019s this prim, prudish part of me, and in order to get past that, I just have to push all the way.\u201d As she spoke, an elderly couple walked along a nearby path, a young woman danced with a hula hoop near a fountain and a squirrel darted away from us toward a tree just beginning to leaf. \u201cNothing I say is actually physically possible on any plane of existence,\u201d Lockwood added, watching the squirrel. \u201cI may want to French a squirrel, but I can\u2019t. It would be hard to catch. Rabies. Too much fur.\u201dMany of the titles of the poems in the new collection, \u201cMotherland Fatherland Homelandsexuals,\u201d rival click bait in their demand to be read: \u201cIs Your Country a He or a She in Your Mouth,\u201d \u201cHe Marries the Stuffed-Owl Exhibit,\u201d \u201cSearch \u2018Lizard Vagina\u2019 and You Shall Find,\u201d \u201cNessie Wants to Watch Herself Doing It.\u201d One poem traces the evolution of generic doe-eyed deer named Bambi into generic women named Fawn, with their \u201clight shafts of long blond hair and long legs.\u201d Yet the book, for all its playfulness, poses sharp challenges to many stereotypes, particularly those around gender. \u201cList of Cross-Dressing Soldiers\u201d starts with famous women who dressed as men and fought in battles, but then shifts closer to home. Lockwood\u2019s younger brother, Paul, is a Marine who has served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. \u201cWe would always have dreams and then hear that something bad had happened near him,\u201d she said. The poem touches on these close calls:\u201cHe\u2019d always say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to go back\u2019 and then do another tour,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cThe last tour in Afghanistan was tough. He just missed being exploded by an I.E.D. He lost buddies.\u201d Yet what drew her into the poem was the interaction between her brother and his fellow Marines.\u201cIt\u2019s such a macho culture,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also the most affectionate male culture I\u2019ve ever encountered. Sitting on each other\u2019s laps, stroking each other\u2019s faces. It\u2019s very sweet. But at the same time it\u2019s, \u2018Be a man!\u2019 \u201dShe didn\u2019t think her brother would read the book. \u201cHe\u2019s just proud that you\u2019ve done it,\u201d she said. \u201cSame with my dad.\u201d Her father has never heard her read her poems. \u201cI stay away and let her do what she needs to do with her life,\u201d Father Lockwood told me one evening during a visit to the rectory in Kansas City. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy smart and very talented. Good theology teaches you that everyone belongs to themselves.\u201d Then he turned to his daughter and said, \u201cYou come from us, but you\u2019re not us.\u201dTo Lockwood, that distinction was more mystery than theology. \u201cI have this hall-monitor mother,\u201d she told me later, \u201cand this psycho freakout prog-rock dad just doing whatever he wants; he doesn\u2019t even obey any laws except the laws of the church, and I came out. I\u2019m not even sure how it happened.\u201dOne afternoon during my visit to Lawrence, Lockwood and Kendall were in the side yard of their house, he drinking wine on the grass, she finishing a shot of vodka while sitting on a swing suspended from a large tree. At some point, a hare emerged from the Burroughs Creek bank and watched them \u2014 Thumper checking in on old friends. The conversation turned to whether she ever felt the lack of a college education.\u201cA nice byproduct of never going to college,\u201d she said, \u201cis that I\u2019m never embarrassed about not knowing something. I\u2019m missing such large areas. If you looked at my brain, it would be like those taxi drivers who have one huge lobe that just contains directions, except for me it would be metaphors. I felt like I had a freak ability.\u201d\u201cLike you\u2019re a good singer,\u201d Kendall said.Kendall saw something from the start in those message boards. \u201cI\u2019m going to work and she\u2019s going to write all day \u2014 when you are marrying a genius, that\u2019s the deal,\u201d he said, watching her on the swing. \u201cIt\u2019s like marrying Aretha Franklin. She\u2019s going to get to sing. If you hear Aretha Franklin sing \u2014 \u201d\u201cThis is so grandiose,\u201d Lockwood interrupted.\u201c \u2014 you understand what\u2019s going on musically. Whoever was the first person to hear Aretha sing, understood. I just happened to be the first.\u201dOn Saturday she was to be part of a distinguished poetry event with a number of well-known older poets at Sarah Lawrence College. The rest of her trip, including her birthday, would prove to be a comedy of errors \u2014 pants ripped on a bench, maxed-out credit-card (the memoir money hadn\u2019t come in yet), passing out in a hot tub. \u201cMy disaster birthday,\u201d as she would describe it to me. But Friday night, the young and clever of Brooklyn packed the Morgan Town Bar in Bushwick, where Lockwood was headlining a long bill of \u201cInternet comedy writers.\u201dShe gamely waited through seven other acts, laughing at the funny bits, smiling through the rest. Many people came up to talk to her \u2014 five minutes into a conversation they might reveal their Twitter handles, at which point her eyes sparked with recognition and she hugged them. One young man approached Kendall to introduce himself and ask about his eyes \u2014 he had contributed to the surgery fund.At last, Lockwood\u2019s turn came and, in a gray top and skirt that she had selected at the Goodwill in Lawrence, she did an impromptu barrel roll onto the stage for her private, nerve-calming joke. The piece she was about to read was a true story of a mother-daughter road trip interrupted by the discovery of less-than-spotless bed linens at a Nashville hotel chain. It\u2019s about the moment when you and your mother first say to each other a slang word for a bodily fluid, at which point, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no going back.\u201d The title of the piece can only be rendered in these pages as \u201cThe Semen Queens of Hyatt Place.\u201dBack in Kansas, she had already read it to her mother, who laughed out loud. In Brooklyn, they did the same.Advertisement"}

Gainor, president and chief executive of Dairy Queen, said in an interview at a store in Manhattan that is being prepared for opening on Thursday. The store, at 54 West 14th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, will be the first Dairy Queen in the borough, he said, and is \u201cjust the start of an expansion plan in Manhattan and other boroughs.\u201d (There is one other Dairy Queen in New York City, at the St. George Ferry Terminal in Staten Island.) The emphasis on social media, as evidenced by a hashtag, #LoveMyDQ, is appropriate for a campaign that calls customers \u201cfans,\u201d Mr. Gainor acknowledged, an approach that stemmed from research by Barkley. \u201cWe felt something was missing\u201d from our ads, he said, \u201ca north star, a bigger idea,\u201d and celebrating the brand\u2019s loyalists fills that gap.Mr. Westrum said: \u201cWhat is at the heart of the campaign is that consumers have an emotional connection to the brand. We\u2019re the home of first dates and first kisses, and where the soccer team goes after the big win. That really is what we\u2019re leveraging, the feel-good elements.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give fans a way to interact with us beyond viewing a spot or a video,\u201d Stephanie Parker, vice president and account director at Barkley, said in a phone interview. For instance, one day next month, the agency plans to bring Mr. Applebaum into the social-media center, Ms. Parker said, \u201cand he\u2019ll be our Dairy Queen community manager for the day.\u201d\u201cWe know he\u2019s bringing his guitar,\u201d she added, laughing.\u201cOne of our creative directors used a phrase yesterday, that \u2018fan food\u2019 can act as a big house with a lot of rooms,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cThe S\u2019mores Blizzard and the $5 Buck Lunch are very different executions, but both are an expression of a larger strategy.\u201dIn developing potential ads, \u201cwe ask: \u2018Is it fanworthy? Is it something fans are going to rally around?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she added.According to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, Dairy Queen spent $76.8 million on advertising last year. That was an increase from the $67.3 million spent in 2012 and just less than the $77 million spent in 2011. Dairy Queen will increase its spending this year, Mr. Westrum said. \u201cWe are thrilled about the response to the \u2018Fan food, not fast food\u2019 campaign, and we want to keep that going as we head into our peak season.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Other Lenders Sought for Trade Center Tower", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe developer Larry A. Silverstein failed on Wednesday for the second time in two months to gain approval for additional government support for his long-stalled second office building at the World Trade Center.But the developer\u2019s $2.3 billion, 80-story tower is not dead yet.Mr. Silverstein has told real estate executives in recent days that he is optimistic that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will eventually guarantee his construction loan, increasing the authority\u2019s support to $1.2 billion, from $190 million.Knowing that the board of the Port Authority is sharply divided on the matter, however, Mr. Silverstein has been working on lining up money from possible backup lenders: a financial institution; an insurance company; a nontraditional lender such as SL Green Realty, a publicly traded real estate company; or Blackstone Group, a private equity firm.It remains to be seen whether he can strike a deal, but Mr. Silverstein has signed a lease with a major advertising media company, GroupM, for almost one-fifth of the tower. Construction on the building itself has been stuck at the eighth floor for more than a year.\u201cWe are committed to continuing the incredible momentum that has been realized in Lower Manhattan to date, and remain 100 percent focused on ensuring a fully rebuilt and revitalized World Trade in the heart of the world\u2019s most dynamic urban neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said in a statement on Wednesday.The debate at the Port Authority has centered not on whether the tower should be built, but on whether the public sector or a private developer should shoulder the risk of financing the project.\u201cThey recognized the votes were not there,\u201d said Kenneth Lipper, a board member and a critic of the deal. \u201cThe proposal to guarantee the $1.2 billion is D.O.A. We\u2019ve gone back to the idea that we\u2019ll limit our exposure to the $200 million that was part of our 2010 agreement.\u201dMr. Silverstein completed his first tower, 72 stories tall, late last year. The Port Authority and the city have committed to lease about half of that building, which is currently vacant. The developer is close to signing another tenant, MediaMath, a software developer.The Port Authority owns the trade center site. Its board was scheduled to vote on Wednesday on the Silverstein proposal for the second tower, but after a straw poll on Tuesday night revealed that the proposal would fail, the item was pulled from the agenda.Mr. Silverstein expressed surprise that \u201cthe discussions did not yield a successful resolution.\u201dProponents of restructuring the deal with Mr. Silverstein, led by Scott H. Rechler, the authority\u2019s vice chairman, say that the completion of the tower would signal that the reconstruction of the World Trade Center site was complete.Critics such as Mr. Lipper, who, like Mr. Rechler, was appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said that it made no sense to subsidize Mr. Silverstein\u2019s tower when there was so much vacant office space available downtown, including space at 1 World Trade Center.There are tenants for a little more than one-third of the three million square feet at 1 World Trade Center. The authority and its partner, the Durst Organization, have been unable to lure any major tenants since 2011, when they signed a deal with Cond\u00e9 Nast. The Durst Organization recently cut the rents for lower floors to $69 per square foot, down from $75.Mr. Lipper argues that guaranteeing the $1.2 billion construction loan could hurt the authority\u2019s credit rating and divert from its core mission of building and maintaining transportation infrastructure in New York and New Jersey.Matt Fabian, an analyst with Municipal Market Advisors, agreed, saying, \u201cThis loan guarantee could, in theory, threaten the authority\u2019s ratings, in particular if the occupancy does poorly, if the local economy turns sour, or if the developer\u2019s finances worsen.\u201dMr. Silverstein signed a lease with GroupM last December for 516,000 square feet. But traditional lenders are reluctant to finance an office tower that does not have tenants for 40 percent to 50 percent of the space. The deal with GroupM commits 20 percent of the space.Some insurance companies and private equity firms could provide the financial backing, although they would almost certainly seek a higher interest rate and a stake in the building. Instead, Mr. Silverstein asked the authority for more help.Mr. Rechler said, \u201cI have great confidence that we\u2019re on the path to getting this done in a way that reduces our exposure and gets the tower built in time to meet GroupM\u2019s time frame.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Swiss Voters Defeat $24.65 Minimum Wage by a Wide Margin ", "Date": "2014-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by Swiss voters resoundingly rejected on Sunday a proposed minimum wage that would have been the world\u2019s highest, a move widely seen as reflecting an aversion to state intervention in the liberal economic policies that are the bedrock of Switzerland\u2019s prosperity.Trade unions had sought a minimum hourly wage of 22 Swiss francs, or $24.65, in what they said was an effort to ensure fair salaries for workers in the lowest-paid sectors, such as retailing and personal services. Switzerland has no national minimum wage.The proposed rate \u2014 considerably higher than elsewhere in Europe and more than double the $10.10 President Obama has sought in the United States \u2014 found little support in a national referendum, with 76.3 percent opposed, according to initial results released by the government.Switzerland, as one of the world\u2019s most prosperous countries and home to major international banks and hedge funds, as well as big chemical, pharmaceutical and machinery companies, might seem an unlikely venue for a debate on wage disparity. But unions argued that many people in the lowest-paying sectors of the economy struggled to make ends meet because their wages had not kept up with a cost of living among the highest in the world.The vote on Sunday showed, however, that most Swiss do not view low wages as a problem, or at least not one that the government should be asked to fix.\u201cA fixed salary has never been a good way to fight the problem,\u201d said Johann Schneider-Ammann, the economic minister. \u201cIf the initiative had been accepted, it would have led to workplace losses, especially in rural areas where less-qualified people have a harder time finding jobs. The best remedy against poverty is work.\u201dGiorgio Tuti, president of SEV, the union for transport workers, told the broadcaster SWI that his disappointment was mitigated by the fact that the initiative had brought the issue of income disparity to the fore. In the months before the vote, several leading retailers raised the base salaries for their workers.\u201cI am relatively certain that the whole of Switzerland has now realized that a minimum wage and the problem of low wages is an important issue,\u201d he said.Business leaders argued that a national minimum wage would hurt Swiss competitiveness in the global economy. Some Swiss already see their nation\u2019s position threatened by a referendum approved in February to limit the number of European Union citizens allowed to live and work in Switzerland, which is not a member of the 28-nation bloc.\u201cSwitzerland, especially in popular votes, has never had a tradition of approving state intervention in the labor markets,\u201d said Daniel Kubler, a professor of political science at the University of Zurich. \u201cA majority of Swiss has always thought, and still seems to think, that liberal economic principles are the basis of their model of success.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Blinked", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe crisis in Ukraine never threatened a Cold War-like\u00a0nuclear Armageddon, but it may be the first case of post-post-Cold War brinkmanship, pitting the 21st century versus the 19th. It pits a Chinese/Russian worldview that says we can take advantage of 21st-century globalization whenever we want to enrich ourselves, and we can behave like 19th-century powers whenever we want to take a bite out of a neighbor \u2014 versus a view that says, no, sorry, the world of the 21st century is not just interconnected but interdependent and either you play by those rules or you pay a huge price. In the end, it was Putinism versus Obamaism, and I\u2019d like to be the first on my block to declare that the \u201cother fellow\u201d \u2014 Putin \u2014 \u201cjust blinked.\u201d And, most of all, Putin underestimated the impact of Western economic sanctions. The world turned out to be more interdependent, and Russia more exposed to that interdependence, than Putin thought. So he blinked. The first flutter was pulling back his troops from Ukraine\u2019s border and letting the election proceed. Interestingly, he chose to blink\u00a0this out most directly at last week\u2019s\u00a0St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Russia\u2019s annual conference to attract global investors. \u201cWe want peace and calm in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Putin told the business executives. \u201cWe are interested that on our western borders we have peace and calm in Ukraine. ... We will work with the newly elected structure.\u201d After Putin spoke, the ruble rose 1 percent against the dollar, demonstrating just how much global markets will continue to reward his conciliation and punish his aggression. It has not been pretty. Putin has had to spend billions propping up the ruble and making up for lost foreign investment. Reuters reported that Russia\u2019s First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov told some attendees in St. Petersburg that the sanctions are \u201ccausing serious consequences for our economy,\u201d which could soon be in recession.And, because Putin\u2019s aggression in Crimea has spurred Europe to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, Putin rushed to Beijing to conclude a natural gas supply deal with China. The price China extracted is\u00a0secret and experts \u201csuspect Putin dropped the price of gas significantly for China in a desperate maneuver to ensure a steady cash flow for Gazprom in the face of sinking revenue and Western sanctions,\u201d The Washington Post reported. \u201c \u2018There\u2019s something fishy in the contract,\u2019 \u201d said Mikhail Krutikhin, an energy analyst at RusEnergy, suggesting that Russia got a bad bargain. Putin blinked.Let\u2019s add it up: Putin\u2019s seizure of Crimea has weakened the Russian economy, led to China getting a bargain gas deal, revived NATO, spurred Europe to start ending its addiction to Russian gas and begun a debate across Europe about increasing defense spending. Nice work, Vladimir. That\u2019s why I say the country Putin threatens most today is Russia.The Russian people will have to sort that out. I wish them well. I don\u2019t want Russia to become a failed state. But I want to see Ukraine get where its majority wants to go \u2014 toward closer ties with the E.U., but without a break in ties to Russia. That will require not only a new Ukrainian president, but a new Parliament, a new constitution and an engaged network of civil society groups able to hold Kiev\u2019s all-too-often corrupt leaders to the rule of law and to the standards of governance being demanded by both the E.U. and the I.M.F., in return for aid.With Ukraine\u2019s economy closely tied to Russia\u2019s \u2014 Kiev owes Russia $3.5 billion in gas bills \u2014 Putin still has enormous power to squeeze Ukraine.\u00a0The goal of the West should not be to prevent Putin from having any influence in Ukraine. Given all the links, that is not possible or healthy. It is to keep Putin backed off and blinking enough so that Ukraine can be Russia\u2019s neighbor \u2014 charting its own balance between the E.U. and Moscow \u2014 but not Russia\u2019s vassal.

{"Headline": "Crimean Vineyards of Last Czar Withstand Time and Tumult", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYalta JournalYALTA, Crimea \u2014 The cavernous cellars of the Massandra vineyards bear testament both to the tumult of history and to the enduring appeal of the wine produced on Crimea\u2019s steep, volcanic slopes.Czar Nicholas II founded Massandra in 1894 to provide wine for his summer palace; the double-headed eagle of his seal is still visible on some dusty bottles. During World War II, Stalin ordered the evacuation of 60,000 bottles from the best vintages. In more recent times, there have even been a couple of ill-starred attempts to get American presidents to drink the stuff.\u201cCzar. U.S.S.R. Ukraine. Russia,\u201d enumerated Valentyn Mytyayev, head of international trade for the vineyard, as he walked among the cellar\u2019s 971,000 bottles.\u201cLook! Revolution. Civil War. World War,\u201d he said, pointing out significant dates from Russian and world history: 1905, 1917 and 1944. \u201cWe were working all the time through history.\u201dWith Russia\u2019s sudden annexation of Crimea in March, the winery has changed hands once more, lost to the Ukrainian government and regained by Moscow. The one constant, Mr. Mytyayev noted, is that Crimea\u2019s average 300 sunny days per year produce a steady harvest of sweet grapes.Agriculture is a crucial sector that the Kremlin hopes to rejuvenate to make Crimea an economic success story under Russian tutelage. The new administration hopes to exploit the wine industry not least to draw more tourists, blaming Ukraine for neglecting both when it ran Crimea.\u201cThank God it has not been completely ruined within these 23 years,\u201d said Yelena Yurchenko, Crimea\u2019s minister of tourism and resorts, speaking of viniculture. \u201cOf course it would be in better shape if there had been investments in this field.\u201dActually, while much of Crimea was bemoaning empty hotel rooms and a scant number of tourists, the bedrock of the economy, the team at Massandra was in a buoyant mood. Wines flew off the shelves at their three local stores last month, on track to double the sales volume from last year, they said.The winery attributed the increase to many first-time Russian visitors\u2019 eagerly snapping up potable souvenirs. The czar\u2019s former winery now caters more to those day-to-day visitors than to the elite, producing 10 million bottles a year. Winemaking in Crimea dates back more than 3,500 years, but the intense Black Sea sunshine means it is most known for sweet wines and sherry.Massandra has been considered a little bit apart ever since its inception. It was popular among members of the artistic high society who summered near the czar. Anton Chekhov brought friends there from his nearby villa. Nationalized in 1922, after the Russian Revolution, it remained a popular draw. Maxim Gorky penned a tribute that was carved into a metal plaque on the wall. But no one is quite sure who visited before World War II, because the Nazi occupiers made off with the guest book.A special 1936 law that preserves the cellars under state protection remains in effect. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as the Communist Party\u2019s general secretary, started an anti-alcohol campaign in the late 1980s, vineyards all over Russia were uprooted. But Massandra was spared.\u201cMassandra is a different country, like the Vatican in Italy,\u201d said Nikolay Boyko, the director general of Massandra for the past 27 years. \u201cWe live according to our own laws and regulations.\u201dWinery workers made no secret of their joy at being back under Russian control, however. They painted the main forklift in the cellars with the colors of the Russian flag. Mr. Boyko said he could not speculate on the fallout from Western sanctions imposed on Russia after annexation. The bulk of the winery\u2019s exports already went to Russia, anyway, and they will just have to endure this murky period as they have previous ones, he said.The management hopes that the uncertainty generated by events in Ukraine will not discourage far-flung collectors interested in its rare wines from the vineyard of the Romanovs. On one recent day, a buyer from London and one from Moscow were expected for lunch. Mr. Boyko said he considered their visit an encouraging sign that the winery\u2019s historical appeal was enduring.The winery has occasionally sold off bottles at international auctions. One of its oldest, a Spanish sherry De La Frontera from 1775, fetched around $50,000 at a Sotheby\u2019s auction in 2001, Mr. Boyko said, noting that it was considered a bad year for sales.He described two attempts to give the wine as gifts to American presidents.In 1987, the office of the Soviet leader, Mr. Gorbachev, called, asking for bottles of wine from 1911, the year of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s birth. Mr. Reagan was then visiting Moscow.One of the winemakers, Galena I. Mytyayev, carried them by hand aboard a plane to the Kremlin. (She is the mother of Mr. Mytyayev, the third generation to work at the vineyard. His great-grandfather moved to Crimea to supervise the water supply for the czar\u2019s palace.)Massandra waited for word from President Reagan, but none came. A Kremlin source later told them that the sommelier there had opened one of the bottles and decided not to give any to the president.\u201cBut we never found out whether it was because they were too good or too bad!\u201d Mr. Boyko said. \u201cThe wine never came back.\u201dMr. Boyko, on a visit to an Arkansas businessman who was planning to import Massandra wines to the United States in 1994, handed the man a bottle of a 1946 vintage as a present for Bill Clinton, then president. Again, he heard nothing back.For both Russia and Ukraine, Massandra wine has long been used to celebrate special occasions, and the winery has been an important destination for foreign dignitaries. The nearly two-inch thick book produced for its 115th anniversary showed pictures of visitors like Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia and numerous other luminaries of the Communist galaxy.In 1997, to honor the signing of the Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between Ukraine and Russia, the winery added bottles of Massandra sherry produced that year to its permanent collection.\u201cIt is still maturing,\u201d Mr. Mytyayev said.Advertisement"}

The monthly survey of households showed that the economy actually lost 73,000 jobs; the only reason the unemployment rate fell is because people dropped out of the labor force, no longer looking for work and thus not counted as officially unemployed.It\u2019s tempting to try to combine the two surveys into one neat package and claim that the economy added jobs, albeit not enough to bring people back into the labor force. But that\u2019s not right. If you believe the household survey, the economy lost jobs.

{"Headline": "Friends of Hillary", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy has gone through some tough times lately. But, happily, we still lead the world in the production of corn, soybeans, beef, cheese and stories about Hillary Clinton.Clinton has become famous in a unique, remarkable way. She\u2019s practically an organizing principle for the American consciousness. We see her everywhere. How could Barbara Walters have signed off from \u201cThe View\u201d this week without a drop-in from H.R.C. \u2014 who holds the record for multiple appearances on Walters\u2019 annual Most Fascinating People roundup? How could Gloria Steinem have celebrated her 80th birthday party without a video visit from the former first lady/senator/secretary of state? How could the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries have gotten through its Las Vegas convention without a Hillary speech?O.K., they had to pay her for the last one. But while she was there, somebody threw a shoe at her. At once, the nation had something new to talk about. People were trudging through their days amid dreary domestic headlines about crime, bad weather and congressional gridlock. Then suddenly it was \u2014 Hillary! Shoe! It\u2019s so interesting how interested we are in her. Of course, she\u2019s a potential presidential candidate. But she\u2019s also got the critical national role of being someone Americans all have in common. Ever since the industrial revolution, when Americans abandoned small-town life for anonymous cities, they\u2019ve bonded by talking about celebrities. In 1800, people chatted over their back fence about the neighbors. In 1900, the guys on the assembly line no longer shared mutual friends, but they all knew that boxing champion John L. Sullivan was a terrible drunk, and had opinions about singer Lillian Russell\u2019s generous figure. Today, the media\u2019s getting so fractured we don\u2019t even know the same famous people. We\u2019re long past the era when 100 million viewers would turn in to see how \u201cM*A*S*H\u201d turned out. There\u2019s still the Super Bowl, for which a large chunk of the country gathers around the TV in a touching show of faith that this is going to be the year when it isn\u2019t boring. But mainly we surf around for our own special favorite things \u2014 the Danish drama on Hulu, the Miley Cyrus video, the blog about \u201cHogs Gone Wild.\u201d Then on weekends we get together for a multigenerational dinner and talk about ... ourselves. Or the salad.Or Hillary. It must be an ungodly burden to be both the most important political figure outside the White House and perhaps the last great all-purpose celebrity on the map. She\u2019s so familiar she\u2019s like a family member \u2014 even to the political right, although in that case it\u2019s something along the lines of a wicked stepmother. Rush Limbaugh recently entertained the theory that Clinton had \u201cstaged or set up\u201d the shoe-throwing incident, although, really, if you were going to try to get attention with that kind of event, you\u2019d have picked someplace more elevating than the scrap recyclers.For the right, Clinton is responsible for nearly everything bad that occurs in the world, including the terrible kidnapping of the Nigerian schoolgirls \u2014 which happened either because Benghazi made us look weak (Laura Ingraham) or because the State Department never formally designated Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization. Also, Chelsea got pregnant because her mother wanted the positive press. Somewhere, right now someone is working on a story that will reveal that Hillary Clinton started the elevator fight between Jay-Z and his sister-in-law.Everybody \u2014 right, left and middle \u2014 is talking about her presidential candidacy even though we\u2019ve got more than two years before the presidential nominating convention. Karl Rove made headlines when he reportedly mused that Hillary might be able to conceal a \u201ctraumatic brain injury\u201d during a run for the White House. (His estimate that she had spent \u201c30 days\u201d in the hospital after a fall last year was a mere 26 days off.) But Rove was not really worried that the public would fail to take a look at the health issues of all the presidential candidates when the race really begins. He was just keenly aware that without Hillary gossip, he might be stuck analyzing the presidential prospects of the current Democratic field: Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. It\u2019s hard to imagine what it must feel like to belong to everybody in such an intimate way. There\u2019s no one else in the same situation. Barack Obama is universally known, but these days, if you have a conversation at the dinner table about him, the real topic is going to be something like health care or the unemployment rate. We\u2019re so aware of his enormous responsibilities, we\u2019ve sort of lost interest in Obama as a person. He may try to be diverting with the odd comment about sports or his dog, but, really, it doesn\u2019t work. This is why Hillary Clinton is going to run for the White House. She wants to be president so people will stop talking about her. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Great-Power Outage", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s aggressive play to bring at least eastern Ukraine inside Moscow\u2019s orbit has unveiled far more than his faith in threats and disinformation. It has opened a window on a dangerous confusion among the four leading power centers of the globe about what constitutes strategic power in 2014.As Russia defies its adversaries with military threats and fifth-column allies, a war-averse Western Europe clings to its commercial interests, hoping economic carrots can make Mr. Putin reasonable. The United States, long a global policeman but tired of the role, tries to keep Mr. Putin at bay with economic sticks, even as it pivots toward Asia. There, an economically expansive China poses new military risks to America\u2019s allies and business partners. In other words, each power center interprets the goals and instruments of international strategy \u2014 power politics or economic interdependence \u2014 differently. That makes resolving disputes more uncertain. And that\u2019s the danger. Can Russia carve up Ukraine without setting off civil war? Can Washington devise sanctions strong enough to impress Mr. Putin without plunging Europe into a depression? Will German bankers and French shipbuilders make sanctions toothless, letting Russian muscle insinuate itself outward toward the borders of the former Soviet Union? Will China, seeing America playing softer politics in Europe, overplay its hand in the jousting for small islands in the South China Sea? How would Japan, South Korea and others react?One matter seems certain: Europe is putting commercial interests above its security interests, and that puts it at odds with American policy. France\u2019s insistence on delivering two amphibious attack ships to Russia is just the sharp edge of the wedge Mr. Putin is driving between the Western allies. Americans have long complained that Europe is feckless in the face of security threats \u2014 that America has often cared more about European security than Europe does. These days, the Americans have a point. Europeans have more at stake in Ukraine \u2014 a neighbor \u2014 than America does, and they have 10 times more trade with Russia to use as leverage over Mr. Putin. But Europe, led by Germany, prefers indifference to action when it comes to the future of Ukraine. As menacing as Russian behavior in Ukraine may be, Europeans fear more that Russia could make their energy supplies uncertain and expensive, or close itself off from European exports and investments. Meanwhile, American strategy feeds European-Russian bonhomie. If there is an American grand strategy, it is to pivot attention to Asia, which could account for two-thirds of global gross domestic product by 2025. Hillary Rodham Clinton, while secretary of state, said the Asia-Pacific region was where the \u201cfuture of politics will be decided.\u201d President Obama underscored that message while visiting Asia, even as the Ukraine crisis unfolded. America\u2019s alliance with Europe was built not so much on strong commercial ties as on historical and cultural bonds and the imperative of a common front against security threats. But in pivoting to Asia, America has signaled that economic interests matter more now. Clearly, Mr. Putin does not see grand strategy that way. To America\u2019s bafflement, he is willing to sacrifice economic interests for old-fashioned power politics \u2014 grabbing territory and building spheres of influence. There is logic here. The Cold War ended with Russia deep in shame \u2014 its economy hollowed out, except for vast energy reservoirs, and its imperial reach lost. If Mr. Putin cannot give his people European-level prosperity, perhaps he can give them pride as a nation still to be feared. China, too, seems to be setting aside economic calculations, to a degree. Hegemonic moves might hurt its pre-eminent imperative of sustaining high growth rates. But China has focused for so long on economics that perhaps it now thinks it can afford to change its strategy. Whatever the reasoning, the change confuses American policy, which is only now fully embracing economics as its own strategic compass in Asia. In other words, many of America\u2019s troubles with Russia and China stem from the dissonance between America\u2019s wish to let economics drive foreign policy and America\u2019s need to confront those powers\u2019 embrace of old-fashioned strategic posturing. Ironically, it is Europe that most shares America\u2019s new faith in economics as the essence of geostrategy, but it is America\u2019s shrinking interest in Europe that tempts Russia to think it can divide the Atlantic alliance. In that situation, it\u2019s understandable that Europe would want to preserve the marriage of Europe\u2019s technology and manufacturing with Russian gas, oil and finance. Europe is not comfortable with Mr. Putin\u2019s assertion of Russian prerogatives in lands once ruled by czars, and one day Mr. Putin may go too far, compelling Europe to stiffen its stance. But for now, Ukraine\u2019s future does not worry Europe enough to demand that Russia change its strategic vision.Which again brings up the matter of danger. America may not see Ukraine as central to its national interest today, but eventually Russian aggression, hiding behind European acquiescence, would challenge America\u2019s broader interest in a peaceful Europe. And America can contain Russia only with Europe\u2019s help.This is not the time to pivot to Asia so completely that it makes Europe reluctant to follow America\u2019s lead in facing up to Mr. Putin\u2019s challenges. Advocates for an Asia pivot should look at it this way: Russia is an Asian power, too, as shown by its 30-year deal this week to sell gas to China. And an emboldened Russia would play a larger role in Korea and in the balance of power between China and Japan. So even in the Pacific, America has a deep interest in managing Russian ambitions \u2014 an interest that now demands a rebalancing of American foreign policy, back to paying primary attention to Europe.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Cuernavaca, Mexico", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateA peach-colored Mexican colonial in Cuernavaca, Mexico, created by one of the city\u2019s most distinctive architectural designers, Rodolfo Ayala, is on the market for $1.03 million.A MEXICAN COLONIAL-STYLE HOME WITH POOL IN CUERNAVACA$1.03 MILLION (13.5 MILLION PESOS)This nine-bedroom Mexican colonial home in Cuernavaca, Mexico, was created by one of the city\u2019s most distinctive architectural designers, Rodolfo Ayala, in the late 1960s. With a peach-colored exterior and candy-green accents, the rambling 7,860-square-foot home, called Mabruka, contains all the hallmarks of the Mexican colonial style, such as solid brick-and-cement walls, heavy wooden ceiling beams, arches, columns, terra-cotta, glazed tiles, hand-carved conch-shell niches, moldings and stone sculptures.But the two-story home also has some of the signature touches of Mr. Ayala, such as soaring ceilings and a copious use of skylights, said Andrea Dolch Espinosa de los Monteros, a partner at Barbara Waugh Propiedades, which has the listing.The beveled-glass front doors open to a short flight of steps descending to Mabruka\u2019s main attraction, a spacious L-shaped terrace hugging a lush, split-level garden. The terrace, spanned by wooden beams suspended by gray stone pillars, has a powder room; a bar of white oak carved in geometric designs; a working fireplace of hand-carved stone; and several long, low built-in benches and tables. Sculptures of hard gray cantera, a Mexican stone, grace the terrace and the yard, which is landscaped with palm trees. An oval-shaped, 36-by-16-foot swimming pool is surrounded by a stone walkway, said Javier Mariscal Vega, one of Mabruka\u2019s owners.Off the terrace is a living room with an antique working fireplace and a bay window facing the garden. Four columns of hand-carved cantera bear a giant arch with a star skylight leading to the dining room, which also has round skylights of carved stone and recessed shelving topped with hand-carved conch shells. A bay window faces a small patio with a stone fountain. Abutting the dining room is a cavernous kitchen with a vaulted ceiling tiled in oyster white and a skylight, along with a butler\u2019s kitchen. The updated kitchen has wooden cabinetry, granite countertops, and three types of original hand-painted Mexican tiles, Ms. Dolch said.Also on the ground floor is a library; the master bedroom with a working fireplace, terrace and master bathroom; and a second bedroom with bathroom and private terrace. Most floors are terra-cotta or Saint Thomas marble, and doors are intricate hand-carved oak. Stairs with blue-and-gold tiled risers lead to the second floor, which has two bedrooms, one of which has a fireplace, sitting area and terrace. There is also a small kitchenette. In its service areas, Mabruka also has a total of five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a kitchen.Mabruka is in the Palmira neighborhood in Cuernavaca, a city of about 350,000 people, 45 miles south of Mexico City. Palmira, which is about a five-minute drive from Cuernavaca\u2019s center, is a largely residential area with sizable homes and grand estates behind solid stone walls, many of them on private streets. The city of Cuernavaca is highly popular with tourists, retirees and Spanish-language students because of its temperate weather and cultural and historic attractions. The drive to Mexico City\u2019s international airport typically takes an hour to 90 minutes.MARKET OVERVIEWMexico\u2019s housing market, which typically lags that of the United States by a few years, continues to stagnate after the global real estate crisis of 2008, while negative media attention about drug violence has also taken its toll, Ms. Dolch said. In particular, Cuernavaca\u2019s luxury sector, which includes homes priced at about $750,000 to $10 million, saw prices fall roughly 20 percent in the mortgage crisis. Highly dependent on the United States economy, that sector continues to flag.\u201cBut taking a more positive slant, it\u2019s definitely a buyer\u2019s market now,\u201d Ms. Dolch said. \u201cWhen you think of what you can get for $1 million in, say, Toronto, and what you can get here, there\u2019s no comparison.\u201dThere are recent signs that both the lower and higher ends of the housing market in Cuernavaca may be gaining traction, said Georgia Spencer, the owner-broker of Cuernavaca Real Estate.\u201cWe\u2019ve tended to cater to people looking for half-a-million-dollar homes, but most recently we\u2019ve been receiving requests of about $250,000,\u201d she said. \u201cThen again, we\u2019ve also noticed the market\u2019s picked up in the million-dollar range, and we see people looking for homes at $1 million and above.\u201dWHO BUYS IN CUERNAVACACuernavaca, where Mexico City\u2019s wealthy residents traditionally have second homes, was nicknamed the \u201ccity of the eternal spring\u201d in the 19th century. For many decades, the city\u2019s temperate climate and lush flora have attracted home buyers from the United States, Canada and Europe, though the global real estate crisis has thinned their ranks, Ms. Dolch said. Ms. Spencer said the most recent home buyers she has assisted were French, Venezuelan, American and Canadian.BUYING BASICSForeign home buyers face no restrictions in Mexico unless they want to purchase within 100 kilometers of the border or 50 kilometers of the coast, neither of which applies in Cuernavaca, brokers said. (For buyers facing that restriction, they must either set up a trust with a Mexican bank or create a Mexican company.)All foreign home buyers must obtain a permit from the Secretary of Exterior Relations, a one-day process that was recently made free, Ms. Spencer said.All property sales are handled by notaries in Mexico, which represent both buyer and seller, said Mr. Mariscal, an owner and a lawyer who works in a notary\u2019s office. While a buyer may use a private lawyer, it is not necessary. Typically, buyers pay as much as 7 percent of the home\u2019s sales price in municipal registration fees, notary fees and taxes, he said. The seller pays the real estate agent\u2019s fee of about 5 percent.Mortgages are available to foreign buyers but are typically not desired, as they typically have higher interest rates of 10 to 12.65 percent, Ms. Spencer said.WEB SITESSpanish; peso (1 peso = $0.08)TAXES AND FEESThe annual property taxes on this home are about 5,000 pesos, or about $382, but that is likely to change with the home\u2019s sale, Mr. Mariscal said.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Before Ink Dries on Army Rules, Soldiers Rush to Get Tattoos", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAKEWOOD, Wash. \u2014 An Army soldier walked into Brass Monkey Tattoo last month and told Dan Brewer, the tattoo artist, to go for it.The military tattoo has a deep history, with reports going back at least to the Roman legions, historians say. Images of adventure or battle \u2014 if not a haunting beauty from the frontiers of Gaul \u2014 could be captured forever on a bicep. Declarations of unit loyalty or individuality, or both, could be sealed through rituals of ink and pain.But now a tightening of the Army\u2019s regulations on the wear and appearance of uniforms and insignia \u2014 issued on March 31 with a 30-day window of unit-by-unit enforcement \u2014 have driven a land rush here and at other Army posts to get \u201ctatted,\u201d as soldiers call it, while the old rules still applied. About 40,000 active duty and reserve personnel are stationed at Lewis-McChord, about an hour south of Seattle, making it one of the United States military\u2019s largest bases.\u201cI\u2019m just going to let her do it until I can\u2019t take anymore,\u201d said Specialist Charles Chandler, 22, an Army infantryman, as he pulled up his left sleeve to show the canvas he planned to present to his tattoo artist this week.The new rules restrict total inkage on arms and legs visible on a soldier wearing short sleeves and short pants. They also limit the size of each visible tattoo to no bigger than the wearer\u2019s open hand. But the Army is also generally allowing soldiers to keep the tattoos they had before the effective date of the new rules, as long as they do not violate prohibitions on things like obscenity, racism or extremism, and are documented with a photograph before the deadline.Hence the rush to get inked. With some superior officers, many of them tattooed as well, giving ample warning as to when those photographs would be taken, soldiers said they have experienced a unique window of opportunity \u2014 but also, perhaps, a nudge \u2014 to get that next tattoo, or a lot of them.\u201cI would probably do it anyway; I\u2019ll just do it sooner,\u201d said Sgt. Ray Stevens, who came after work on Monday to Aces-n-Eights Tattoo and Piercing here in Lakewood for some work on his left forearm. \u201cI like getting tattoos,\u201d said Sergeant Stevens, who is originally from Portland, Me.Tattoo artists like Tyrell Barbour, at Stay Fresh Tattoos on Lakewood\u2019s main commercial drag, Bridgeport Way, said they had never seen such fat times. \u201cI\u2019m getting hit like no tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially younger military, but a lot of superiors, too,\u201d he added.Military regulation of tattoos, or at least the attempt, is not new. Shortly before World War I, military authorities tried to reign in wayward ink with a prohibition on \u201cindecent or obscene\u201d tattoos \u2014 mostly naked women in those days \u2014 but allowed existing depictions to be altered to meet the new rule, which led to many a discreet grass skirt as cover-up.The Navy updated its tattoo policies again in 2003, and again in 2006, and with a further update in 2010 \u2014 nodding to the modern military of men and women serving together \u2014 that tweaks the rules on so-called permanent makeup tattoos, allowed for eyebrows, eyeliner, lipstick and lip liner.\u201cPermanent makeup shall be in good taste,\u201d the Navy\u2019s regulations say.The Marines tightened their personal grooming and appearance regulations in 2010, the Air Force in 2012. All four main military branches prohibit tattoos around the neck. No person with what is called a sleeve \u2014 or fully tattooed arm \u2014 can become a Marine.\u201cPeople who are in situations of depersonalization, whether it\u2019s wearing uniforms, or other ways stripped of the ability to assert their identity, tend to react to this depersonalization by getting tattoos,\u201d said Dr. Friedman, who is heavily tattooed herself.Prisoners, chefs and athletes are in much the same boat, she believes \u2014 all straining to declare difference to a community, or a marketplace, that might other otherwise have a hard time telling them apart.The tattoo economy on the edge of Lewis-McChord is bracing for change, too. Mr. Brewer at Brass Monkey, where about 80 percent of the business is military, said the shop\u2019s owner was anticipating a big drop in customers after the regulations are fully in place, and is planning a move to Tacoma, about 10 miles north, to be nearer the city\u2019s night life and bar scene.But at South Tacoma Tattoo, just a few blocks away, the tattoo artists said they thought there would be still plenty of skin left to decorate when things quieted down. The new rules do not say anything about chests and backs and other parts of the body always covered by a uniform, they said.And Specialist Chandler, the infantryman who was planning out his arm art this week, said he was also studying the rules carefully as to what might push the boundaries of content and good taste. Regardless of the timing question on getting tattooed now, he said, he wants to re-enlist in a few years and does not want any overly racy skin art to hold him back.So the girl he plans on his arm will be clothed. \u201cA pinup girl, to stay in the regs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to adapt to the Army \u2014 the Army doesn\u2019t adapt to you.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manzur's Lonely End", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of my father\u2019s older brothers, Manzur Anam, died last week. He was in his early 70s, and though the medical reasons for his death were many, it was loneliness that killed him.There is a prevailing sense that the old in places like Bangladesh age with their large extended families around them, and that age gives them power, respect and status. It is in the West, we have been told, where they disrespect their elders and abandon them to nursing homes. But while the aging population in Bangladesh may have enjoyed some measure of security in the past, dramatic changes in the social fabric \u2014 rapid urbanization, mass migration and a focus on the nuclear family \u2014 have heralded a transformation in the way we regard and treat our old.My uncle lived in Dhaka\u2019s modern architectural convention: the apartment building built on the site of an old family estate. He came home from work every day and sat on one corner of his 1950s green sofa and ate dinner in front of the television. On Fridays, he played a regular poker game he\u2019d begun with friends 40 years ago.In the servants\u2019 quarters lived his housekeeper, Lucky, a young woman who looked after him with efficiency and tenderness in his last days (he was estranged from both his wife and his son). In the rest of the apartment building were the extended family \u2014 the sons of my father\u2019s other three brothers, and their wives and children. His nephews (my cousins) dutifully kept vigil at his bedside through several long illnesses.Yet, there was no one, in the end, to hear my uncle cry out when he fell from his bed. It was Lucky who discovered him the morning after his stroke, lying helpless on the floor where he\u2019d fallen.Bangladesh self-identifies as a young country with an old culture. The nation itself is only 43 years old; we refer to ourselves as a young democracy, an emerging economy, a nascent political culture.We still revere the old in the ways we always have, by referring to an old person as the head of the family. As the eldest man of his generation, we treated my uncle like the patriarch he was.Yet he aged alone and out of sight. This is because while the aging body as a symbol retains power, the aging individual is more and more a person whom it is possible to neglect. He is relegated to his subdivision of the family property, his illness sanitized by the new hospitals we are grateful to have throughout the city, his solitary life witnessed only by the people paid to look after him.For Bangladeshis like me, living far from home, the question of what will happen to our aging parents is a pressing one. For the hundreds of thousands of migrants who leave Bangladesh every year to work abroad, there are parents who are left behind, often to look after grandchildren. Those families back home are the ones who have to cope with the alienation of being left behind.What is pressing for a middle-class family is all the more challenging for a poor one. In \u201cdevelopment speak,\u201d there is a category of people in Bangladesh who are referred to as the ultra poor \u2014 the bottom 10 percent, who live without income or resources. The old and the disabled make up a disproportionate number of the ultra poor; even the aid packages designed to help them are sometimes ill-suited to their needs. There are means-tested state pension programs for older people in Bangladesh, but bureaucracy and poor access mean that enrollment is far lower than it should be.For Bangladesh to address the impending demographic shift, we must first admit that we are no longer a society that has automatic safety nets for the old, that the fantasy of better aging is just that \u2014 a fantasy rooted in our denial of how old people are actually treated. We must then go about the hard work of creating new systems that address the challenges we are about to face.We need better nursing care, more palliative care in hospitals, and national health care initiatives aimed at the older population. Development programs and nationally funded pension plans must be made more accessible. Most important, we need to help older people form their own communities in order to reduce the crippling loneliness and isolation of aging.My uncle\u2019s funeral, or qulkhwani, was attended by more than 300 people. Friends and colleagues commented on his sense of humor: It appeared that he had laughed with his friends when they told stories of their happier, fuller families, hiding the shame of his own isolation behind a quick wit and a ready smile. Few were privy to the reality of his last days.\u201cIt is ironic,\u201d my mother wrote to me, later that day, \u201cthat a man so beloved should have died alone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hopes of a Generation Ride on Indian Vote", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "Advertisement\nSix months ago, when India\u2019s national elections were still only a shape on the horizon, I stood on a service road in New Delhi, listening to an auto-rickshaw driver speak about the state of the country.I had already filled most of a notebook with the grievances of auto-rickshaw drivers, which mostly had to do with police constables and traffic tickets, but there was something unusual and a bit ferocious about what this man was saying; for one thing, his complaint was not specific to auto-rickshaw drivers, or even to the working poor. It sounded like the complaint of a generic citizen.\u201cCongress has been in power since independence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey say all the right things, but look at the condition of the country \u2014 other countries have come much farther in the last 60 years. Why don\u2019t we have better medical facilities, educational facilities, roads? Why? Who is answerable for this?\u201dIn the months that followed, I heard versions of these questions in villages, in dusty cantonment towns, in the hybrid spillover communities at the edges of great cities.This is vast, churning, aspirational India. Farmers I met in the state of Andhra Pradesh were spending every last rupee they earned, or incurring terrible debts, to send their children to private schools advertised on billboards on the highway in the hopes that they would somehow end up with an office job \u2014 anything, really, other than farming. Young men were staking their hopes on software courses at fly-by-night colleges, hoping for something better than work at a call center. They all seemed poised to take a leap, but had no idea where they were leaping to.Many of these people wound up at the rallies of Narendra Modi, the candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The gatherings began like small-town carnivals, as streams of young men in jeans and T-shirts emerged from alleyways and jogged down the road together. Mr. Modi opens his speeches with words of soft affection for his followers, and there were times that his punishing schedule could be seen in his drained face and rumpled clothes, but he gathered strength from the sea of faces tilted up at him, like a battery recharging, and the rallies would finish as a livid, roaring attack on the status quo.This was not the fight that the Indian National Congress had prepared for, after presiding over a decade of rising incomes. Last fall, when I visited Ajay Maken, one of the party\u2019s senior leaders, in his handsome government-issued British colonial bungalow in New Delhi, he sounded serenely confident about the message that the party would take to voters. It was not a message based on airy promises for the future, he explained, but on concrete things that Congress had already done for \u201cthe poorest of the poor.\u201dMr. Maken was talking about major pieces of legislation, the most ambitious a food subsidy bill that established a legal right to food for most of India\u2019s population, and could cost the budget as much as $20 billion annually. That bill, pushed through Parliament at the tail end of the Congress-led coalition government\u2019s five-year term, had been seen by many as an electoral juggernaut, guaranteeing the votes of the 148 million people who live below the poverty line.Why did that not work? One reason is that India\u2019s poor have themselves changed, adopting attitudes and concerns long associated with the middle class. Indians are moving to cities in huge numbers; but even those who remain in villages, surfing the Internet on cheap smartphones, are drawing closer to the way city-dwellers think. Dilapidated infrastructure that they have long tolerated now seems intolerable. They want jobs.\u201cThe Congress remembers us during elections and gives the poor a crutch,\u201d a driver in Varanasi said to one of my colleagues. \u201cBut we want to stand on our own feet.\u201dFor generations, Congress politicians have focused heavily on the rural electorate, in part because a 30-year freeze on redistricting kept the number of urban constituencies artificially low, said K.C. Sivaramakrishnan, co-author of \u201cA Handbook of Urbanization in India.\u201d\u201cThere is a certain political attitude which has been there for a long time \u2014 that rural is good, rural is simple, rural is plain, rural is beautiful,\u201d Mr. Sivaramakrishnan said, a belief that harks back to Mohandas K. Gandhi, who venerated villages as the ideal expression of human civilization.But this was an election when we also heard from the cities, places with tawny marble shopping malls, migrant families living under highway overpasses, and armies of tailors, blacksmiths, locksmiths, cobblers, drivers and maids. Urban voters have long been seen as an apathetic group.But that turned out not to be true at all: Early analysis shows that urban turnout in these elections shot up around 10 percentage points compared with 2009, going from 53 percent to 62 percent. It was even more pronounced in the smaller regional capitals whose populations have exploded in recent years. Turnout in Patna, the capital of Bihar State, increased by nearly 18 percentage points, and in Baroda, a large city in Gujarat, Mr. Modi\u2019s home state, by 22 points, Mr. Sivaramakrishnan said.The paradox for Congress is that it has lost some of the voters who prospered most during its decade in power. Take Gaurav, the auto-rickshaw driver, who had come to New Delhi from a farming village in Uttarakhand. He acknowledged that he was better off than his father, having acquired a cellphone, a television, and access to good hospitals.But he was not happy; on the contrary, he was madder and madder. The city\u2019s clogged roads had become such a frustration, Gaurav said, that when he stops in traffic his knuckles go white clenching the handlebar. When he overheard passengers speaking positively about Congress, he would stop his auto-rickshaw, claiming it was broken, and ask them to get out and walk. He was eager, even desperate, for some change that he could not quite explain.\u201cMy wish is to start something so I am not in this precarious situation \u2014 earning daily, eating daily,\u201d Gaurav, who uses one name, said. Ahead of state elections in December, he decided to throw his vote behind Arvind Kejriwal, the firebrand leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, which grew out of mass protests against corruption.In the end, though, it was Mr. Modi who managed to connect with this aspirational India. He did this in part by proudly holding up his own humble origins as the son of a tea vendor \u2014 mostly omitting the Hindu nationalist organization that shaped him profoundly \u2014 and by heaping disdain on the aristocratic Nehru-Gandhi family and the elites who surround it.

{"Headline": "President Obama and the World", "Date": "2014-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialTwo years after winning an election in which foreign policy was barely mentioned, President Obama is being pummeled at home and abroad for his international leadership. The world sometimes seems as if it is flying apart, with Mr. Obama unable to fix it. Through a combination of a few significant missteps, circumstances beyond his control, unreasonable expectations and his maddeningly bland demeanor, Mr. Obama has opened himself to criticism that he is not articulating a strong, overarching blueprint for the exercise of American power and has not been able to bend authoritarian leaders to his will.It is paradoxical that, in key respects, Mr. Obama is precisely the kind of foreign policy president most Americans and their allies overseas wanted. He rejected the shoot-first tendencies of George W. Bush, who pretended to have all the answers, bungled two wars and asserted an in-your-face American exceptionalism that included bullying allies. We know where that got us.But Mr. Obama has long been fully responsible for his own foreign policy. While he has made mistakes, and can be frustratingly cautious, he has done a better job than his detractors allow, starting with salvaging an economy that is at the core of American power. He has produced the first possibility of a deal on Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons. Even though shrinking budgets and a public that is tired of war and unconvinced of the need for international engagement have undoubtedly put a check on his ambitions, talk of America shrinking from the world is overblown.Still, too often, Mr. Obama\u2019s ambitions seem in question. It does not feel as if he is exercising sufficient American leadership and power, even if he is in fact working to solve a problem. Some analysts have suggested he lacks a passion for foreign policy. Others say he has no inspiring ideological prism through which the world can understand his choices. Others say he is too resigned to the obstacles that prevent the United States from being able to control world events as easily as it may once have done. These criticisms have some truth to them, and Mr. Obama sometimes makes things worse when he deigns to explain himself. What follows is an examination of some of the world\u2019s problems, the areas where Mr. Obama has done well, and the areas where he has stumbled.It is tempting to dismiss criticism from right-wing Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz, who knows little about foreign policy; from Senator John McCain, who knows quite a lot but advocates a military response to almost every crisis; and from former Bush officials. They have an interest in seeing this president fail. It was disquieting to hear some Republicans speak almost admiringly about Vladimir Putin\u2019s macho boldness when the Russian president invaded Crimea. There was a time when both political parties saw real value in cooperating to advance America\u2019s security interests, and the country was better for it.But there is also powerful criticism from Democrats, liberals and centrists, who fault Mr. Obama\u2019s handling of Syria (some want airstrikes, some want more weapons for rebels) and Ukraine (many want weapons for the government). His critics are inconsistent in their philosophies and have failed to offer cogent alternatives to Mr. Obama\u2019s policies. But the perception \u2014 of weakness, dithering, inaction, there are many names for it \u2014 has indisputably had a negative effect on Mr. Obama\u2019s global standing.He has asserted the right to order the killing even of Americans who plot against this country abroad. In Asia on April 24, he gave assurances that America\u2019s treaty commitments to Japan included defending islands disputed with China. Accusations that he is soft on terrorism are simply without merit. In fact, his policies are too similar to his predecessor\u2019s for our comfort.Suggestions from the right that Mr. Obama should somehow use the military, or at least the threat of it, against Russia over Ukraine are irresponsible, to put it politely. Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to work with Europe on tougher sanctions have the best chance of restraining Russia.Taken as a whole and stripped as much as possible of ideological blinkers, Mr. Obama\u2019s record on foreign policy is not as bad as his critics say. It\u2019s just not good enough.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Buoyed by Exports, Portugal Chooses Clean Exit From Bailout", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLISBON \u2014 Portugal on Sunday announced its exit from a three-year bailout program that has forced deep spending cuts and set off mass protests \u2014 but has also helped the country clean up its public finances and return to the bond markets after halving its budget deficit.Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said that Portugal had built up sufficient financial reserves to end the program on schedule and without requesting any additional line of credit from its European counterparts. Such a line of credit would have acted as a safety net if the country again struggled to meet its debt financing obligations.\u201cWith the recovery of our autonomy, Portugal will be on an equal footing with the other member states\u201d of the European Union, Mr. Passos Coelho said in a televised address on Sunday evening, flanked by his ministers. Recent economic data shows that Portugal is making a steady, albeit fragile, recovery, after emerging last year from recession. The economy is expected to grow more than 1 percent each of the next two years. Unemployment has fallen to 15.2 percent in the first quarter after peaking at 17.7 percent in early 2013.Portugal opted for a clean exit from the bailout program, following the example of Ireland last year. That means Lisbon will not ask lenders for a precautionary credit line, which could be tapped if the country\u2019s finances deteriorate and it needs more European rescue funding.After Mr. Passos Coelho\u2019s announcement, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said in a statement that \u201calthough uncertainties and challenges remain, Portugal is now in a strong position to complete the consolidation of public finances and further deepen structural reforms, which will be essential to achieve sustainable growth and job creation.\u201dEuropean finance ministers are also expected to endorse Portugal\u2019s exit during a two-day meeting that starts on Monday. Mr. Passos Coelho said Portugal had rebuilt sufficient reserves to protect itself against any financial market shock in the coming year.Portugal had returned to bond markets even before the exit was announced. In April, Portugal issued \u20ac750 million worth of 10-year government bonds in the first such offering since the bailout started in 2011. The bonds were sold with an average yield of 3.575 percent, the lowest interest rate Portugal has ever received for 10-year debt. Mr. Passos Coelho said at the time that the auction \u201cgives us confidence in the future.\u201dSuch confidence, however, comes with caveats, particularly regarding debt levels. Government debt has climbed to 129 percent of gross domestic product, from 94 percent at the end of 2010, when borrowing costs began to spiral out of control, eventually forcing Lisbon to request a bailout. And even though Portugal is officially exiting the program on May 17, international creditors will continue to monitor its finances. Under the current redemption schedule, Portugal is set to repay its last loan to the I.M.F. in 2024 and its last European loan in 2042.\u201cHigh levels of indebtedness in the economy, combined with continued high financing costs in a low-inflation environment, underscore the need for decisive measures to reduce corporate debt\u201d and associated risk premiums, the international lenders cautioned in their review statement on Friday.Many economists say that Portugal\u2019s turnaround \u2014 partly the result of booming exports, which have helped the country rebalance its trade \u2014 stands out when compared with progress in other ailing euro zone economies.\u201cI think Portugal did the right things,\u201d said Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank. \u201cIts outlook is much brighter than that of Greece.\u201dIn their review of Portugal\u2019s progress, the international lenders noted that \u201cexports continue to drive economic growth, while private investment and consumption have also started to pick up.\u201dThe lenders also forecast a further decline in unemployment. The jobless rate is still about three percentage points higher it was than before the bailout.In 2011, Portugal became the third euro economy to negotiate an international bailout \u2014 following Greece and Ireland \u2014 after the then-Socialist government found itself struggling to meet its debt payments amid soaring borrowing costs. A month later, the Socialists were ousted in a general election and replaced by a center-right coalition government led by Mr. Passos Coelho, which has since enacted deeply unpopular spending cuts and tax increases to comply with the bailout conditions. With Portugal set to hold its next general election in 2015, Mr. Passos Coelho on Sunday urged the Socialists and other opposition parties to help create \u201cnational consensus\u201d to keep Portugal\u2019s fledgling recovery on track. Mr. Passos Coelho said the country was emerging from a period of \u201cnational emergency.\u201dBut in a separate televised address on Sunday night, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro, the Socialists\u2019 leader, accused the government of deceiving the Portuguese about the scale of the country\u2019s turnaround. \u201cThe program is finishing, but the austerity and sacrifices continue,\u201d he said.Portugal\u2019s return to bond markets is part of a broader global shift: Borrowing costs for European countries have fallen as investors move out of emerging markets like Russia and Turkey.Spain has also benefited from this trend. Recent debt offerings by the Spanish treasury have offered much lower interest rates. On Friday, yields on Spanish 10-year government bonds fell to 2.97 percent, matching the intraday record low set in 2005. Greece, which is still receiving an international helping hand, also managed to return to the bond markets in April, selling \u20ac3 billion in bonds with a yield of about 4.75 percent. It was the country\u2019s first sale of sovereign debt in four years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Everyone Wants to Be a Homeowner. Why Not a Foodowner?", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPerverse IncentivesImagine if we bought food the way we buy housing.Instead of buying the food you need right now, you would buy a contract giving you rights to a stream of food in perpetuity. Say, a contract entitling you to five pounds of chicken breasts, delivered to you every week, forever. That\u2019s basically what buying a home is: securing the use of a residence, indefinitely.Buying that stream of future food would be expensive, so you\u2019d get a loan from a bank to cover most of the cost, secured by your interest in those future chicken breasts. And if for some reason you didn\u2019t need your chicken contract anymore (you became a vegetarian or you moved out of the delivery range of your chicken supplier), you could sell the contract at the current market price.With this system, perverse things would begin to happen. Normally, consumers prefer that food prices be low. But this practice would create a large constituency of foodowners, who would benefit from rising food prices: If you bought your chicken contract for $20,000, and rising chicken prices pushed its value to $40,000, you\u2019d have a nice windfall.Foodowners would eagerly support government policies that restrict the production of food because that would push up prices. And they might reap windfalls from rising prices without selling their contracts: They could refinance, cashing out the equity in their appreciated food contracts to spend on caviar and cr\u00eame br\u00f9l\u00e9e contracts, or on nonfood items.People might start buying contracts on food they don\u2019t even want to eat in hopes of selling later at a profit. That might lead to a food bubble. And if food prices crashed, a lot of highly leveraged foodowners would end up in bankruptcy.That would all be pretty stupid. But it would all seem perfectly normal, as it very closely mirrors the way we approach housing. Housing exists so people can use it. But because housing consumers tend to take long-range equity interests in housing, they come to view housing as an investment, which distorts the housing market in the directions of restricted supply, inflated prices and speculation.And because home equity is often the dominant form of investment for a middle-class family, people bet their economic fortunes on the residential real estate market where they live, rather than making the less volatile bet on the overall condition of the economy that comes from a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds.You might object that home prices are not more volatile than the stock market. But the relevant issue here is the equity in a home with a mortgage on it; a 20 percent decline in home prices may wipe out the equity interest entirely, making it a riskier bet than buying stocks.I will grant that there are some advantages of homeownership. Owning offers people a sense of security, as well as the freedom to customize their residences as they see fit. Those are perfectly good reasons to buy a home as a consumption good; it is not a justification for homes (or chicken breasts) as investments.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Rescue That Worked, but Left a Troubled Economy", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDebate That DividesAs the officials debated how to help, Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, expressed alarm that the planned public statement said nothing about the risk of inflation. \u201cDid I miss something?\u201d he asked in a derisive tone, as Timothy Geithner recalls in his new memoir.\u201cNo,\u201d Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said simply.Yet Mr. Lacker said something else during that meeting that looks more prescient \u2013 a concern Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner and other crisis fighters of the last seven years have never successfully addressed: \u201cWe could easily be portrayed as helping banks make a lot of money on this.\u201dI\u2019m wary of the notion that both sides have a point. It\u2019s too easy a position to take. In this case, though, it happens to be accurate, and it\u2019s accurate in a way that often gets lost in the shouting. The financial rescue of 2008 and 2009 was both deeply impressive and deeply insufficient in fixing our economy\u2019s problems.The standard argument from populist critics of Mr. Geithner, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bernanke is that they should have let more banks fail. Rather than bailing out A.I.G., Bank of America and Citigroup, rather than shoring up Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, Washington could have let them pay for their sins. The executives and traders at these firms would then have suffered far more than they did.They almost certainly would have, but so would have the rest of the economy. Just consider the global chaos that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the only big firm left to die without federal help, and remember that many other banks were bigger than Lehman.The administration instead forced banks to shore up their balance sheets, by raising private capital or accepting government loans. Within weeks of these programs going into place in the spring of 2009, the crisis began to recede. Critics predicted trillion-dollar bailout bills and zombie banks that would haunt the economy for years. Amazingly, the federal government\u2019s various rescue efforts, like the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, have made money.Mr. Geithner, who spent 2008 at the New York Fed and nearly all of 2009 as Treasury secretary, and his colleagues are justifiably proud of their record. Listen carefully to their recitation of it, though, and you\u2019ll notice something: It relies mostly on economic statistics (like G.D.P. and industrial production) that only indirectly describe people\u2019s living standards. The picture isn\u2019t nearly as bright when you look at incomes or jobs.Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, famously said, \u201cNever let a serious crisis go to waste\u201d (a line Mr. Geithner quotes in the book). By that standard, the rescuers were not nearly so successful. To read the early histories of this crisis is to be struck by how little it seems to have reordered the economy.Something about the American economy has changed in the last 15 years. The usual measures of economic health no longer translate into rising living standards as directly as they once did. The financial crisis offered an opportunity to change this dynamic. And Mr. Obama and his team left no doubt that they sought to do so, including through the 2010 financial regulation law that Mr. Geithner shaped.In his book, Mr. Geithner describes his feelings in the summer of 2009, as the success of the rescue programs was becoming clear: \u201cBut the primary goal of our financial engineering had always been to revive the broader economy, and times were still very tough on Main Street. We could see early signs of economic growth in the data, but people weren\u2019t feeling it on the ground.\u201dMany still aren\u2019t, five years later. The response to the worst financial crisis in 70 years was more effective than its critics, and most Americans, believe. It was also less ambitious than its architects acknowledge.The Upshot presents news, analysis and graphics about politics and policy. Online, Timothy Geithner talks about which charts he included in his book and why.\nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentine Official to Be Questioned Over Link to Firm That Prints Money", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina\u2019s vice president was ordered Friday to respond to accusations that he had abused his power to gain control of the company that prints the nation\u2019s currency.Judge Ariel Lijo ruled that there was enough evidence to merit formally questioning Vice President Amado Boudou about his role in the case, in which secret partners and shell companies have been accused of receiving tax exemptions and lucrative government contracts after buying the bankrupt Ciccone Calcogr\u00e1fica printing company at a cut-rate price. The printer, renamed the Compania de Valores Sudamericana, also produced campaign material during President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s re-election bid in 2011 with Mr. Boudou as her running mate.Mr. Boudou is the first sitting vice president since Argentina emerged from military dictatorship in 1983 to be ordered to stand for questioning in criminal court, constitutional experts said. Mr. Boudou dismissed calls for his resignation, saying he had done nothing improper. \u201cI swear, I sustain and I will demonstrate that I did not commit acts of corruption,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m very calm,\u201d Mr. Boudou said in one of several interviews with local radio stations after the judge\u2019s ruling was announced. \u201cThis is an important step because I\u2019m going to prove my innocence.\u201dAfter Mr. Boudou is questioned next month, the judge could either dismiss the case or proceed with formal criminal charges that could carry a maximum of six years in prison and a lifetime ban from elective office.A federal prosecutor told the judge that evidence supported allegations of influence trafficking by Mr. Boudou, who has been accused of using his power as economy minister and then vice president to smooth the printing company\u2019s exit from bankruptcy.Members of the Ciccone family said Mr. Boudou had been personally involved in negotiations that persuaded them to sell the printing company. He has denied participating in the meetings or knowing other key participants, but testimony by witnesses and documents presented to the judge suggested Mr. Boudou was involved.Jorge Capitanich, the cabinet chief, dismissed the investigation as politically motivated, noting that the judge scheduled the hearing for July 15. The date coincides with a possible trip by Mrs. Kirchner to an economic conference in Brazil; Mr. Boudou would be named acting president in her absence. Mr. Capitanich, however, said the government respected the authority of the court and praised the vice president\u2019s willingness to cooperate.The judge also ordered testimony from Mr. Boudou\u2019s longtime friend and business partner, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona; Alejandro Vandenbroele, a businessman who allegedly acted as Mr. Boudou\u2019s secret proxy; a top tax agency official, Rafael Resnick Brenner; and two of the printing company\u2019s executives, the co-founder Nicol\u00e1s Ciccone and his son-in-law, Guillermo Reinwick.The judge wrote that evidence suggests that Mr. Boudou and Mr. N\u00fa\u00f1ez Carmona acquired the bankrupt company, which operates Argentina\u2019s only currency printing factory. The judge also said Mr. Boudou\u2019s intervention appeared to influence the tax agency\u2019s decision to grant the company an illegal exemption, effectively erasing its debts by enabling it to pay back taxes at below-market interest rates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Secret Success", "Date": "2014-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat? You haven\u2019t heard about that? Well, that\u2019s not too surprising. European economies, France in particular, get very bad press in America. Our political discourse is dominated by reverse Robin-Hoodism \u2014 the belief that economic success depends on being nice to the rich, who won\u2019t create jobs if they are heavily taxed, and nasty to ordinary workers, who won\u2019t accept jobs unless they have no alternative. And according to this ideology, Europe \u2014 with its high taxes and generous welfare states \u2014 does everything wrong. So Europe\u2019s economic system must be collapsing, and a lot of reporting simply states the postulated collapse as a fact.The reality, however, is very different. Yes, Southern Europe is experiencing an economic crisis thanks to that money muddle. But Northern European nations, France included, have done far better than most Americans realize. In particular, here\u2019s a startling, little-known fact: French adults in their prime working years (25 to 54) are substantially more likely to have jobs than their U.S. counterparts.Now, young French citizens are still a lot less likely to have jobs than their American counterparts \u2014 but a large part of that difference reflects the fact that France provides much more aid to students, so that they don\u2019t have to work their way through school. Is that a bad thing? Also, the French take more vacations and retire earlier than we do, and you can argue that the incentives for early retirement in particular are too generous. But on the core issue of providing jobs for people who really should be working, at this point old Europe is beating us hands down despite social benefits and regulations that, according to free-market ideologues, should be hugely job-destroying.I\u2019m sure that many people will simply refuse to believe what I\u2019m saying about European strengths. After all, ever since the euro crisis broke out there has been a relentless campaign by American conservatives (and quite a few Europeans too) to portray it as a story of collapsing welfare states, brought low by misguided concerns about social justice. And they keep saying that even though some of the strongest economies in Europe, like Germany, have welfare states whose generosity exceeds the wildest dreams of U.S. liberals.But macroeconomics, as I keep trying to tell people, isn\u2019t a morality play, where virtue is always rewarded and vice always punished. On the contrary, severe financial crises and depressions can happen to economies that are fundamentally very strong, like the United States in 1929. The policy mistakes that created the euro crisis \u2014 mainly creating a unified currency without the kind of banking and fiscal union that a single currency demands \u2014 basically had nothing to do with the welfare state, one way or another.The truth is that European-style welfare states have proved more resilient, more successful at job creation, than is allowed for in America\u2019s prevailing economic philosophy.Advertisement"}

Such assertions and other claims in the East China Sea have raised fears throughout the region, where many countries contend that portions of the strategic and resource-rich waters are theirs.In Vietnam, with its history of occupation, the move was seen as nothing short of a challenge to the country\u2019s sovereignty, inflaming its prickly patriotism.The government, which critics say has a record of using such sentiments when politically convenient, let loose the press to cover the controversy, and television featured tirades against China. Then officials took the unusual step of allowing the press to cover peaceful protests.The first protests in city centers were peaceful and generated colorful photos of seas of flag-waving Vietnamese. But analysts say the government was unprepared for what followed, as workers near Ho Chi Minh City and then here in Ha Tinh began turning on foreign-owned factories. Scores of buildings were razed or badly damaged, burned by the marauding crowds.The government arrested more than 400 people and issued anxious statements about the loss of business. But the authoritarian government may have an easier time stopping the protests than quelling the anger that coalesced around the rig. China itself has learned a similar lesson in recent years, when protests against Japan over a maritime dispute and other controversies that were initially tolerated spiraled into attacks on Japanese factories and offices. Managing nationalist sentiments in this case may be especially difficult because Vietnam\u2019s relationship with China is so complex. The Chinese helped Vietnamese revolutionaries fighting the French, and Beijing has often served as a model for socialist policies. But China has also often been viewed as an aggressor, with its last war with Vietnam starting as recently as 1979.These days neither the Chinese nor the Vietnamese government likes to discuss that war, which was prompted by Vietnam\u2019s invasion of Cambodia and claimed thousands of lives. But for years after the hostilities, the Vietnamese Communist Party carried out a propaganda campaign against China that \u201cfeatured extremely harsh, racist language and imagery,\u201d according to Peter B. Zinoman, a professor of Vietnamese history at the University of California, Berkeley, who is currently in Hanoi.Many of today\u2019s adults were raised on that current of invective, even as the Vietnamese and Chinese Communist Parties patched up their differences and the governments sought to expand cross-border trade.China\u2019s economic and military rise has added to the conflicted feelings among many Vietnamese. Chinese investors and contractors have been part of a welcome flood of foreign investment in recent years. But critics of the Vietnamese government have maintained that some of those investments benefited party cadres in Vietnam while doing little to help the broader population.Still, China\u2019s decision to move the rig into position trespassed into one area that the government and its critics can agree on, analysts say.Earlier this year, Vietnamese newspapers broke with longstanding reticence about reporting on a military clash in 1974, when China seized control from South Vietnam of the southern Paracel Islands. The news had been avoided in part because of sensitivities of lionizing the South Vietnamese, but the recent news coverage included heroic portrayals of the struggle.By the time China moved the rig, anti-Chinese feelings were already at a slow boil.Vietnamese anger with China has \u201cspread from the elite of intellectuals and cadres to workers,\u201d said Carl A. Thayer, an emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia who studies Vietnamese politics. \u201cThis is new. This is populist pressure.\u201dAnalysts say the fact that the explosion of violence targeted businesses was evidence that the motivations went much deeper than nationalism, saying workers tapped into a well of resentment against low wages and against their own government.\u201cI think the anger that lies underneath this has just as much to do with corruption and incompetence in the government in Hanoi than in any resentment of China,\u201d said Mr. Templer, the expert on Vietnam. \u201cIt all adds up to a lot of anger and very few ways to channel that.\u201d But a number of workers insisted that their reasoning was simpler.\u201cOur complaint isn\u2019t about wages,\u201d Ho Van Hang said. \u201cIt\u2019s about China.\u201dChris Buckley reported from Ha Tinh Province, and Edward Wong from New York.

{"Headline": "Thomas Piketty Responds to Criticism of His Data", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncome InequalityThe short version: He doesn\u2019t give an inch.He argued that many of the things that The Financial Times identified as sloppy or arbitrary were in fact considered choices, which he explained in footnotes. Reasonable people might disagree with some of his choices of how to handle the data, he says. But even where there\u2019s room for debate, any reasonable changes to his methodology would be small and not alter the broad conclusions, he suggested.The part of the newspaper\u2019s critique that throws the most doubt on his overall conclusions is its argument that wealth inequality in Britain has risen much less than Mr. Piketty contends. For that, he has sharp words. He says the newspaper\u2019s analysis rests on apples-to-oranges comparisons of past data from tax returns mixed with current data from surveys, which makes the conclusions they reach deeply flawed, and contrary to what a wide range of other studies have found.\u201cMy problem with the FT criticisms is twofold,\u201d he wrote, in a 4,400-word response on his website. \u201cThe FT suggests that I made mistakes and errors in my computations, which is simply wrong, as I show below. The corrections proposed by The FT to my series (and with which I disagree) are for the most part relatively minor, and do not affect the long run evolutions and my overall analysis, contrarily to what The FT suggests.\u201dAnd those arguments by the newspaper that are not so minor and do undermine his findings, he writes, \u201care based upon methodological choices that are quite debatable (to say the least).\u201dHere\u2019s how he addresses many of the specific charges raised by the newspaper:He writes that \u201cThe FT journalists evidently did not read carefully the technical research papers and Excel files that I have put online; whatever adjustment one makes to correct for differential mortality (and I certainly agree that there are uncertainties left regarding this complex and important issue), it should be clear to everyone that this really has a relatively small impact on the long-run trends in wealth inequality. This looks a little bit like criticism for the sake of criticism.\u201dThe difference is huge: Using the survey data, as The Financial Times does, results in a finding that the top 10 percent of British households control 44 percent of total wealth in 2010. Mr. Piketty\u2019s preferred source puts that number at 71 percent.\u201cThis is a very large difference indeed,\u201d Mr. Piketty concedes. The problem, he writes, is that for older periods the only data available are studies of estate tax data, including careful research based on estate tax data from the 1920s to 1980s. Mr. Piketty then updated that old research using estate tax data over the decades since then.He argues that The Financial Times\u2019s approach requires apples-to-oranges comparisons, using estate tax data for older periods and then switching to surveys for more recent information. \u201cThis is problematic because we know that in every country wealth surveys tend to underestimate top wealth shares as compared to estimates based upon administrative fiscal data,\u201d he writes. \u201cTherefore such a methodological choice is bound to bias the results in the direction of declining inequality.\u201dIndeed, if the survey data cited by The Financial Times is correct, it \u201cwould mean that Britain is currently one of the most egalitarian countries in history in terms of wealth distribution; in particular this would mean that Britain is a lot more equal than Sweden, and in fact more equal than what Sweden has ever been (including in the 1980s). This does not look particularly plausible.\u201d\u201cOf course the estate records based estimates also raise significant methodological concerns, and I do not claim that the resulting estimates are perfectly reliable,\u201d Mr. Piketty continues. \u201cBut they definitely seem more plausible than the estimates based upon self-reported survey data.\u201dBut Mr. Piketty says that under his data, the three countries show the same basic pattern, so the choice of how to average doesn\u2019t change the resulting conclusions much. That changes if one believes The Financial Times\u2019s data that indicate wealth inequality is much lower in Britain; if that data is right, then weighting the average results in a much different story.\u201cBut in case Britain did follow a markedly different pattern than the other countries in recent decades (with a decline in wealth inequality rather than a rise), then putting more weight on Britain than on Sweden becomes a significant issue,\u201d he writes. \u201cSo we are back to the previous question: What happened to wealth inequality in Britain in recent decades?\u201dThe Upshot: The Upshot presents news, analysis\nand graphics about politics\nand policy.\nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}

Adams acknowledged that the United States didn\u2019t fully live up to that ideal, but he argued that America came closer than anywhere else.Adams was right at the time, and for decades. When my father, an eastern European refugee, reached France after World War II, he was determined to continue to the United States because it was less class bound, more meritocratic and offered more opportunity.Yet today the American dream has derailed, partly because of growing inequality. Or maybe the American dream has just swapped citizenship, for now it is more likely to be found in Canada or Europe \u2014 and a central issue in this year\u2019s political campaigns should be how to repatriate it.When our futures are determined to a significant extent at birth, we\u2019ve reverted to the feudalism that our ancestors fled.Three data points:Inequality has become a hot topic, propelling Bill de Blasio to become mayor of New York City, turning Senator Elizabeth Warren into a star, and elevating the economist Thomas Piketty into such a demigod that my teenage daughter asked me the other day for his 696-page tome. All this growing awareness is a hopeful sign, because there are policy steps that we could take that would create opportunity and dampen inequality.We could stop subsidizing private jets and too-big-to-fail banks, and direct those funds to early education programs that help break the cycle of poverty. We can invest less in prisons and more in schools.It\u2019s time to bring the American dream home from exile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China and Russia Fail to Reach Deal on Gas Plan", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 President Xi Jinping of China and the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, were unable to announce an agreement on a natural gas deal on Tuesday, despite high expectations that mutual political interests would help finally push through the project.Instead, commercial concerns continued to dominate \u2014 specifically, the price of the gas, which China and Russia have been haggling over for nearly a decade. After the meeting between the two leaders, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said that talks were continuing.According to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, after meeting Mr. Xi in Shanghai, Mr. Putin said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to be informed that the two sides have made significant progress in the price negotiation of the east route of the natural gas project.\u201dA joint statement said that Russian natural gas supplies would start flowing \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d a phrase used after many previous negotiations between Gazprom and the China National Petroleum Corporation, and an indication that the two sides could not close the gap on price in time for the two leaders to announce a deal at their meeting.Energy analysts had predicted that there would finally be an agreement, partly because Russia might have been willing to accept China\u2019s hard bargaining in order to diversify Gazprom\u2019s natural gas sales into Asia and away from a stagnant market in Europe.Some analysts believed that the countries\u2019 political imperatives were also aligned. By this reasoning, China was willing to help Russia at a time of American and European sanctions over Ukraine, and China was interested in siding with Russia during a tense period in relations between Washington and Beijing.\u201cGiven the political and commercial catalysts, this is a surprising result for everyone and for Gazprom,\u201d said James Henderson, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in Britain. \u201cThere was an expectation that with Putin arriving in China and with the political issues with Europe \u2014 that would be the trigger to get it over the line.\u201dMr. Putin had also been expected to agree to China\u2019s demands on price in part because of the weak Russian economy. The International Monetary Fund projects Russia\u2019s economic growth in 2014 will be 0.2 percent.But China was in no hurry to sign a deal, said Shoichi Itoh, a senior analyst at the Institute of Energy Economics in Tokyo. \u201cChina already has enough gas from Central Asia, and now Myanmar, until the mid-2020s,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless Russia made a compromise on price, China has no reason to sign it.\u201dIn recent weeks, Mr. Putin has repeatedly emphasized that Russia sees its economic future with China, which is on a trajectory to surpass the United States as the leading global economic power. Mr. Putin\u2019s focus on China is also consistent with his conservative nationalist ideology, emphasizing family values and patriotism and criticizing what he views as the West\u2019s moral decadence.Mr. Putin arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday to attend a conference of Asian countries hosted by China. Mr. Xi seized the opportunity to give Mr. Putin a warm welcome, even though it was not a state visit, by making sure ships from a Russian-Chinese naval exercise in the East China Sea berthed in Shanghai and by meeting Mr. Putin one-on-one at the start of the gathering.After the leaders\u2019 meeting, Xinhua said that Russia and China had proposed establishing a comprehensive energy partnership, and that the two sides would deepen their cooperation in the oil sector.China has maintained an official neutrality on Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, but that position has begun to tilt in favor of Moscow because of the \u201cquite bad\u201d atmosphere between China and the United States, said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.If the gas deal went ahead in the coming period, Mr. Shi said, it would be \u201ca Chinese financial assistance contract for Russia in guise of commercial payment.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lynn Williams, 89, Who Led Steelworkers Union, Is Dead", "Date": "2014-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLynn R. Williams became head of the United Steel Workers union in 1983, early in one of the worst decades in history for steel and steelworkers in America. Having lost much of its core business to better-equipped foreign competitors in the 1970s, the American steel industry had closed hundreds of mills since the new decade began, eliminating 200,000 jobs in the United States and Canada by 1983. It would eliminate 200,000 more by the decade\u2019s end.The bookish, Canadian-born Mr. Williams, who died May 5 in Toronto at 89, assumed control of a union that at 600,000 members was half the size it had been in 1979. In the next few years, he would steer members through round after round of layoffs, company bankruptcies and a six-month work stoppage at U.S. Steel. Yet by the time he retired in 1994, he also added 100,000 new members to the union\u2019s ranks and pioneered strategies for carving lasting benefits for workers from the fast-shrinking industrial core of the American economy.Mr. Williams was early to recognize the permanent nature of job losses in the steel industry, and one of the first to adopt a strategy of diversification. As U.S. Steel began buying oil companies, for instance, he led organizing campaigns that brought rubber, cork and linoleum workers, upholsterers, security guards, bus drivers and Canadian ski-patrol members into the ranks of the steelworkers.His union was also among the first to successfully demand financial transparency from the industry to negotiate deals fair to both sides and the first to hire an investment bank (Lazard Fr\u00e8res) to provide advice on subjects like stock options, profit-sharing and how to leverage union power in takeover raids like Carl Icahn\u2019s stormy 1986 bid for U.S. Steel.In exchange for concessions on wages and benefits, Mr. Williams negotiated contract provisions that added union members to employee stock-ownership plans and gave them seats on the company board. He mediated bailouts that saved 25 steel plants from closing between 1985 and 1993 by leveraging employee stock holdings.Mr. Williams, whose death was confirmed by the steelworkers union, was the first Canadian to head a major American industrial union.He had been the union\u2019s second-in-command for several years before being named president; and was already enmeshed in the union\u2019s state-of-emergency efforts: He had negotiated wage and benefit concessions in hopes of saving jobs. He had coordinated food and clothing aid for unemployed members in towns where the mills had closed and supermarkets and stores of all kinds were leaving as well, for lack of business.He had been working the phones for months, entreating friendly members of Congress to block a bill that would permit steel companies to void their labor contracts if they filed for bankruptcy. (The bill, long advocated by the steel industry, passed in 1984.) For all his preparation, though, he said years later, Mr. Williams remembered feeling overwhelmed when, after the death of his predecessor, Lloyd McBride, of a heart attack, he suddenly became president of an enterprise under siege on so many fronts. \u201cIf you can imagine an old mattress out in the junkyard with the springs popping up, I was like a guy lying on the springs trying to hold them all down,\u201d Mr. Williams said in a 2010 interview, describing his first days in the job. With only two hands, two legs and a torso, he added, \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough body parts.\u201d His interviews after retirement were often colorful. But his public statements during 11 years as union president bore the negotiator\u2019s stamp of calculated dullness, said Harry C. Katz, dean of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do quotes\u201d for the newspapers, which made him less familiar to the public than some labor leaders of the time, Dr. Katz said. But he was known for a nuanced understanding of the economics of steelmaking, as well as his grasp of the wage earner\u2019s world. \u201cHe was ahead of the curve in so many ways,\u201d Dr. Katz added. \u201cHe was probably one of the most intelligent labor leaders of the 20th century.\u201dMr. Williams is survived by two daughters, Judy Hocking and Barbara Williams; two sons, Brian and David; and 11 grandchildren. His wife of 34 years, Audrey Hansuld Williams, died in 2000.Lynn Russell Williams was born into a devoutly religious family in rural Springfield, Ontario, on July 21, 1924, one of three children of the Rev. Waldemar Williams and Emma Elizabeth Fisher Williams. His father was a minister in the United Church of Canada, and his mother an ardent churchgoer who named her son after Lynn Harold Hough, a famous Methodist theologian of the early 20th century.He originally planned to follow his father into the ministry. But after the church transferred his father to the industrial city of Hamilton during the Depression, Lynn was drawn to the growing union movement as a more \u201cdemocratic\u201d way of helping people.At McMaster University, where he studied English and philosophy, he encountered a book that became a cornerstone of his activism, he said. In \u201cThe Dynamics of Industrial Democracy: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Era of the New Deal,\u201d by Harold J. Ruttenberg and Clinton S. Golden (1942), Mr. Williams found a vision of industrial democracy in which workers and owners share responsibility for the products they make.After a year in the Royal Canadian Navy, he began his master\u2019s degree in industrial relations and economics at the University of Toronto, but dropped out to take a job at a steel plant, and to join the union.

{"Headline": "Possible Path to Closing Pay Gap", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIt\u2019s 2014, and women are still paid less than men. Does this suggest that a gender pay gap is an unfortunately permanent fixture? Will it still be with us in 50 years? I would predict yes. But by that point, it will be men who will be earning less than women.My forecast is based on evidence from schools, where it has been easier to work toward a level playing field than in the workplace.\u201cWhenever educational opportunities are made available on a relatively equal basis for females,\u201d Mr. Katz told me, \u201cthey tend to excel in completion and grades with some field differences.\u201dAs opportunities equalize in the workplace, will we also see a reversal of the gender pay gap?Employers demand these same noncognitive skills. Those that it takes to succeed in college \u2014 time management, writing ability, structuring tasks on your own, working in teams \u2014 are also needed in the modern workplace.These differences \u2014 competitiveness, overconfidence and risk-seeking \u2014 could conceivably have greater benefits in the workplace, at least in some jobs, than they do in school.For the gender gap to reverse, these norms \u2014 or, at least, women\u2019s responses to them \u2014 would have to change. Ms. Bertrand notes that in Asia, \u201cwhere gender norms are particularly strong, successful women are opting out of traditional family structures to focus on work.\u201d Rates of marriage and fertility are particularly low for successful Asian women. Of course, this may not be the way we would like to see norms change.Ultimately, no one can predict with certainty the future of the gender gap; there are simply too many uncontrollable variables. But, clearly, the current debate is missing something.If the pay gap leads us to consider men to be more productive than women, the schooling gap should symmetrically lead us to consider the opposite. Perhaps it is women who are more productive. If women\u2019s choices \u2014 such as taking time off to rear children \u2014 make them less productive in the economy, does adolescent boys\u2019 behavior in school make them even less so, because they are missing the educational potential of their formative years?Maybe we shouldn\u2019t be asking when women will catch up. Maybe they\u2019ve already caught up, and we should instead ask whether society is holding them back.SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN is a professor of economics at Harvard. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Points of No Return", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo why would the senator make such a statement? The answer is that like that ice sheet, his party\u2019s intellectual evolution (or maybe more accurately, its devolution) has reached a point of no return, in which allegiance to false doctrines has become a crucial badge of identity.I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about the power of doctrines \u2014 how support for a false dogma can become politically mandatory, and how overwhelming contrary evidence only makes such dogmas stronger and more extreme. For the most part, I\u2019ve been focusing on economic issues, but the same story applies with even greater force to climate.To see how it works, consider a topic I know well: the recent history of inflation scares.More than five years have passed since many conservatives started warning that the Federal Reserve, by taking action to contain the financial crisis and boost the economy, was setting the stage for runaway inflation. And, to be fair, that wasn\u2019t a crazy position to take in 2009; I could have told you it was wrong (and, in fact, I did), but you could see where it was coming from.Over time, however, as the promised inflation kept failing to arrive, there should have come a point when the inflationistas conceded their error and moved on.Why the bad behavior? Nobody likes admitting to mistakes, and all of us \u2014 even those of us who try not to \u2014 sometimes engage in motivated reasoning, selectively citing facts to support our preconceptions. But hard as it is to admit one\u2019s own errors, it\u2019s much harder to admit that your entire political movement got it badly wrong. Inflation phobia has always been closely bound up with right-wing politics; to admit that this phobia was misguided would have meant conceding that one whole side of the political divide was fundamentally off base about how the economy works. So most of the inflationistas have responded to the failure of their prediction by becoming more, not less, extreme in their dogma, which will make it even harder for them ever to admit that they, and the political movement they serve, have been wrong all along. The same kind of thing is clearly happening on the issue of global warming. There are, obviously, some fundamental factors underlying G.O.P. climate skepticism: The influence of powerful vested interests (including, though by no means limited to, the Koch brothers), plus the party\u2019s hostility to any argument for government intervention. But there is clearly also some kind of cumulative process at work. As the evidence for a changing climate keeps accumulating, the Republican Party\u2019s commitment to denial just gets stronger. Think of it this way: Once upon a time it was possible to take climate change seriously while remaining a Republican in good standing. Today, listening to climate scientists gets you excommunicated \u2014 hence Mr. Rubio\u2019s statement, which was effectively a partisan pledge of allegiance.It\u2019s hard to see what could reverse this growing hostility to inconvenient science. As I said, the process of intellectual devolution seems to have reached a point of no return. And that scares me more than the news about that ice sheet. Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia, whose motives in urging a delay in the vote came under furious attack by officials in Kiev.A day after Mr. Putin scrambled the political landscape by suggesting the vote be put off, militant leaders in Donetsk, Luhansk and Slovyansk said they would go ahead\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0as scheduled. Far from mollified by Mr. Putin\u2019s new stance, Ukrainian officials expressed deep suspicions, accusing him of trying to replay events preceding Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea.\u201cThe Ukrainian state has never planned any referendum,\u201d the head of Ukraine\u2019s National Security Council, Andriy Parubiy, said at a news conference in Kiev. \u201cWe cannot cancel or postpone something that doesn\u2019t exist. This is political fraud.\u201dUkrainian officials said Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks were intended to continue destabilizing the country with an eye toward disrupting the far more consequential presidential elections scheduled for May 25. \u201cAny calls for their postponement are not an expression of good will, but simply farce,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement. \u201cThis scenario has already been played by Russia in Crimea.\u201dBut some analysts said Mr. Putin was hedging against the inability of insurgents to pull off a successful ballot measure.\u00a0\u201cThey control dozens of buildings, but not the entire territory, and don\u2019t have the administrative capacity to organize a vote,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who until earlier this year served as the United States ambassador in Russia. \u201cMoreover, polls show that a free and fair election there would not produce support for splitting with Ukraine.\u201dIn Moscow\u00a0on Thursday, Mr. Putin briefly echoed the remarks he made a day earlier about seeking a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis through mediation by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.In another gesture of reconciliation, Ukraine\u2019s acting president, Oleksander Turchynov, and prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, in a statement offered amnesty to any insurgents who did not have \u201cblood on their hands.\u201dCaught off guard by Mr. Putin\u2019s surprise remarks on Wednesday, separatist leaders in southeastern Ukraine regained their balance Thursday, insisting the referendum would go ahead as planned. \u201cI think he has reasons to propose rescheduling the referendum,\u201d the self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyachislav Ponomaryov, told reporters Thursday\u00a0afternoon. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know these reasons. We\u2019re ready to hold it.\u201dMr. Ponomaryov displayed what he said was a sample ballot that contained a single question, printed in both Russian and Ukrainian: \u201cDo you support the declaration of independence of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic?\u201dHe predicted that an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d would vote in favor of independence, a step that he indicated would mean closer relations with Russia and, perhaps, eventual union with the Russian Federation.\u201cFor now, we should just specify for ourselves that we should definitively secede from Kiev,\u201d Mr. Ponomaryov said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll decide for ourselves which path to take further.\u201dHis optimism notwithstanding, even the simplest mechanics of the vote remained unclear. Less than 72 hours before voting would begin, the rebel authorities in Slovyansk had yet to disclose even a list of polling places. On Tuesday, Mr. Ponomaryov did not know if there would be 56 or 156 polling places in the city.As a result, the decision to proceed with the vote was fraught with risks for the rebels, who have managed to disrupt eastern Ukraine but control only a small amount of territory. If the voting reaches only a tiny portion of Ukraine\u2019s eastern population, as many here expect, it will highlight their lack of support among the population at large. While a chaotic voting process might discredit insurgent leaders, Ukrainian officials were not willing to stand by and hope for a mess, particularly given the level of misinformation that has been broadcast repeatedly on Russian state-controlled news media throughout the crisis. Just a polling station or two with a line of voters could provide the backdrop needed to make the vote appear legitimate on television to millions of viewers. The recording was of a phone call that the security service said took place between a pro-Russian political operative named Aleksandr Barkashov, who was identified as being in Moscow, and Dmytro Boitsov, a leader of rebels in Donetsk.The authenticity of the recording could not be independently verified.In the conversation, riddled with expletives, Mr. Boitsov suggests canceling the referendum and Mr. Barkashov insists that it must go forward, but says that it is ridiculous to consider holding a real vote.\u201cAre you going to walk around and collect papers?\u201d he asks incredulously, his words punctuated by curses. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d Mr. Barkashov adds: \u201cLet\u2019s say that 89 percent voted for the Donetsk Republic and that\u2019s it.\u201dGiven the risks of manipulation, the acting Ukrainian president, Mr. Turchynov, and the prime minister, Mr. Yatsenyuk, continued to denounce the referendum and Mr. Putin, even as they called for a national round table to discuss the country\u2019s political future. By their reckoning, it seemed as if the Russian president had stage-managed yet another deft maneuver in his geopolitical feud with the West, presenting himself as a conciliator while also reasserting, as he has for weeks, that the rebels in eastern Ukraine are not under Kremlin control.Ukrainian officials said they did not believe Mr. Putin would pull back troops along the border, and they suggested that he was simply buying time, allowing his agents on the ground to continue stirring unrest while giving Russia flexibility to intervene further and potentially take steps to cast doubt on the Ukrainian presidential election this month. The presidential race is viewed in Kiev, and particularly by Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, as critical to installing a government that even Russia must accept as valid, and allowing the country to open a new chapter that will almost certainly involve closer ties with Europe.While officials said they suspected the rebels\u2019 referendum was intended to mimic the series of events that led to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the road has been far rockier for separatists in the east. In Crimea, Moscow made clear that it supported the idea of a public referendum. Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks covering southeastern Ukraine suggested a far murkier situation, in which the Kremlin seemed reluctant to take responsibility for the region, with its shabby economy and where surveys have indicated a majority of the population does not support joining Russia.In another development, officials from the Pentagon and NATO questioned Mr. Putin\u2019s assertion on Wednesday that Russia had pulled back its troops from the Ukrainian border. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO, wrote on Twitter that while the alliance had taken note of Mr. Putin\u2019s statement, \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen any \u2014 any \u2014 indication of troops pulling back.\u201dC.

{"Headline": "Defending the Open Internet", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe future of the Internet \u2014 which means the future of communications, culture, free speech and innovation \u2014 is up for grabs.The Federal Communications Commission is making decisions that may determine how open the Internet will be, who will profit most from it and whether start-ups will face new barriers that will make it harder for ideas to flourish.Most everyone embraces net neutrality, yet the debate over how to accomplish it is so volatile that more than a million signatures have been filed protesting F.C.C. regulations that haven\u2019t even been proposed yet. (They may be released in draft form on Thursday.)What makes the current debate so contentious is that the F.C.C. has signaled its intention to grant cable and telephone companies the right to charge content companies like Netflix, Google, Yahoo or Facebook for speeding up transmissions to people\u2019s homes. And this is happening as the F.C.C. is considering whether to bless the merger of Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which could put a single company in control of the Internet pipes into 40 percent of American homes.In other words, these arcane matters of engineering and jurisprudence stir people up because they appear to violate net neutrality.\u201cSometimes what everybody thinks about the law is more important than what the law itself says,\u201d Mr. Wu told me recently in his Columbia office. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with net neutrality. It\u2019s become a kind of norm of behavior, what you can and can\u2019t appropriately do with the Internet. It\u2019s got to be open. Except for legitimate purposes like protecting the network itself, there shouldn\u2019t be discrimination against one form of content or another or one provider or another. And people generally accept that. Until now, the idea in a way has been more important than what the regulations have actually said.\u201dWhat got him to this point of influence and authority, besides his creative legal scholarship, was firsthand experience in Silicon Valley during the wildest days of the dot-com era. And a depressing afternoon at an Atlanta strip joint.\u2018A Perpetual Frontier\u2019On a rainy May afternoon, Mr. Wu, attired in academic casual, sat in his cluttered office discussing the state of the Internet and his place in it.A child of peripatetic scientists, he was born in Washington and spent formative years in Basel, Switzerland, and Toronto. His father, born in Taiwan, was a noted immunologist. He died in 1981, when Mr. Wu was 8. His mother, who moved from London to Canada as a child, is an immunologist at York University in Toronto.Thanks to his mother\u2019s farsighted purchase of an Apple II computer in 1982, Tim Wu says proudly that he became something of a geek. \u201cThat computer changed our lives, my brother\u2019s and mine,\u201d he said.In high school, Tim Wu got a part-time job writing software, while operating an online bulletin board, \u201cthe main purpose of which was to move around pirated software,\u201d he said. \u201cHey, it was a different time.\u201d His younger brother, David, is now a computer game software developer.A biochemistry major at McGill University, Mr. Wu was headed toward a career in \u201cthe family business \u2014 science,\u201d when, he noted wryly, \u201cI had a sort of rebellion.\u201d It took the form of an application to Harvard Law School, where he spent the next three years. But he didn\u2019t really know why he was at Harvard until he wandered into a cyberlaw class taught by Lawrence Lessig, an early advocate of an open Internet. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what cyberlaw was exactly, but it seemed cool,\u201d Mr. Wu said. \u201cLarry gave me my calling.\u201dMr. Lessig said he recognized that Mr. Wu was \u201cunusually gifted\u201d and helped arrange two clerkships for him. (Several years later, Mr. Lessig recommended that another student receive the same clerkships, and she did. Her name is Kathryn Judge. She is also a Columbia law professor and Mr. Wu\u2019s wife.)Judge Posner encouraged Mr. Wu to be a contrarian \u2014 and to find an independent road in the broad territory between heavy-handed government interference and free-market anarchy.In 1999 and 2000, Mr. Wu served as a clerk to Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court. There he played a different role. Justice Breyer\u2019s law clerks, Mr. Wu said, were expected to find out what the other justices were contemplating. \u201cOne of Breyer\u2019s favorite things was to ask, \u2018What does Sandra think?,' \u201d referring to Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who was often the pivotal vote until she retired in 2006. \u201cHe believed he had a big job trying to defend the middle ground in the court \u2014 to form a caucus of reasonable adults.\u201dIn 2000, as Mr. Wu\u2019s clerkship came to a close, the country was infected with dot-com fever. And even at the Supreme Court, he caught a case of it. With his legal pedigree and programming skills, he was in high demand. He opted for a high-risk, high-reward opportunity: a marketing job with a start-up firm in Silicon Valley called Riverstone Networks. The company, he said, \u201cpromised to make us all rich.\u201dInstead, it made him disillusioned. He says he was appalled by the business practices around him. \u201cNetwork neutrality came out of the bad things there,\u201d he said.The company sold industrial-size Internet routers that were being used, Mr. Wu recalls, \u201cto block and prioritize Internet traffic, to discriminate against traffic, basically, to do many of the things that I think companies on the Internet shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201d He went to China for the company and found that the equipment he was dealing in was of interest to the Chinese for its potential to abet censorship.\u201cHelping the Chinese government censor dissidents wasn\u2019t the way I wanted to spend the rest of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hit me that we weren\u2019t on the good side there.\u201d The idea of net neutrality grew, in part, because \u201cI had personal experience of violations of it,\u201d he said.Mr. Wu was untouched by the investigations, but said he had known that things weren\u2019t right.It all crystallized for him on Sept. 12, 2001 \u2014 the day after the 9/11 attacks. He was stranded in Atlanta at a trade show with other company employees. Their business engagements were canceled because of the attacks, and, with no other plans, his colleagues decided to go to a strip club. On such a solemn day, the tawdry revelry repelled him.\u201cI wondered how I\u2019d gotten there,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI realized that what we\u2019d been doing all those months was abhorrent.\u201d He had been living in a world based on nothing but money, he said, and saw that \u201cthe idea that the private sector, the free market, on its own has all the solutions is just a myth.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen it\u2019s just about money, there are no values.\u201dHe looked for a way out and got a job teaching law at the University of Virginia. But the Internet preoccupied him. \u201cI thought of it as a kind of perpetual frontier, the place where everyone gets a shot, where the underdogs have a chance. The Internet has been that. And I wanted some principles that would keep it that way.\u201dMr. Wu\u2019s ideas spread, reaching top staff members at the F.C.C., who brought them to the attention of Michael Powell, then the commission chairman.The \u2018Common Carrier\u2019 DebateThe argument today is not so much whether net neutrality is a good concept \u2014 most people agree that it is \u2014 but what it means in practice.Mr. Lessig and Mr. Wu both say Mr. Powell was effective in maintaining an open Internet. He used a very light regulatory hand \u2014 and this has left some issues unresolved to this day. He decided that the Internet was \u201can information service\u201d and not a \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d This semantic difference is crucial. Common carriers, like phone companies, are more tightly regulated, and while Mr. Powell prohibited the arbitrary blocking or setting of priorities for Internet traffic, he did so without invoking the F.C.C.'s authority over common carriers, which is embodied in Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.Congress could intervene, but has not done so. One reason for his original decision, Mr. Powell said in the interview, was that the Internet needed enormous capital investment, which would have been deterred by tighter regulations. \u201cIf I thought Congress wanted to throw $10 billion or $20 billion or $30 billion a year into building up the infrastructure, I\u2019d be willing to have a conversation about how to regulate such a system.\u201dToday, Mr. Powell speaks as the head of the cable industry\u2019s trade organization. \u201cNow that private markets have created a system with certain expectations on return of capital,\u201d he said, \u201cit would be wrong, from many perspectives, to change the rules and confiscate what has been a public good.\u201dMr. Wu and his allies argue that broadband carriers \u2014 basically the telephone and cable companies \u2014 do, in fact, function as common carriers. In their view, the Internet is increasingly crucial to the economy, society and the political system, and its openness to all comers needs to be enforced by the F.C.C., which should invoke its full authority under Title II.Netflix has already begun making deals with Comcast and Verizon Communications to ensure swift transmissions from its servers to their broadband networks, and with the new F.C.C. proposals, priority service might be permitted through the \u201clast mile\u201d of these networks \u2014 that is, through the broadband networks into people\u2019s homes. Mr. Wu says both sorts of commercial prioritization should be regulated under Title II.\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in net neutrality,\u201d Mr. Obama said in that interview. \u201cWe\u2019re getting pushback, obviously from some of the bigger carriers, obviously who would like to charge more fees and extract more money from wealthier customers, but we think that runs counter to the whole spirit of openness that has made the Internet such a powerful engine not only for economic growth but also for the generation of ideas and creativity.\u201dMany companies, including content providers like Netflix and Yahoo; social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Reddit; search sites like Google and Microsoft\u2019s Bing; and e-commerce companies like Amazon, say they worry that the F.C.C. might give \u201cbroadband gatekeepers\u201d control.In a letter to the F.C.C. last week, these companies and many others said the new rule making \u201crepresents a grave threat to the Internet.\u201d Cable and telephone industries respond that it is in their own interests to keep the Internet open. The main question, they say, is whether content providers will help pay for the cost of operating and building the network. \u201cThat\u2019s just a financial issue,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of principle.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like FedEx,\u201d he said. \u201cYou pay a certain amount for overnight delivery and a certain amount for two-day delivery. You could end up with something like that for the Internet.\u201dMr. Wu views the current battles as the latest in a long cycle. His book, \u201cThe Master Switch: The Rise And Fall of Information Empires,\u201d describes how the F.C.C., as a weak overseer of the old AT&T telephone monopoly, often acted less in the public interest than to promote the interests of the company. Mergers like the one now proposed between Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which he opposes, could create new behemoths that might overwhelm the F.C.C. Yet he says the agency should persevere, using the most powerful weapons at its disposal, which include Title II.He says media companies will combine and grow \u2014 until they grow too large and start to fragment, and are replaced by more dynamic companies, in an endless cycle. In his book, he cites \u201cThe Romance of the Three Kingdoms,\u201d the classic Chinese novel: \u201cAn empire long united must divide; an empire long divided must unite.\u201d But when this process takes place in the modern world, he says, government regulators must protect the public interest.Advertisement"}

Still, the index closed at another nominal record high, but this time by just a fraction of point.Stocks have gained as many investors remain optimistic that the economy will start to accelerate this year after a cold winter that stymied growth. First-quarter corporate earnings came in better than expected, giving stocks a lift.Whether the S.&P. 500 climbs beyond the 1,900 level or falls back depends on how the economy develops, said John Canally, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. If growth falters, stocks will most likely slide, he said.\u201cBut if the economy can deliver,\u201d he said, \u201cand the global economy can accelerate, we\u2019ll look back at 1,900 and say, \u2018Yes that was just a stop on the way to 2,000.\u2019\u00a0\u201d On Tuesday, the S.&P. 500 index rose 0.8 point, or less than 0.1 percent, to close at 1,897.45, after topping 1,902 in early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.97 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,715.44. The Nasdaq composite index was the laggard of the three, falling 13.7 points, or 0.3 percent, to 4,130.17. Keurig Green Mountain was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. Its stock surged $8.36, or 7.6 percent, to $119.07 after Coca-Cola raised its stake in the coffee company. Coca-Cola, the world\u2019s biggest beverage company, disclosed in a regulatory filing that a subsidiary now has a 16 percent stake in Keurig.Investors were also assessing corporate earnings.The McKesson Corporation, the prescription drug distributor, jumped $5.77, or 3.3 percent, to $180 after saying on Monday that its net income rose 43 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter. Its overall earnings got a boost from stronger results in North America coupled with lower costs.Elizabeth Arden, the beauty products company, plunged $8.13, or 22.8 percent, to $27.50 after reporting an unexpected quarterly loss and disclosing that it had hired Goldman Sachs to help it explore strategic alternatives.Over all, though, first-quarter earnings have come in better than analysts expected.Nearly all companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported their results, and earnings are forecast to grow by 3.3 percent when final figures are calculated, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Three weeks ago, analysts were expecting earnings to fall 1.1 percent.Another encouraging sign was that company revenue growth accelerated to 3.2 percent in the quarter, from 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Despite the positive backdrop, this year\u2019s stock market rise has been a grind compared with last year\u2019s surge. Along with worries about the United States, there are concerns about growth overseas as well as tensions with Russia after it annexed Crimea.Another limiting factor is that stocks, having rallied for more than five years, are also no longer the bargain they once were.\u201cIn 2009, the market was cheap,\u201d Mr. Canally of LPL Financial said. \u201cNow we\u2019re fairly valued, maybe a bit overvalued.\u201d In the bond market, interest rates retreated.

{"Headline": "In Taking Crimea, Putin Gains a Sea of Fuel Reserves", "Date": "2014-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Russia seized Crimea in March, it acquired not just the Crimean landmass but also a maritime zone more than three times its size with the rights to underwater resources potentially worth trillions of dollars.Russia portrayed the takeover as reclamation of its rightful territory, drawing no attention to the oil and gas rush that had recently been heating up in the Black Sea. But the move also extended Russia\u2019s maritime boundaries, quietly giving Russia dominion over vast oil and gas reserves while dealing a crippling blow to Ukraine\u2019s hopes for energy independence.Russia did so under an international accord that gives nations sovereignty over areas up to 230 miles from their shorelines. It had tried, unsuccessfully, to gain access to energy resources in the same territory in a pact with Ukraine less than two years earlier.\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Carol R. Saivetz, a Eurasian expert in the Security Studies Program of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt deprives Ukraine of the possibility of developing these resources and gives them to Russia. It makes Ukraine more vulnerable to Russian pressure.\u201dGilles Lericolais, the director of European and international affairs at France\u2019s state oceanographic group, called Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea \u201cso obvious\u201d as a play for offshore riches.In Moscow, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin said there was \u201cno connection\u201d between the annexation and energy resources, adding that Russia did not even care about the oil and gas. \u201cCompared to all the potential Russia has got, there was no interest there,\u201d the spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Saturday.Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and other major oil companies have already explored the Black Sea, and some petroleum analysts say its potential may rival that of the North Sea. That rush, which began in the 1970s, lifted the economies of Britain, Norway and other European countries.William B. F. Ryan, a marine geologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, said Russia\u2019s Black Sea acquisition gave it what are potentially \u201cthe best\u201d of that body\u2019s deep oil reserves. Oil analysts said that mounting economic sanctions could slow Russia\u2019s exploitation of its Black and Azov Sea annexations by reducing access to Western financing and technology. But they noted that Russia had already taken over the Crimean arm of Ukraine\u2019s national gas company, instantly giving Russia exploratory gear on the Black Sea.\u201cRussia\u2019s in a mood to behave aggressively,\u201d said Vladimir Socor, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a research group in Washington that follows Eurasian affairs. \u201cIt\u2019s already seized two drilling rigs.\u201dThe global hunt for fossil fuels has increasingly gone offshore, to places like the Atlantic Ocean off Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and the South China Sea. Hundreds of oil rigs dot the Caspian, a few hundred miles east of the Black Sea.Nations divide up the world\u2019s potentially lucrative waters according to guidelines set forth by the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty. The agreement lets coastal nations claim what are known as exclusive economic zones that can extend up to 200 nautical miles (or 230 statute miles) from their shores. Inside these zones, countries can explore, exploit, conserve and manage deep natural resources, living and nonliving.The countries with shores along the Black Sea have long seen its floor as a potential energy source, mainly because of modest oil successes in shallow waters.Just over two years ago, the prospects for huge payoffs soared when a giant ship drilling through deep bedrock off Romania found a large gas field in waters more than half a mile deep.Russia moved fast.In April 2012, Mr. Putin, then Russia\u2019s prime minister, presided over the signing of an accord with Eni, the Italian energy giant, to explore Russia\u2019s economic zone in the northeastern Black Sea. Dr. Ryan of Columbia estimated that the size of the zone before the Crimean annexation was roughly 26,000 square miles, about the size of Lithuania.In August 2012, Ukraine announced an accord with an Exxon-led group to extract oil and gas from the depths of Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea waters. The Exxon team had outbid Lukoil, a Russian company. Ukraine\u2019s state geology bureau said development of the field would cost up to $12 billion.Dr. Ryan estimates that the newly claimed maritime zone around Crimea added about 36,000 square miles to Russia\u2019s existing holdings. The addition is more than three times the size of the Crimean landmass, and about the size of Maine.At the time, few observers noted Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in those terms. An exception was Romania, whose Black Sea zone had been adjacent to Ukraine\u2019s before Russia stepped in.\u201cRomania and Russia will be neighbors,\u201d Romania Libera, a newspaper in Bucharest, observed on March 24. The article\u2019s headline said the new maritime border could become a \u201cpotential source of conflict.\u201dMany nations have challenged Russia\u2019s seizing of Crimea and thus the legality of its Black and Azov Sea claims. But the Romanian newspaper quoted analysts as judging that the other countries bordering the Black Sea \u2014 Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania \u2014 would tacitly recognize the annexation \u201cin order to avoid an open conflict.\u201d Originally, to avoid Ukraine\u2019s maritime zone, Russia drew the route for the costly pipeline in a circuitous jog southward through Turkey\u2019s waters. But now it can take a far more direct path through its newly acquired Black Sea territory, if the project moves forward. The Ukraine crisis has thrown its future into doubt. As for oil extraction in the newly claimed maritime zones, companies say their old deals with Ukraine are in limbo, and analysts say new contracts are unlikely to be signed anytime soon, given the continuing turmoil in the region and the United States\u2019 efforts to ratchet up pressure on Russia. \u201cThere are huge issues at stake,\u201d noted Dr. Saivetz of M.I.T. \u201cI can\u2019t see them jumping into new deals right now.\u201dThe United States is using its wherewithal to block Russian moves in the maritime zones. Last month, it imposed trade restrictions on Chernomorneftegaz, the breakaway Crimean arm of Ukraine\u2019s national gas company. Eric L. Hirschhorn, the United States under secretary of commerce for industry and security, said sanctions against the Crimean business would send \u201ca strong message\u201d of condemnation for Russia\u2019s \u201cincursion into Ukraine and expropriation of Ukrainian assets.\u201dAlexandra Odynova contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cities in India Among the Most Polluted, W.H.O. Says", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 New Delhi\u2019s air is the most polluted in the world, according to an international report that quantifies pollution levels, confirming findings by experts confounded by the lack of attention to the city\u2019s problem.For years, experts have wondered why so much international attention has focused on air pollution in Beijing when some say conditions are as bad or even worse in South Asia.\u201cI am shocked at the extent of the problem they found in India,\u201d said Dr. Sundeep Salvi, the director of the Chest Research Foundation in Pune, India. \u201cThis is incredibly bad, and there is a complete lack of awareness about it both amongst policy makers and the common man.\u201dPM 2.5 refers to particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, which is believed to pose the greatest health risk because it penetrates deeply into lungs.In Beijing, a pollution level as high as Delhi\u2019s would most likely have caused widespread concern. But in Delhi, almost no one seemed to notice. Few people here wear the filter masks that have been appearing on the streets of Beijing, and even among the wealthy, few own air purifiers, which are used widely in East Asia, because few are even aware of the problem.India is in the midst of national elections, but air pollution is rarely mentioned by leading politicians. At a recent embassy party here, several people expressed astonishment that New Delhi\u2019s air was considered dangerous. One of the guests, a marathon runner who jogs through Delhi\u2019s streets daily, said she had never noticed any problem with the air.The W.H.O. report, which examined pollution levels in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries for the years 2008 to 2013, found that the annual mean for PM 2.5 concentrations in Delhi was 153 micrograms per cubic meter. The cities of Patna, Gwalior and Raipur followed Delhi for the worst air pollution readings. Delhi\u2019s reading was almost three times that of Beijing, whose annual mean in the report was 59.Gufran Beig of India\u2019s state-run System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research said Thursday in an interview that the annual mean provided for Delhi in the W.H.O. report was incorrect.\u201cOur levels are comparable with those of other cities,\u201d he said. \u201cDelhi\u2019s air quality is better than Beijing\u2019s in summer and much better in monsoon season.\u201dA host of other officials, including the chairman of the Central Pollution Control Board, were either unavailable for comment on Thursday or said they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.Air pollution killed about seven million people globally in 2012, making it the world\u2019s biggest environmental health risk, the W.H.O. reported last month. About 80 percent of those deaths came from heart attacks and strokes, although air pollution also increases lung cancer deaths.Dr. Carlos Dora, the coordinator of health and environment at the W.H.O., said most Asians should be concerned.\u201cThe levels of air quality which we see in India, Pakistan, Iran and China are very worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cAir pollution has a huge impact on human health.\u201dThe W.H.O. study found that in the cities that had provided data for a similar but smaller study in 2011, air quality had mostly deteriorated in the intervening years. The growing use of coal-fired power plants, cars and dung fuel for cooking is one of the principal causes of worsening air pollution, the organization said.China\u2019s extensive pollution problems have grown out of efforts by the country\u2019s leaders to develop manufacturing and industrial capacity no matter the cost. But India has little to show for its toxic air. The country\u2019s economy is sputtering, its small manufacturing sector has been shrinking, and efforts to build roads and open coal and metal mines have foundered on corruption and environmental concerns. Pakistan, which had three cities among the world\u2019s 10 most polluted, has even less to show for its pollution levels, as economic growth there has been well below India\u2019s for decades.Dr. Anurag Agrawal, a pulmonary physician and researcher based in New Delhi, said he had seen a patient on Wednesday whose asthma had become so bad in recent years that he must take high doses of steroids to keep it under control.

Yet ALG also says that drop is within the typical $700 fluctuation for used-car values, meaning the Cobalt\u2019s decline could be related to other factors.The notion of a Pontiac Solstice roadster as a cheap prescription for a midlife crisis, or a low-mileage Saturn Ion compact as a $2,000 bargain, is unlikely to become a reality.\u201cAnybody who is looking to exploit any potential loss in value for personal gain is going to find a tough situation,\u201d said Eric Lyman, ALG\u2019s vice president for industry insights.Recalls generally have no measurable effect on resale values, though safety defects that attract widespread, prolonged media coverage can cause values to dip. \u201cDriver fatalities and things that make front-page news, those do have a different impact, largely because their visibility is so much higher,\u201d Mr. Lyman said. \u201cInterestingly, what we see is that the impact of those recalls is very temporary.\u201dAfter the recalls of Ford Explorers with Firestone tires in 2000, and of Toyotas for unintended acceleration in 2009-10, used-car values rebounded within 12 months of the media coverage\u2019s subsiding.ALG tracks used-car prices through the wholesale auctions where dealers buy and sell vehicles. Before the unintended-acceleration recalls, the typical Toyota Camry sold for about $2,000 more than its competitors. During the height of the controversy, Camry prices dropped to an average of $400 above the competition. Mr. Lyman ascribes $1,000 of the $1,600 loss directly to the recalls and the subsequent publicity. The remaining $600 decrease is attributed to factors like the reputation and relative newness of competitive models.In the case of G.M.\u2019s recent woes, the recalled cars may have dodged serious depreciation because of their age. The already low prices of economy cars as much as 10 years old leave little room for discounting. Ten-year-old Chevy Cobalts and HHRs are worth roughly $5,000 today.Newer and more desirable, the Solstice and Saturn Sky roadsters are selling for $10,000 to $15,000, but finding a great deal on a sporty car is even less likely. The two-seaters largely escaped the media spotlight because fewer were sold and they haven\u2019t been implicated in fatal accidents tied to ignition switches.Even if the prices of recalled cars are holding up, G.M. may face a different outcome in the courts. After Toyota\u2019s unintended-acceleration recall, a $250 million settlement compensated owners who sold their cars from Sept. 1, 2009, to Dec. 31, 2010, for diminished values. While most of those payments were trivial \u2014 as little as $37.50 \u2014 certain models sold in specific months qualified for substantial payments. Owners of the 2007 Lexus LX 470 who sold in March 2010 received as much as $5,977.Dozens of outstanding lawsuits against G.M. seek class-action status for loss of value because of the ignition-switch recall. G.M. has asked a federal court to dismiss those suits under the terms of its bankruptcy, which relieved the automaker of liabilities from incidents before July 10, 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hikers Spread Democracy in India", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMarkha Valley JournalMARKHA VALLEY, India \u2014 Staring up at the steep and lifeless brown ridges looming over the valley, Gulzar Ahmad Dar, a boyish and chatty Kashmiri policeman, sighed at having drawn a short straw.\u201cWhat miserable luck I have,\u201d he said, peering down the funnel of mountains toward the village of Markha, his destination, 22 grueling miles away. \u201cBut somebody had to get this place, no?\u201dMr. Dar, 25, was the youngest in a group of five government employees randomly assigned by a computer to election duty in this exceedingly remote valley. The members of this polling team, like all the others across the country, were plucked from their day jobs and given the temporary but vital task of ensuring free and fair voting.Voting ended Monday in the six-week exercise \u2014 the largest election in history \u2014 which included more than 800 million registered voters casting ballots in fetid slums and on palm-fringed beaches, from sultry, monsoon-drenched forests to the hostile windswept barrens of India\u2019s craggy northern edge. Much attention has rightly been focused on the contest between Narendra Modi, the leader of the center-right Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been far ahead in the polls, and Rahul Gandhi, the prince of India\u2019s most famous political family and reluctant leader of the Indian National Congress, which seems headed for a historic defeat.But the sheer logistics of getting a ballot into the hands of every voter in a nation as large and diverse as India are daunting. Few places are as formidable on that front as the Markha Valley, in the district of Leh, a predominantly Buddhist region high on the Tibetan Plateau, spanning 17,375-square miles of rugged alpine desert.In most of the rest of this crowded country, every 1,000 voters warrant a polling booth, but in Leh, only four of its 274 settlements would fit that bill. Instead, local officials hew more closely to the election commission\u2019s rule that voters cannot be required to travel more than a mile and a quarter to their polling station. In this sparsely populated region where clusters of families live in isolated hamlets, that means some stations have as few as a dozen voters.None of the five-man team had ever been to the Markha Valley, or hiked anywhere near as far as it takes to reach the 12,500-foot-high village of the same name from the end of a road in the aptly named village of Chilling, at the valley\u2019s bottom. Aside from Mr. Dar, the team represented departments not usually accustomed to physical exertion: Ali Asad, a quick-witted and short-tempered technical officer from Public Works; Tsewang Gyaltson, an accountant from Handicrafts whose cool head offset Mr. Asad\u2019s; Thinless Angchok, a quiet and introspective teacher at a government elementary school; and Tashi Wangdan, the stoic and grave presiding officer, who, despite being a high school lecturer in political science, reflected on the prospect of traipsing up the valley for just 114 voters by remarking, more to himself than anyone else, \u201cMy, this democracy thing is stupid, isn\u2019t it?\u201dMr. Dar chimed in. \u201cAll they\u2019ve got here is dry hills. Not even a bit of green,\u201d he said. Then, referring to the trekking enthusiasts from the West who are crucial to the valley\u2019s economy, using its guides, guesthouses, and packhorses, Mr. Dar asked, \u201cWhy do the white people even come here?\u201dThe Markha Valley\u2019s beauty is of the desolate kind, and hiking mile after mile over sand and the rounded rocks of its riverbed is hard on the feet of people who sit behind desks most days. Its pointy brown slopes appear like so many stegosaurus backs in a row, guarding the approach to the dinosaur king\u2019s throne.As the sun slowly unlocks frigid water from the icy caps above, the valley\u2019s residents give what modest arable land they have its first tilling, chanting while they plow and rake. Into the ground go barley seeds, a hardy, nutritious and durable grain that can last over the long winter when people here light fires, stay indoors and slowly whittle away at their food stores until the next spring. This is not a land of plenty; people here, after eating all the meat and cartilage off a bone, crack it to suck out the marrow.The village of Markha itself is but a few dozen beige mud-brick homes, sitting on a slight promontory, almost invisible against the brown backdrop. Livestock outnumber people. At night, it is as if all the stars in the sky gather here, the rest of the world having slowly abandoned them. One barely notices the moon among all that starlight.By nightfall, the team still had not reached its destination. For more than five hours, locals heading downriver had been saying that the village was only two hours away. It had already been 10 hours of hiking, and a decision was made to stay at a guesthouse \u2014 a plan quickly foiled when its proprietor promptly informed the team that she had no safe shelter for the pony, and that two days earlier, snow leopards had been sighted in the area.And so the men plodded along in the dim moonlight until they came upon a stream bursting with the day\u2019s snowmelt \u2014 so much that it had taken out the rock bridge crossing it. With no choice but to push on to Markha, the exhausted workers took off their shoes, rolled up their pants, held hands and waded through the waist-high water.There was little sign that anything extra had been spent on this polling team\u2019s excursion, besides transportation to and from Chilling. The team gathered water from natural springs and accepted bread from the homesteads that dotted the path, like oases.But bringing democracy to these places is not cheap. Simrandeep Singh, the top official in Leh District, said that his office had already spent more than $1,665 per voter, with most of the money going into fuel and voting awareness campaigns in distant corners of the district. Every home in the district was sent an invitation card inviting them to vote on May 7, and many of those locations were only reachable by helicopter.Mr. Singh said that was probably the highest expenditure per voter in the country, but that reaching every voter was essential.\u201cPeople in other parts of the country \u2014 Mumbai, Delhi \u2014 they have their own festivals, and we have ours,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that atmosphere, that democratic euphoria, that brings us together. This election is the only festival in which the entire country is bothered.\u201dIn Markha, though, Tsetan Dolkar, 34, the owner of a guesthouse, said her village had tried to take advantage of multiparty democracy, but so far had seen no results. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried in the past two elections to vote as a block for whoever will win, so that they will remember us and build us a road,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth parties always make promises. Elections for us have always been about getting a road.\u201dAfter going all-in twice, once with the Indian National Congress and then the Bharatiya Janata Party, Markha remains roadless. The anxiety of what to do if someone falls gravely ill hovers constantly. Ms. Dolkar said there were mixed feelings about this election. Her father, Tashi Largyal, said: \u201cA vote is like money. It\u2019s like power. And we have very little of all those things.\u201dAs polling closed on Wednesday evening, however, 100 out of 114 voters had cast their ballots, officials reported. At 88 percent turnout, Markha is not ready to give up just yet.videoAdvertisement"}

A number above 50 indicates expansion, while a number below that level suggests contraction. Economists consider the purchasing managers figures, which are based on surveys of around 5,000 euro zone companies, to be one of the better real-time indicators of the health of the bloc\u2019s economy.\u201cThe ongoing improvement in business conditions was evident in both manufacturing and services,\u201d a Markit statement said.The pace of manufacturing output grew at a slower rate, it noted, partly because exports eased, but companies \u201cacross both sectors nevertheless expanded capacity to meet rising demand, collectively taking on staff at the fastest rate since September 2011.\u201dAny hint of improvement in the bleak labor market is good news for the roughly 26 million unemployed people in the 28-nation European Union, but the purchasing managers surveys have been showing signs of a modest hiring uptick for several months, which has not been reflected in official data.The euro zone jobless rate has been steady at around 11.8 percent since December, with a quarter or more of the working populations in Spain and Greece seeking employment.A separate Markit index tracking German purchasing managers came in at 56.1, unchanged from April, suggesting that Europe\u2019s largest economy is growing strongly. That contrasted with France, where the index fell to 49.3 from 50.6 in April, suggesting the economy is weakening slightly.\u201cThe data don\u2019t point to any meaningful change in the near term,\u201d \u200bsaid Michel Martinez, chief euro zone economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cThe euro zone recovery is stuck in a low gear.\u201dOn the positive side, he said, there was little to suggest that the Ukraine crisis or the slowdown in China were having an effect on growth, so far.Chris Williamson, Markit\u2019s chief economist, said in a statement that Thursday\u2019s survey data was consistent with an acceleration in the April-June period to a 0.5 percent quarterly rate.The European monetary authority has so far resisted the outright buying of government bonds used by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England to stimulate lending and stave off deflation.

{"Headline": "Thai Prime Minister Ordered Removed From Office", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 A Thai court on Wednesday ordered Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra removed from office, a highly divisive move and a victory for a powerful opposition movement that for six months has sought to overthrow the government.The Constitutional Court ruled that Ms. Yingluck abused her power when she transferred a civil servant to another post more than three years ago. The court ordered her to step down immediately along with all members of her cabinet who were in office at the time of the transfer.Ms. Yingluck\u2019s party called the decision a \u201cnew form of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201dLeaders of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s party quickly announced that a deputy prime minister, Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, would become acting prime minister.Thailand for decades was considered an island of pluralism, freedom and strong economic growth \u2014 especially in contrast with its neighbors \u2014 but its economy has suffered during the recent turmoil, and leaders have warned of civil war.The court\u2019s decision, which highlights its overtly political role, throws into question elections announced for July 20, which the governing party was expected to win because of its strong support in the northern provinces.Bhokin Bhalakula, a member of the governing party, Pheu Thai, told reporters at the party\u2019s headquarters that the court decision was part of a \u201cnew form of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in order to establish a new regime and destroy the hope of the people who want to see the country progress democratically and with rule of law.\u201dMr. Niwattumrong, the commerce minister who was named acting prime minister, is a former executive in Mr. Thaksin\u2019s corporate empire. His appointment is likely to exacerbate tensions with the antigovernment movement, which wants to eradicate Mr. Thaksin\u2019s influence from the country.The antigovernment movement, which is armed, continues to block access to the prime minister\u2019s office and a number of other government facilities in Bangkok. Pro-government \u201cred shirts,\u201d who in the past have also been allied with shadowy armed groups, are planning a show of force on the outskirts of Bangkok on Saturday.Highlighting concerns about violence, the Thai news media reported Wednesday that for security reasons, the judges and staff members of the Constitutional Court would not return to work until Tuesday.Ms. Yingluck, 46, was the country\u2019s first female prime minister but was loathed by the opposition and called a proxy for Mr. Thaksin, who has lived abroad since a 2006 military coup and a subsequent conviction for abuse of power in a highly politicized trial.\u201cI am so sorry that I no longer have the opportunity to serve the people,\u201d Ms. Yingluck said on national television after the court decision, adding that she was proud that she became prime minister \u201cthrough democratic means.\u201dMs. Yingluck could face further legal proceedings on charges that she mismanaged the government\u2019s costly subsidy program for rice farmers, charges that could lead to a prison term and a ban from politics. The country\u2019s countercorruption commission is to decide Thursday whether to press the case.The court\u2019s verdict was unanimous and was reached with unusual speed. It was delivered just one day after Ms. Yingluck gave evidence at the court.The antigovernment movement, which is supported by some of Thailand\u2019s wealthiest families, has called for an appointed prime minister and described Wednesday\u2019s court verdict as a partial victory. It turned to the courts after unsuccessfully trying to force Ms. Yingluck out.The Constitutional Court has backed the protest movement, saying in previous rulings that protesters, who also led a campaign to block elections, had the \u201cright to exercise their rights and liberty.\u201d A lower court barred the government from dispersing protesters.As the antigovernment movement cheered the decision to remove Ms. Yingluck, independent legal experts despaired over what they described as the crusading role of the courts and the damage to the prestige of the judiciary.The decision to remove Ms. Yingluck is \u201ctotal nonsense in a democratic society,\u201d said Ekachai Chainuvati, the deputy dean of the law faculty at Siam University in Bangkok.\u201cThis is what I would call a juristocracy \u2014 a system of government governed by judges,\u201d Mr. Ekachai said.The grounds for Ms. Yingluck\u2019s ouster were that she did not give sufficient justification when she transferred the secretary general of the National Security Council, Thawil Pliensri, to another post in 2011. The court said that Ms. Yingluck was within her rights to remove Mr. Thawil but that the move was rushed, intended to free up another job for a relative of Ms. Yingluck\u2019s and not done according to \u201cmoral principles.\u201dIn a stark symbol of the dysfunction of the Thai government, Mr. Thawil was reinstated, on court order, last week, and he told the news media that even while in office, he would continue to support the movement to remove the government.

One of his closest associates and a former minister, Brice Hortefeux, said Mr. Sarkozy was \u201cvery displeased to see his name associated with this curious news\u201d and knew nothing about the false invoices.On television, Ms. Le Pen openly chortled over such statements, saying that as a presidential candidate and the head of a party herself, she could say unequivocally that he would have had to have known.Still, she insisted that she was not one to gloat.\u201cI am not rubbing my hands together,\u201d Ms. Le Pen said. \u201cWhen I see this kind of thing, I see the gap growing between the political classes and the citizens.\u201dThe scandal, experts say, can only help Ms. Le Pen, an adept campaigner who played down her party\u2019s past links to racism and xenophobia and articulated a populist message that resonates with French voters exhausted by years of economic troubles and insecure about their nation\u2019s place in a rapidly changing world. With her sights set on a presidential run in 2017, she now faces a conservative opposition party racked by scandal and the governing party of Mr. Hollande, who has record-low approval ratings.In February, the newsmagazine Le Point reported that the U.M.P. leader, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, had funneled 10 million euros, or $13.6 million, in party funds to a communications firm run by two of his close associates, paying the company for services that seemed suspect. On Monday, just hours after Ms. Le Pen\u2019s electoral victory, a lawyer for the firm, Bygmalion, said his clients had produced \u201cfake invoices\u201d to bill the U.M.P. for political \u201cconventions\u201d that Bygmalion had not organized and might not have taken place. The bills should have been made out to Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s campaign, but the U.M.P. had requested that they be sent to party headquarters.The next day, Mr. Cop\u00e9 offered his resignation, though he maintained that he knew nothing about the bills until recent days. One of his former top aides, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lavrilleux, went on TV to take the blame. He said that he had not told anyone about the overspending. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy responsibility to do that \u2014 you\u2019d stop an electoral campaign in its tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the courage.\u201dHaving begun the process of cleaning house, the U.M.P. has time to reorganize, unify and prepare for the next presidential race, which is already the obsession of national politicians and the news media.But Mr. Sarkozy\u2019s party may not be able to make the Bygmalion scandal disappear. Open questions about the invoices remain, including suspicions that Mr. Cop\u00e9 may have used them to embezzle party funds. Bygmalion is run by two of Mr. Cop\u00e9\u2019s closest associates.The scandal could end up in the courts, popping up at an inopportune time for the U.M.P., as could any number of the other allegations that have swirled around Mr. Sarkozy since his time in office, including, for instance, allegations that he received millions in illegal funds for his successful 2007 presidential campaign from the former Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Mr. Hollande also has time to bolster his standing, especially if the economy finally improves.And of course, Ms. Le Pen, playing on a much bigger stage than she ever has, could make mistakes or otherwise see her image damaged before the next election.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama\u2019s Top Economist Has Some Problems With Piketty\u2019s Book", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIncome InequalityMr. Furman starts with a relatively straightforward description of Mr. Piketty\u2019s arguments and the rise in inequality in the United States over recent decades, trying to peel apart how much of that broad story \u2014 greater inequality in income and wealth than in the past \u2014 is attributable to changes in how people are paid for their labors and how much to a shift in returns and ownership of capital.There has been an increase in inequality within labor income, Mr. Furman argues. At the top end, superstars in fields like finance and sports are paid more than ever, both in absolute terms and relative to typical workers. Meanwhile, wages have been depressed at the middle and lower income brackets by such factors as technological change, a decline in unionization and a decline in the inflation-adjusted minimum wage.But while those changes are real and important, particularly in the United States, the crux of Mr. Piketty\u2019s argument is that the more important shift over the long run is toward enormous accumulations of wealth, in the form of capital, which, so long as returns on capital rise more quickly than the overall economy and taxes on capital remain low, can create a vicious cycle of ever-growing dynastic wealth. This is what happened, he argues, in the 19th century, a cycle broken only by the wars and political revolution of the first half of the 20th century.Or as Mr. Furman summarizes it in the prepared text of his speech: \u201cThe most striking argument in Piketty\u2019s book is that to the degree that growth rates slow in the future because of demographic or other factors, this will inevitably lead to a sustained increase in inequality.\u201dBut Mr. Furman isn\u2019t completely buying it. \u201cThis thesis is intriguing and an important source of concern,\u201d he said, \u201calthough it is unclear how likely it is. Piketty\u2019s prediction is that the capital share of income will rise, pushing in the direction of increased inequality. But this is only one of the determinants of inequality. While the trends may continue to shift in that direction, a more important factor to date has been the inequality within labor income, and while Piketty implicitly takes this to be fixed, there is no a priori basis to predict whether it will rise or fall in the future because it is a function of unpredictable technological developments, norms, institutions and public policies.\u201dIn other words, the starting point of Mr. Piketty\u2019s analysis is the trends that lead to superstars in a range of industries earning millions or billions of dollars, which they can in turn invest in capital that builds on itself. But there are no guarantees that the trend of recent decades in this direction will continue.Second, Mr. Furman argues that a central part of Mr. Piketty\u2019s thesis \u2014 that slowing economic growth would necessarily mean rates of return on capital that exceed overall growth \u2014 is not inevitable.\u201cIn general when growth rates fall, the ratio of capital to income rises, and the increased prevalence of capital drives down the rate of return on capital,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cWhether the return on capital falls more or less than the growth rate depends on how substitutable capital and labor are, with less substitutability meaning that the extra capital will be less useful, thus driving its return down more.\u201dIn other words, if growth slows, we would expect the return on capital to fall as well, though we can\u2019t say based on pure theory which will fall by more. It is possible, he says, that lower growth would lead the rate of return on capital to fall even more rapidly, which would \u201cpush in the direction of less inequality.\u201d(Mr. Furman also concedes that Mr. Piketty\u2019s assumption \u201cis a plausible reading of the aggregate data,\u201d it should be noted).In addressing his recommended policies for fighting global inequality, Mr. Furman mentions longstanding priorities of the Obama administration, such as expanding access to preschool, striking international trade deals and raising the minimum wage.There is no sign he is embracing the more radical solutions for rising inequality that Mr. Piketty recommends, such as drastically higher taxes on income in the highest brackets or a global 2 percent tax on wealth. For now, wrestling with the ideas contained in \u201cCapital,\u201d rather than the policy proposals, is the best that Piketty fans are going to get from the Obama administration.Advertisement"}

The current conventional wisdom touting \u201ccollege for all\u201d leads many thousands of kids each year into an endeavor for which they have no interest. They enroll in college because good jobs are scarce, and they are told they\u2019re doomed unless they tack on four very expensive years to their unhappy K-12 experience. They take out tens of thousands of dollars in loans and often end up dropping out.Now is the problem bad colleges? Maybe there are some. But the real problem is the failure of our economy to provide viable career paths \u2014 replete with on-the-job training \u2014 for children for whom academics are a big yawn. The writer is a teacher, author and researcher. To the Editor:Your article says, \u201cMany college leaders accuse the president of grasping for a simplistic solution to what they call a crisis of soaring tuition.\u201dCollege administrators are the primary cause of the soaring tuition, making frivolous decisions to spend money on items that have nothing to do with education itself \u2014 expensive student amenities, luxurious sports facilities, outlandish coach salaries \u2014 all in a competition to attract the best students. And the salaries of college presidents and other administrators have also soared, while overall faculty salaries have been cut by having fewer tenured positions and more adjunct faculty, who are cheap to hire, with no fringe benefits.To the medical industry, we keep repeating, \u201cHeal thyself,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t happen. To the presidents of the colleges, I also say, \u201cHeal thyself,\u201d and quit complaining about the threat of government intervention.To the Editor: I majored in philosophy in college, and I learned to think. I became a social worker, because my education taught me to value and pursue social justice. Under the rating system that President Obama recommends, I am a liability to institutions of higher learning, as are nurses, artists, writers, teachers, actors and others who use their education for something other than profit-oriented pursuits.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Common Sense at the Library", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialWhat will happen instead, according to the library: A more modest, cheaper, quicker and, by the looks of it, smarter plan. The Mid-Manhattan Library will stay put and be made beautiful, with computer labs and adult-education space. Closed rooms within the glorious Beaux-Arts main building will be opened to the public, and a new, permanent exhibition of treasured manuscripts and artifacts will be created. Book storage will be expanded into space under Bryant Park, where a 19th-century reservoir once sat. And, the library\u2019s officials say, this plan is affordable. The library\u2019s reversal was motivated by the best of reasons \u2014 what its president, Anthony Marx, aptly called \u201cthe facts.\u201d They include a budget that had swollen to $300 million and beyond, a sagging economy, and unexpected difficulties in building a new circulating library in the stacks beneath the Rose Reading Room. Beyond those particulars lay the intense derision the project had inspired among some critics, a cluster of lawsuits, and the skepticism of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was leery about the proposed sale of the Mid-Manhattan Library.Though the now-abandoned plan was widely mocked, the library\u2019s earlier goals, its need to raise money and stay relevant in the digital age while doing something about its white-elephant buildings, the Mid-Manhattan Library and its neglected Science, Industry and Business Library on 34th Street made sense at the time. But circumstances changed and Mr. Marx is right not to dig in, even though the library had already paid $9 million to the architect Norman Foster to design the new space. It\u2019s nice to know that for a venerable institution like the New York Public Library, old doesn\u2019t mean inflexible. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case Against the Bernanke-Obama Financial Rescue", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UpshotAtif Mian and Amir Sufi are convinced that the Great Recession could have been just another ordinary, lowercase recession if the federal government had acted more aggressively to help homeowners by reducing mortgage debts.\u201cIf you actually look at the argument that people like Mr. Geithner make, they almost always point to financial metrics like risk spreads and interest rates,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you look at the real economy, it just tends to come out in our favor.\u201d Millions of Americans remain unemployed almost five years after the formal end of the recession.Christina Romer, who led President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers during the recession, said the research by Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi had convinced her that she and other administration officials underestimated the importance of helping homeowners. But she said Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi, in turn, had underestimated both the economic impact of the financial crisis and the effectiveness of the government\u2019s response.Mr. Geithner wrote in his book that the administration had tried to help homeowners \u2014 and that doing more wouldn\u2019t have changed the trajectory of the recession. \u201cWe did not believe,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthough we looked at this question over and over, that a much larger program focused directly on housing could have a material impact on the broader economy.\u201dThe Road to a TheoryMr. Mian began by calling Equifax, the credit bureau, to ask whether he could buy data showing the debts of individual households, stripped of identifying information. He spoke with a series of flummoxed salespeople who gradually referred him to the head of sales \u2014 a woman who happened to live in Hyde Park, a few blocks away in Chicago.\u201cWe now have the ability to observe data in almost all the cases, so it\u2019s just a question of trying to convince the right parties, many of them in the private sector, to provide that data,\u201d Mr. Mian said. \u201cAnd she was willing to experiment with us.\u201dIn a series of papers, Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi gradually developed a theory of the boom and bust. They found evidence that lenders flush with cash had made increasingly risky loans. They found, for example, that lending volumes had risen fastest in areas where average incomes were actually in decline. This process continued until the borrowers started defaulting so quickly that the risks became impossible to ignore, and the loans dried up.When housing prices crashed, people lost their equity, but their debts did not disappear. They cut back on consumption, and the economy fell into recession. And, importantly, the households with the largest debt burdens cut back the most. Mr. Sufi and Mr. Mian found that for every $10,000 decline in home values, families with high debt burdens reduced spending on autos by $300, while families with low debt burdens reduced spending on autos by just $100.The housing crash, in other words, took away the greatest share of wealth from the part of the population that had been most likely to spend it. The point, Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi said, was that the economy had crashed the financial system.Mr. Sufi said he was delighted that policy makers were listening. \u201cIt was always the goal for me to write research that would be policy-relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I\u2019m pretty sure I just wanted to be right.\u201dYet some admirers of their research, like Ms. Romer, wonder whether Mr. Mian\u2019s and Mr. Sufi\u2019s book overstates the significance of their findings by asserting that debt was the driving force in the recession.Americans lost a similar amount of wealth during the housing crash as during the collapse of Internet-related stocks in 2000, but the economic consequences of the housing crash were much larger. The difference, in the view of Mr. Bernanke, the former Fed chairman, and other economists, is that the housing crash precipitated a financial crisis. Mr. Bernanke has noted that the worst of the economic downturn did not begin until the markets crashed in the fall of 2008, and that it ended once the financial crisis was arrested. The recovery has been slow, he has said, because of factors including cuts in government spending and Europe\u2019s malaise.Why Subsidize Debt?At times, Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi write as if debt is simply bad. In interviews, their views are more nuanced. They both have mortgages. They recognize that borrowing by governments and businesses can be productive. But they say the rules of debt are evolving in a direction that is bad for borrowers and bad for society.The people taking the risks are the ones with the least financial wherewithal to absorb setbacks. As a result, during an economic downturn, they tend to cut their spending most sharply. Standard economics sees little problem in this, because it assumes that interest rates will fall as a result, inducing others to spend more. But in a big downturn, rates would need to fall below zero to create a sufficient incentive. The only way out, Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi say, is for society either to forgive the debts, or to step in and impose some of the losses on the creditors instead of the borrowers.At a minimum, Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi say, they cannot understand why the government encourages borrowing, for example, through tax deductions for mortgage interest payments.\u201cYou need some kind of limit on where people can smoke, and you need some kind of limit on debt,\u201d Mr. Mian said. \u201cWhen there is an activity that is dangerous, you should tax it in one way or another. And instead we have a system that actively subsidizes debt.\u201dWhat we talk about when we talk about household debt, of course, is mostly mortgages. And the two men have a proposal for making mortgages better: Lenders would agree to ease debts during downturns; in exchange, lenders would get a percentage of any gains from the eventual sale of a home.Academics often find that in Washington, their diagnoses are taken more seriously than their prescriptions. And so it was when Mr. Mian described this \u201cshared-responsibility mortgage\u201d to the Senate Banking Committee in October 2011.\u201cI have to say, that\u2019s one of the oddest proposals I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who has a reputation for being among the more financially astute members of Congress. \u201cI doubt that will make it into the mainstream here.\u201dThe professors profess themselves unfazed.\u201cSomeone needs to talk about how things should be, and then hope that someone else takes it up,\u201d Mr. Mian said.Mr. Sufi added, \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to get people to appreciate what debt is, and what it does.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ukrainians Working in Italy Do What They Can to Help", "Date": "2014-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Mar\u2019yana Tril, one of the more than 192,000 Ukrainians who live and work in Italy, took an unscheduled holiday from her job as a babysitter in February. As the rebellion against the government mounted back home, so did the anguish of being away.\u201cYou\u2019re watching the news, and things are getting worse, so you can\u2019t resist,\u201d she said. \u201cI was up all night monitoring the situation on my computer, so I decided that I might as well go.\u201d Once she got there, she ended up driving some of the wounded to hospitals during the revolt that toppled Ukraine\u2019s former pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych.There are more Ukrainians living in Italy than in any other European Union country, according to Eurostat data. Nearly 80 percent of them are women who have easily found work here over the last two decades, often caring for Italy\u2019s aging population. In many cases, they enter on a tourist visa, and then overstay, finding live-in jobs through word-of-mouth contacts.Being so far from their own families at a time of deep uncertainty has intensified feelings of helplessness and anxiety, Ukrainians said in interviews. So they are doing what they can from a distance. Many protest weekly in front of the Russian Embassy in Rome. They have raised money and sent it home. Some are even training and organizing to help in the event of war with Russia.After returning to Rome, Ms. Tril, 29, said she enrolled in a first-aid course that was taught by two Ukrainian nurses. She was among about 100 Ukrainians who joined the \u201cRome Sotnia,\u201d she said, using the military term for company. \u201cWe\u2019re getting organized in case we have to leave.\u201dSvitlana Kovalska, president of the Association of Ukrainian Women Workers in Italy and a cultural mediator, spoke of \u201cthe Italian syndrome,\u201d a form of depression that has long affected Ukrainian immigrants here. Based on her experience helping Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, she said that the women who work as caregivers were acutely affected.\u201cThey live far from their families, feel enormous nostalgia and suffer a huge sense of guilt for not being with their families,\u201d Ms. Kovalska said. \u201cWhen I speak to women, they want to return. They\u2019re separated from their families, their kids, in a dangerous situation. It\u2019s natural that they\u2019re afraid of losing their kids, and the crisis has added new fears, new anxieties.\u201dThe widening conflict in Ukraine has produced a constant state of apprehension that \u201cinfluences us psychologically, making it difficult for many people to work,\u201d she said. \u201cThis grief is ruining our souls.\u201dFor some, going back to Ukraine, even if only briefly, temporarily assuages the anxiety. But many cannot go, and are coping through activism, protests and social networks.Lyudmyla D\u2019Ayala, one of the nurses who taught the training course that Ms. Tril attended, said the situation at home was such that knowledge of first-aid was essential for people who felt compelled to go home. \u201cBecause it\u2019s clear that this is a small war, drama can happen at any moment, so it\u2019s better to have people on the ground trained to deal with the casualties,\u201d she said.Ms. D\u2019Ayala spoke on the margins of a demonstration one recent Sunday afternoon that brought about 300 people to a square in front of a Roman train station where buses depart for Ukraine.Some women wore bright headbands of flowers, other protesters staged a performance piece recalling the Russian aggression of other Eastern bloc countries, still others used a microphone to declaim poetry amid diatribes against Russian aggression. People wept when a song about the people who died in the Maidan, the square in Kiev at the center of the protests, was broadcast. \u201cIt\u2019s never been about joining the European Union or the euro,\u201d Ms. D\u2019Ayala said, \u201cit\u2019s about fighting for democracy.\u201d But even in their shared opposition to Russia, there were catcalls and whistles when some of the participants in the rally took the microphone to campaign for diverse candidates in Ukraine\u2019s presidential election, scheduled for May 25.The protests should not become sounding boards for political speeches, said Anna, one Ukrainian woman who declined to give her surname for fear of creating problems with her employer. \u201cOur people are dying and we\u2019re squabbling over candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re here we can have different opinions,\u201d she said. \u201cbut we have to be together.\u201dDuring the early days of the protests in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Ukrainians in Rome and other Italian cities used such rallies to raise about 20,000 euros, or $27,000, organizers said. Volunteers continue to collect primary goods, pharmaceuticals and clothing.\u201cPeople gave one or two euros to support the cause,\u201d said Oles Horodetskyi, the head of the Christian Association of Ukrainians in Italy, and one of the organizers of the Rome protests. \u201cThere was a solidarity among people I hadn\u2019t seen for some time,\u201d he said last month during a Thursday afternoon rally. He has since gone to Ukraine to help coordinate the support of his compatriots in Italy.Often the women who work here as caregivers are already the principal providers for their families back in Ukraine. \u201cLots of women become A.T.M. machines for their families, which is a tragedy,\u201d Ms. Kovalska said.Maria Hladets was looking for some economic relief when she decided to emigrate from Ukraine eight years ago. \u201cLife was unlivable, we had Italian prices, but I was earning 150 euro a month,\u201d said Ms. Hladets, who is a full-time caregiver.She has been sending money home, and joining in the protests, too. \u201cI have been coming every week,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t want to sit at home and cry in front of the television.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tempering Excitement for the E.C.B.'s Measures", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 At last, the European Central Bank seems ready to shoot some adrenalin into the moribund euro zone economy. After a news conference last week, when Mario Draghi strongly hinted at action to come after the E.C.B. council meeting on June 5, this week brought a host of interviews and media leaks describing quite specifically the new ideas the bank has in mind. The measure, which is now almost a foregone conclusion, will be a cut in the interest rate the E.C.B. pays on bank deposits from zero to a negative 0.1 percent or 0.2 percent. Beyond that, E.C.B. officials have suggested several additional stimulus measures: extension of loans to commercial banks at very low fixed rates for three or even five years, purchases by the E.C.B. of bank loans to small and midsize enterprises packaged into asset-backed securities, and concessional lending to European banks on condition that they pass on these funds to those businesses. These announcements generated quite a lot of enthusiasm: The euro weakened from almost $1.40 to $1.37, bond yields in Italy and Spain fell to record lows and European stock markets jumped between 1 percent and 2 percent. On Wednesday the market reaction even crossed the Atlantic, with interest rates on United States Treasury bonds falling to their lowest levels in six months. Sadly, however, investors may be overexcited about the E.C.B.\u2019s plans. Even assuming all the reports about the plans turn out to be true \u2014 and several times recently the E.C.B. has not followed through on similar rumors \u2014 it is far from clear that these policies would have much impact on the big economic problems facing the euro zone: feeble economic growth and mass unemployment, a continuing credit crunch for small and midsize enterprises in southern Europe, huge imbalances in competitiveness between Germany and the rest of the euro zone, and deflationary pressures that create debt traps and balance-sheet recessions in the peripheral economies.A negative interest rate on deposits, the measure that has been watched closely, is unlikely to have much effect for two reasons. First, the banks that have excess cash to park at the E.C.B. are by definition the stronger ones, most of them in Germany, France and northern European countries. These banks do not need further incentives to lend to their customers, because credit is readily available to both businesses and households in those countries. The credit crunch that needs to be relieved is in Italy, Spain and other \u201cperipheral\u201d countries \u2014 and the banks in these economies are generally much weaker. Their reluctance to lend to customers is mainly due to their lack of capital, not their eagerness to hoard cash at the E.C.B. If negative E.C.B. deposit rates now eliminate the meager profits these institutions can earn by placing excess liquidity in the interbank market, their capital positions may, on balance, deteriorate, and it is hard to see how this would increase their ability to lend. Second, although negative interest rates may grab media headlines, there is nothing magical about their economic effect. This has been demonstrated by the experiences in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland, where negative interest rates have been used to discourage excessive capital inflows and to try to weaken currencies that were deemed too strong. In all these cases, the effects of imposing what amounts to a small tax on bank deposits turned out to be quite modest. To achieve the desired results, negative rates had to be supplemented with other measures, like foreign exchange intervention or aggressive expansion of central balance sheets, which amounted in one way or another to \u201cprinting money\u201d and using it to buy government bonds. And printing money to buy government bonds, in the manner of American, British and Japanese quantitative easing, is the one kind of measure still ruled out for Europe by German opposition, as Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank president, confirmed this week. To be more precise, Mr. Weidmann has ruled out easing in Europe unless and until the other measures now planned by the E.C.B. have been tried and found wanting. The problem with the step-by-step approach favored by the E.C.B. under pressure from the Bundesbank is that every step taken becomes an excuse for delaying the next step. Experience suggests that E.C.B. economists may well spend months \u201canalyzing\u201d and \u201cstudying\u201d the consequences of negative deposit rates before they decide to move onto other measures such as purchasing small and midsize enterprise loans. And even if the E.C.B. does move faster than in the past and announces a package next month combining both negative interest rates and business loans, this may not do much for southern Europe without action to encourage investment and spending by businesses and consumers, as well as increasing the availability of credit by easing the regulatory pressure on undercapitalized banks. What would really help these countries would be a relaxation of fiscal policies or a direct injection of government-backed credit into small and midsize businesses, along the lines of the government-backed mortgages that have transformed the British economy.Unfortunately, neither fiscal easing nor any kind of government-backed credit expansion seems to be an option for southern Europe, because it would directly conflict with the deficit-reduction programs and bank restructuring regimes imposed by the European Commission and the E.C.B. The upshot is that E.C.B. action will probably prove just sufficient to prevent the euro zone economy from deteriorating any further, and the attainment of this stability will be offered as a reason not to do anything more ambitious, either by way of monetary stimulus or the easing of fiscal and regulatory constraints. A continuation of Japanese-style stagnation thus seems the most likely prospect for most of Europe despite, or perhaps because of, the half-hearted action that can now be expected from the E.C.B.

{"Headline": "Celebrating Sainthood and Witnessing Barbarity", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThe Catholic Church\u2019s canonization of two of its recent popes and the grotesquely botched execution of a murderer in Oklahoma last week stood at opposite ends of the moral scale. Yet there was something about the two events \u2014 the public affirmation of a religious order in the one and the medieval barbarity of the other \u2014 that seemed to challenge the popular image of a linear march of human progress.All the while, the drumbeat of civil war grew louder in southeastern Ukraine as the caretaker government in Kiev launched a new bid to retake Slovyansk, one of the cities in eastern Ukraine seized by pro-Russian secessionists. Russia, which has tens of thousands of troops massed on the Ukrainian border, warned anew that it reserved the right to intervene to protect Russian residents of eastern Ukraine, who, in Moscow\u2019s propaganda, were being attacked by Ukrainian \u201cultranationalistic organizations\u201d supported by American \u201cmercenaries.\u201dCanonizing Two PopesThe canonization of John XXIII and John Paul II by their successor, Pope Francis, with his retired predecessor, Benedict XVI, standing by and a vast throng of cardinals, bishops, priests and more than a million pilgrims and visitors filling St. Peter\u2019s Square and spilling out across Rome, provided an intriguing blend of ancient tradition and modern politics.The secular press, focused as it is on discernible fact, always has trouble covering religion, with its source in something that is by definition unprovable but held to be absolute. Accordingly, the theology of sainthood, in which the church recognizes select people as worthy of veneration for lives of \u201cheroic virtue,\u201d with its complex rules and requirements of scientifically confirmed miracles \u2014 an oxymoron that is definitely tough for the media to grasp \u2014 figured less in coverage of the theology than the politics.And politics there were. The fact that Pope Francis chose to canonize his two predecessors simultaneously \u2014 the processes were initiated before he became pope \u2014 was perceived by many commentators as yet another wise balancing act by a pontiff who after barely a year in the Vatican has won broad respect for his personal humility and his efforts to reunite the various strands of the Catholic Church.John XXIII, pope from 1958 to 1963, was an Italian with a common touch and warm humor, for which he came to be called \u201cthe Good Pope.\u201d He is revered by liberal Catholics \u2014 and frowned upon by traditionalists \u2014 for convening the Second Vatican Council, which modernized many aspects of Catholic doctrine. John Paul II, 1978 to 2005, was a charismatic Pole who traveled the world in his nearly 27-year reign and became a symbol of the struggle against Communism. He was lauded by many conservative Catholics, who saw him as an antidote to \u201cthe spirit of Vatican II.\u201dThe Execution DebateThe opposition to capital punishment in the United States has generally centered on two issues \u2014 the risk of executing an innocent person, and whether execution violates the Constitution\u2019s ban on \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. Nobody disputes that Clayton Lockett was not innocent \u2014 in 1999 he beat and shot a 19-year-old woman and had accomplices bury her alive so she would not tell the police about how they had gang-raped her friend. It is harder to argue that his execution on Tuesday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Okla., was neither cruel nor unusual.The execution was supposed to be the first of two that night \u2014 the other of a murderer named Charles Warner. The timeline subsequently reported by Robert Patton, director of the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, established that after Mr. Lockett was tied down on the execution table, a technician was unable to find a vein for the IV and after a long search, eventually inserted it in the groin area. The warden then went ahead and released midazolam, a sedative intended to knock Mr. Lockett out, and a doctor declared that he was unconscious. The warden then released vecuronium bromide, which paralyzes the respiratory system, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Both would cause excruciating pain if the recipient was conscious. And, as it turned out, they did, since the vein with the IV collapsed, and Mr. Lockett was apparently conscious and in acute pain for over 20 minutes before his heart gave out. Mr. Warner\u2019s execution was put off.The botched execution raised a chorus of protest from opponents of the death penalty in the United States and in Europe, and it was certain to revive the question of whether execution by lethal injection constitutes \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d punishment. The method was initially introduced precisely because it was supposed to be more humane than the electric chair or the gallows.Part of the dispute focuses on the fact that Oklahoma and several other states have pulled a cloak of secrecy over their sources of lethal drugs, since American manufacturers have stopped producing those previously used and European pharmaceutical companies have refused to supply these or any other. Several states have therefore sought out compounding pharmacies to provide the drugs, and have refused to provide any information about them. Oklahoma provided only the names of the chemicals, but no details or information about the supplier.The Struggle for SlovyanskThe struggle over Ukraine escalated on Friday when the Ukrainian government launched a bid to retake Slovyansk, a rebel-controlled city that has become a flash point in the struggle between Ukrainian authorities in Kiev and Russia-backed secessionists in eastern Ukraine.The fighting immediately sparked a war of words among Russia, the United States and Europe. The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was \u201coutraged\u201d by the offensive and called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. As it has throughout the crisis, Russia described the Ukrainian armed forces as \u201cultranationalistic organizations\u201d and claimed, without evidence, that there were \u201cEnglish-speaking officers\u201d among the attackers.In Washington, President Barack Obama and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, jointly warned of further and tougher sanctions if Russia failed to \u201cchange course.\u201d Mr. Obama said the next round would target unspecified sectors of the Russian economy. Previous sanctions by the United States and the European Union have largely targeted individual Russian officials or separatist leaders.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Italian Confidence Undimmed by Statistics", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE Italian economy has been a laggard for years. In the final quarter of 2013, it registered scant growth of just 0.3 percent at an annual rate, and that was a great improvement. Before that, it had shrunk for nine consecutive quarters. The economy remains smaller than it was 14 years ago. Unemployment has climbed to nearly 13 percent, twice its level in early 2008.What is going on? There may be some enthusiasm for changes proposed by the government to raise domestic demand and increase job creation. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi wants to reduce individual income taxes and raise taxes on income from financial instruments \u2014 although he would exempt from those increases the income from Italian government bonds. But there also is relief that the euro zone crisis seems to have eased. The Italian stock market is up more than 25 percent over the last 12 months, and yields on Italian government bonds have plunged. In April the yield on Italian five-year bonds fell below 2 percent \u2014 the lowest since the euro zone was created in 1999.The new consumer confidence survey found that in April, 44.2 percent of respondents said they expected the economy to be good, or very good, a year from now. That was the highest level of optimism since 1996.To be sure, 23.8 percent of those surveyed forecast an economy that would be bad, or very bad. In many countries, such a high level of pessimism might be alarming. But in Italy, it is an encouraging figure. Not since 2010, when the country seemed to be pulling out of the recession and the European credit crisis had not yet begun, had that figure been so low. That is an astonishing rate, but at least it has slipped a bit in each of the last two months. The consumer confidence survey showed that pessimism on unemployment remained high, but had declined. Nearly half \u2014 47.5 percent \u2014 of the respondents expected unemployment to rise over the next year, but it was the first monthly survey since 2008 in which the figure was not over 50 percent. The proportion expecting unemployment to decline was just 21.6 percent, but that figure was higher than at any time since 2002. The remaining respondents either had no opinion or expected the rate to remain stable. In most countries, a survey that showed there were more than twice as many pessimists as optimists on future unemployment would not be viewed as a good sign. But in Italy, that is a big improvement.Advertisement"}

As its name \u2014 meaning \u201cthe exchange\u201d \u2014 suggests, the restaurant in Turin, Italy, held sway among the city\u2019s upper class and the occasional star passing through. Mozart, Nietzsche, Maria Callas and Audrey Hepburn have been among its two and a half centuries of boldface patrons, and members of Turin\u2019s Agnelli dynasty have been regulars for generations. Though Napoleon\u2019s regime briefly Frenchified its name as Caf\u00e9 du Change, the original Italian had been reinstated by the time it became the unofficial dining room of the country\u2019s first parliament. But the fortunes of the restaurant were tethered to the city\u2019s: Turin\u2019s once-thriving industry tumbled in the 1980s and \u201990s, regaining some momentum when the city hosted the Olympics in 2006. The costs, however, left the economy limping. By 2012, the luster of Del Cambio had long faded and it was on the brink of bankruptcy, which is when the investor and Turin native Michele Denegri stepped in to buy it.\u201cWhen I was growing up in the \u201970s, this was a city for old people. And so was Del Cambio, with its horrible food and its staid interiors,\u201d he says. Today the city is having a renaissance \u2014 it\u2019s home to the original Eataly, and it\u2019s the capital of the increasingly influential Slow Food movement. Signifying true boom times, Turin-based Fiat gained full control of Chrysler this year and recently announced plans to increase the plant\u2019s annual production. Denegri wanted a restaurant worthy of his newly thriving city. Using Jack Clayton\u2019s \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d and Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d as visual references, he enlisted the help of art dealer Franco Noero and interior decorator Marco Segantin to revamp the place.A team of 100 restorers, carpenters and upholsterers rehabili-tated the main salon\u2019s 19th-century frescoes and regilded the boiserie. To inject modernity into the Old World space, Denegri commissioned the Israeli artist Izhar Patkin to graffiti 200 S\u00e8vres platters. Through a grand passageway is a second dining room, paneled in artwork by Michelangelo Pistoletto. The London-based Italian designer Martino Gamper created round tables with modernist wood inlays and plush red velvet chairs. Up a new marble staircase lies Bar Cavour \u2014 named for the leader of the Risorgimento, another Del Cambio regular \u2014 a vaulted room decorated in a calligraphed mural by Venezuelan artist Arturo Herrera.Despite the expense lavished on the interiors, Denegri intends to instill a sense of democracy in Del Cambio. His family would likely not have been regulars in the old days \u2014 he proudly notes that his grandfather drove a taxi in the city. While Denegri cites as inspiration exclusive spots like Wiltons in London and the Plaza Hotel in New York (before its 1999 renovation, he notes), he is quick to point out that the spirit here is not classist, and his staff will make everyone feel at ease.Part of transforming Del Cambio from a symbol of the city\u2019s haute bourgeoisie into a true destination is the appointment of a great chef. Matteo Baronetto, 36, who had worked for nearly two decades under Milan-based chef Carlo Cracco \u2014 of \u201cI Am Love\u201d fame \u2014 agreed to come if Denegri would give him a custom French kitchen. Three days later he was in Turin.The kitchen includes a dining area where guests can watch 14 cooks in action. Baronetto\u2019s menu features hazelnut consomm\u00e9 with steamed shrimp in an elderflower sauce, and an award-winning cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e made with extra-virgin olive oil, vanilla pods and squid. His signature dish, though, is a lighter version of traditional la Finanziera (veal sweetbreads). Baronetto echoes Denegri when he explains Del Cambio\u2019s real draw: \u201cthe idea of returning to my own Piedmontese roots.\u201dWHEN IN TURINAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Ends Meet at Walmart", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFair GameThis has not been a good year for Walmart shareholders. Amid a torrid market over the last 12 months, this giant retailer\u2019s stock has flatlined, reflecting a slowdown in sales growth. Nor was it a great year for many Walmart customers. In fact, the company cited a sluggish economy and cuts in federal food stamps for its weak sales increase of 1.6 percent in fiscal 2014. (Growth was 5 percent the previous year.) When you stop buying food, you know things are bad.But Walmart executives aren\u2019t feeling the same pain. While the company\u2019s malaise is clearly laid out in financial tables \u2014 numbers don\u2019t lie, after all \u2014 when it comes to figuring the performance pay of top executives, let\u2019s just say the numbers can be made to fib. I\u2019ll let Walmart\u2019s proxy filing explain. Each year, when measuring top executives\u2019 performance for pay purposes, the company says it makes various \u201cadjustments\u201d to its recorded financial results. In 2014, those adjustments resulted in better performance than reported in the audited statements. That enhanced performance meant higher incentive pay for executives.Walmart routinely adjusts its results for pay calculations, the proxy said, so they can be \u201ccomputed on a comparable basis from performance period to performance period.\u201d The company wants to exclude the impact of what accountants sometimes call extraordinary items \u2014 events not likely to happen again the next year. David Tovar, a Walmart spokesman, said the adjustments were intended to encourage executives to make the right decisions for the business. \u201cFor example, we don\u2019t want a delay in restructuring or store closings to be influenced because management could take into consideration how it might impact their bonus,\u201d he said.Sometimes, these adjustments have brought down executive pay at Walmart; this occurred in 2012. But adjustments for the dismal 2014 wound up padding it. This year, the company included far more adjustments than in recent years. The impact of 11 \u201csignificant\u201d items \u2014 including store closings, delays in store openings and the sale of operations \u2014 was eliminated from its results. In each of the four previous years, the number of adjustments never exceeded five. The current adjustments essentially make the costs or lost income disappear when figuring performance pay. Consider the case of William S. Simon, president and C.E.O. of Walmart\u2019s United States unit. Under Walmart\u2019s pay plan, he would receive some incentive pay if sales grew more than 2 percent. The trouble was, Walmart\u2019s United States sales rose only 1.8 percent in fiscal 2014. That meant Mr. Simon would miss his threshold. Enter the adjustments.After adjusting for certain items relating to the company\u2019s sales, the Walmart unit eked out a growth rate of 2.03 percent in 2014. On the strength of that \u201cadjusted\u201d performance, Mr. Simon received $1.5 million, the proxy noted. His total compensation was $13 million last year.What adjustments helped Mr. Simon clear the bar? One action that the company took was to eliminate the decline in its United States sales that occurred after the government cut food stamp benefits \u2014 formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, or SNAP \u2014 by 5 percent last November. That reduction in benefits hurt Walmart\u2019s sales, the company acknowledged, because many customers use food stamps in its stores. But for executive-pay purposes, that sales decline never happened. And that meant a bigger payday for Mr. Simon.Mr. Tovar said the adjustment relating to SNAP benefits was significantly smaller than those made because of\u00a0store closures, transactions or other one-time events.\u00a0There\u2019s more. When figuring cash incentive pay, the company requires performance to exceed another threshold relating to its operating income. The bar is low \u2014 the company\u2019s total operating income could decline by 1.5 percent, the proxy said, and executives would still earn a minimum cash incentive payout. Again, the adjustments provided a crucial lift. According to the company\u2019s annual financial filing, its actual operating income fell by 3.1 percent. But after making its adjustments \u2014 presto chango \u2014 the growth rate became a positive 1 percent. Six of Walmart\u2019s top executives received a total of $8.42 million in cash incentive payments for 2014, the proxy said. Mr. Tovar declined to specify how much of that was generated by the adjustments.This year\u2019s adjustments also differed from earlier years in an interesting way. Previously, the company said the changes were made \u201cto ensure that our incentive plans reward underlying operational performance, disregarding factors that are beyond the control of our executives.\u201d This year, that language has disappeared from the proxy. I asked the Walmart spokesman if this change meant that the company was now making adjustments to factors that are within the control of its executives. He said no, but that the company wanted \u201cto make our disclosures more transparent.\u201dMary Pat Tifft, who lives in Kenosha, Wis., is a longtime Walmart shareholder as well as an employee \u2014 an associate, in Walmart parlance \u2014 of more than 20 years. She thinks these adjustments are the equivalent of an athlete moving the goal posts. \u201cWalmart associates are having their hours cut because of declining sales but executives are still getting their bonuses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that they can keep receiving their compensation because they keep moving the numbers around.\u201d The average full-time hourly Walmart employee makes about $27,000 a year. Ms. Tifft, along with her colleagues Charmaine Givens-Thomas and Janet L. Sparks, tried to get a shareholder proposal onto the agenda at this year\u2019s annual meeting of Walmart stockholders in June. The proposal would have required the executive pay calculations to include a measure that shows management addressing employee needs.Walmart contended that it should be able to keep the proposal off its ballot because it had \u201csubstantially implemented the proposal.\u201d Last summer, the company surveyed its 2.2 million associates, Mr. Tovar said, and 71 percent, a record high, said they felt that management was responsive to employees.\u00a0\u201cAs a shareholder and an associate, I thought the resolution was very important for Walmart,\u201d Ms. Givens-Thomas said in an interview. \u201cAssociates want more accountability for Walmart resources so we can all enjoy the benefits.\u201dStockholders and employees are certainly entitled to share in the benefits of a well-run company. But the way Walmart adjusts its results on behalf of executives indicates pretty clearly who comes first. Advertisement"}

Prices for new homes fell in eight of the 70 cities in April from the previous month, up from four cities in March. Prices for existing homes dropped month-on-month in 22 cities in April, compared with 14 in March, the data showed.\u201cThe home prices in 70 major cities were generally stable and the gains were easing,\u201d Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the bureau, said in a news release accompanying the data.The price data followed official figures last week that showed property investment, construction activities and sales slowing across the country.Beijing has spent more than four years trying to tame rising home prices, and the measures started to take hold toward the end of last year.The slowdown in the property market helped pull down annual economic growth to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter of 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Egyptian Tourism\u2019s Message to World: Come Anyway", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat is putting it mildly. For three years now, political turmoil has scared many travelers away from Egypt, leaving millions of people whose livelihoods depend on visitors desperate for any sign of an end to the most sustained tourism crisis anyone here can recall.The loss of tourism has taken a disastrous toll on the economy, starving the country of income and badly needed foreign currency. Now many people in Egypt talk not just about short-term pain but long-term damage, as workers forsake years of training and experience to hunt for new jobs outside the industry, and students abandon what had been the country\u2019s most promising career track.Others, though, are holding out, nervously watching their nest eggs dwindle as they wait for things to improve. \u201cWhat was saved has been spent,\u201d said Raafat Ferghani Khattab, a guide in Cairo who called tourism the family business.Mr. Khattab, whose grandfather showed a Swedish king the sights in the early 20th century, said tourism was \u201cthe nerve system of the middle class.\u201d It is not just families like his that are suffering, he said; the ripples from the crisis have affected people like the farmers who supply organic fruit to hotels, and even pharmacists with shops in resort areas. \u201cThey are back to square one,\u201d he said.Tourism officials who tried last year to persuade the world that fears about Egypt were overblown are turning now to increasingly imaginative pitches, like promoting a spiritual retreat in a Cairo park, meant to sell a country that until recently sold itself.Having given up on trying to attract business from the United States or many European countries, officials have focused instead on Arab tourists, hoping that regional good will and nostalgia for Egypt will trump concerns about safety. \u201cThey are comfortable here,\u201d Rasha al-Azaizy, a tourism ministry spokeswoman, said of Arab visitors, who traditionally made up a fifth of Egypt\u2019s tourists. The government is also taking aim at more unlikely markets, including Latvia, perhaps in the hope that adventurous tourists are to be found there.In 2010, before the political crisis, almost 15 million foreign tourists visited Egypt, officials said; last year the figure fell to 9.5 million. Most of the visitors these days are beachgoers who avoid Cairo and other cultural destinations, limiting the reach of the money they spend. But the resort business is under threat, too, after the attack on the bus in Sinai, which was quickly followed by travel warnings from several European countries.The crisis has been a boon to a trickle of travelers who have ignored the warnings and found five-star hotel accommodations available for a song close to prime beaches and historic sites.At the same time, workers at Egypt\u2019s most famous attractions have had to get used to an unsettling quiet. At the pyramids in Giza, hawkers seem to outnumber tourists most mornings by about 10 to one. In the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, employees napped in their chairs one recent afternoon while a handful of people lingered around King Tutankhamen\u2019s gleaming funerary mask, unhurried by any crowds.Outside the building, dozens of soldiers and police officers stood guard next to armored vehicles and trucks, a visible reminder of the strife that has isolated the country. Some may have been there to protect the treasures and the tourists, but many were holding tear gas launchers, ready to disperse crowds in case protesters dared to march on Tahrir Square nearby.Egypt will hold a presidential election in three weeks, which is expected to be won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who led the military takeover of the government in July and then served as defense minister and de facto leader of the country. His supporters pin great hopes on his presidency, saying that the popular military leader will bring a firm hand to Egypt\u2019s spiraling crises, including the drop-off in tourism. Mr. Sisi has pointed to his background growing up in Cairo\u2019s historic districts as evidence that he understands the industry.Some of Egypt\u2019s tour operators are skeptical, though, that the election will bring any immediate relief. In the past, tourism rebounded quickly from calamities, including deadly militant attacks on tourists, they say, but this time there is a broader loss of confidence in Egypt from overseas, a problem that clever slogans and confident leadership cannot easily repair.In the garden outside the museum on a recent afternoon, desperate guides chased after a group of tourists from Thailand, only to learn that the Thais needed no guides because they had brought along Egyptian friends to show them around. A shopkeeper in the museum lobby stood in his stall, among maps and guidebooks no one was buying, recalling the boom years, when \u201cyou couldn\u2019t step a foot inside this museum.\u201dAlaa Mosaad, a 37-year-old tour operator who sat in a nearly empty patio restaurant, said he was afraid that the downturn in tourism \u201cwill last another three or four years.\u201d Like many in the industry, Mr. Mosaad has taken up other work \u2014 in his case, teaching German \u2014 to pay the bills.His colleague Mohamed Atef, 30, noted that the succession of new governments over the last few years had each promised greater stability. But for all that, he said, \u201cthe situation of the country is getting worse.\u201dAsmaa Al Zohairy contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pro-European Businessman Claims Victory in Ukraine Presidential Vote", "Date": "2014-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Caught in a battle for influence between Russia and the West, Ukrainians elected Petro O. Poroshenko as president on Sunday, turning to a pro-European billionaire to lead them out of six months of turmoil.The special election was called by Parliament to replace Viktor F. Yanukovych, who fled Kiev on Feb. 21 after a failed but bloody attempt to suppress a civic uprising, and whose toppling as president set off Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of Crimea.\u201cThe first steps of our team at the beginning of the presidential work will be to put an end to war, to put an end to chaos, to end disorder, and to bring peace to the land of Ukraine \u2014 united, unitary Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said in a speech at an arts center in Kiev, where he declared victory shortly after the polls closed. He added, \u201cWe need to do all our best to bring in European values.\u201dMr. Poroshenko appeared for his victory speech with Vitali Klitschko, the former champion boxer, a leader of the street protests that deposed Mr. Yanukovych. Mr. Klitschko was elected on Sunday as mayor of Kiev.In his remarks, Mr. Poroshenko said he would push for early parliamentary elections \u2014 this year \u2014 answering a demand by critics of the Yanukovych government who have said installing a new president is not sufficient.13 PhotosLegislative elections would have a potentially far-reaching effect, not just reshaping Parliament but also allowing for an entirely new government. In February, lawmakers voted to return to a 2004 version of the Constitution, which designates Parliament, not the president, to choose a prime minister and cabinet members.Despite formidable obstacles in the east, where armed separatists largely prevented voting on Sunday, election officials reported robust turnout throughout the rest of the country. Opora, a monitoring group, estimated turnout nationwide at 60 percent.International observers also predicted that the presidential vote would receive high marks in meeting standards of fairness. \u201cThere was a sense of determination about it \u2014 to get it right,\u201d said Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state who was in Kiev as an observer. \u201cIn many ways, Ukraine spoke through its vote.\u201dPresident Obama issued a statement praising the vote and reiterating that the United States does not accept Russia\u2019s seizing of Crimea. \u201cDespite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls,\u201d he said.Although Mr. Poroshenko, 48, won in a landslide, he faces skepticism even among many who voted for him because they are wary of his status as a billionaire businessman and because he is a veteran in Ukraine\u2019s notoriously corrupt politics.He has been a longtime member of Parliament, where he briefly served as speaker, and was minister of trade and economic development under Mr. Yanukovych and foreign minister under the previous president, Viktor A. Yushchenko.Mr. Poroshenko has vowed repeatedly to set Ukraine on a pro-European course, and has pledged to sign the political and trade agreements with the European Union that Mr. Yanukovych abandoned, setting off the uprising last fall.But Mr. Poroshenko has deep business interests in Russia and has previously served in pro-Russian governments, creating some optimism in Moscow that negotiations are possible. In a sign of the intricate, even personal, nature of the relationship, the Russian government seized bank accounts in Russia belonging to Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s chocolate company, Roshen, this year and closed its factory and warehouse in southern Russia as part of an investigation into unspecified criminal charges.Mr. Poroshenko has expressed a willingness to mend ties with Russia, but on Sunday he insisted those discussions would also have to involve Ukraine\u2019s territorial claim to Crimea.Regarding the insurrection, Mr. Poroshenko has repeatedly called for armed separatists to be brought to justice, but he also focused his campaign on the bread-and-butter issues of jobs and the economy, as well as a populist anticorruption message.\u201cWe will do the absolutely unique transformation of the country,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said at a polling site before voting, \u201cwith zero tolerance to corruption, with a very good investment climate, with an independent court system, with all the necessary things to attract business.\u201dIt will not be easy. Mr. Poroshenko inherits an interim government that is unpopular in much of the country, and regarded as illegitimate by many in the east.Ukraine will be under continuing pressure from Russia, which is demanding billions of dollars for unpaid natural-gas bills, and has made clear that it could cripple the Ukrainian economy at any moment with trade sanctions. There is also pressure from the International Monetary Fund, which has laid out strict requirements, including austerity measures, in exchange for $27 billion in emergency credit that saved the country from default.In Kiev, there were long lines at polling stations, and voters generally expressed resolve that the country needed to open a new chapter, with a new leader, even if many expressed some disappointment in the choices offered.\u201cWe are stuck in everything,\u201d said Tatyana Zhukova, a retired engineer, who said she had just voted for Mr. Poroshenko. \u201cI don\u2019t see new leaders.\u201dIlya Danko, 31, an architect, said he had voted for Mr. Poroshenko with the hope of calming the country by avoiding a second round. \u201cIt\u2019s like choosing the best from the worst,\u201d he said.Mr. Danko, who participated in the street protests that led to Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s ouster, said he had no doubt that Ukraine should follow a European course.\u201cI personally just compare for many years Ukraine and Poland, because we were at the rather same starting point about 15 years ago,\u201d Mr. Danko said. \u201cNow when I go to Warsaw or Krakow, I see a European country, a very economically developed country, and Ukraine, the main problem is this corruption; it has blocked the normal flow of evolution of development.\u201dStill, there was a strong sense of the momentousness of the vote, with many wearing vyshyvankas, embroidered Ukrainian national shirts, to show patriotism.Ivan Grinko, 27, a doctor, wore face paint and a T-shirt emblazoned with the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag as he arrived to vote in central Kiev. \u201cPeople want peace,\u201d Mr. Grinko said. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s higher salaries.\u201dSunday\u2019s vote has had the broad support of leaders in Europe and the United States, who view it as a crucial step to installing a pro-Western government. In St. Petersburg, Mr. Putin, too, expressed support on Saturday. \u201cWe will respect any choice made by the Ukrainian people,\u201d he said at a round-table interview with international news agencies.Violence, including sporadic mortar shelling and gunfire, continued in eastern Ukraine over the weekend. An Italian news photographer, Andrea Rocchelli, 30, and a Russian human rights advocate, Andrei Mironov, 60, working as his interpreter, were killed Saturday by mortar fire, Ukrainian officials said.Mr. Poroshenko singled out voters in the east, known as Donbass, for thanks and praise. \u201cCitizens of Donbass, even in those conditions where participation in elections was connected with health and life risks, took part in voting,\u201d he said.In Kiev, Oleh Kovalenko, 53, who works as a driver, said he happily voted for Mr. Poroshenko. \u201cLet one of the richest men in the country \u2014 a Chocolate King \u2014 rule, and this chaos is over as soon as possible,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number of months that have passed since Viktor F. Yanukovych was ousted as president of Ukraine. It has been three months, not four.Reporting was contributed by Sabrina Tavernise and Andrew Roth from Donetsk, Ukraine; Neil MacFarquhar from Moscow; and Oksana Lyachynksa and Daniel Rzhenetskyy from Kiev.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once More, Economy Exhibits Weakness", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs has happened so many times since the recovery began nearly five years ago, the economy turned in another disappointing quarterly performance, surprising even the most pessimistic observers as growth in the first three months of 2014 slowed to a near-standstill.While that optimism was reassuring for Wall Street, which rallied after the Fed announcement, the view in the rear-view mirror was as bleak as a January walk along the Hudson River. In their initial estimate for growth in the months of January, February and March, government statisticians said output expanded at an annual rate of just 0.1 percent, although experts noted that figure was affected by one-time headwinds like unusually cold weather and slower inventory gains after businesses aggressively built up stockpiles in the second half of 2013.With more volatile factors like trade and inventory swings excluded, the pace of growth in domestic demand was about 1.5 percent in the first quarter, just slightly below where it was in the fourth quarter of 2013, while consumer spending increased at a healthy 3 percent rate.For all the attention devoted to the quarterly fluctuations, the current underlying rate of expansion is not much different from the frustratingly slow trajectory in place ever since the economy began to recover from the Great Recession. The average quarterly rate of growth since the summer of 2009 stands at 2.2 percent.Even if activity picks up in the current quarter and the second half of the year, said Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, a large insurer, the annual growth rate in 2014 will most likely still be below the post-World War II average just over 3 percent.\u201cWe\u2019ve been living in sub 3-percent land, and people have gotten used to that as the new normal,\u201d Mr. North said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not. It\u2019s anemic.\u201dWith midterm congressional elections on the horizon in November, the seeming inability of the economy to gain any sustained momentum is also likely to weigh on the fortunes of Democrats up for re-election on Capitol Hill, since their prospects are in many ways tied to voter attitudes toward the performance of President Obama. His poll numbers have been sinking, and although there have been some encouraging economic signs recently, like a surging stock market and a gradual fall in the unemployment rate, much of the electorate remains very skeptical that things are getting any better.Moreover, the rebound of the housing market after the crisis in the middle part of the last decade seems to be fading. For the second quarter in a row, private residential real estate investment fell, shaving 0.2 percent off total economic growth last quarter. \u201cWeather was a factor, but it has become increasingly clear that the housing recovery has lost steam over the past six months, as higher mortgage rates and higher prices have weighed on buyer demand for new homes,\u201d Ryan Wang, United States economist at HSBC, said in a note to clients. Corporate investment in equipment, which jumped sharply in the fourth quarter of 2013, reversed course in the first quarter, a major reason overall business investment slackened, shaving 0.4 percent off growth. Other major sources of weakness included a slower buildup in inventories, which reduced the pace of expansion by 0.6 percent, and a weakening trade balance, cutting 0.8 percent off total growth. For all the controversy over Mr. Obama\u2019s health care reform efforts, the rollout of the program actually made the difference between a stall and an outright contraction last quarter, as a surge in health care spending added 1.1 percent to growth. Although prices for health care have not been rising sharply at all, consumption has, and economists expect the sector to continue to gain strength in the months ahead. Wednesday\u2019s report was the first of three estimates of growth by government statisticians, and subsequent revisions could move the final figure up or down sharply as more data comes in, with the next report by the Commerce Department on gross domestic product scheduled for May 29. The fresh economic indicators and the Fed announcement Wednesday afternoon kicked off a busy few days for economists and investors, and Wall Street will be glued to the flow of data. On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report new figures on personal income and spending in March, followed on Friday by the Labor Department\u2019s latest data on the job market in April. The consensus among economists calls for a jump in payrolls of 215,000, with the unemployment rate falling by 0.1 percent to 6.6 percent.On Wednesday, the payroll processor ADP said that American businesses increased hiring in April, adding 220,000 jobs in April, the most since November and up from 209,000 in March. The ADP numbers cover only private businesses and often diverge from the government\u2019s more comprehensive report.Advertisement"}

Stein is chairman both of the internal committee that monitors financial markets for signs of trouble and of the committee that watches the way banks treat their customers.He is also the only remaining member of those committees.Mr. Stein has said that on May 28 he will step down from the Fed.A string of departures from the Fed\u2019s seven-member board over the last year has left the central bank on the verge of operating with just three governors for the first time in its hundred-year history. Three nominees are awaiting Senate confirmation, but so are scores of nominees to other offices, and Senate Democrats say there is a real chance no vote will be held before Mr. Stein departs.The dwindling of its board is straining the Fed\u2019s ability to manage its complex responsibilities, which extend well beyond its enormous economic stimulus campaign and its lead role in the overhaul of financial regulation.It is also shifting the balance of power on the Fed\u2019s most important group, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The March and April meetings of that committee \u2014 which includes board members and presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks \u2014 represented just the third and fourth times in history that a majority of the votes were cast by the regional presidents, who are allocated five votes on the committee on a rotating basis.Unlike the members of the Fed\u2019s board, who are presidential appointees, those officials are selected by business leaders in each district, and are not subject to Senate confirmation.\u201cCongress created an F.O.M.C. with a majority of presidential appointees on it, and it would be unfortunate not to continue that and to honor that,\u201d said Donald L. Kohn, the Fed\u2019s vice chairman from 2006 to 2010, and now a scholar at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt seems to me consistent with democratic accountability.\u201dBut Senate Republicans often seek to stretch out the confirmation process. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said on Monday in a letter to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, that he would act to delay votes on the Fed nominees unless Democrats allowed a vote on legislation to increase congressional oversight of monetary policy.Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was \u201chopeful that the Senate will confirm the three pending nominees without delay.\u201dThe depletion of the Fed\u2019s board is a relatively new phenomenon. President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated six men to the newly created Federal Reserve Board on a Monday morning in January 1936. The Senate confirmed all six on Thursday, and they took office on Saturday.For the next half-century, the Fed was rarely short-handed. Replacements for departing governors were named and confirmed with little fuss.In the last two decades, however, the Fed has had a full complement of governors less than 40 percent of the time. Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the Fed has operated primarily with just five governors.Partisan divisions have made it harder to push all manner of presidential nominees through the Senate, and appointments to the Fed in particular have generated more political heat in the aftermath of the crisis.Since March, the Fed has operated with four governors for just the third stretch in its history.The confirmations of Mr. Fischer and Ms. Brainard would return the board to five, including Mr. Powell, who, though his term has expired, is allowed to continue to serve pending a Senate vote. The White House has yet to nominate people to the remaining two seats.Randall S. Kroszner, who served on the board from 2006 to 2009, was one of five governors during most of that time, a situation he described as difficult but manageable, even during the heart of the financial crisis. He said, however, that anything less than that would be difficult.\u201cWhen you get down to four or fewer, it\u2019s difficult to get the work done,\u201d said Mr. Kroszner, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous amount going on \u2014 on the regulatory side, monitoring the markets, the impact of Q.E. and the tapering \u2014 and it takes a lot of time and focus,\u201d referring to quantitative easing, or the Fed\u2019s bond-buying program.Frederic S. Mishkin, a board member from 2006 to 2008, said the absence of a vice chairman was particularly problematic for the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, because some tasks could not be delegated to other board members.\u201cThe chair has to have time to think about what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Mr. Mishkin, a professor of economics at Columbia University. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of administrative stuff that either the chair or the vice chair needs to be in charge of. And if there\u2019s no vice chair, that means the chair is going to have less time to figure out the best policy. And that can be very costly.\u201dThe board manages its affairs through six committees. In normal times, each of the governors leads one committee and sits on some others. Ms. Yellen does not sit on the committees.With only five board members, most of the committees were reduced to just two members. Mr. Kohn recalled that he and Kevin M. Warsh made up the membership of both the board\u2019s operating committee and the committee that oversaw the regional reserve banks. Mr. Kohn led one committee, Mr. Warsh the other, and they took turns sitting at the head of the table.Now that the Fed has only four board members, most of the committees are solo affairs. Only the one that oversees bank supervision, headed by Daniel K. Tarullo, has a full complement of all three of the available governors.Mr. Stein and Mr. Powell each run two solo committees, an arrangement the Fed has maintained in the hope of imminent reinforcement.But if the board is reduced to three governors, the challenges would extend beyond asking Mr. Powell to be chairman of four committees. The remaining governors would be barred from speaking about policy issues except at formal meetings because any such conversation would involve a majority of the board.\u201cThree would be extraordinarily difficult,\u201d Mr. Kohn said, adding that it \u201cwould really constrain the ability to have interchanges in the way that normal human beings would.\u201dThe Fed faces few major decisions in the next several months. It is gradually ending its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, and is still some time away from a decision to start raising interest rates. But Ms. Yellen has emphasized its responsibility to reduce unemployment more strongly than many of her Fed colleagues.Any restrictions on Ms. Yellen\u2019s ability to meet with fellow board members could particularly constrain her ability to build support for her views. Her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, won support for his policies during the financial crisis through constant consultation with his board members, sharing with them his academic expertise in the workings of financial crises.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brothers Battle Climate Change on Two Fronts", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the New Mexico of the 1950s, the two brothers grew up steeped in the beauty of the landscape, the economics of energy and the power of science. They skied, fly-fished, explored on the family\u2019s 50,000-acre sheep ranch, watched oil towns go boom and bust, and talked of the nuclear weapons up the road at Los Alamos.Today the work of Robert and William Nordhaus is profoundly shaping how the United States and other nations take on global warming.Called the Manning brothers of climate change, the mild-mannered, dry-witted Nordhauses are scions of a New Mexico family long rooted in the land, which powerfully shaped who the brothers became. But for the Nordhaus brothers, protecting the earth depends far more on dispassionate thinking and intellectual rigor than on showy protests outside the White House.They have neatly divided their world \u2014 Bill is the academic theorist, Bob the legal mind and political pragmatist \u2014 but their work is intertwined.\u201cI tend to have lots of crazy ideas, and I run them by Bob first,\u201d Bill said by phone from the Acela train between Boston and New Haven, Conn. He described himself as \u201can academic economist\u201d who has stayed out of policy debates, although his ideas have not.Bob agreed. \u201cBill\u2019s work is about what needs to be done and how soon, using the tools of economic analysis,\u201d he said over a recent lunch in Washington. \u201cMy work is: How do you convert that into a legal and regulatory policy?\u201dThe two have a friendly rivalry, but both believe that cutting carbon pollution is crucial to protecting the environment and the economy from the risks posed by climate change. They also agree on the best way to do it: A Bill-style carbon tax, they say, would be far more effective and efficient than a Bob-style regulation.Like him, both brothers went east to Yale, where in 1963 Bob graduated from the law school and Bill from Yale College. From there Bob headed to Washington for a job as a staff lawyer in the House legislative counsel\u2019s office.He was still there in 1970, working on the bill that would become the Clean Air Act, when his bosses came to him with an unusual assignment: The legislation already included language to regulate known pollutants, such as mercury and smog, but could he write a provision giving the federal government the authority to regulate as-yet-unknown pollutants of the future?While Bob began his career in Washington, Bill received a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and began teaching at Yale. By the late 1970s, when an increasing number of scientists were raising the threat of global warming, Bill wrote a paper proposing a tax on industries and businesses based on the amount of carbon they emitted into the air. The idea was revolutionary at the time, but economists, scientists and many world leaders now say it will have a powerful market effect and is the best way to stave off the catastrophic impacts of a warming world. Already, more than 30 countries have passed carbon-pricing laws.\u201cThe name was both descriptive (representing a dynamic integrated model of climate and the economy) but also consciously aimed to suggest that we are gambling with the future of our planet,\u201d Bill wrote in an email.DICE profoundly changed climate policy. Although the chief political argument against curbing carbon emissions from cars and coal plants has long been that doing so would harm the economy, the DICE models show that, depending on various scenarios, one ton of carbon pollution can inflict $20 to $30 in economic damage \u2014 a major cost, given that the global economy emits about 36 billion tons of carbon a year.Bill\u2019s work \u201cwas seminal,\u201d said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.Here the work of Bob comes in: Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a carbon-pricing bill through Congress in his first term, which is why he has turned to Bob\u2019s section of the Clean Air Act as the legal underpinning for the regulation due out in June.Bob, who was an energy adviser to President Jimmy Carter and general counsel at the Department of Energy under President Bill Clinton, now says that because he was not writing the provision with climate change in mind, the new regulation is an imperfect and perhaps legally vulnerable solution to regulating carbon pollution. Environmental lawyers note that it has almost never been used.But one way the E.P.A. will justify the new regulation is with an analysis showing that the economic benefits of the climate change rule would outweigh the costs.A core component of that analysis? The DICE model.Back in New Mexico, Bob recalled, he and Bill \u2014 the oldest and youngest brothers among four siblings \u2014 could not help noticing the changing world of energy around them. In the 1950s, he said, as the Los Alamos weapons program expanded, the state changed \u201cfrom a pastoral economy, split between ranching, irrigated farming and extractive industries, to defense-related work, which was a whole different world.\u201dThey also paid close attention to the climate changes, and periodic droughts, that affected the family ski business and their lives outdoors.\u201cGrowing up in New Mexico,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re aware of the very fragile ecosystem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Senate Battle Over Mortgage Rules", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReal Estate and the RecoveryThe problem is that loosening lending standards poses the risk of creating bad loans like those that were at the root of the crisis. Taxpayers are on the hook to cover the costs of future housing-related problems, since the vast majority of new mortgages are backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been in government control since September 2008.The left-leaning senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sought for such potential homeowners to be included in the government guarantee created in the new system. In the parlance of housing finance, the Democratic senators wanted a large credit box \u2014 a relatively expansive view of the role of government in supporting housing.Those senators objected to the provision in the Johnson-Crapo proposal to have eligibility for the government guarantee roughly follow guidelines set out by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to ensure that borrowers have the ability to repay their loans \u2014 an irony in that the left more typically defends the bureau against criticism. (Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Charles Schumer of New York, both more usually viewed as centrists on economic issues, joined the coalition against the bill).Consumer groups allied with Mr. Brown and the other left-leaning senators took issue with a requirement that potential homeowners make even modest down payments to qualify for government-backed loans \u2014 as little as 3.5 percent in the Johnson-Crapo proposal for first-time home buyers. Housing advocates were essentially advocating for no-money-down mortgages, on the theory that scrutiny of individual borrowers and other requirements such as mandatory financial education can provide confidence for taxpayers to stand behind otherwise risky mortgages. This upends the usual belief that a meaningful equity stake in one\u2019s own home is an essential motivation to pay the mortgage.Even if the bill had allowed an expansive standard for mortgages to qualify for the government guarantee, risky borrowers \u2014 those at the \u201cedge of the credit box\u201d \u2014 would still need to find a bank willing to make them a loan. This would be no trivial matter, since each of those mortgages would need private investors willing to put a considerable amount of their own money at risk to cover losses before the government guarantee kicked in.Republicans noted that all firms would be subject to anti-discrimination laws, but saw the loose lending standard and duty to serve obligation as both inappropriate interference in business decisions and too far a step back toward the problems that led to the crisis. The policy discussion over housing finance can thus be seen as echoing a larger debate over the role of government \u2014 in this case, regarding the extent to which taxpayers should take on risk to support homeownership.The Johnson-Crapo bill was approved by the Senate Banking Committee with a bipartisan 13-to-9 vote on Thursday. Despite the endorsement of the legislation by President Obama, the majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, is not likely to allow further action in the Senate, given the opposition in his own caucus.With reform stalled, the housing finance system is thus once again turning back toward a greater role for the government and risk for taxpayers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cutting Back on Carbon", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust ask the United States Chamber of Commerce.Specifically, the report considers a carbon-reduction program that\u2019s probably considerably more ambitious than we\u2019re actually going to see, and it concludes that between now and 2030 the program would cost $50.2 billion in constant dollars per year. That\u2019s supposed to sound like a big deal. Instead, if you know anything about the U.S. economy, it sounds like Dr. Evil intoning \u201cone million dollars.\u201d These days, it\u2019s just not a lot of money.Alternatively, consider the chamber\u2019s estimate of costs per household: $200 per year. Since the average American household has an income of more than $70,000 a year, and that\u2019s going to rise over time, we\u2019re again looking at costs that amount to no more than a small fraction of 1 percent.And all of this is based on anti-environmentalists\u2019 own numbers. The real costs would almost surely be smaller, for three reasons.First, the Chamber of Commerce study assumes that economic growth, and the associated growth in emissions, will be at its historic norm of 2.5 percent a year. But we should expect slower growth in the future as baby boomers retire, making emissions targets easier to hit.Third, the U.S. economy is still depressed \u2014 and in a depressed economy many of the supposed costs of compliance with energy regulations aren\u2019t costs at all. In particular, building new, low-emission power plants would employ both workers and capital that would otherwise be sitting idle, and would, if anything, give the U.S. economy a boost.You might ask why the Chamber of Commerce is so fiercely opposed to action against global warming, if the cost of action is so small. The answer, of course, is that the chamber is serving special interests, notably the coal industry \u2014 what\u2019s good for America isn\u2019t good for the Koch brothers, and vice versa \u2014 and also catering to the ever more powerful anti-science sentiments of the Republican Party. Finally, let me take on the anti-environmentalists\u2019 last line of defense \u2014 the claim that whatever we do won\u2019t matter, because other countries, China in particular, will just keep on burning ever more coal. This gets things exactly wrong. Yes, we need an international agreement to reduce emissions, including sanctions on countries that don\u2019t sign on. But U.S. unwillingness to act has been the biggest obstacle to such an agreement. If we start taking serious steps against global warming, the stage will be set for Europe and Japan to follow suit, and for concerted pressure on the rest of the world as well.Now, we haven\u2019t yet seen the details of the new climate action proposal, and a full analysis \u2014 both economic and environmental \u2014 will have to wait. We can be reasonably sure, however, that the economic costs of the proposal will be small, because that\u2019s what the research \u2014 even research paid for by anti-environmentalists, who clearly wanted to find the opposite \u2014 tells us. Saving the planet would be remarkably cheap. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Governments Await Obama\u2019s Move on Carbon to Gauge U.S. Climate Efforts", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama is expected to announce on Monday an Environmental Protection Agency regulation to cut carbon pollution from the nation\u2019s 600 coal-fired power plants, in a speech that government analysts in Beijing, Brussels and beyond will scrutinize to determine how serious the president is about fighting global warming.The regulation will be Mr. Obama\u2019s most forceful effort to reverse 20 years of relative inaction on climate change by the United States, which has stood as the greatest obstacle to international efforts to slow the rise of heat-trapping gases from burning coal and oil that scientists say cause warming.The president had tried, without success, to move a climate change bill through Congress in his first term, and such legislation would now stand no chance of getting past the resistance of Republican lawmakers who question the science of climate change. So Mr. Obama is taking a controversial step: He is using his executive authority under the 1970 Clean Air Act to issue an E.P.A. regulation taking aim at coal-fired power plants, the nation\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution.\u201cI am closely watching this. This standard is the real test of how serious the Obama climate action plan really is,\u201d said Qi Ye, director of the Climate Policy Center at Tsinghua University in China. The university is one of about half a dozen institutions that the Chinese government has tasked with immediately analyzing the new rule, according to Chinese experts.China and the United States, the world\u2019s two largest economies and greenhouse gas polluters, are locked in a stalemate over global warming. While today China pollutes more than the United States, Chinese officials insist that, as a developing economy, China should not be forced to take carbon-cutting actions. China has demanded that the United States, as the world\u2019s historically largest polluter, go first. Chinese policy experts say that Mr. Obama\u2019s regulation could end that standoff.\u201cIf the standard is really stringent, that will make a difference in the domestic debate in China,\u201d Mr. Qi said.Mr. Qi said that while he did not expect the Chinese government to publicly comment on the E.P.A. rule, a strong regulation \u2014 like one that led to a 20 percent cut in coal plant pollution \u2014 could stimulate policy changes. \u201cIt will have an impact,\u201d he said.But scientists have also warned that collective action, with carbon cuts by all the major economies, is essential to achieve the drastic reduction in carbon pollution necessary to stave off the most destructive impacts of global warming.This December, leaders from many nations will gather in Lima, Peru, at a United Nations summit meeting aimed at drafting a treaty, to be signed in 2015, that would legally bind the world\u2019s major economies to cut their carbon pollution.The goal is to avoid the debacle of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the world\u2019s first attempt to forge a climate change treaty, which was effectively rendered null when the United States Senate refused to ratify it.But as Mr. Obama moves ahead using his existing authority under the Clean Air Act, governments around the world have taken notice \u2014 and tried to learn everything they can about the law.\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to see the new rule on existing power plants. We see this as absolutely the backbone of U.S. climate strategy,\u201d said G\u00fcnter H\u00f6rmandinger, environmental counselor to the European Union delegation in Washington. The European Union, which enacted a carbon-cutting policy after the Kyoto Protocol, has been among the critics of the United States\u2019 climate change policy.\u201cOnce it\u2019s out, I will be rushing to understand it and report back to Brussels,\u201d said Mr. H\u00f6rmandinger, an Austrian who has spent the past four years studying the Clean Air Act.Within the United States, opponents of the climate change rule, chiefly the nation\u2019s coal industry, are preparing to fight with lawsuits, and global analysts are assessing whether the rule will stand up to those attacks.\u201cI think it can be done legally, going back to the Supreme Court decision that led to E.P.A.\u2019s authority to regulate carbon emissions,\u201d said Mario Molina, a climate policy adviser to President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of Mexico.Mexico, which enacted an ambitious climate change law in 2012, has urged other Latin American nations to pass similar legislation.Many governments are also mindful of the opposition to climate change science in the United States Congress.\u201cSenator Rubio shows us that there are still people who are skeptical of the science, even though we are already suffering the consequences of climate change,\u201d Mr. Pulgar-Vidal said. \u201cThe government faces resistant actors, skepticism from political leaders \u2014 it\u2019s the same in the international arena.\u201dPerhaps no governments are anticipating the rule with more urgency than those in the small island nations that could be threatened if sea levels rise. A series of scientific reports have concluded that as the planet warms, melting polar ice will drive up sea levels two to four feet by the end of the century, threatening the very existence of some of those islands.\u201cThe path we\u2019re on right now is that our country will disappear,\u201d said Ronald Jean Jumeau, the United Nations ambassador from the island nation of Seychelles, and a spokesman for the Alliance of Small Island States. \u201cThis will slow things down and give us more time to adapt and restructure our economies. Taking action now gives us more breathing room.\u201dAlso paying close attention will be Saudi Arabia, which has sought to block global action on climate change. Economies that are deeply dependent on producing fossil fuels fear that lowering the global demand for oil and gas presents a grave economic threat.\u201cEveryone knows that the U.S. is key to achieve any solution to the climate change crisis,\u201d wrote Wael Hmaidan, director of a Lebanon-based advocacy group, Climate Action Network. \u201cMany OPEC countries, who do not want to see the world wean itself from fossil fuels, realize this.\u201dOne world capital that will not be paying much attention is Moscow. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is an open skeptic of climate science, and Russia, as one of the world\u2019s largest producers of oil and gas, has generally been dismissive of efforts to forge a climate change treaty.\u201cClimate change is snubbed in Russia,\u201d said Vladimir Milov, a former Russian deputy minister of energy and president of the Institute of Energy Policy, a Moscow think tank. \u201cIt is a very climate-change-skeptical society.\u201dAdvertisement"}

During high tide one recent afternoon, Eliseo Toussaint looked out the window of his Alton Road laundromat and watched bottle-green saltwater seep from the gutters, fill the street and block the entrance to his front door.\u201cThis never used to happen,\u201d Mr. Toussaint said. \u201cI\u2019ve owned this place eight years, and now it\u2019s all the time.\u201dDown the block at an electronics store it is even worse. Jankel Aleman, a salesman, keeps plastic bags and rubber bands handy to wrap around his feet when he trudges from his car to the store through ever-rising waters.Forty-four percent of Americans said they believed that there is solid evidence the temperature on earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity.\u201cThe theme of the report is that climate change is not a future thing, it\u2019s a \u2018happening-now\u2019 thing,\u201d said Leonard Berry, a contributing author of the new report and director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University. \u201cAlton Road is one of the now things.\u201dAverage temperature in 1991-2012 compared with the 1901-60 average.The national climate report found that although rapidly melting Arctic ice is threatening the entire American coastline, Miami is exceptionally vulnerable because of its unique geology. The city is built on top of porous limestone, which is already allowing the rising seas to soak into the city\u2019s foundation, bubble up through pipes and drains, encroach on fresh water supplies and saturate infrastructure. County governments estimate that the damages could rise to billions or even trillions of dollars. In and around Miami, local officials are grappling head on with the problem. \u201cSea level rise is our reality in Miami Beach,\u201d said the city\u2019s mayor, Philip Levine. \u201cWe are past the point of debating the existence of climate change and are now focusing on adapting to current and future threats.\u201d In the face of encroaching saltwater and sunny-day flooding like that on Alton Road, Mr. Levine has supported a $400 million spending project to make the city\u2019s drainage system more resilient in the face of rising tides. But while local politicians can take action to shore up their community against the rising tide, they are powerless to stop what scientists say is the heart of the problem: the increasing fossil fuel emissions that continue to warm the planet. Scientists say that the scale of emission reductions necessary to prevent the most dangerous effects of global warming can only come as a result of national and international policies to cut carbon pollution. Some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.In particular, climate experts say, national policies to tax or regulate carbon pollution are required by the world\u2019s top emitters, chiefly the United States and China. Such efforts have to date met a wave of political opposition in Congress \u2014 bills aimed at putting a price on carbon pollution have repeatedly failed. President Obama plans to use his executive authority to issue a regulation that would cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, but Republicans, who call the rule a \u201cWar on Coal,\u201d want to overturn it. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, supports carbon-cutting efforts, even as he acknowledges that they will come with some economic cost. In April, he convened a packed hearing at the Miami Beach City Hall on the encroaching waters. \u201cWith sea level rise, you\u2019ve got to get to core of the problem,\u201d Mr. Nelson said at the hearing. \u201cYou have to lessen the amount of CO2. It\u2019s politically treacherous and costly. But at the end of the day, something like that is going to have to get passed. Otherwise the planet is going to continue to heat up.\u201d But three prominent Florida Republicans \u2014 Senator Marco Rubio, former Gov. Jeb Bush and the current governor, Rick Scott \u2014 declined repeated requests to be interviewed on the subject. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Bush are viewed as potential presidential candidates. Political analysts say the reluctance of the three men to speak publicly on the issue reflects an increasingly difficult political reality for Republicans grappling with the issue of climate change, particularly for the party\u2019s lawmakers from Florida. In acknowledging the problem, politicians must endorse a solution, but the only major policy solutions to climate change \u2014 taxing or regulating the oil, gas and coal industries \u2014 are anathema to the base of the Republican Party. Thus, many Republicans, especially in Florida, appear to be dealing with the issue by keeping silent. \u201cJeb likes to take positions on hot-button issues, the same with Rubio,\u201d said Joseph E. Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami. \u201cOn immigration they are further mainstream on that than the rest of the G.O.P. But on this, Republicans are dead set against taking action on climate change on the national level. If you have political aspirations, this is not something you should talk about if you want to win a Republican primary.\u201dOver the past year, Mr. Rubio has signaled his skepticism about the established science that fossil fuel emissions contribute to climate change. When asked in a 2013 Buzzfeed webcast interview if climate change posed a threat to Florida, Mr. Rubio responded: \u201cThe climate is always changing. The question is, is manmade activity what\u2019s contributing most to it?\u201d He added that \u201cI\u2019ve seen reasonable debate on that principle\u201d and \u201cif we unilaterally impose these sorts of things on our economy it would have a devastating impact.\u201dBut in 2008, while serving in the Florida State Legislature, Mr. Rubio supported a bill directing the State Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules for companies to limit carbon emissions. As governor from 1999 to 2007, Mr. Bush pushed several environmental initiatives, particularly efforts to protect Everglades National Park, which scientists say is highly vulnerable to encroaching seawaters. Political scientists say that Mr. Rubio\u2019s shift and Mr. Bush\u2019s current silence on the issue appear to reflect the position of lawmakers who are mulling transitions from the state to the national stage and the realities of satisfying their party\u2019s base in the 2016 primaries.

{"Headline": "Alibaba Bets on a Growing Chinese Economy and New Consumers", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWhen American tech upstarts float their companies on the stock market, they often sell investors on a familiar dream \u2014 \u201cdisrupting\u201d an existing industry. It doesn\u2019t matter if the industry is advertising, software, commerce or some other sector. The start-up will usually claim that its business is a great technological leap forward that will greatly lower costs and improve service for customers and leave rivals unable to respond. Therefore, buy some stock.That new market is China itself, particularly its ascendant middle class and its growing appetite for spending rather than saving.Instead of disruption, Alibaba is betting on existing trends staying more or less the same: that China will continue to change into the world\u2019s largest consumer gold mine, and Jack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s charismatic co-founder and chairman, will continue to sit at the apex of the consumerist revolution.Alibaba\u2019s long-term goal highlights the difference in scope between Chinese Internet firms and their American counterparts. You may think of Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon\u2019s chief executive, as an ambitious man, but he is really only betting that in the future, Americans will shift some of the dollars they are already spending from offline stores into his online store. He isn\u2019t betting that Americans will start spending twice as much on everything as they do now.That is precisely Mr. Ma\u2019s bet. And as investors weigh Alibaba\u2019s stock offering, they will have to consider which approach \u2014 Amazon\u2019s disruption or Alibaba\u2019s going along with an existing trend \u2014 is better.The numbers seem to be on Alibaba\u2019s side. \u201cOur business benefits from the rising spending power of Chinese consumers,\u201d the firm says in its filing.The crux of Alibaba\u2019s pitch to investors is that Chinese customers will begin to act much more like American customers. Today, much of the Chinese population doesn\u2019t spend very much money compared with their counterparts in the West. Only about a third of China\u2019s gross domestic product is made up of consumer spending, significantly lower than the consumption rate of other countries. By comparison, about two-thirds of the United States\u2019 economy is made up of consumer spending.Mr. Ma is counting on these habits changing in his favor. Alibaba is betting that the Chinese will continually increase their spending and that a huge pool of new money will flood through China\u2019s economy.The McKinsey researchers noted that in 2000, just 4 percent of urban Chinese households earned a middle-class wage. By 2022, the study predicted, more than 75 percent of urban households will have joined the ranks of the middle class, with income among that group twice as much as it is today. The growth of this vast new market is occurring across the country and many of these newly wealthy people are hooked on online shopping.\u201cYou\u2019re really seeing consumer behavior change in all kinds of ways in China,\u201d said Kelland Willis, an analyst who studies global retail trends at the research firm Forrester.While the growing middle class has resulted in a growing population that can afford to shop, Ms. Willis said that many newly wealthy Chinese had been initially wary of spending money in the new ways that the Internet allowed for. Alibaba\u2019s genius has been in recognizing and constantly adapting to society\u2019s evolving views about shopping. The company has been adept at finding the reasons that people might be suspicious about spending money, then looking for novel fixes.\u201cWhat you see them doing is trying to understand exactly what the Chinese consumer wants and then experimenting with technological solutions to address those problems,\u201d she said.That plan has worked phenomenally well so far. As the I.P.O. filing points out, Alibaba already commands a vast portion of the Chinese e-commerce market. Of the 302 million Internet shoppers in China, 231 million already shop at Alibaba\u2019s properties. More than 76 percent of the total value of all mobile commerce in China flows through Alibaba.A look back at the Internet revolution\u2019s notable I.P.O.s, and how valuations have fared over the years.What is more, offline retail in China is a far less developed part of the economy than in the United States. This means that unlike American e-commerce companies, Alibaba isn\u2019t fighting against brick-and-mortar stores or even another online retailer. Instead, it is riding a bigger tide. As wealth grows, Alibaba is pushing to make shopping of all kinds a safer and more widely practiced part of Chinese life.A big example is Alipay, the online payment system that Alibaba introduced in 2004. In the United States, online payment companies like PayPal were meant to replace older, more costly and slower ways of paying, like personal checks or money transfers. But in China, online payments weren\u2019t really a replacement of an old way of doing business. For many people just entering the consumptive middle class, the whole idea of paying large sums in any way, whether offline or online, has always been risky. Fraud and trickery abounded and buyer protections weren\u2019t an ingrained part of consumerism.Thus, unlike PayPal, Alibaba didn\u2019t just need to come up with a faster or more efficient way of paying. It needed to find a payment method that would allay people\u2019s fears that paying for goods was a bad idea in the first place.Its innovation was escrow. When a buyer purchases an item from a seller using Alipay, the firm holds the buyer\u2019s money in an account. Only when the buyer informs Alipay that she has received her goods does the payment firm release the money to the seller.Many of Alibaba\u2019s other innovations have followed a similar pattern. To Americans, Alibaba\u2019s breakthroughs may look comically backward compared with the technological wizardry being peddled by Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. There are no unmanned drones, robotic warehouses, self-driving cars or software-based assistants.But as admirable as they may be, these American efforts at disruption are also far riskier than Alibaba\u2019s simple plan to ride a cultural wave. Nobody knows if self-driving cars will pan out or if we will ever be O.K. with aerial drones delivering our toothpaste. But the idea of serving a gigantic new consumer market with a set of tools to make shopping easier and safer? That\u2019s not disruptive. It\u2019s obvious. And often, what is obvious wins.Email: farhad.manjoo@nytimes.com; Twitter: @fmanjooAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Pursuit of Beats May Foretell a Shift", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHas streaming music\u2019s moment in the mainstream finally come? Or is it here already, and has Apple \u2014 once the great innovator of music technology \u2014 finally caught on?The deal was quickly characterized as a potential landmark for Apple. If completed, it would be the company\u2019s biggest acquisition by far, and unusual in that Apple would be buying a company that already had a firmly established consumer brand. But exactly what kind of landmark it means for Apple is unclear. Many analysts seemed perplexed by the move.\u201cWe are struggling to see the rationale behind this move,\u201d Gene Munster, an analyst with the firm Piper Jaffray, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cBeats would of course bring a world-class brand in music to Apple, but Apple already has a world-class brand and has never acquired a brand for a brand\u2019s sake.\u201dBeats\u2019 hardware business \u2014 its headphones, speakers and other audio products \u2014 is one obvious attraction for Apple, whose own empire was likewise built on selling high-margin, high-status, high-technology products. Formed in 2008 by Dr. Dre and the music executive Jimmy Iovine, Beats now has annual sales of more than $1 billion, thanks to canny marketing that has included endorsements from music and sports stars.Yet in the music world, the move seemed to suggest a different, or at least complementary rationale: Apple, which transformed the industry in 2003 with the iTunes store but has been hesitant to enter the streaming market, was finally taking the plunge.Streaming by subscription, in which access to millions of songs are made available for a monthly fee, has been a fringe part of the business for more than a decade. But with the rise of smartphones and the aging of the download format, streaming has started to come into its own, and record labels and artists are preparing themselves for a future in which it will become the dominant listening mode.If Apple makes a major marketing push for Beats\u2019s subscription model \u2014 or, even better, if Apple integrates Beats into its ecosystem of online services and physical products \u2014 it could mean a big lift for streaming. Apple may be calculating that the timing for acquisition is right. Last year, the music industry\u2019s income from subscription services around the world exceeded $1 billion for the first time. And music download sales began to drop last year for the first time, reflecting broader patterns of media consumption that find people less willing to buy CDs, DVDs and individual downloads, and instead signing up for various kinds of streaming plans.\u201cWe\u2019re moving to access rather than an ownership economy in media,\u201d said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst with BTIG in New York. \u201cNetflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu \u2014 those are now the default destinations in the media world.\u201dAlice Enders, of Enders Analysis in London, called the Beats deal \u201cthe clearest sign yet that Apple agrees that the era of music downloads is over.\u201dLast year there were 6.1 million subscribers to such services in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, yielding $628 million in revenue for the industry. Revenue for downloads, by contrast, was $2.8 billion. Apple\u2019s immersion in streaming would help shift that equation. One likely effect of the Beats deal would be pressuring other players in the market, particularly Spotify, which has been a subject of frequent speculation about an initial public offering. Spotify, or smaller subscription providers like Rdio and Rhapsody, may now find themselves acquisition targets by giants like Google, analysts say.The effect on Pandora media, however, is unclear. Unlike Spotify and Beats, Pandora has remained focused on its Internet radio model, which, because of different licensing rules, has made it less dependent on record companies and music publishers. Pandora\u2019s stock closed at $22.62 yesterday, up 1.9 percent, while Apple\u2019s was down 0.4 percent, at $585.54. Still another possibility is that Apple may be pursuing the deal for the marketing and branding vision of Beats, and chiefly that of Mr. Iovine, 61, who in addition to being co-chairman of Beats has become one of the music industry\u2019s most consistently successful impresarios, guiding the careers of superstars like U2, Eminem and Lady Gaga. If Mr. Iovine leaves Universal, the music company will still have some consolation: It owns a 14 percent stake in Beats, which if the deal closes at $3.2 billion will be worth nearly $450 million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Memoirs", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistIf you smoked Colombian weed in the continental United States between 1970 and 1986, odds are good that the author\u2019s father, Big Tony Dokoupil, was your supplier. A graduate school dropout whose heroin addiction exempted him from the Vietnam War draft, Big Tony had all the makings of an extralegal superstar: handsome, smart, prone to romantic self-mythologizing, and he lived up to the mythology in time. Big Tony moved his first brick of marijuana in 1970, the same year Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, firing the first shots of what would eventually turn into Reagan\u2019s war on drugs. Marijuana became a Schedule I narcotic, cast as highly addictive and deadly, a scourge on society requiring a new set of draconian punishments.It was just the kind of challenge Big Tony wanted. Impatient with honest, low-stakes work, he found rebellion as thrilling as any chemical high he pursued. After 14 years in the business, he had amassed more money than he could keep track of, with millions of dollars lost in beer coolers buried across America. Amid all this chaos, Tony started a family with a cleareyed, resourceful schoolteacher who made sure to invest in the one thing the government and the drug trade could never take away \u2014 a top-notch education for their only son, Little Tony.What happens to the Dokoupil family is inevitable: Big Tony walks out on his wife and their 6-year-old son so he can dive deeper into the squalor of cocaine addiction. Former friends and colleagues start ratting, and Big Tony recedes further into the hell he seemed to crave. This titan of the pot trade would have become an obscure footnote, but Big Tony\u2019s son and namesake, a senior writer for NBC News, took an inheritance of psychic loss and transformed it into a probing, exuberant memoir about the history of the American drug economy, the ambitions and failures of politicians and outlaws, fathers and sons. After years of estrangement, Little Tony reunites with his father looking for answers. The result is a fascinating tale about the wreckage of addiction and the shadow side of the American dream.In her first memoir, \u201cUnorthodox,\u201d Feldman made the courageous choice to cut off ties with her family and the Satmar community of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, a sect of conservative, isolationist Hasidim, some of whom believe the Holocaust was God\u2019s punishment for the crime of assimilation. Now a divorced woman in her 20s, Feldman chronicles the next phase of her life in her new book. It opens with Feldman suffering from insomnia and panic attacks, questioning the role of genetics and fate in her newly liberated life. Is she doomed to wander the earth an outcast like her mother, who also left the Satmar community and essentially abandoned young Feldman to the care of grandparents? Has she inherited the trauma and resulting depression of her grandmother, a Holocaust survivor? Is the price she paid for her escape into the secular world a life of perpetual anxiety? Without a tribe, will she ever be whole again?Feldman goes on a quest of self-discovery, starting with a shamanic healer in the corner of rural New England where she now lives with her young son. She sets off on a series of trips across the United States and Europe, seeking a wider vision of Jews in the modern world, in the hope of finding her rightful place. Some of the most powerful scenes come when Feldman retraces the path of her female ancestors in Hungary and confronts the anti-Semitism of contemporary Europe. But the book becomes a travelogue full of flat-footed metaphors belaboring the point of her sometimes moving, other times lamentable, observations. (She compares forcing Jews to manufacture guns for the Nazis to \u201cfeeding chicken to a chicken.\u201d) On American soil she navigates love and sex in the secular world. In these chapters the memoir sounds shockingly ordinary, as though Feldman had been a member of the \u201cGirls\u201d generation all along, and not a recently exiled Hasid suffering from PTSD. But what it lacks in grace \u201cExodus\u201d makes up for in heart, as Feldman ultimately discovers that her rightful place is wherever she happens to be.At a supper club in New Jersey when Lansky was 10 or 11 years old, a nervous young singer stopped by her table to pay homage to her father and accidentally knocked a bucket of ice, in which Sandra\u2019s ginger ale was cooling, all over her lap. The singer was terror-stricken, but when little Sandi responded with a good-natured laugh, it was \u201cas if I had saved his life, . . . like getting a thumbs up from a Roman empress.\u201d That singer was Frank Sinatra, the nightclub was owned by Sandra\u2019s \u201cuncle\u201d Willie Moretti, a.k.a. Willie Moore, and her father was none other than Meyer Lansky \u2014 the architect of Murder Inc., a founding father of Las Vegas and the man later fictionalized as Hyman Roth in \u201cThe Godfather: Part II.\u201d Lansky recounts her life of luxury as her father\u2019s favorite sidekick, as it was she, and not her mentally ill mother, who accompanied Meyer on his business throughout New York, New Jersey, Florida, Cuba and eventually Las Vegas. Sandra Lansky knew by the look in her father\u2019s eye when it was time to go play with the hatcheck girls at Dinty Moore\u2019s. But she didn\u2019t know her father was a gangster until she was 13, after his first Senate hearing in 1951. Hers was a sheltered, privileged childhood that evolved into rebellious adolescence. Sandra dated Dean Martin, married a man who turned out to be a gay \u201cfortune hunter\u201d when she was just 16, then fell in love with an undercover F.B.I. agent. (It didn\u2019t end so badly, considering.) Meyer Lansky, true to his reputation, remained cool throughout his daughter\u2019s romantic follies, and the portrait she paints of him is that of an exceptionally loving patriarch. Sandra eventually married a man on the periphery of the Gambino crime family whom Meyer negotiated out of service to the mob in order to establish a legitimate life for his daughter and son-in-law. The book is studded with riveting personal stories about Bugsy Siegel, Lucky Luciano, Sinatra and the Kennedys. Sandra Lansky, along with her co-writer, William Stadiem, has assembled a work of retrospective honesty that delivers an intimate look inside the mob.

{"Headline": "Owners Who Are Happy When the Engine Doesn\u2019t Start", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt started at the 2014 Portland Auto Show in Oregon with Dave Barthmuss of General Motors\u2019 West Coast communications office mentioning offhandedly, yet with definite pride, that he had bought a Chevy Volt early last summer \u2014 and nine months later, he was still on the first tank of gas. But doesn\u2019t gasoline go bad? Get stale? It does, Mr. Barthmuss said, and that\u2019s why the Volt, a plug-in hybrid that can make most local trips on battery power, has maintenance modes. If a driver always commutes in all-electric mode, the engine maintenance mode will activate after five to six weeks, and there is a fuel maintenance mode that runs every nine months to a year, according to a G.M. spokesman, Shad Balch. The driver is notified with a message on the dashboard display screen, and at that point can choose to proceed or to postpone the exercise for up to a day. If an O.K. is given, the gasoline engine, which G.M. calls a range extender, starts up to keep the internal parts lubricated or to burn off the old gas. The Cadillac ELR, which uses a similar powertrain, operates the same way, Mr. Balch said. Owners like Patricia P\u00e9rez, who lives in Los Angeles where clogged freeways and interminable commutes are a daily reality, want the conventional engine as a backup to eliminate range anxiety, but they find themselves doing whatever they can to drive electric-only miles. \u201cAn all-electric vehicle would not work for me,\u201d she said. Ms. P\u00e9rez, who works in public relations and describes herself as \u201cthe average Latina consumer,\u201d delved deep into her car\u2019s settings to schedule charging during off-peak hours. She installed a 240-volt charger in her garage, so a midnight-to-6 a.m. charge tops off her battery pack, and she fills the gas tank only a quarter of the way to avoid hauling extra weight.Still, people try their best to outwit the maintenance mode.Noble Anderson, an early-adopter Volt owner in Alexandria, Va., said that for him there was a strong psychological factor to the maintenance mode. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hit that generator,\u201d he said, referring to the engine\u2019s main role as a producer of electricity. \u201cIt drives terrible using gas. I cringe when I drive so far the generator kicks in.\u201d He said he used the Volt\u2019s regenerative braking almost obsessively. He also bought the more powerful home charger and sets his battery charging time using an app that works through the OnStar telematics system. After a year of working on his own, Mr. Rosack said, G.M. gave him access to OnStar\u2019s programming interface so he could collect the data directly.\u201cThe site helps you know what your car can do and what your boundaries are,\u201d Mr. Rosack said. Some users, he added, get around the maintenance mode by staying parked while the engine runs. When OnStar collects that data, it shows that zero miles were traveled using gasoline. Though he lives in Appleton, Wis., Mr. Rosack does not use the air-conditioning or heater, because running either would cut into his mileage numbers. \u201cWe squeeze 10 to 15 percent more out,\u201d he said of his fuel economy, adding that he averages one nine-gallon tank of gas every other month.Though he is, in his own words, a \u201cgeek,\u201d Mr. Stehouwer is not a car lover. \u201cI hate cars,\u201d he said. Volt drivers often note that maintaining those electric miles is like a game, and they rely on the instant feedback the car gives to keep the m.p.g.e. reading high. Most often, they mention keeping the green ball in the middle, a reference to the Volt\u2019s dashboard energy usage display. \u201cDrivers\u00a0know\u00a0what they need to do in order to improve economy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t always remember. Real-time feedback and nudges can help keep a driver driving in an efficient manner.\u201dMr. Siegel said he hoped that CarKnow would be able to make the data that companies were collecting both standardized and available for the cars\u2019 owners. Ms. P\u00e9rez, who keeps her monthly OnStar reports, is the sort of driver looking for this data. \u201cI do go through them closely,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when I drive, I\u2019m always watching to see that I\u2019m at the maximum.\u201d She also plugs in at every opportunity. Her family knows to leave a space close to an outlet open at any gathering; Ms. P\u00e9rez is going to want to use it \u201cto take a couple of watts,\u201d as she said.For the first year or two after he bought one of the early Volts, Mr. Anderson checked a third-party website to see how many electric-only miles he had logged. Now he uses the OnStar app, though he checks it less often than he used to. Mr. Anderson then interrupted the interview to say, with disappointment obvious even through his hands-free phone, \u201cIt just kicked in to gas right now, unfortunately.\u201d Advertisement"}

But as President Abraham Lincoln said, facing re-election in 1864 while America\u2019s Civil War still raged, \u201cWe cannot have free government without elections; and if the rebellion could force us to forgo, or postpone, a national election, it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us.\u201dLike Lincoln, we Ukrainians are resolved to go to the polls to choose a new president, in defiance of every threat. We will not grant victory to those who would discredit and dismember our country by allowing the May 25 vote to be canceled. Our election must go ahead if only to prove that the 100 and more men and women who died for our liberty in the protests around Maidan, Kiev\u2019s Independence Square, did not die in vain.We will brave every obstacle to vote, for we are determined to confound President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s efforts to transform our democratic country into a Russian vassal state. No one should doubt that Mr. Putin\u2019s primary aim is to hollow out our democracy. But Americans, and free people everywhere, must not be deceived by Russia\u2019s aggression, or by Mr. Putin\u2019s current peace offensive.The separatist cause fomented by Russia would never win on its merits in any free and fair vote of Ukrainians, as a recent Pew Research Center poll has confirmed. Russia\u2019s separatist mafia can win only sham elections of the type that Mr. Putin has imposed on Russia since he came to power 14 years ago, and which he recently forced upon our fellow citizens, now hostages, in Crimea. The lie Mr. Putin is peddling is that Slavs constitute a special culture that requires the rule of a strong man, and that European and democratic ideals, and the tolerance of minorities that comes with them, are antipathetic to that culture. The best possible rebuke to that falsehood is a successful Ukrainian democracy linked to Europe.Ukraine\u2019s liberty is a mortal threat to the authoritarian, state-capitalist system that Mr. Putin has unleashed on Russia\u2019s citizens. If Ukrainians, who are also Slavs, can build an open society and a free economy, as we are determined to do, then ordinary Russians may recognize the scale of the liberties and the economic opportunities that have been stolen from them under Mr. Putin\u2019s misrule.Of course, Ukrainians\u2019 trust in their government has been shattered by the growing realization of former President Viktor F. Yanukovych\u2019s corruption, and of his stealthy collaboration with Russia in undermining Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. But our trust in one another has never been higher.The spirit of resistance has kindled a new national consciousness across the country, east and west, north and south. It is this spirit, not one of vengeance, that we must keep alive in the days ahead. If we do, Ukrainians will secure the democracy and the European future to which they have shown such extraordinary devotion. We can eliminate corruption and cut down the bureaucratic maze that stifles the entrepreneurial spirit of our people. We can embrace a modern educational system, not the hidebound Soviet-style ways that still prevail in too many of our classrooms.We know that we must man the barricades of freedom ourselves if Ukraine is to remain free. But there is much that America and Europe can do to help, short of sending soldiers to fight. As Winston Churchill wrote to Franklin D. Roosevelt during the darkest months of World War II, when Britain stood alone against Nazism: \u201cGive us the tools, and we will finish the job.\u201d The consequences of allowing Ukraine to be plundered and divided in the name of Mr. Putin\u2019s imperial ambitions are too dire to contemplate. Ukrainians have battled for freedom, and now we are poised to risk everything we hold dear in order to vote for it. Give us the support, material and moral, that we need so that we can achieve the just and open democracy that is America\u2019s greatest bequest to the world.Advertisement"}

Timothy Geithner, who went from president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to Treasury secretary, never worked for Goldman or any other financial company. But he had a great deal of trouble persuading anyone that was the case.In the decades before the financial crisis, there was even a growing agreement that less regulation was better than more. That would let markets work their wonders. In the United States, Congress passed laws that allowed derivatives to largely escape review. In Britain, there was pride in a \u201clight touch\u201d system of regulation.Bank regulators were content to let banks use their own models in estimating the risk of investments and therefore in calculating how much capital was needed. And there was a general willingness to assume that everything was fine. Did the United States arm of Deutsche Bank have virtually no capital? Who cared? Surely the parent was well capitalized and would stand behind its subsidiary. And if that failed, surely the German government would not allow a disaster.But the financial crisis changed many things. And one of them was that consensus. Regulators saw a need for tougher rules, less trust and more stringent enforcement. Banks have been appalled at some of the results. The new reality has been on display this spring, as United States banks lobby to repeal, or at least tone down, some of the harsher requirements of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. They complain whenever there is evidence that bankers in Europe might be getting off easier than those in the United States, and they \u2014 or at least their friends in Congress \u2014 complain even more bitterly when there is evidence that international regulators might be pressing United States regulators to toughen some rules.But regulators seem to have abandoned the founding principles of the banker-regulator complex.Mr. Carney sounded like a friend of banks compared with another speaker at the same conference. At the heart of the new regulatory spirit is a belief that banks are not, in and of themselves, necessarily good things. \u201cIn the run-up to the crisis,\u201d Mr. Carney said, \u201cbanking became about banks not businesses; transactions not relations; counterparties not clients. New instruments originally designed to meet the credit and hedging needs of businesses quickly morphed into ways to amplify bets on financial outcomes.\u201dMs. Lagarde added that \u201cthe true role of the financial sector is to serve, not to rule, the economy. Its real job is to benefit people, especially by financing investment and thus helping with the creation of jobs and growth.\u201dThat kind of talk can sound scary in bank boardrooms, where regulators are expected to set rules and then let banks do what they wish to do so long as they remain within the letter of the law. United States bank regulators have spoken several times in recent months of taking \u201creputational risk\u201d into account in monitoring banks. In one case, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warned that \u201cengaging in practices that are perceived to be unfair or detrimental to the customer can cause a bank to lose community support and business.\u201dTo Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who leads the House Financial Services Committee, that sounds suspicious. \u201cIt would be an abuse of regulatory discretion to use vague, subjective and unquantifiable indicators to justify regulatory outcomes that could not otherwise be justified,\u201d he wrote in a letter to bank regulators last week. He asked that they explain by June 12 how they could legally use such discretion.\u201cObjectivity delivers fair competition and predictability; predictability fosters market stability; market stability tends to promote economic growth,\u201d he lectured.The fact that rules were predictable before the crisis \u2014 and in some cases easy to evade \u2014 did not exactly produce stability. What the banks delivered, Ms. Lagarde said, was \u201cexcess, in risk-taking, leverage, opacity, complexity and compensation.\u201d And that \u201cled to massive destruction of value.\u201dNonetheless, Mr. Hensarling\u2019s reaction underscores that banks continue to have substantial political support in the United States, among some Democrats as well as many Republicans. If the Republicans take control of the Senate this fall, and hold on to the House, there will certainly be efforts aimed at reining in the regulators.An international survey of the public conducted in 27 countries late last year, mentioned by Ms. Lagarde, found widespread doubt about whether either business or political leaders could be trusted to act ethically. There was general agreement that there was still not enough regulation of financial institutions. In the United States, 45 percent said there was not enough regulation, compared with 24 percent who thought there was too much, and just 18 percent who thought there was just enough, according to the survey conducted for Edelman, a public relations firm.That may sound like a repudiation of banks, but in fact they seem to be more trusted in the United States than they are elsewhere. Only in Argentina and South Africa did more than 24 percent think there was too much regulation.Talk can be cheap, of course, and there is precedence for regulators not following up on promises to get tough. But it seems likely that the crisis both embarrassed and emboldened regulators and that they will not be easily swayed. Before the financial crisis, both Mr. Carney and Ms. Lagarde appeared to be members in good standing of the regulator-banker complex. Mr. Carney spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs before entering public service. Ms. Lagarde is a former Chicago corporate lawyer who served as French finance minister before moving to the I.M.F. The French government has historically been remarkably attentive to the needs of its banks, at one point persuading the European Commission to allow those banks to ignore an accounting rule they deemed inconvenient. But that was before 2008. \u201cBankers made enormous sums in the run-up to the crisis and were often well compensated after it hit,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cIn turn, taxpayers picked up the tab for their failures. That unjust sharing of risk and reward contributed directly to inequality but \u2014 more importantly \u2014 has had a corrosive effect on the broader social fabric of which finance is part and on which it relies.\u201dMr. Carney, by the way, is a Canadian who got the Bank of England job in part because of a perception that British regulators had been too trusting. The Edelman survey found that only 6 percent of people in Britain thought there was now too much regulation of financial services firms, while 64 percent thought there was too little.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dark Side of the Sharing Economy", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere are good reasons that governments regulate housing. For example, officials use zoning laws to separate hotels and residential development so apartment buildings are not overrun by tourists. Rent control policies exist to help ensure that lower-income tenants have a place to live. Laws against short-term rentals make sure landlords do not operate illegal hotels and reduce the number of apartments available to permanent residents.Mr. Schneiderman found that at the end of January about 30 percent of the nearly 20,000 New York City listings on Airbnb, one of the most successful \u201csharing\u201d companies, were placed by people or businesses that advertised more than one listing. Multiple listings by the same person suggests that unscrupulous landlords have converted thousands of apartments into illegal hotels.In addition, Airbnb should more explicitly inform people who think they can sublet their apartments with impunity about what they can and cannot do. Even when they are not breaking the law, many New Yorkers risk being evicted when they sublet rooms and apartments without the permission of their landlords or co-op boards.An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that Airbnb had removed 2,000 clients after a subpoena was issued. It removed more than 2,000 listings from an unspecified number of users.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Egypt\u2019s New Strongman, Sisi Knows Best", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the former army officer soon to be Egypt\u2019s president, promises to remedy Egypt\u2019s crippling fuel shortage by installing energy-efficient bulbs in every home socket, even if he has to send a government employee to screw in each one.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving a chance for people to act on their own,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in his first and most extensive television interview. \u201cMy program will be mandatory.\u201dMr. Sisi, 59, disciplined and domineering, is universally expected to become Egypt\u2019s head of state after a pro forma election scheduled to begin Monday. He has already been the nation\u2019s paramount decision maker since he ousted Egypt\u2019s democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, last summer.Now, more than three years after the Arab Spring uprising raised hopes of a democratic Egypt, his move into the presidential palace will formally return Egypt to the rule of a paternalistic military strongman in the tradition of Gamal Abdel Nasser, Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak.In his long rise to power and a compressed, three-week campaign, Mr. Sisi has shown that he, too, sees himself as a morally superior father figure responsible for directing and correcting the nation, with a firm hand if needed.\u201cYou want to be a first-class nation?\u201d he asked of Egyptians, in a leaked recording of an off-the-record conversation with a journalist-confidant. \u201cWill you bear it if I make you walk on your own feet? When I wake you up at 5 in the morning every day? Will you bear cutting back on food, cutting back on air-conditioners?\u201d\u201cPeople think I\u2019m a soft man,\u201d he added. \u201cSisi is torture and suffering.\u201dLike his predecessors, Mr. Sisi has proved adept at guiding Egyptian history from behind the scenes. He teamed up with President Morsi to take the job of the former defense minister two summers ago, only to oust the president himself last summer. As chief of military intelligence, Mr. Sisi was also the secret architect of the strategy the generals employed during the 2011 uprisings, siding with \u201cthe people\u201d against President Mubarak while ensuring the army stayed in control.All but unknown until 10 months ago, Mr. Sisi was immediately elevated to the status of national hero by a broad section of the public \u2014 and all of the state and private media \u2014 because he promised order and stability after three years of upheaval. Now he will preside over the most populous and, in many ways, most influential Arab state.He has quickly displayed a certain nostalgia for the Nasserite state dominance of the economy that set the stage for six decades of stagnation. He has proposed government projects to force down prices and profits as well as to irrigate and give away vast areas of desert. And he has expressed frankly condescending views of the public.The military, Mr. Sisi told fellow officers in a leaked recording of a meeting last December, is \u201clike the very big brother, the very big father who has a son who is a bit of a failure and does not understand the facts.\u201d Urging patience with public criticism of the army, Mr. Sisi asked: \u201cDoes the father kill the son? Or does he always shelter him and say, \u2018I\u2019ll be patient until my son understands\u2019?\u201dA Nation DividedBut if he likens Egyptians to his family, he will lead a nation as deeply divided as it was the day last July when he ousted and imprisoned Mr. Morsi. Security forces have since killed more than a thousand of Mr. Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters at street protests and jailed tens of thousands of others. Millions more are alienated from the new government. Extremist violence has surged.The economy teeters close to the brink. An inefficient system of energy subsidies is bankrupting the Treasury, but the low prices have become so ingrained that any reform could be explosive. In 10 months, the Egyptian government has burned through $20 billion of financial aid from supportive Persian Gulf monarchies, and it is counting on billions more for at least the next several years.But Mr. Sisi often suggests that the problem is not the fault of the state but the failings of its people, whether a lack of industry and enterprise, a moral laxity that has tolerated rampant sexual harassment, or even the exponential growth in the population.He recently complained to a group of young doctors that Egypt could not possibly afford to offer so many people the same level of health care the defense ministry now provides to families of officers, much less guarantee education and employment. \u201cWhy? Because there is nothing!\u201d he shouted, urging the doctors to work harder for less.As a student at the United States Army War College, in Carlisle, Pa., during the Iraq war in 2005 and 2006, Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi wrote a 17-page thesis about potential paths to democracy in the Arab world.For challenges from protests to poverty, his solutions are almost always expanding the government\u2019s power. In an interview, he talked of unlocking the \u201cmagic wand\u201d of Egyptians\u2019 \u201cself-ability,\u201d but by \u201cmaximizing the role of the state.\u201dAs a speaker, he is a charismatic populist. Mr. Sisi often hails the Egyptian people as the \u201cultimate authority\u201d who drafted him to public office. He can speak in a style so sentimental that it seems almost romantic, cooing that the Egyptian people are \u201cthe light of my eyes,\u201d evoking comparisons to Abdel Halim Hafez, a midcentury crooner of the Frank Sinatra-style.\u201cSisi is soft and sweet, as if he is flirting with a beautiful woman,\u201d said Hassan Nafaa, a political scientist at Cairo University.But in television interviews, he raises his voice to reprimand or silence his questioners and promises Egyptians a kind of tough love. \u201cI will not sleep and neither will you,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in a television interview. \u201cWe must work, night and day, without rest.\u201dIn addition to vast government projects that would force private companies to lower both prices and profits, Mr. Sisi has proposed to distribute trucks for the unemployed to find work hauling vegetables to new markets. His pledges to irrigate vast acreage of desert for distribution to small farmers resemble schemes the government discussed or tried under both President Sadat and President Mubarak.\u201cThe state has to be in control here,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in the television interview, insisting the government would plan, choose \u201cand execute.\u201dNo Room for DissentMr. Sisi says the job of president also includes improving public morals and \u201cpresenting God\u201d correctly. He has said bluntly that as president he would take legal action against personal insults. And although a wave of protests against Mr. Morsi helped Mr. Sisi to power, he has defended the current government\u2019s virtual prohibition of demonstrations.\u201cThe existing dangers to the Egyptian state are much bigger than a discussion of the protest law,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who thinks otherwise wants to destroy Egypt.\u201dMr. Sisi\u2019s childhood friends and neighbors say the district was then a prosperous neighborhood of middle-class traders and tradesmen. Mr. Sisi\u2019s father, Said el-Sisi, owned a shop in the storied Khan el-Khalili bazaar and several small workshops, and he was one of the neighborhood\u2019s biggest employers and richest men, they say.\u201cHe always dressed in a suit and tie, and all the others wore djellabas,\u201d said Hussein Abdel Naby, a lawyer who grew up downstairs from Mr. Sisi in a building that his father owned, referring to a traditional peasant gown worn by Egyptian men. \u201cHe was the only one who drove a Mercedes.\u201dMr. Sisi\u2019s father was a stern and intimidating figure, several residents of the neighborhood said, and Abdel Fattah\u2019s zeal for exercise stood out from the other boys. He would hop up and down stairs to develop his calves, Mr. Abdel Naby said, or alternate reading a schoolbook with dropping to do sets of push-ups.\u201cHe used to punish himself,\u201d Mr. Abdel Naby said. After his father looked askance at Mr. Sisi for the vanity of his necklace and open-collared shirt, Mr. Sisi shaved his own head. \u201cBecause I know I did something wrong,\u201d he told his friends, as Mr. Abdel Naby recalled.Mr. Sisi\u2019s father married a second wife and had a second family, as permitted in Islamic teachings, his neighbors and friends said. At the age of 21 Mr. Sisi became engaged to a cousin who lived across the street. His wife, mother, sisters and daughter have never worked outside the home, several friends and neighbors said. (The campaign declined to comment.)Two of Mr. Sisi\u2019s sons followed him into branches of Egyptian intelligence, and his daughter married the son of the new military chief of staff.By his 20s, Mr. Sisi was already in the military and dreaming of greatness. In another leaked recording, he is heard telling his journalist-confidant, Yassir Risk, that a voice in a dream said to him, \u201cWe will give you what we have given to no other.\u201dIn another dream, Mr. Sisi discussed premonitions with former President Anwar Sadat. \u201cI said to him: And I know I will be the president of the republic,\u201d Mr. Sisi recalled.His first chance to shape history came near the end of the Mubarak era. A few months after Mr. Mubarak promoted him to head of military intelligence in 2010, General Sisi delivered a prescient report to top generals. He argued that their own interests, and Egypt\u2019s, would soon diverge from the president\u2019s, according to three people briefed on the discussions by General Sisi and other top military leaders.General Sisi told the top officers that military intelligence had concluded that Mr. Mubarak was preparing to anoint his younger son, Gamal, as Egypt\u2019s next president, perhaps as soon as the elder Mubarak\u2019s 83rd birthday, in May 2011, these people said.Egyptians would rise up in revolt, Mr. Sisi predicted, and the internal security forces would not be able to contain it. So Mr. Mubarak would call for help from the army, General Sisi said, according to all three independent accounts.Mr. Sisi \u201ctold them, \u2018Are we ready? How do we respond to this question?' \u201d recalled Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, 90, a former journalist-historian who was close to President Nasser and is now close to Mr. Sisi. \u201cHe was the one who proposed to the army that they should not back Mubarak.\u201dThe anticipated revolt erupted five months earlier than Mr. Sisi thought, in January 2011, set off by events in Tunisia. But the generals followed precisely the plan Mr. Sisi laid out, said Mr. Nafaa, the Cairo University political scientist, who learned about Mr. Sisi\u2019s report along with Mr. Risk at a dinner with Mr. Sisi and three other generals after the officers had finally removed Mr. Mubarak.\u201cThe army deployed very smoothly on January 28, 2011, because they had a plan to go to the streets, and they simply moved it forward, to take advantage of the revolution,\u201d Mr. Nafaa added.Initially, Mr. Sisi was \u201ckeen that the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist option, be given a chance,\u201d Mr. Heikal recalled.Counseling MorsiPhotographs with Mr. Morsi show Mr. Sisi in deferential postures, looking down with his head bowed, or sitting in a slight hunch with his hands between his thighs. But Mr. Sisi now says that in private he had vehemently disagreed with Mr. Morsi. Among other points, Mr. Sisi says, he objected to Mr. Morsi\u2019s pardon of jailed Islamist militants, whom the current government blames for the violent backlash against the takeover.In his television interview, Mr. Sisi said that he had complained angrily to Mr. Morsi, \u201cYou are letting people out who will kill us!\u201d But the president kept silent, Mr. Sisi said.Mr. Sisi\u2019s account, however, is at odds with the record. It was the top generals who released almost all of the militants even before Mr. Morsi held power. According to a tally published by the website Mada Masr, the generals released more than 850 militants, while Mr. Morsi released only 18.Mr. Sisi and his supporters also blame Mr. Morsi for allowing Islamist militants free rein in Sinai. The army always stood ready to help the police with security, Mr. Sisi said in an interview, as it now has aggressively. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for it,\u201d Mr. Sisi said, speaking on behalf of the military.But in a leaked recording of an officers\u2019 meeting in October 2012, Mr. Sisi said he had refused that job. \u201cI always stress to the senior people, my mission is not to combat terrorism,\u201d Mr. Sisi said, citing \u201cvery grave dangers\u201d of civilian casualties. \u201cYou would be creating an enemy against you and against your country, because there will have been bad blood between you and him.\u201d (In letters smuggled from prison, two top Morsi aides also said Mr. Sisi had refused the president\u2019s request for military action in Sinai.)In private meetings after the takeover, Mr. Sisi often repeated that he had tried to advise Mr. Morsi about ways to stay in office, or, later, to persuade him to accept a referendum on his continued rule, other cabinet members said. But since then Mr. Sisi has increasingly argued that the essential nature of the Brotherhood \u2014 whose party won successive free elections \u2014 poses a threat to Egypt.\u201cTheir ideological structure makes confrontation with us inevitable,\u201d he said in a television interview. \u201cThe ideological structure of these groups is that we are not real Muslims and they are real Muslims,\u201d he continued. \u201cAn ideology like that cannot come back.\u201dMayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Loses Ground as Investors Seek Safety", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe stock market fell back from record levels on Wednesday as investors decided it was better to play it safe.A day after the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index flirted with 1,900 mark for the first time, investors turned their backs on stocks that would benefit more than others from a reviving economy. Consumer discretionary stocks, a group that includes luxury retailers and entertainment companies, dropped. Industrial and technology companies also fell, and riskier small-company stocks continued their sell-off after a rebound on Monday.Instead, investors sought safety in utility and telecommunications stocks \u2014 favorites when the market gets choppy \u2014 which rose the most in the S.&P. 500. Government bonds also rallied, pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to its lowest point in about six months, another sign that investors were favoring safer assets.\u201cThere\u2019s some internal self-correction and rotation going on beneath the surface,\u201d said Jim Russell, a regional investment director at U.S. Bank. Mr. Russell said stocks were getting closer to being fairly valued.The S.&P. 500 fell 8.92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,888.53. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 101.47 points, or 0.6 percent, to 16,613.97. Both reached nominal record highs on Tuesday.The Nasdaq composite index fell 29.54 points, or 0.7 percent, to 4,100.63. The Russell 2000 index, a gauge of small-company stocks, fell 18.02 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,103.14. The index has slumped 9 percent since peaking on March 4, as investors have fled risk.Bonds benefited from investors\u2019 appetite for safer assets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note declined to 2.55 percent from 2.61 percent on Tuesday, as its price rose 18/32, to 99 19/32. \u201cPeople are rotating out of equities and into bonds,\u201d Mark Pibl, United States fixed-income strategist at Canaccord Genuity, a wealth manager, said of Wednesday\u2019s moves in the bond market.Bonds have rallied this year because inflation remains low and investors have been concerned that the economy may not grow as quickly as anticipated. The Barclays index of Treasury bonds maturing in 20 years or more has gained 10.6 percent this year, outperforming the 2.2 percent rise of the S.&P. 500.In corporate news, the Fossil Group, a maker of watches, jewelry and accessories, was the biggest decliner in the S.&P. 500 in terms of percentage. Fossil fell $11.45, or 10.3 percent, to $100 after the company said late on Tuesday that its first-quarter net income had fallen 8 percent despite sales gains across all its business segments. The results beat market expectations, but the company gave a weak forecast.The farm equipment maker Deere & Company fell $1.91, or 2 percent, to $91.70 after it reported a decline in second-quarter net income because of weaker demand for its products. The company also cut its full-year sales forecast.The American depositary receipts of Sony dropped $1.14, or 6.5 percent, to $16.50 after the Japanese electronics giant reported a loss of $1.3 billion and forecast more to come as it struggles to execute a turnaround.Almost all the companies in the S.&P. 500 have finished reporting their first-quarter earnings. Earnings rose 3.3 percent for the period, according to S&P Capital IQ. That compares with growth of almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Democracy Triumphs in India, but Falters Again in Ukraine", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryIt is often noted, correctly, that elections are not the whole of democracy. But when millions upon millions of people in an enormously diverse and complex land like India vote over several weeks for an orderly change of government, it is a heartening sight. Especially so when set against people taking the law into their own hands in Ukraine, Thailand or Vietnam.The vote was above all a resounding rejection of Congress and the latest Gandhi to carry its banner, 43-year-old Rahul Gandhi. India is undergoing profound change under the forces of urbanization and economic growth, and almost 100 million new voters had been registered ahead of this election. For many of them, the Congress legacy and the dark taint of Hindu nationalism on Mr. Modi and the B.J.P. were less relevant than the promise of fresh thinking after years of ineffectual governance and corruption scandals.As governor of Gujarat State for 13 years, Mr. Modi, 63, came to be known as a tough, pro-business leader with little tolerance for corruption. He also ran a more modern campaign than Mr. Gandhi, including a far greater presence on social media. His election promptly sent the Indian stock market soaring. But Mr. Modi also carries baggage. He is held responsible by many of India\u2019s Muslims for failing to stop religious riots in his home state in 2002 that left more than 1,000 people dead.Still, when democracy is nonexistent or under threat in so many corners of the world, there is cause to celebrate when a dynasty graciously steps aside and its spokesman proclaims, \u201cWe humbly accept the verdict of the people of India.\u201dMeanwhile, in UkraineThe alternative continued to play out in southeastern Ukraine, where thugs nostalgic for a Moscow-ruled Soviet empire had seized administrative buildings and on May 11 held what they called referendums, asking people whether they endorsed the \u201cpeople\u2019s republics\u201d they had proclaimed in Donetsk and Luhansk. To no one\u2019s surprise, the armed organizers said that large majorities voted yes.A similar scenario in Crimea led to its annexation to Russia in March. But Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, seemed content in southeastern Ukraine to tighten the screws on Kiev and force it to grant considerable autonomy to the pro-Russian provinces. The question after the \u201creferendums\u201d was whether Mr. Putin really controlled the secessionists and whether they would allow Ukrainians in their regions to vote in the presidential election scheduled for May 25.But then a curious thing happened. In Mariupol, the region\u2019s second-largest city and the site recently of a bloody confrontation, thousands of unarmed steelworkers went out on Thursday and took control of the city from the separatists. The pro-Kremlin militants melted away.The dominant employer in the city\u2019s mining and metals operations is Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine\u2019s richest oligarch. Until now Mr. Akhmetov had been treading carefully in the crisis, but on Wednesday he issued a statement rejecting separatism and warning his workers that their jobs would be at risk under Russian control. Altogether, Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s companies employ some 280,000 workers in eastern Ukraine. Similar throngs of miners and steelworkers fanned out in at least five cities, including Donetsk, but pro-Kremlin militants remained for the moment in charge.It was too early to call it a turning point, given the 40,000 Russian troops still massed across the border. But public opinion polls have shown that a majority of eastern Ukrainians were for remaining in Ukraine.Colors Clash in ThailandThe paralyzing and often violent clashes between \u201cred shirts\u201d and \u201cyellow shirts\u201d in Thailand offered another contrast with the elections in India. The \u201cred shirt\u201d majority has repeatedly elected governments either led by or loyal to the now-self-exiled populist Thaksin Shinawatra, while the \u201cyellow shirts\u201d of the Thai establishment have regularly found violent or quasi-legal ways to oust them.Moving farther eastward, China\u2019s growing territorial assertiveness in crowded Asian seas provoked a new and surprising eruption of violence in another authoritarian Communist country \u2014 Vietnam. Given the demonstrated ability of Hanoi authorities to turn demonstrations on and off, there was suspicion that the Vietnamese government was behind at least some of the rioting to signal its anger to Beijing. But nationalist passions do have a way of getting out of hand, as Ukraine bears witness.Turkish Mine DisasterPeople also took to the streets in Turkey, but here it was for a different and more tragic reason. An explosion on Tuesday in a coal mine near the western town of Soma choked hundreds of miners to death. On Friday, authorities said they expected the final toll to rise above 300.Serge Schmemann is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times. Advertisement"}

But I would add several ingredients to his prescription for an American energy strategy.Revenue from a carbon tax should be returned to the public to ease the transition to clean energy, or allocated to the infrastructure we need to create a new energy market. In that regard, our electric transmission system is ridden with protective territorial rules and is anything but a modern, reliable interstate transmission system; we cannot create a competitive market for wind power from the Plains or solar energy from the Southwest without developing a long-distance electron highway. (In sharp contrast, our natural gas pipeline system is a great example of a commerce-inducing interstate energy highway.)By their nature, renewable energy projects have very high capital needs at the outset and require help from something like a \u201cgreen bank\u201d to finance the initial stages at low interest. Revenue-neutral carbon taxes could be redirected to such a bank to lower cost and risks.The United States should take immediate steps to drive down the world price of crude oil. It also should lift the ban on exporting American crude oil, and strongly encourage oil-producing allies to open the spigots and flood the market. Driving the price of crude oil down to $60 or $70 per barrel will impose pain on the Russian economy, but lower energy prices could benefit the economies of oil-consuming countries. The risk is a collapsing Russian economy that may produce unforeseen consequences.Re \u201cIn high seas and politics, China moves unilaterally\u201d (News, May 12): This is a disagreement that China may win. Its training aircraft carrier loaded with armed helicopters and a contingent of troops may hold off most, if not all, Vietnamese forces sent to force out the Chinese oil rig. Also China\u2019s second aircraft carrier is being completed at a pace not seen since America\u2019s fleet-building in the 1940s. The expansion of China into the Pacific has begun, with no end in sight. Having been saved by America in 1941-45 from Imperial Japan\u2019s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, China is attempting to force its own version of the same on its neighbors. And like the Japanese version, it is not \u201cco-prosperity\u201d that the Chinese have in mind; it\u2019s coercion.Advertisement"}

You may have marveled at the gleaming new high rises and the pricey penthouses, at the influx of young professionals and the blossoming post-recession economy.But talk to Amy Chan, a 42-year-old waitress, and she\u2019ll tell you the flip side of that story.In her neighborhood in Elmhurst, many Asian families live in crowded apartments and homes, and struggle to get by. Last summer, Ms. Chan lost her job at the Chinese restaurant where she had worked for five years.It took her six months to find another one.Yes and yes. But if you dig below the surface, you\u2019ll find that Ms. Chan\u2019s story is yet another example of the complexities and challenges that have emerged during this unsettled economic recovery period.Half of the city\u2019s Asians live in Queens. And from 2008 to 2012, the percentage of Asians classified as poor increased to 29 percent from 22 percent, the sharpest rise of any ethnic group in the city.The cause? The Great Recession wiped out higher-paying jobs in the borough\u2019s information and manufacturing sectors, the comptroller\u2019s report said. Those jobs have been replaced by work in lower-paying sectors such as retail, health care, food service and other industries.So the wealthy and professionals with good jobs are thriving in Queens. But low-wage workers? Not so much.And that Asian-American model minority stereotype? Well, nationally, the median income of Asian households is still higher than that of any other ethnic group, census statistics show. In New York City, the median income of Asian households was $52,095 in 2012, the second highest of any ethnic group after white, non-Hispanic households.But the community is far from monolithic.Immigrants from some countries have historically fared better economically than others, which is often related to how much education they have when they arrive. Many newcomers work in the service industry where wages remain low. Elderly Asians who lack citizenship sometimes struggle because they are ineligible for some safety net benefits.\u201cThere are a lot of indicators that seem to show that Asian-Americans are doing just fine,\u201d Mr. Shih said.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no need in our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge we face in telling our story.\u201dOfficials in the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who have vowed to improve the lives of working families, said they planned to dig deeper into the statistics to try to develop a targeted approach.Mindy Tarlow, director of the mayor\u2019s Office of Operations, and Nisha Agarwal, the commissioner for immigrant affairs, said that efforts already underway will also help, including improving translation services to ensure better access to city services and benefits, and working to raise the minimum wage.Meanwhile, Ms. Chan, who has a son in high school, considers herself lucky. She and her husband, who works as a chef, had savings to turn to when she was out of work.Even so, the anxiety and stress of joblessness weighed on her.\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult for immigrants,\u201d explained Ms. Chan, who knows that many people born in the United States are also struggling.\u201cYou can only imagine then,\u201d she said, \u201cthat it is even more difficult for us.\u201dEmail: swarns@nytimes.com\nTwitter: @rachelswarns Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fresh Signs Point to Possible European Central Bank Stimulus Plan", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Top officials of the European Central Bank sent strong signals on Wednesday that action to stimulate the economy was all but certain next month. But they also made it clear that the bank was unlikely to make a powerful injection of money into the economy.Such a boost, which the Federal Reserve accomplished in the United States through huge purchases of government bonds, is seen by many analysts as necessary to prevent the euro zone from tipping into a new crisis.At its meeting in June, the E.C.B. is likely to cut the main interest rate to close to zero, begin penalizing banks for hoarding cash by means of negative interest rates and perhaps issue a new round of cheap loans to banks, according to the comments by the central bankers. The E.C.B. could also buy assets like packages of bank loans.But the outlook for inflation and the state of the European economy would have to significantly worsen before the central bank would begin buying government bonds wholesale, Peter Praet, a member of the bank\u2019s executive board, told the German newspaper Die Zeit in an interview published on Wednesday.Continued reluctance by the E.C.B. to deploy quantitative easing, or the buying of bonds and other financial instruments to stimulate the economy, will come as a disappointment to many economists, who warn that the euro zone faces the same kind of prolonged stagnation that has gripped Japan.\u201cAny action that is likely to be taken is almost certainly going to be a case of too little, too late,\u201d Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a consultancy in London, said in an email on Wednesday.With the benchmark interest rate already at a record low of 0.25 percent, the central bank has been struggling to find ways to raise inflation and get banks to lend.The central bank\u2019s main aim in imposing a negative deposit rate would be to lower the value of the euro against the dollar and other major currencies. A negative deposit rate would encourage investors to buy other currencies that pay a better return. Euro zone exporters benefit from a weaker currency because it makes their products cheaper in foreign markets. The bank has expressed concern that the euro is too strong.\u201cNegative deposit rates are a possible part of a combination of measures,\u201d Mr. Praet told Die Zeit. \u201cWe are preparing a range of things.\u201d He also said that the central bank could offer long-term loans to banks, with conditions attached to ensure that banks lent the money to businesses and consumers.At 0.7 percent, annual inflation in the euro zone is below the 2 percent level that the central bank considers healthy. When inflation is that low, debtors have more trouble repaying their loans and there is a risk that some kind of shock could lead to deflation, a broad decline in prices that undercuts business investment and can lead to mass unemployment.Such a shock could come from the current tensions in Russia and Ukraine. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is partly financed by the United States, warned on Wednesday that the dispute could have severe economic consequences in Eastern Europe, countries of the former Soviet Union and the Middle East. That bank promotes economic development in those regions.\u201cThe crisis in Russia and Ukraine is having a severe impact on the economies of the two countries and is threatening to slow down the recovery in the wider E.B.R.D. region \u2014 or even bring it to a complete halt,\u201d the bank said on Wednesday.The statements by central bankers showed wide agreement on measures, short of quantitative easing, to combat such risks.The Bundesbank, Germany\u2019s central bank, signaled that it would not object to more aggressive stimulus measures, which should in turn assure the support of the German public.However, the Bundesbank gave several caveats and remained opposed to the purchase of euro zone government bonds, an action it regards as illegal.Mr. Draghi indicated last week that the bank would announce stimulus measures at its June 5 meeting, assuming that there was no change in the long-term outlook for inflation.\u201cThe governing council is not resigned to having low inflation for too long a time,\u201d Mr. Draghi said last week at a news conference in Brussels. \u201cThe governing council is comfortable with acting next time.\u201dThe euro rose slightly on Wednesday to about $1.37.The Bundesbank would not oppose measures like new low-cost loans to banks or negative deposit rates if such measures were deemed necessary, said the person at the bank, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The Bundesbank also would not oppose the purchase of packages of bank loans, the person said, which could make it easier for banks to lend money in troubled countries like Italy and Spain.Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank, confirmed on Wednesday that he was open to more stimulus.The Bundesbank first indicated in March that it might consider unusual steps to stimulate the economy.Mr. Weidmann is a vocal member of the European Central Bank\u2019s governing council. He has often split with other members over policy and speaks for a significant number of Germans. His support for stimulus measures would reduce the risk that moves by the central bank to push up inflation would alienate the German public.Mr. Weidmann said he had not dropped his opposition to E.C.B. purchases of euro zone government bonds, which he regards as a violation of the bank\u2019s mandate.Yves Mersch, a member of the E.C.B.'s executive board, appeared to leave the door open to quantitative easing, saying in Berlin on Wednesday that the central bank would not be violating its mandate if it bought government bonds.Mr. Mersch defended the central bank\u2019s promise to buy bonds of troubled countries to keep their borrowing rates under control.The program, which has not been put into effect since its announcement in 2012, has been controversial in Germany and was the subject of a legal challenge in the country\u2019s constitutional court. The German court referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, which is considering it.The E.C.B.'s mandate \u201cincludes the possibility of buying, under the appropriate conditions, government bonds on the secondary market,\u201d Mr. Mersch said, according to a prepared text, \u201cshould this be necessary from a monetary policy perspective.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In fact, the number of travelers like her is growing constantly.Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, estimated that some two-thirds of the United States population regularly or periodically focused on special diets. He said almost 5 percent had a food allergy, some 20 percent had a food sensitivity, while 30 percent had consistent dietary preferences \u2014 vegan, vegetarian, kosher and so on. The number of people with special dietary needs is growing at least 10 percent annually, he added.Susie Ellis, president of Spafinder Wellness, a wellness industry media and marketing company, said she was \u201cdefinitely seeing far more gluten-free menu options.\u201d\u201cAnd weight is increasingly a major issue for a huge percentage of the population,\u201d she added.\u201cPeople\u2019s stress levels just continue to skyrocket, and this has a lot to do with technology,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are working 24/7.

One way Marriott International addresses its guests\u2019 dietary needs is through training: Since 2008 it has offered chefs and servers in its restaurants and bars a course that teaches them about food allergies, how to prepare and serve meals free of a guest\u2019s allergen, and how to handle an allergic reaction. Over 80,000 staff members have completed the training, Marriott says.Mr. Harteveldt said airlines needed to \u201cdo better responding to food trends.\u201d He criticized United States carriers in general, saying they focused on \u201cshelf-stable items, high in sodium and fat,\u201d sold in economy class on domestic flights.Carriers considered more proactive in catering to food preferences include Singapore Airlines, which generally offers a choice of 15 special meals to passengers in all classes of service, and Delta, which has 16 special meal categories available in first class on some domestic flights and in all classes of service on most international flights. Special meals usually must be ordered 24 hours before departure.Mr. Harteveldt suggested that full-service hotels might incorporate information on their guests\u2019 special dietary needs in their reservations systems or loyalty program databases. This could let them recommend special menu items at their restaurants when travelers book a room, creating a \u201cway to show that the hotel is responsive and cares for guests\u2019 needs.\u201d\u201cThis could also keep guests on the property,\u201d he said, \u201csomething they might otherwise not do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Rooms decorated in the school colors? Hotels near college campuses are gearing up to attract graduation weekend crowds, just as they compete throughout the year to attract visiting high-school families, graduates attending reunions and parents dropping off freshmen.Large chains are increasingly joining established independent hotels by tailoring their decorations and amenities to the college calendar.\u201cThe hospitality industry is focused on the customer experience right now,\u201d said Michael Giebelhausen, assistant professor of marketing at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. \u201cHotel managers are integrating local elements and upping their games on unique offerings.\u201d This includes syncing those offerings with the rhythms of the local college.Universities are a stable source of business with a predictable seasonality, Mr. Giebelhausen said. \u201cThey can help protect hotels from the ups and downs of the economy.\u201dHotels are varying their efforts to pursue college-related business. The Holiday Inn Elmira, near Elmira College in upstate New York, gets into the spirit by offering purple drinking water, among other things. And for the last two years, guests arriving for the Western State Colorado University graduation and staying at the nearby Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Suites have arrived to lobby decorations, gift bags in their rooms and a letter from the president of the university thanking families for their support.A family\u2019s first visit to the college can be important to a hotel. \u201cIf you can create a memorable experience for the family in the beginning of their freshman year, then you can ideally earn a loyal guest for the four years or six years the student is in college,\u201d said Bryan Barbieri, director of public relations for the Revere Hotel Boston Common, which is near Suffolk University, Emerson College, New England School of Law and Tufts University.Leah Kronthal of Short Hills, N.J., stayed at the Best Western Plus Country Cupboard Inn in Lewisburg, Pa., throughout her daughter\u2019s time at Bucknell University. \u201cThe hotel was always decorated for freshman move-in, parents weekend, and they gave out cards with next year\u2019s events so we could reserve early,\u201d she said. \u201cFriends would recommend this or that cute B&B, but the hotel did all the college events so well we always went back.\u201dThe Revere started offering college-themed packages for freshman move-in in 2012 and last year started offering graduation gifts. A welcome package available throughout the year for families includes college merchandise, museum tickets and other Boston-centric activities. The hotel keeps a supply of themed items from the local schools.\u201cHotels associating themselves with a local college can be seen as a co-branding activity,\u201d Mr. Giebelhausen said, just as a food company advertising that its vanilla ice cream includes Snickers candy bar pieces. \u201cThey are leveraging the strengths of one brand to augment another.\u201dSome hotels go far beyond the gift mug or color-coordinated balloon-arch and tie their interior decoration to the school year-round.The 2012 renovation of the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University renovated the hotel\u2019s interior to closely align with the university. On one wall are mathematical equations; the other has vintage school football helmets. Table linens for meetings are often Vanderbilt\u2019s black and gold.\u201cBecoming a close partner with the university has made for more camaraderie between their faculty and staff and our hotel,\u201d said Jodi Pfeiffer, the hotel\u2019s director of sales and marketing. \u201cThey recommend us to their colleagues coming in for meetings, or to families coming to see the school.\u201dThe Hotel Commonwealth in Boston near Boston University is opening the Terrier Suite, named for the school\u2019s mascot, this summer. The suite will feature a photo montage depicting scenes of the university gleaned from the school\u2019s archives, a minibar that looks like a Boston University locker with monogrammed glassware, and other themed elements.

At the Revere, senior design students at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design designed the staff uniforms as part of a yearlong curriculum. Four Seasons Hotel Austin near the University of Texas has a U.T. Concierge, a recent graduate who helps families with questions about the university. Some colleges own hotels on or near campus. The Gettysburg Hotel, owned by Gettysburg College and managed by Waterford Hotel Group, is in downtown Gettysburg, Pa. Its recent renovation uses school colors throughout the property, and its lobby features a large round carpet depicting the school emblem. Some hotels, of course, do nothing more than raise their rates on popular college weekends. But not all families flock to hotels.Margo Swanson traveled from Seattle to San Diego last week to attend her daughter\u2019s graduation from San Diego State University. She joined with five other family members coming in from around the country to stay at an Airbnb rental. \u201cIt\u2019s more convenient and saves money to share a house and barbecue in the backyard,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Elections Nearing, Republican Senators Take On Yellen on Jobs", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans on Thursday sharply questioned Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, about the persistence of unemployment and the slow pace of the economic recovery during a hearing that highlighted the growing prominence of election-year considerations on Capitol Hill.The hearing before the Senate Budget Committee flipped the standard script of congressional sessions in recent years with Ms. Yellen and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. Generally, Democrats are the ones who fret about unemployment and the weak economy, while Republicans question whether the Fed will lose control of inflation or destabilize financial markets.With the midterm elections approaching, however, Democrats are increasingly eager to claim credit for the progress of the economic recovery, while Republicans are emphasizing that the recovery remains weak and incomplete.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the committee, was particularly critical of the Fed\u2019s performance, sharply questioning Ms. Yellen\u2019s statement that the labor market was showing signs of progress.\u201cWe\u2019ve got fewer people working today than there were in 2007 and the population has increased by 15 million,\u201d he said. \u201cSo how is this progress? Please tell me.\u201dWhen Ms. Yellen responded that things were getting better, but were still not good, Mr. Sessions suggested the Fed should not overstate the improvement. \u201cFrom the point of view of working Americans, this is the slowest, most anemic recovery that we\u2019ve seen, ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever we\u2019re doing, we need to get better at it.\u201dSenator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, asked Ms. Yellen what it would take for the Fed to extend its bond-buying campaign. The Fed is gradually reducing the volume of its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, now $45 billion, with the goal of ending the purchases sometime this fall.\u201cWhenever we meet,\u201d Ms. Yellen responded, \u201cwe ask ourselves the question, \u2018Do we continue to believe that the economy is on a path that will take us toward our objective of reaching full employment or maximum employment?\u2019\u00a0\u201dOther Republicans said that they doubted the Fed\u2019s ability to help.\u201cI worry that the Federal Reserve is trying to use its monetary policy hammer to solve a problem that\u2019s really not a monetary problem and at some risk of doing so,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. Companies, he said, would not invest \u201cno matter how low interest rates go\u201d because they were frozen by uncertainty about the economic outlook. Mr. Portman suggested the Fed could help by ending its stimulus campaign because it had become a crucial source of the uncertainty.Ms. Yellen did not stray from her script in answering the attacks.\u201cMonetary policy is not a panacea,\u201d she said, invoking a favorite line. But \u201cI think maintaining a policy of low interest rates has been helpful in a number of ways.\u201dDemocrats were more supportive. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the committee chairwoman, opened the hearing by thanking Ms. Yellen and the Fed.\u201cOur economy is much stronger than it was five years ago when the Great Recession hit,\u201d she said. \u201cMore workers are getting back on the job, and the unemployment rate has declined to 6.3 percent \u2014 the lowest level since September 2008.\u201dMs. Yellen also faced a significant number of questions about fiscal policy, and she echoed Mr. Bernanke in chiding Congress for its failure to address the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges.\u201cWe can see that going out 20, 30, 50 years without some further shifts in fiscal policy, it\u2019s projected that the ratio of debt to G.D.P. will rise to unsustainable levels,\u201d Ms. Yellen told the committee, referring to the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cI would join my predecessor in saying that I do think it\u2019s important that Congress address that issue.\u201dMs. Yellen also commented on proposals to raise the minimum wage. She said such a change would benefit workers whose pay increased, but was also \u201clikely to have some negative effect on jobs,\u201d an assessment that is shared by many economists. \u201cIt\u2019s a question mark exactly how large that impact is,\u201d she said.In response to questions, Ms. Yellen said that she was in favor of adding someone with community banking experience to the Fed\u2019s board. She said she had shared her view with the White House, which is considering several such candidates for a pair of openings on the seven-member board.Advertisement"}

And the NEC director is supposed to be an honest broker \u2026 while Larry wasn\u2019t known for sublimating his own views.\u201dThe subtle tension continued during the transition period before the start of the Obama presidency. \u201cLarry\u2019s mantra in those days was \u2018discontinuity,\u2019 the importance of distinguishing the Obama response from the pre-Obama response. \u2026 But I didn\u2019t like Larry\u2019s frequent derision of Hank [Paulson] and Ben [Bernanke]; I was protective of them, and of course implicated in virtually everything they had done.\u201d His critiques, Mr. Geithner continued, \u201cweren\u2019t entirely wrong, but Larry hadn\u2019t been there, and I didn\u2019t think he had earned the right to second-guess with that degree of confidence.\u201dAnd perhaps never was their relationship more tricky than the summer of 2009, when President Obama was deciding whether to appoint Mr. Summers to be Federal Reserve chair or to reappoint Mr. Bernanke. While Mr. Geithner doesn\u2019t convey this decision with the drama he offers in other moments in the book, it is clear it was a difficult moment for all involved.\u201cI told the President I thought the current arrangement was working well, and I said this didn\u2019t seem like a great time for a change at the Fed \u2026 When it became clear the president wanted continuity, Larry was disappointed, but I think he also recognized it wasn\u2019t an ideal time for a change. He was tired, too, and he considered leaving the administration. But the President, Rahm [Emanuel], and I all leaned on him to stay, and he relented.\u201dHe adds later in the book: \u201cWe had our differences during the crisis, and nothing was ever easy when he was around, but he was the most talented policy thinker I knew. I felt bad that the Fed chairmanship hadn\u2019t worked out for him.\u201dIt seems that Mr. Summers could see the writing on the wall for his possible Fed chairmanship. \u201cThe job would open up again in 2014, but when the President, on my recommendation, nominated my excellent former Fed colleague Janet Yellen to be vice chair in April 2010, Larry mused that she was certain to be the next Fed chair, because she would be too compelling a choice to pass over \u2014 another correct prediction.\u201d\u201cI did talk a lot about risks to the stability of the financial system, usually to financial audiences. \u2026 I didn\u2019t seek media coverage, and I didn\u2019t get any. But I did try to convey what I was learning about the strengths and weaknesses of the system, and to outline my hierarchy of concerns. In my careful, qualified, occasionally tortured way, I tried to lean against the wind.\u201dAnd, even more pointedly: \u201cMy speeches were never a model of clarity or hair-on-fire force. I was careful to express my concerns in understated, nuanced, deliberately dull language that wouldn\u2019t move markets or depress confidence.\u201d\u201c'When, Gene?\u2019 she demanded. \u2018When are you going to get me another?'\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Detroit Plan to Profit on Water Looks Half Empty", "Date": "2014-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFLINT, Mich. \u2014 As Detroit seeks to settle its debts and chart a viable course for the future, one of its best sources of revenue, clean water for sale, may be evaporating. The fresh water in Lake Huron is still plentiful, but the customers are having second thoughts about Detroit and its vast, aging water system.Detroit pipes much of its water from the lake, and Detroit Water and Sewerage, the city\u2019s water department, sells it wholesale across southeastern Michigan, generating about two-thirds of the city\u2019s water revenue. But this year, Detroit is losing its second-biggest customer, the City of Flint, which has joined with surrounding Genesee County to build a $300 million, 63-mile pipeline parallel to an existing one to bring water directly from Lake Huron, cutting out Detroit.Two other counties have joined Genesee and Flint\u2019s efforts to break away. And separately, Detroit remains in talks with three other counties to reorganize its water system as a regional enterprise, a crucial element of its plan to exit bankruptcy.The moves underscore the foot-dragging and rivalries that can thwart efforts to consolidate municipal services anywhere, but especially in southeastern Michigan, with its patchwork of have and have-not communities.Some local officials, like those in Genesee County, think they will be better off on their own for economic reasons. Not only do they want to dodge Detroit\u2019s future rate increases, but in an age of climate change, they also hope to harness Lake Huron for what they call the blue economy \u2014 investments and jobs in agribusiness, food processing and other industries that use lots of water.Others worry that joining with Detroit in\u00a0a regional business venture will bring a toxic exposure to Detroit\u2019s fiscal ailments.\u00a0The city\u2019s tax base is severely eroded, and even though much of its debt will be extinguished in bankruptcy, people outside the city limits are not eager to help foot whatever bills may remain through new regional projects, taxes and fees. Prosperous, pro-business suburbs, exemplified by AAA-rated Oakland County, have already spent years fighting plans to reinvent Detroit\u2019s convention center, art museum, zoo and bus system as regional enterprises.Wealthy communities are not the only leery ones. Many in distressed Flint, about 70 miles away, suspect that Detroit is overcharging them for water, though outside consultants say that the rates charged by Detroit reflect national medians. When Flint opted to join with Genesee County in what is known as the Karegnondi Water Authority, Detroit urged the state to block it, saying it would be folly for Flint to build an expensive new pipeline when Detroit\u2019s already had plenty of capacity \u2014 duplicating one part of the infrastructure while neglecting other parts that badly needed repair.\u201cIf there were regional cooperation in the greater Detroit area, then Detroit wouldn\u2019t be in bankruptcy,\u201d said Matt Fabian, a managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, noting that several billion dollars in water bonds is at stake.Negotiations for Detroit\u2019s proposed regional water enterprise, the Great Lakes Water Authority, faltered in April. Among the sticking points, county officials said, was a provision for the new water authority to accelerate its contributions to the city pension fund, even though the city itself would get a 10-year funding holiday. Oakland County withdrew from the talks, and its commissioners voted to spend $500,000 studying alternatives to Detroit.A few days later, Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy judge, Steven W. Rhodes, said the chance for the city and its suburbs to run the water utility together was \u201ca unique opportunity,\u201d which, if missed, would \u201cin all likelihood be lost forever.\u201d He then ordered the three counties in the reorganization talks back to the table with a new mediator.Detroit\u2019s emergency manager, Kevyn D. Orr, has included plans for a regional authority in his agenda for reviving Detroit. Uncoupling the system from the city and giving the three counties more power would improve its credit rating and lower its borrowing cost. Detroit would still own the nearly 4,000 miles of water mains; the Great Lakes Water Authority would lease the system, run it and keep any excess cash. The lease payments would bring Detroit $47 million a year for 40 years. The money would go into Detroit\u2019s general fund, where the city could use it for its economic recovery. Under the current structure, the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department must plow any surplus back into its own operations, not subsidize the city.Freeing up the water revenue would be a boon to the city, but bondholders call it an illegal diversion, and wary suburbanites worry that the $47 million a year for Detroit would be a backdoor bailout, using their water bills.Flint and Genesee County are preparing to show they can avoid Detroit altogether.Although they teamed up in 2010, Flint, the seat of Genesee County, had wanted its own water source since at least 1962. A growing, prosperous city then, Flint bought three acres on the shore of Lake Huron, with plans to build a pipeline.But those plans fell through, and Flint signed a long-term contract to buy its water from Detroit. It pays a wholesale price and delivers Detroit\u2019s water locally through city-owned pipes. Detroit built its Lake Huron pipeline to accommodate industrial growth, but industry has declined instead, so the pipeline operates at well below capacity.Losing Flint and Genesee County will cost the Detroit system $22 million a year just in lost revenue, according to the system\u2019s chief financial officer, Nicolette Bateson. It made no sense, she wrote to the state treasurer last year, for struggling Flint to take on debt to build a pipeline when Detroit\u2019s had plenty of capacity. \u201cFlint\u2019s financial flexibility will be impaired for generations,\u201d she warned.The state ultimately approved the new pipeline anyway.Flint has more than a pipeline to blame for its water woes, William G. Stannard of Raftelis Financial Consultants, told the City Council there recently.If water bills in Flint seemed high, he said, it was because Flint\u2019s local delivery system was old, crumbling and built for the needs of a much larger city. About 40 percent of the water Flint had been buying from Detroit was leaking away underground before reaching customers\u2019 taps.\u201cWe can\u2019t charge anybody for that directly, but we are responsible for it,\u201d Mr. Stannard said. And then came the bombshell: Flint\u2019s water bills would continue to rise under the Karegnondi system \u2014 just not as rapidly as they would if Flint kept buying water from Detroit.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it possible for the water rates to go down?\u201d demanded Wantwaz D. Davis, a city councilor. He said rising water rates were driving away residents, and he argued that if rates could be reduced for a few years, people might stay. If Flint\u2019s decline could be slowed, he said, it would improve the financial prospects of the new pipeline.And now there is no turning back. The first $220 million in construction bonds for the new pipeline has already been sold. Flint is supposed to repay about one-third of that, and Genesee County will pay back the rest. The new pipeline is scheduled to go into service in 2016. In the meantime, Flint has been getting its water from the Flint River. It turned off the tap on Detroit on April 25.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Cannabis Goes Corporate", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHershey stopped producing chocolate in Smiths Falls, Ontario, six years ago. The work went to Mexico, but the factory remains, along with reminders of the glory days: A sign that once directed school buses delivering children for tours. A fading, theme-park-style entrance that marks what used to be the big attraction \u2014 a \u201cChocolate Shoppe\u201d that sold about $4 million of broken candy and bulk bars a year.The once ever-present sweet smell of chocolate is gone, too. In the high-ceilinged warehouse, where stacks of Hershey\u2019s bars and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups once awaited shipment, the nose now picks up a different odor: the woody, herbal aroma of 50,000 marijuana plants.Clinical, climate-controlled rooms with artificial sunlight house rows upon rows of plants at various stages of growth. In the \u201cmother room,\u201d horticulturalists use cuttings to start new plants. The \u201cflowering rooms\u201d are flooded with intense light 12 hours a day to nurture nearly grown plants in strains with vaguely aristocratic names like Argyle, Houndstooth and Twilling.A court ordered the government to make marijuana available for medicinal purposes in 2000, but the first system for doing so created havoc. The government sold directly to approved consumers, but individuals were also permitted to grow for their own purposes or to turn over their growing to small operations. The free-for-all approach prompted a flood of complaints from police and local governments.So the Canadian government decided to create an extensive, heavily regulated system for growing and selling marijuana. The new rules allow users with prescriptions to buy only from one of the approved, large-scale, profit-seeking producers like Tweed, a move intended to shut down the thousands of informal growing operations scattered across the country.The requirements, which went into effect in April, are giving rise to what many are betting will be a lucrative new industry of legitimate producers. The government, which will collect taxes on the sales, estimates that the business could generate more than 3.1 billion Canadian dollars a year in sales within the next decade.Canada is not unique in transforming once-forbidden cannabis into a legal, or at least tolerated, proposition. The Netherlands has long allowed personal possession and cultivation of small quantities while allowing commercial sales through licensed cafes. Spain permits growing for personal use. Portugal has decriminalized possession of small quantities of all drugs.In the United States, 20 states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana; both Washington State and Colorado have legalized recreational use with conditions. But marijuana remains illegal under federal law, creating uncertainty; the federal government, for example, recently banned state-legal marijuana growers from using federal water on their crops. Canada\u2019s across-the-board law, by contrast, provides a cohesive set of regulations, laying the groundwork for a group of companies to set up operations.\u2018Why Not Smiths Falls?\u2019\u201cIt was a huge tourist attraction for the town,\u201d Dennis W. Staples, the town\u2019s mayor, said of the Hershey\u2019s factory, which lured about 400,000 visitors a year. \u201cThey were without a doubt an excellent corporate citizen.\u201d The company sponsored sports teams and hockey tournaments and helped underwrite a \u201cchocolate and railway\u201d festival each summer.The relationship seemed so fixed \u2014 the factory had been there for more than 40 years \u2014 that Mr. Staples was a bit puzzled in February 2007 when reporters called asking for comment on Hershey\u2019s plan to leave town. No one had told Mr. Staples. \u201cProbably not the best way to communicate to the mayor,\u201d he said.Hershey shut down its conveyor belts in 2008. But that was just the beginning of the bad news for Smiths Falls. A year later, the province of Ontario closed a nearby home for up to 2,650 developmentally disabled adults. Stanley Tools, an industrial company, left, as did two other American manufacturers. And a portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway\u2019s old transcontinental line, for which Smiths Falls was a regional hub, was ripped up. In all, about 1,700 jobs vanished, according to Mr. Staples.At first, Hershey promised to help the town find a new business to take over the plant. A flavored-water company expressed interest but couldn\u2019t get the money together. In 2012, Hershey sold the plant to a holding company controlled by the Omnicom Group, the ad-agency giant. The new owner inquired about demolition permits last summer.Around the same time, Mr. Rifici, who lives in Ottawa, showed up in Smiths Falls. Mr. Staples and the town council were supportive. They believed that Tweed would help stem, even if just a little, the outflow of jobs and investment.\u201cIf it\u2019s going to happen somewhere in Canada, why not Smiths Falls?\u201d Mr. Staples said. \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to be part of an industry that\u2019s sanctioned by the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create 100 jobs.\u201dThe mayor also had a personal reason. When his younger brother was dying from colon cancer 11 years ago, marijuana was the only way he found relief from his pain.Despite the warm welcome, Tweed has had to overcome the stigma of a once-illicit business. Mr. Rifici said the factory owner wouldn\u2019t lease the plant to a start-up focused on marijuana. So Mr. Rifici and his business partner Bruce Linton had to form a small investment pool to buy the plant for an undisclosed amount.Even once in the building, Mr. Rifici said it was impossible to get a bank loan to buy equipment. Initially, Tweed raised money from private investors. More recently, the company has tapped the public markets for 15 million Canadian dollars by issuing stock. Other licensed marijuana-growing operations have faced similar impediments. When Privateer decided to start Tilray, for example, Mr. Kennedy crisscrossed Canada to find the right spot. It was apparent, he said, that Privateer would hit resistance in many areas. Illegal growing operations had attracted widespread negative publicity for destroying rental houses with mold and creating fire hazards with their lighting systems.In Nanaimo, British Columbia, Mr. Kennedy found economic development officials who eagerly courted Tilray. The city was looking for new businesses to offset a gradual decline of the forestry and fishing industries, the region\u2019s historical economic base. The officials introduced local zoning bylaws that made it easier for the medical marijuana industry to operate.Tilray has since bought a building for $3.5 million and spent $17 million to renovate it. The company employs 65 people, with plans to increase that number to 100. \u201cOne hundred new jobs in a community of less than 100,000, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said.Still, he said it took a while to find a bank that would deal with a marijuana grower. The Royal Bank of Canada eventually agreed to take Tilray\u2019s account and to process its credit card transactions.Nor has Tweed won over everyone in Smiths Falls. Like many small, blue-collar towns in rural North America, it has an illegal-drug problem, mainly crack cocaine and marijuana.Darlene Kantor, 50, works as a building manager, and she says she is thrilled that Tweed came to town with its jobs and millions of dollars of investment. \u201cBut my main concern is: Is it going to make the illegal drugs more rampant?\u201d she said.Some are more skeptical about whether Tweed will be able to provide many jobs. \u201cThey were talking about creating jobs and such, and it\u2019s not going to, it\u2019s not going to do anything,\u201d said Andrew Brinkworth, 18, outside the downtown Tim Hortons. \u201cA lot of people here have criminal records, and they\u2019re not going to be able to get a job at the plant if they have a record.\u201d A 300-Page ApplicationDressed in a casual shirt and slacks, Mr. Rifici, 39, is built from an entrepreneurial mold. His fast speech and seemingly inexhaustible enthusiasm appear to be byproducts of pitching start-up ideas to investors, or anyone who will listen, for two decades.His early interest in the Internet came from playing simple, text-based games. \u201cSlaying virtual dragons with someone from Australia from my computer in my parents\u2019 basement in 1991-92 was eye-opening to how the Internet would fundamentally alter how we lived,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I had to get involved in some way.\u201dIn 1995, during his third year of computer engineering studies at the University of Ottawa, he decided to start an Internet service provider. He sold the business in 2003 for 1.1 million Canadian dollars ($1 million) to a larger competitor, Cybersurf, where he became chief financial officer. Over the next two decades, he helped start a dozen tech companies.His interest in politics indirectly inspired his marijuana business. Mr. Rifici, who volunteers as chief financial officer of the Liberal Party of Canada, one of the three main national parties, closely tracked the evolution of marijuana laws.In October 2012, Health Canada, the federal agency responsible for drug controls, published a long, technical list of proposed reforms. One thing caught his eye: Under the new approach, customers could buy only online or through call centers, types of systems that his Internet businesses had operated. But his background didn\u2019t prepare him for the regulatory strictures of the medical marijuana business. Accustomed to developing start-ups on the fly with little capital, Mr. Rifici and Mr. Linton, another Ottawa entrepreneur who is Tweed\u2019s chairman, underestimated the money they would need by a factor of three, largely because of the government\u2019s regulatory demands. The application ran 300 pages, not including attachments. And before they could even submit applications, Tweed and other growers had to secure sites for their operations and obtain all local permissions. Applicants who passed the initial vetting then had to pass a final, two-day inspection.The requirements are significant. Growers must have sophisticated carbon filtration systems to prevent the smell of marijuana from wafting outside. They must maintain high-security measures like biometric thumbprint readers. Employees need to pass rigorous security checks, conducted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which take four to six months.\u201cIf I knew how much regulatory overhead there would be from the beginning, I would have probably been just as excited about the industry,\u201d Mr. Rifici said. \u201cBut I might have thought that I might not be able to get there.\u201cNothing like a bit of ignorance to allow you to move ahead.\u201dThe red tape was part of an effort to reform Canada\u2019s initial approach to medical marijuana. In court filings, the government suggested that the old system had become little more than a legal veneer for recreational growers, with a significant amount of marijuana making its way to illegal operations. Health Canada said users, on average, grew enough marijuana to roll 54 to 90 cigarettes a day, far beyond what they needed for personal use.Trying to Convince DoctorsWalking the vast, 425,000-square-foot factory, Mr. Rifici talks animatedly about Tweed\u2019s next steps. Just behind the new entrance of glass and shiny stainless steel, he has carved out space for a gift shop. He also hopes to lure a craft brewer into the unused portion of the factory. He wants to make 1 Hershey Drive a destination for tourists again.Tweed is taking a subdued, almost artisanal, approach to its branding, avoiding the Cheech-and-Chong vibe of some rivals. Many of its marijuana strains are named after fusty fabrics like tweed, as well as people and places associated with such clothes. The Herringbone strain is supposed to help with depression. Bakerstreet is used to treat anxiety. Donegal is promoted as a pain reliever.But the industry faces an uphill battle, as prominent doctors, researchers and even the Canadian Medical Association are advising against prescribing marijuana at all. Marijuana, they say, has not been through the testing and approval process required for other pharmaceuticals.\u201cI don\u2019t think any physician today would say: \u2018I suggest you take up smoking cigarettes to deal with your anxiety,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Fitzcharles said.A Fine Legal LineWhen Tweed shipped its first two orders directly to customers on May 5, about half of the company\u2019s management watched, partly for ceremonial reasons but mostly to make sure that its elaborate, government-mandated inventory-tracking system worked. Employees weighed the total inventory before doling out the shipments onto smaller scales calibrated to 0.01 gram. The marijuana was dropped into boxes bearing Tweed\u2019s logo and then, to meet government requirements, vacuum-packed into odor-blocking bags. Then came a final check on the scales before the two parcels left in standard courier pouches that did not bear Tweed\u2019s name.As with many in the new industry, Tweed repeatedly cites a Health Canada forecast suggesting that the user base will grow to more than 400,000 from about 40,000. But some analysts wonder how the industry will reach such levels. Mr. Zettl is one of the few players who acknowledges that many buyers will probably be recreational users with sham prescriptions.Like most people in the medical marijuana trade, Mr. Rifici rejected suggestions that the industry was ultimately counting on the introduction of an open, legalized market. But there is such a possibility. Justin Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party, has vowed to legalize marijuana if he takes power in elections scheduled for next year, and polls suggest that the idea has widespread support.Mr. Rifici, speaking over the drone of dehumidifiers in the production facility, said that \u201cthe difference between medical marijuana and nonmedical marijuana is one of legislation.\u201d \u201cAnd at the end of the day,\u201d he added, \u201cour product is essentially high-quality marijuana under a medical platform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Science Standards Divide a State Built on Coal and Oil", "Date": "2014-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHEYENNE, Wyo. \u2014 Sitting in the headquarters of the Wyoming Liberty Group, Susan Gore, founder of the conservative think tank, said new national science standards for schools were a form of \u201ccoercion,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think government should have anything to do with education.\u201dMs. Gore, a daughter of the founder of the company that makes Gore-Tex waterproof fabric, was speaking here weeks after the Republican-controlled Legislature made Wyoming, where coal and oil are king, the first state to reject the standards, which include lessons on human impact on global warming. The pushback came despite a unanimous vote by a group of Wyoming science educators urging acceptance. Wyoming was the first state to say no, but likely not the last. A House committee in Oklahoma last week voted to reject the standards, also in part because of concerns about how climate change would be taught.Many here and elsewhere consider that liberal dogma rather than scientific consensus and want their children to hear it as theory rather than fact. What is more, some Wyoming lawmakers say, such teaching is a threat to the state\u2019s economic engine.The standards \u201chandle global warming as settled science,\u201d State Representative Matt Teeters, a Republican from Lingle, told The Casper Star-Tribune. \u201cThere\u2019s all kind of social implications involved in that, that I don\u2019t think would be good for Wyoming.\u201d Although oil companies like Exxon and Chevron have publicly supported the Next Generation standards, Mr. Teeters told The Star-Tribune that such teaching could wreck the economy of Wyoming, the country\u2019s largest energy exporter. Mr. Teeters, who declined requests to elaborate, was joined in his objections by Ron Micheli, chairman of the State Board of Education, who called the standards \u201cvery prejudiced, in my opinion, against fossil fuel development.\u201dThe controversy over climate science \u2014 and the question of whether other states will reject the standards \u2014 is in many ways a replay of fights over the teaching of evolution. Opponents say parents and local educators should determine what is taught to children.\u201cWe question this whole idea of standards reform and the whole idea of nationalized standards,\u201d said Amy Edmonds, policy analyst at the Wyoming Liberty Group. \u201cWe believe at the heart that it continues to take away parental choice.\u201dThe new standards were developed by 26 state governments and several groups of scientists and teachers. They provide signposts for what students should learn in each grade between kindergarten and high school graduation, but leave decisions about textbooks and how to teach the curriculum to individual districts, schools and educators.In Wyoming, after 18 months of study and comparison with standards from other states, a committee of science educators unanimously recommended last fall that the State Board of Education adopt the guidelines. In March, at the tail end of the state\u2019s legislative session, lawmakers passed a footnote to the biennial budget, prohibiting any public spending to implement the new standards.And last month, the State Board of Education ordered the committee of science educators to come up with a new set of standards. Mr. Micheli, the chairman and a cattle rancher from Fort Bridger, said he was concerned about any teaching on climate change that did not consider \u201cthe cost-benefit analysis in terms of the expenditure of the effort to bring under control global warming.\u201dIn other states, the debate is also intense. Last fall, the Legislature in Kentucky voted to reject the new science guidelines but Gov. Steven L. Beshear overruled the Legislature and put the standards in place with an executive order. In South Carolina, state-specific guidelines with watered-down references to climate change and evolution are still awaiting approval by the State Legislature.With an election for governor this year, opposing the standards is \u201cbecoming a political litmus test,\u201d said Richard Barrans, a science education professor at the University of Wyoming who served on the state\u2019s standards review committee. \u201cAre you enough of an independent, antigovernment person?\u201d He added that the role of humans in climate change is only a small part of the science standards.Even educators who identify themselves as conservative said they saw no problem with the standards. Walter Hushbeck, a high school science teacher in Cheyenne who served on the standards review committee, said that critics of the standards were \u201cbullies.\u201dNonetheless, Gov. Matt Mead has made clear that he is skeptical of national science standards for Wyoming. Cindy Hill, the state\u2019s superintendent of education, who is running against Mr. Mead in the August Republican primary with Tea Party support, declined to comment.Supporters of the standards are incensed by what has happened.\u201cPolitical realities should not wag the dog of science,\u201d said Marguerite Herman, a lobbyist for the American League of Women Voters in Wyoming and a member of Wyoming for Science Education, a group of parents and educators. \u201cWe acknowledge and appreciate the revenue that has been raised and that runs this state from oil and gas extraction and from the coal mining, and it is a fact that our schools are well funded because of it. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t change a scientific fact.\u201dSome Wyoming school districts have already adopted the Next Generation standards on their own. In Goshen County, the heart of cattle and sugar beet country, for example, science teachers have been developing curriculum around the standards for the past three years.Roger Spears, science facilitator for the school district, said he liked the guidelines because they promoted scientific inquiry and allowed flexibility at the local level. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to be controversial about it,\u201d Mr. Spears said. \u201cThe majority of us will present evidence. That\u2019s what the scientific method is all about.\u201dOn a recent morning at Southeast Elementary School in Yoder, a speck on the map about 75 miles north of Cheyenne, Mr. Spears, wearing his signature tie-dye lab coat, used an electrostatic generator to make a student\u2019s hair stand on end and showed how a bicycle pump could make a puddle of water and some smoke bloom into an instant cloud inside a five-gallon glass jug.With so many jobs in the state dependent on science and technology, Mr. Spears said, it was important that Wyoming students got the best science curriculum. \u201cDo you want our kids, or do you want other people to come and take those jobs?\u201d he asked.Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about Wyoming\u2019s being the first state to reject national science standards for schools misidentified, in some editions, the organization led by Ron Micheli, who said the standards were prejudiced against fossil fuel development. It is the State Board of Education, not the State Department of Education. The article also misidentified, in some editions, a main agricultural crop in Goshen County, where schools have adopted the standards on their own. It is sugar beets, not sugar cane.Advertisement"}

Sometimes you can even read by them.At this furniture fair, I thought I had seen it all: LEDs embedded in resin pigeons, in classical busts, in paper bags. Then I caught sight of the Horsehair sconce by the New York design studio Apparatus: twin hanks of hair suspended like pigtails from a brass arc, each ending in glowing frosted glass.Gabriel Hendifar, Apparatus\u2019s creative director, described the light as a \u201cmuscular thing, nonchalantly hanging from a hook.\u201d Asked whether you could trim your fingernails by it, he said, \u201cI conceived of it more as an art piece that hangs on the wall.\u201dIt was only recently (in other words, pre-2008) that a global wave of \u201cdesign art,\u201d or small-batch expressive work with limited or nonexistent functionality, was the subject of debate. Some loved and collected it. Others called it pretentious. But there were no apologies for the small-batch expressive lighting, some of it quite beautiful, that I saw this year at the Javits and beyond. Throughout the citywide group of exhibitions and other events known as NYCxDesign, designers argued for the importance of setting a mood in a room, or creating a showstopper. If the word \u201cart\u201d didn\u2019t turn up in these conversations, \u201cjewel\u201d often did. And more than ever, lighting looked like a young designer\u2019s pursuit, particularly for a knot of professionals who have emerged out of Brooklyn and matured together as collaborators and friendly competitors.Bec Brittain, for instance, was all over town. The 33-year-old Brooklyn lighting designer showed her angular fixtures at the Javits, while her toothy Seed chandelier was part of a Midtown exhibition by the Brooklyn lighting company Roll & Hill. Downtown, the SoHo design gallery Matter featured Ms. Brittain\u2019s wonderfully weird collaborations with Hilda Hellstrom, a London designer who works in a mottled resin called Jesmonite.At the same time, Jamie Gray, 46, Matter\u2019s founder and creative director and now a newly hatched lighting designer, was introducing Discus at the furniture fair. This LED system has a language of illuminated circles meant to fit anywhere, floor to ceiling, in homes or offices.Also at the Javits, Rich Brilliant Willing, a seven-year-old Brooklyn design studio, presented an LED collection that included Mori, a pendant lamp made from a wire skeleton spray-coated with a thin layer of material. At Sight Unseen Offsite, an invigorating new design show in SoHo, it showed a big scribble of a chandelier called Palindrome. And several weeks ago, the company, which has produced all manner of furnishings, announced that it would confine itself to lighting in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s where we think our best ideas are,\u201d said Theo Richardson, 31, one of the three founders.Jason Miller, 42, who started Roll and Hill four years ago after creating a ceramic lamp cast from deer antlers that became an emblem of Brooklyn design, believes it is only to be expected that young New York designers would find their way to lighting. \u201cIt fits the business of an independent designer well,\u201d he said, explaining that economies of scale prevent small design companies from producing and selling their work cheaply. They need to make premium goods that consumers won\u2019t balk at, and lighting is looked at as a justifiable luxury. \u201cThat\u2019s the sculpture over the table,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThat\u2019s the jewelry.\u201d No one thinks of a couch as jewelry, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a practical thing.\u201dWhich is not to say that other kinds of items at ICFF lacked pizazz. My husband, who accompanied me to the show one afternoon, pointed out the impressive number of stylish bathtubs, including a turquoise model from the Italian company Teuco with black, gray and gold stripes.Decorative surfaces were the order of the day. MT Casa, a Japanese brand of \u201clow-adhesive-strength\u201d tape, set up a booth demonstrating how the exuberantly colored and patterned material can be applied to your walls.And Trove, a wallpaper company never satisfied with being merely pretty, presented Allee, a fantasy image of a misty formal garden inspired by the 1961 film \u201cLast Year at Marienbad.\u201d (Written by Alain Robbe-Grillet, the film is about many things, but chiefly ambiguity.) The 12-foot-tall panorama was shown in the muted graphite of a pencil sketch being erased.\u201cI think things are starting to look a little softer,\u201d said the New York interior designer Benjamin Noriega-Ortiz about his impressions of ICFF. \u201cDesign has become romantic.\u201d In his view, Brooklyn designers fitting together raw hunks of wood have long set the tone for the show, but this year a subtler handling of the material was in evidence.\u201cEven Ross Lovegrove did this beautiful chair in wood,\u201d Mr. Noriega-Ortiz said, referring to the Anne chair commissioned from the Welsh designer for the 125th anniversary of Bernhardt. \u201cThat was romantic,\u201d Mr. Noriega-Ortiz added. \u201cAnd it was comfortable.\u201dThose descriptors also applied to a standup desk by the German company Stilvoll, with compartments neatly stashed under the top. Of course, you have to pay for these virtues: in this case, about $8,300 for the walnut version, and $15,000 for the rosewood. But affordable design was on view as well. Sauder, an 85-year-old company near Toledo, Ohio, that pioneered ready-to-assemble furniture made of particleboard, presented a modish collection of pieces, none selling for more than $650. (Its Objeti table by Joseph Ribic, for example, with a black-and-white painted pattern and compartmentalized top, was about $300.)ICFF takes the initial standing for \u201cinternational\u201d seriously. Once again, there were group displays from Britain, Spain, Austria and Norway, among other countries. But Wanted Design, a satellite exhibition in Chelsea, now in its fourth year, was also an inspiring venue for global talent. A small but eloquent division of Latin American pieces was an eye opener, with collections from Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Puerto Rico and Chile. Bravo! from Santiago, for instance, showed hollowed-out river rocks of appealing purity.Another highlight of Wanted was \u201cNasz,\u201d Polish works curated, and in many cases designed, by Studio Rygalik in Warsaw. \u201cThe name means \u2018ours,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Gosia Rygalik, who leads the company with her husband, Tomek. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want \u2018Poland\u2019 in the title.\u201d Seeing the simple, pale furnishings, one would be challenged to identify their origins, with the possible exception of a folkloric-style carpet adorned with a picture of an urban scene.Like the new Sight Unseen Offsite and the two-year-old Collective fair, which ended last week, Wanted Design showed the advantages of concentrating smartly selected, well-arranged design under a single roof. Not everything was of comparable quality, but there was enough excellence to reward making the trek over. More important were the connections and reverberations established among various designs \u2014 the way Poland, for instance, converses with Mexico in the language of objects.Even ICFF, despite the terrible ambience native to convention centers, had many bright spots from its more than 600 exhibitors. O.K., maybe not the aluminum lamp in the shape of a tiny man playing a guitar. But that did make me laugh.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Spending and Pay Gains Suggest Better Economy", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 After a winter that seemed endless, has the long-awaited spring economic thaw arrived?One day after a dismal report on growth in the first quarter of 2014, fresh data from the Commerce Department on Thursday on personal income and spending in March suggested that the economy may finally be shaking off the effects of the deep freeze. The better-than-expected numbers, with the Federal Reserve\u2019s statement that the slowdown early this year appears to be easing, improved the outlook for renewed growth in the next few months. \u201cWe had a big bounce in March, and that sets us up for a solid gain in the second quarter,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cI\u2019m confident the first quarter numbers shouldn\u2019t be read as a signal of sustained weakness in the economy.\u201d Like many of his peers, Mr. Maki estimated that the pace of growth in the second quarter would increase to an annualized rate of 3 percent, compared to a 0.1 percent gain last quarter.Hopes for better days around the corner have been dashed repeatedly since the fitful recovery began nearly five years ago, but another reality check is set for Friday morning, when the Labor Department will report on hiring and unemployment in April. As has been the case before previous reports, many economists have recently been raising their estimates for what the data will show in terms of hiring. They have been disappointed many times in the past, but on Wall Street, at least, hope springs eternal. The average estimate among economists polled by Bloomberg is that employers added roughly 218,000 jobs in April, with the unemployment rate falling by 0.1 percentage point to 6.6 percent. A week ago, forecasters predicted a gain of 210,000 jobs. While that might seem like an insignificant change \u2014 even a 218,000 uptick in hiring is practically a rounding error in an American economy where more than 146 million people are already working \u2014 investors will be watching for clues to whether activity did in fact pick up as the second quarter began.Experts will also be watching to see if Labor Department statisticians increase the number of jobs they estimate employers added in February and March, or if there are signs that sectors hit by cold weather in December and January are bouncing back. With gains of 84,000 in December and 144,000 in January, results for those months were not only much weaker than expectations, but they were far below the average monthly gain of 187,000 positions over the year. Hiring did improve in February and March, with nearly 200,000 workers added in each month, another reason economists are looking for another healthy gain in April. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a 250,000 gain in April,\u201d Mr. Maki said. \u201cIt looks like there was more hiring in April as the thaw proceeded.\u201d On the other hand, Mr. Maki said, a number below 175,000 would renew worries the economy remains feeble. \u201cIt would signal there wasn\u2019t a pickup as we entered the second quarter, and that would be disappointing,\u201d he said.Federal Reserve officials said on Wednesday that they were seeing an increase in economic activity and would continue to gradually reduce monthly bond purchases aimed at stimulating the economy.Besides the Commerce Department data on income and spending in March that was released Thursday, other recent information has been encouraging, said Michelle Meyer, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She cited the ADP survey of hiring among private employers in April, which showed the best monthly increase since November, as well as the April rise in the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s index of factory activity. The seasonally adjusted gain in consumption spending of 0.9 percent in March was the strongest in nearly five years, and it was driven by purchases of durable goods like automobiles and appliances, as well as nondurable goods, like clothing and food. Restaurant spending also bounced back, as warmer weather encouraged formerly snowbound shoppers to head to malls and other retail venues. And with personal spending rising faster than the 0.5 percent gain in income, personal saving as a percentage of disposable income fell to 3.8 percent in March from 4.2 percent in February. \u201cThe second quarter seems to be starting out on a healthy footing,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cThe data on consumption and income was strong across the board.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Boosting the Birthrate", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEarlier this month, a Japanese government advisory panel proposed for the first time a numerical target that, it said, would address the problem of Japan\u2019s declining population.The goal is to ensure a population of 100 million 50 years from now, which would mean raising the current total fertility rate of 1.4 births per woman to over 2 during the next 20 years, a tall order. Until now the government has refrained from setting a specific target for fear of intruding into private decisions about having children. Given present trends, Japan\u2019s population will decrease from 127 million today to 87 million in 2060, at which point about 40 percent of the population will be older than 65. The economic and social consequences of the shrinking and aging population are dire. The panel suggested various ways of encouraging childbearing. It recommended doubling current government social welfare spending on children, noting that countries that have managed to increase the fertility rate like Britain and France spend more than three times what Japan does. And it said the nation needed to create an environment more conducive to young people marrying and choosing to have children, including, for instance, building many more child care centers. One big reason for the low fertility rate in Japan is that women are increasingly postponing marriage in order to work longer and build a career. Over one-third of women between the ages of 30 and 34 are unmarried, and in Japan\u2019s conservative society, marriage remains the socially accepted condition for having children. Only 2 percent of Japanese babies are born outside of marriage, and there is still a strong stigma attached to such births. The vast majority of single mothers are divorced, as divorce has become more socially acceptable over the past generation or so. Public policies, like the tax laws, continue to discriminate against mothers with children born out of wedlock compared with divorced mothers with children. In light of the dire predictions of population decline, the government might well rethink its discriminatory attitude toward births out of wedlock, which have been a critical factor contributing to the increase in fertility rates in other advanced economies. In France, for instance, out-of-wedlock births rose from about one-tenth of all births to over half in the last three decades. While the Japanese government need not promote such births, it should at least adjust its policies so that all women with children are treated the same whether they have been married or not.Advertisement"}

But picking a planning guy to run the Department of Parks and Recreation, overseeing 29,000 acres of parkland, is not as contrarian as it might appear, he suggested. Having recently served as president of the American Planning Association, he has long studied the way parks fit into the larger urban fabric.\u201cI believe in the anatomy of a place, of a city,\u201d he said. \u201cParks are a system within a city. They are connected to culture. They are connected to traditions and memories, the economy, the natural systems. As a planner, I take a very different view of parks, as not just a green space but a public space.\u201dMr. Silver, a Brooklyn native, graduated from Midwood High School and earned degrees from Pratt Institute and Hunter College. He worked for the city\u2019s Planning Department before overseeing northern Manhattan for the borough president\u2019s office. He learned to ride a bicycle in Prospect Park and, as a member of his high school\u2019s track team, ran through Van Cortlandt Park. As a young planner in the 1980s, he would relax in one of Bryant Park\u2019s signature bistro chairs after its turnaround. He said he \u201cloved to see the evolution\u201d of that park, \u201cfrom when it was really not a welcoming place to the whole redesign; it\u2019s just a wonderful public space.\u201d While he was still learning the layout of his fortresslike headquarters, Mr. Silver ticked off his main areas of focus for a parks system that includes 13 golf courses, 695 tennis courts, 14 miles of beaches and 650,000 street trees. His priorities, he said, are park equity, resilience, community health, safety and innovation. Perhaps it was no accident that \u201cequity\u201d topped Mr. Silver\u2019s shortlist. For the past year, equality has emerged as the key issue for Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration. The success of some conservancies, in particular those of Central Park, Prospect Park and the High Line in raising money and paying for upkeep, has served to highlight the disparities across the system\u2019s 1,900 parks and playgrounds.\u201cI boil down equity to one simple word: fairness,\u201d Mr. Silver said in an interview. \u201cAre we being fair on how we distribute our resources? Are we being fair on how we manage our system? People know when they\u2019re not getting their fair share.\u201cSo equity and fairness to me is absolutely paramount. How we figure that out, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019ll be a lot of meetings, both internally but also externally with our partners, to figure out how we can have a fair parks system.\u201dAs he made his way from floor to floor, meeting employees, Mr. Silver made the occasional quip. While shaking hands with the staff from a program named Operations Excellence, he said, \u201cI love that phrase.\u201dIn a second-floor hallway, he saw seats from the original Yankee and Shea Stadiums. \u201cThey\u2019re facing each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be.\u201dHe seemed especially taken with the Arsenal\u2019s two rooftop gardens, where the staff can go to relax or eat lunch. The gardens \u2014 planted with weeping white pine, cucumber magnolia and dwarf conifers \u2014 look out over the sea lion pool at the Central Park Zoo and beyond to the Central Park South skyline. \u201cThis is where I actually want to have meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is amazing.\u201dKate Spellman, his chief of staff, volunteered: \u201cWe can relocate you up here for the season.\u201dMoving back to New York, Mr. Silver was getting a second shot of spring \u2014 he had already seen the season bloom in Raleigh.And he said that he was looking forward to reconnecting with the city\u2019s newly reclaimed waterfront, with its 520 miles of shoreline. \u201cI grew up around water and with water, and it\u2019s nice to see water again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get that in Raleigh \u2014 unless there\u2019s a flood.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In California, Governor Pushes a Rainy-Day Fund", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 After overcoming years of fiscal dysfunction that stemmed in part from an antitax ballot referendum, Gov. Jerry Brown is trying to call California voters to the ballot again \u2014 this time to approve a constitutional amendment requiring that surpluses be used to pay down municipal debt and create an emergency fund.The proposal comes as the state has ended years of multibillion-dollar budget gaps and is in the midst of another boom, bringing in billions more than it predicted in tax revenue this year and facing a budget surplus even more flush than anticipated just months ago.As he begins campaigning for what would be an unprecedented fourth term as the state\u2019s governor, Mr. Brown, a Democrat, is eager to play up his frugality, which has helped turn around the state\u2019s era of i.o.u.s. If he succeeds in his attempt to create a permanent contingency fund, it would be a crowning achievement in his efforts to right the state\u2019s finances.\u201cWe need something to force savings during the exuberant periods of surplus,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview last week, sitting at the breakfast table inside the governor\u2019s mansion here. (The mansion is purely for tours these days: Mr. Brown favored moving into an apartment near the Capitol rather than spending money on renovations needed to make it livable.) \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to spend on the high and lock in programs that become completely unaffordable.\u201dStill, it remains unclear how many states will address long-term structural problems, particularly finding money for underfunded pension liabilities. Mr. Brown has said he wants to find a way to allow the reserve to be used each year to help pay down pension debt, which includes an $80 billion shortfall for the California State Teachers Retirement System.In many ways, California\u2019s troubles are rooted in strict regulations against rising property tax rates, a landmark constitutional amendment that voters approved in 1978 and that led to a taxpayer revolt throughout the country. The measure cut and capped property taxes for existing owners, limiting them to 1 percent of valuation and making it more difficult for municipal governments to use climbing property values to fill their coffers. The initiative spawned several other voter-approved budget regulations that limit the State Legislature\u2019s ability to shape the budget, including setting minimum spending levels on public schools.\u201cWhy would we tax those who can most afford it at a lower rate \u2014 that\u2019s laughable on its face,\u201d said Mr. P\u00e9rez, who has promoted the idea of a rainy-day fund for months. \u201cMy main concern is that we do this now, while the recession is still fresh in our memories. We all know what it was like to preside over very, very painful cuts. This is our best effort to stop this from happening again.\u201dSeveral recent polls show that voters enthusiastically back rainy-day fund proposals, and Mr. Brown is convinced that his bigger challenge is winning over the State Legislature. While Democrats may object to more budget restrictions, Republicans are more supportive of a rainy-day fund proposal already on the ballot that was negotiated by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2010 \u2014 his last year in office and the last time the Republican Party had any control over state finances. That proposal would essentially set a spending cap, which Mr. Brown and other Democrats say is too limiting.\u201cThis has implications for generations to come,\u201d Mr. Steinberg said.He added, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about a double-whammy of a lot of money going to a rainy-day fund and a separate appropriation going to pay down debt, which would leave little room for infrastructure, public safety, education and other key investments that have been cut deeply.\u201dThe state has had a rainy-day fund for nearly a decade. But payments to it can easily be waived by a governor, and it has mostly gone unfunded since it began. Under Mr. Brown\u2019s plan, any increase in capital gains tax would be set aside in the fund, which could also be used to pay down long-term debt.During Monday\u2019s brief hearing on the fund, Mr. Brown was met with a chorus of support from State Assembly members of both parties, including a longtime Republican lawmaker who said she trusted Mr. Brown with state finances and expected him to stay in office for another four years, apparently taking his re-election for granted.While Republicans in both houses have mostly been left out of negotiations for the last decade, Mr. Brown will need to sway at least two Republicans in the State Senate \u2014 and most likely more, since Democrats there appear to be the most reluctant.An earlier version of this article misstated how much a 1978 constitutional amendment cut and capped property taxes for existing owners; the amendment limited them to 1 percent of valuation, not 2 percent.

A few months later, when she was ready to go back to work, she discovered it wasn\u2019t so easy to find her next gig. \u201cOur play closed on the day Lehman crashed, and my world dissolved,\u201d she said, recalling the start of the financial crisis in 2008.But then she met Danielle Grace Warren, who, at 25, was involved in a project to improve conditions and business prospects for the 600,000 women in Ghana who work in the global trade of cosmetics and cooking products made from the nut of the shea tree.They also defy the persistent stereotype about younger and older people battling over jobs in the still-shaky economy.When these multigenerational ventures succeed, if is often because of the different sets of skills and perspectives that an older and younger person can bring to solving a problem.Lara Galinsky, senior vice president of Echoing Green, which provides seed funding to emerging social entrepreneurs, says she frequently sees such partnerships. Though the average age of their applicants is 29 to 32, she explained, \u201cWhen you unpeel the layers, there\u2019s often someone older who\u2019s been guiding them in a mentor role or as part of the founding team.\u201dMs. Boyle said she felt an immediate connection to Ms. Warren and her project. She grew up traveling often to Ghana and other parts of West Africa and had spent most of her career in the nonprofit sector. Initially, she volunteered her time, making introductions to her network of contacts. After about six months, the two secured an angel investment from a family friend of Ms. Warren\u2019s, which turned their cause into a venture. The two are paid the same salary, which rises and falls based on how fund-raising is going.The company\u2019s products are sold in stores like ABC Home and through the Just Shea website. Though the venture is gaining traction, Ms. Boyle still takes on outside freelancing work. \u201cI do worry constantly about paying the bills, but I\u2019ve had an incredibly interesting chock-a-block full life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do have this loft, which is my pension, 401(k) and I.R.A. It\u2019s a sadness, but at some point I will have to move out of the loft so that its sale will care for an old me.\u201dMs. Warren says working alongside someone twice her age feels natural. She learned about being an entrepreneur from her father, who has run a series of small businesses, including a tropical flower farm in Florida and reforestation project in Haiti. When she was in college, her father invited her to Haiti to help develop an idea he had for a women\u2019s resource center, to provide classes in sewing and other skills and information about health and nutrition. Ms. Warren\u2019s family wasn\u2019t rich, but playing this kind of role was a part of her upbringing. Ms. Boyle feels a similar comfort in the team. Her daughter is the same age as Ms. Warren.When Ms. Boyle and Ms. Warren describe their respective contributions, they explain how their ages and life stages complement one another. They use Ms. Boyle\u2019s loft as an office and meeting space, even as a place to hold fund-raising events. \u201cI also have tons of contacts from a life lived across careers,\u201d Ms. Boyle says. She found a chemist who turned the raw shea into a marketable product, for example. Ms. Warren, by contrast, has relationships with funders of organizations like theirs and with others working on similar globally oriented social ventures. With no children tying her to the United States, she can travel to Ghana for long periods of time to focus on local fund-raising opportunities and to work with their employee on the ground. \u201cWe share like mad,\u201d Ms. Boyle said.Mr. Stokar proposed bringing on some younger physicians and medical staff and training them in Dr. Lupin\u2019s approach to care. \u201cWhen Daniel talked about \u2018taking my practice to scale,\u2019 so that we could help hundreds, perhaps thousands more patients, I had never even heard that phrase,\u201d Dr. Lupin said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a term my generation used.\u201dEach family member has a well-defined role. Dr. Lupin interviews and hires other doctors, and serves as a mentor to them. Daniel Stokar runs the business of office. And Daniel\u2019s father, Avi Stokar, who is a software engineer and computer programmer, is the resident technology expert. He created the electronic medical system used by the practice to track patient data during the house call visits.\u201cIt\u2019s a real blend of the old and the new,\u201d Dr. Lupin said. \u201cWhat we are doing medically \u2014 the actual rendering of bedside care \u2014 is very old. But every other aspect of the delivery is modernized.\u201dSince its start (originally as Brooklyn Housecalls), Housecalls for the Homebound has brought on six additional doctors and a nurse practitioner and has provided care to about 800 patients. They have a model that provides doctors with a competitive salary, without requiring them to run a back office or do hospital rounds. And they are proud that they have been able to deliver good care at a low cost. \u201cIf we needed to, we could visit a patient in this category even weekly, for an entire year, for less than it costs in New York for a single hospitalization,\u201d Dr. Lupin said. The group also provides consulting services to hospitals and other practices that want to emulate their model.Two years ago, Dr. Lupin stopped going out on house calls, maintaining his role in managing the medical staff and consulting on difficult cases. On average, he says he is working about 15 to 20 hours a week. After 50 years practicing medicine, Dr. Lupin says this work is the most gratifying of his career. And he hopes it will be his legacy. \u201cI can\u2019t pass on my medical slot to my son-in-law and grandson, but I can pass on the project.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fringe Group in Britain Forces Others to Listen", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Nigel Farage boasts that his United Kingdom Independence Party is now \u201cthe fox\u201d in the Westminster henhouse. But in reality, without a single seat in Parliament, he is still prowling the boundaries of the farm.Mr. Farage and his party did well in elections last week for local councils and the European Parliament, setting off some panic among the three more established parties. While the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, appeared to be in serious trouble, Prime Minister David Cameron fared better than expected in his real battle, against the opposition Labour Party.But there is no doubt that the United Kingdom Independence Party, or UKIP, has emerged as a force. Politicians are already trying to recalibrate their positions to deal with the threat of Mr. Farage, whose showing has an impact on both Britain\u2019s domestic politics and its uncomfortable relationship with its European Union partners.At home, UKIP\u2019s real power remains its ability to push the other parties and especially the Conservatives farther to the right, to embrace more moves against immigration and benefits for new immigrants and to ratchet up the criticism of membership in the European Union.In Europe, paradoxically, the strong showing of UKIP and other anti-European Union parties in countries like Denmark, France and the Netherlands is likely to help Mr. Cameron convince his colleagues that the European Union needs to pull in its horns, slow down on integration and return some powers back to the nation states.Arriving at a summit meeting of European leaders on Tuesday, Mr. Cameron called for \u201can approach that recognizes that Brussels has got too big, too bossy, too interfering.\u201dMr. Cameron has promised his party \u2014 and the nation \u2014 that if he is re-elected prime minister, he will try to negotiate a better deal for Britain in the European Union and have an in-or-out referendum on membership in 2017. Labour has refused to make such a promise, which will allow Mr. Cameron to say to those tempted to vote for UKIP that only a vote for the Conservatives will guarantee them the referendum they want, and that a vote for UKIP could throw the election to Mr. Miliband and Labour.If many of them vote for UKIP in marginal constituencies where Tories hold a narrow lead, they will give Labour the election.Mr. Cameron has to frame his campaign carefully, Mr. Kellner said. \u201cIf he moves to the right on Europe and immigration, he risks losing more moderate voters,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than fretting about the precise way to talk about Europe and immigration, Cameron needs to be the sunshine leader and dispel the pessimism that has driven so many Tories into the arms of Nigel Farage.\u201dIn the short term, Mr. Cameron will seek to persuade his European colleagues to nominate a candidate broadly sympathetic to Britain\u2019s objectives as head of the European Union\u2019s executive, the European Commission: in other words, someone who is not associated with \u201cmore Europe,\u201d like Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, who expects to get the job.Upon his arrival in Brussels on Tuesday, Mr. Cameron took what was interpreted as a thinly veiled swipe at Mr. Juncker, calling for \u201cpeople running these organizations who really understand that and can build a Europe that is about openness, competitiveness and flexibility.\u201dThe British government argues that the bloc now needs to reflect on its priorities, such as creating jobs and bolstering competitiveness, and then pick a candidate that fits that profile.One of the best ways of gauging the impact of the vote is to listen to the grumbling about the party leaders. The Liberal Democrat leader, Mr. Clegg, who is also deputy prime minister in the ruling coalition, is in the deepest trouble. His party lost 10 of 11 seats in the European Parliament, and despite a reputation for good local politics, he lost 310 of 737 council seats.There is also considerable growling in Labour ranks about Mr. Miliband, who so far is not seen by voters as prime ministerial. Mr. Miliband\u2019s main theme, the pain of austerity and the high cost of living, has been partly undercut by the turnaround in the British economy, which is creating jobs and booming compared with the rest of Europe, even if most Britons have yet to feel the impact.Some Labourites, like the lawmaker Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, are urging Mr. Miliband to \u201cengage more vigorously on Europe and immigration\u201d to respond to UKIP. Even former Prime Minister Tony Blair, much disliked in the Labour Party despite winning three elections, had advice for Mr. Miliband, urging him instead to confront UKIP and \u201cstand for what is correct and right for Britain.\u201dThe Conservatives have reluctantly rallied around Mr. Cameron, who managed expectations well and presides over a recovering economy. But the Conservatives still trail Labour, though not by a lot, and with a year before the election and Scotland voting on independence in September, more swings of opinion are likely.All three major parties are pointing hopefully to history. In the 2010 general election, UKIP won 3 percent of the vote after having received more than 16 percent of the vote in the European elections the year before. One analysis by the London School of Economics and Political Science, conducted before last week\u2019s vote, predicted that UKIP could win as much as 14 percent of the vote next year, and still capture no seats.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "X Still Marks Sunken Spot, and Gold Awaits", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe discovery of sunken gold conjures up visions of instant riches: Swiss bank accounts and lazy afternoons on faraway beaches, daiquiris in hand.But the quest to salvage the S.S. Central America \u2014 which went down in 1857 in a hurricane off South Carolina carrying 425 souls, as well as thousands of coins, bars and nuggets of California gold \u2014 has produced a quarter-century of broken dreams and legal nightmares.The bones of the side-wheeler were discovered in 1988, nearly a mile and a half down. The finder hauled up glittering coins and boasted of treasure worth $1 billion.But paralysis ensued as waves of insurers and angry investors filed rival claims. Recovery of the shipwreck languished as courtrooms echoed with charges of fraud. In 2012, the finder became a fugitive. Now, with the legal obstacles cleared, a private company working with a court-appointed receiver has become the first to revisit the shipwreck in two decades. It is, the team was delighted to find, still heavy with treasure.On April 15, the company, Odyssey Marine Exploration, lowered a robot into the depths of the Atlantic Ocean and hauled up five gold bars weighing 66 pounds \u2014 worth about $1.2 million as metal and more as artifacts. That step, the company says, opened a new chapter in the saga of the Central America that will include raising the rest of the gold and exploring the deteriorating shipwreck. \u201cWe want to show that it can be done right,\u201d Gregory P. Stemm, Odyssey\u2019s chief executive, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d When it sank, the Central America was steaming toward New York with a cargo meant to strengthen the city\u2019s banks. The 280-foot vessel was carrying so much gold \u2014 commercial and personal riches from the California fields estimated at three tons, as well as a rumored secret federal shipment of 15 tons \u2014 that its loss contributed to the Panic of 1857, considered the first global financial crisis. From the start, the locus of the recovery drama has been Columbus, Ohio \u2014 a landlocked city not known for treasure hunters. It is, however, home to the Battelle Memorial Institute, a private contractor specializing in science and technology.Thirty years ago, Thomas G. Thompson, a plucky Ohio native who was a young engineer at Battelle, began wooing investors with dreams of finding the Central America. Soon, the Columbus America Discovery Group was formed to finance the hunt, including a robot with lights, cameras, arms and claws.The team hit pay dirt in September 1988: Piles of gold coins and ingots lay scattered across the ship\u2019s rotting timbers, and overnight, the investors became millionaires \u2014 in theory, at least. In all, the team lifted up about two tons of gold. If sold today as pure metal, it would fetch $76 million. But as news of the sensational find went public, the group\u2019s investors were not the only ones paying attention. Claims to the fortune came from an order of Catholic monks, a Texas oil millionaire, and Columbia University, where an oceanographer had provided Mr. Thompson with sonar imagery of what turned out to be the shipwreck. And scores of insurance companies insisted that the treasure was rightfully theirs because of claims paid more than a century earlier. Thus began a legal battle that kept the gold locked away. The disputes crippled Mr. Thompson\u2019s ability to raise new funds, and treasure. It was not until about 2000, when insurers were awarded $5 million in gold, that his hands were untied. He sold much of the remaining treasure that his team had recovered, making a reported $52 million.But his 251 investors got nothing. In 2005, some of them sued. John G. McCoy, a Columbus mogul who had invested $219,000, told Forbes in 2006, \u201cI think he was dishonest from the word go.\u201d Mr. Thompson avoided courtrooms, always speaking through intermediaries. One dispute centered on 500 coins that had seemingly vanished. In a 2012 filing, Mr. Thompson said they had gone into a trust in Belize, and in August of that year \u2014 when he failed to show up for a hearing \u2014 a federal judge ordered his arrest.It turned out that Mr. Thompson and his assistant, Alison Antekeier, for years had lived in Vero Beach, Fla., in a mansion set on four acres. By the time federal marshals went there to arrest Mr. Thompson, they had fled.The Columbus Dispatch, whose parent company had invested $1 million in the gold hunt, reported that the couple had left behind empty coin boxes, currency wrappers marked $10,000 (used to band $100 bills in stacks of 100), a bank statement listing a balance of more than $1 million, and a book on assuming a new identity.Federal marshals had billboards put up in Ohio and Florida seeking information about Mr. Thompson and Ms. Antekeier. Mr. Thompson\u2019s last known lawyer, Shawn J. Organ, in Columbus, no longer represents the gold hunter. \u201cHe\u2019s incommunicado,\u201d said Liberty P. Casey, Mr. Organ\u2019s office manager. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen him or been able to track him down.\u201dLast May, the marshals auctioned off Mr. Thompson\u2019s 180-foot ship, the Arctic Discoverer. Its safe was empty.An important part of the legal drama was resolved that month, when Judge Patrick E. Sheeran of the Court of Common Pleas in Franklin County, Ohio, named as receiver Ira O. Kane, a Columbus lawyer and businessman whose task was to recover as much gold as possible for the benefit of creditors and duped investors. This March, Mr. Kane picked Odyssey \u2014 based in Tampa, Fla., and publicly traded \u2014 to resume the hunt. The stakes? Mr. Thompson recovered 532 gold bars and some 7,500 gold coins whose total face value, in 1857 dollars, was $1,126,000. Experts hired by Mr. Kane estimated the likely face value of the remaining gold at $760,000, but put the range at $343,000 to $1,373,000. In other words, more than half the treasure could still be sitting at the bottom of the sea, at least in theory. Mark D. Gordon, Odyssey\u2019s president, told investors in March that the remaining treasure, thought to be mostly gold coins, would fetch at least $85 million if sold for its value to collectors. On eBay, $20 coins from the original haul sell for up to $26,500. Not included in the receiver\u2019s estimate was a cargo long rumored to be aboard the wreck: 15 tons of Army bullion. A best-selling book about the discovery, \u201cShip of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea\u201d by Gary Kinder, published in 1998, called it a secret shipment meant to shore up the faltering Northern industrial economy, and said the Army had recently declassified its existence.In an interview, Mr. Stemm of Odyssey said the reconnaissance dive and retrieval of the five gold bars on April 15, as well as two gold coins, was important for demonstrating that, contrary to rumors that the site had been looted, the deteriorating shipwreck was still tantalizingly rich with treasures. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they didn\u2019t do a complete recovery,\u201d Mr. Stemm said of the original team. He added that the dive \u201cconfirms that the site has remained untouched\u201d since the last retrievals more than two decades ago. Helping direct the April 15 operation was Bob Evans, the chief scientist and historian of the Recovery Limited Partnership, one of Mr. Thompson\u2019s insolvent companies and the legal owner of the shipwreck. \u201cI\u2019m elated,\u201d Mr. Evans said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling my dream.\u201d On April 23, the new recovery ship, Odyssey Explorer, sailed from Charleston to renew the hunt. As a prelude to recovering the remaining gold, Odyssey is surveying the wreckage and will perform an archaeological excavation of the remaining artifacts. The company also plans to collaborate with a scientist from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to study deep-sea life colonizing the site, and to continue science experiments initiated by Mr. Thompson\u2019s team.Odyssey will absorb the expedition costs if little treasure is recovered. If the take is substantial, the company will get 80 percent until it recoups its costs. After that, Odyssey\u2019s share will drop to 45 percent. Judge Sheeran, like the surviving investors, is eager to see what develops.The new plan, he wrote last year, bodes well for \u201cthe rebirth\u201d of the enterprise and a renewed sense of awe as \u201cmore treasure, both historical and monetary, makes its way from the depths of the seas.\u201dAs for Mr. Thompson, it seems likely that he, too \u2014 wherever he is \u2014 is giving serious attention to what emerges next from his ship of gold.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tunisian Discontent Reflected in Protests That Have Idled Mines", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGAFSA, Tunisia \u2014 Tunisians often say the first uprising of the Arab Spring began not in 2010 after the self-immolation of a fruit vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, but in 2008, when protests over corrupt hiring practices at the mines of Gafsa ran on for six months. It is a measure of the lingering challenges of Tunisia\u2019s revolution that people here are still in revolt.In the towns of Moulares and Redeyef, protests have idled the phosphate mines \u2014 a cornerstone of the economy \u2014 for much of the last three years. Citizens regularly block roads and burn tires. Police and government officials are barely tolerated.\u201cWe will never stop this strike until we get a job,\u201d said Bashir Mabrouki, 28, in a group of young people who huddled around a brazier while guarding a barricade of rocks and scrap metal that blocked shipments last month. \u201cWe are being played by the government and their fake promises.\u201dThe complaints are an enduring refrain even since the overthrow of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. They point to what many here see as the unfinished business of their revolution, and a problem endemic across North Africa: the failure to meet the aspirations of a youthful population.The joblessness and aimlessness of young people remain a deep well of volatility, whether or not countries took part in the Arab Spring. Youth unemployment in neighboring Algeria is at 21 percent, according to World Bank data. In Egypt it is 25 percent, and in Morocco, 18 percent.Here in Tunisia, where more than 30 percent of young people cannot find work, the Gafsa mines are in many ways emblematic of the challenges that governments face.Jobs here have been declining since a shift to open-pit mining in the 1970s. Wary of unrest, successive governments have put the state\u2019s shoulder behind creating 15,000 jobs in the phosphate mines and attached environment, forestry and transport enterprises.While International Monetary Fund economists criticized the efforts for expanding the public sector, the state is still failing to create nearly enough opportunities for the unemployed. Some 30,000 people applied in the last round of job openings at Gafsa for just 2,700 jobs, said Kamel Ben Naceur, minister of industry, energy and mines.Each round of hiring incites a bout of new unrest from those not selected. \u201cThis is a conservative society, and youngsters do not listen to their elders anymore, and they react because they have reached complete despair,\u201d said Najib Mabrouki, 51, a representative of the local labor union.The same complaints that compelled the revolt against the dictatorship \u2014 of poverty and pollution, a lack of basic services like electricity and clean water, and corruption in parceling out coveted jobs \u2014 continue to animate the protests against Tunisia\u2019s new technocratic government, which took over in January.In Moulares, wagons filled with mounds of gray silt stand abandoned amid weeds on train tracks, and the factory siren blares over an empty washing plant. Workers and their families have forsaken their bonuses to join the protests of the unemployed.\u201cThere is no social justice,\u201d said Mohammad Nasir Saidi, who lives near the blockaded train tracks. He lost his job when the foreign mining company he worked for closed because of the unrest, yet he directs his anger at the government. \u201cThey are stealing our natural resources, and they are not helping us. They do not care about the people.\u201dA small crowd of men in their 20s and 30s gathered around him. All said they were jobless.\u201cThe revolution started here in 2008 in Moulares and Redeyef, and we are still living the revolution, protesting and chanting slogans,\u201d said one of the men, Hatem Behmida.Tunisia has already seen firsthand the dangers of such disaffection. During the protest here in 2008, the government under Mr. Ben Ali reacted with harsh repression, detentions and torture: Three people died in the clashes, dozens more were injured, and the protest leaders were given heavy prison sentences.Mohamed N\u00e9jib Mrabet, a mining engineer, said, \u201c2008 was revelatory as to the social discontent of the whole population.\u201d Mr. Mrabet last year became chairman of the mostly state-owned Gafsa Phosphate Company, which \u2014 together with a sister chemical company \u2014 directly or indirectly employs about 27,000 people.\u201cIt was very violent, the revolution,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThey had practically been slaves since the French colonial period. It was revenge for everything.\u201dTwo years later, during the Arab Spring revolt, the people here again took to the streets and chased the police and officials from their towns. But the overthrow of Mr. Ben Ali, they say, has changed little, including the strikes and blockades that threaten to cripple the phosphate mines \u2014 and Tunisia\u2019s struggling economy along with it.Once a market leader, Tunisia has seen phosphate production slump to a third of pre-revolution volumes, and business has shifted to regional competitors. The loss of revenue has amounted to three billion Tunisian dinars, or nearly $2 billion, said Mr. Naceur, the mining minister.Even as the protests undercut the company\u2019s performance, leaders of the revolt complain that the government has been too immersed in politics and has ignored the people\u2019s needs.\u201cThe revolution lost its way,\u201d said Tarek Halimi, 49, one of the leaders of the 2008 protest movement in Redeyef. \u201cAnd it is not yet on the right path because the demands were mainly social and economic.\u201dHe criticized the government job programs as meaningless tinkering in the face of deteriorating health and living standards. \u201cWith billions of dollars you get 10 or 20 trees and an amateur soccer team starting? It is not serious,\u201d he said.Families live in homes made of concrete breeze blocks beneath yellow slag heaps. A sulfurous drain from the washing plant overflows down the main street, the liquid pooling in front of the primary school gates. Residents said that they had been complaining about the overflow since 2008, but that nothing had been done about it.In the fall of 2012, frustrations turned violent, and a mob burned the phosphate company\u2019s administration building in Moulares.\u201cIt is people who spent four years waiting, and all they have is hope,\u201d Hassen Mabrouki, 38, explained as he walked through the gutted building. He won a job in one of the hiring rounds, but joins the peaceful protests in solidarity. \u201cThey got promises that have never been fulfilled, and they cannot understand what is happening,\u201d he said.In a cafe across the road, Anwar Leki, 24, wipes tables with pent-up anger. The son of an invalided miner, he has 12 brothers, some of them graduates, but none of them secured a job in three rounds of hiring.\u201cWe have this phosphate powder everywhere. It comes into the house,\u201d he said. \u201cI earn six dinars ($3.75) a day. I finished high school but could not afford to go to university. You see all this and you have pain in your heart and you cannot even express yourself.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Missouri Republicans Hand Defeat to Governor Once Called \u2018Purplish\u2019", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2014 Last September, Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, pulled off a political long shot: He lobbied so successfully against a tax-cut bill championed by the Republican-controlled Legislature that the lawmakers were unable to override his veto. This week, the Republicans struck back. Banding together with unusual vigor in the final days of their legislative session, the Missouri Republicans overrode Governor Nixon\u2019s veto of a new tax bill and passed a $620 million income tax cut, the first for the state in close to 90 years. The move came only weeks after some Republicans in the House flirted with an effort to impeach Governor Nixon, conducting hearings of the House Judiciary Committee to discuss resolutions brought by three legislators. One lawmaker said the governor was guilty of misconduct for allowing same-sex couples to file joint tax returns; another said he took too long to hold special elections to fill legislative vacancies. (Sensing they may have taken it too far, the Republicans decided not to bring the charges to a vote on the House floor.)The unusually deep political animus has turned this state into a scene of extraordinary division, a rarity in the Midwest, where a single party controls both the Legislature and governor\u2019s office in states like Kansas, Illinois and Wisconsin. Will Kraus, the bill\u2019s sponsor in the Senate, promised that it would \u201csafeguard Missouri taxpayers\u201d and protect core funding. Republicans pushed through the override \u2014 with the help of one Democrat in the House \u2014 with a five-page bill that was more concise than last year\u2019s version. The legislation will reduce the top individual income tax rate to 5.5 percent, from 6 percent, starting in 2017, provided state revenue is growing. It also provides a 25 percent deduction for business income reported on personal tax returns. After the override vote, Governor Nixon, who has warned that the tax cut would hurt efforts to pay for education and downgrade the state\u2019s credit rating, issued a terse statement calling the legislation \u201ca very real threat to the principles of fiscal discipline that have helped us maintain our spotless AAA rating for decades.\u201d Moody\u2019s downgraded Kansas\u2019 credit rating last week, citing its recent tax cuts, pension liabilities and spending on schools. In an interview in his wood-paneled office decorated with a large portrait of Mark Twain, Governor Nixon said he had been prepared for defeat on the tax-cut bill in the waning days of the session. He struggled to come up with another time that his relations with the Legislature had become so unfriendly. \u201cPeople tend to posse up in the last two weeks,\u201d he said with a half-smile. \u201cIt feels pretty partisan.\u201d But he was also coyly dismissive of the Legislature, whose members are limited from staying in office more than eight years in either chamber, and its perceived political power. \u201cThis is very much a part-time Legislature,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come and they speak and they pass laws and they say things. They are one part of the fabric. We\u2019re still capable of getting solid progress done.\u201d Governor Nixon, Missouri\u2019s longest-serving attorney general, was elected in 2008 in the mold of a quintessential Midwestern governor who hewed so closely to the center that it was possible to sustain popularity among both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cHe fit that purplish-red state kind of mold,\u201d said Aaron Willard, the treasurer of the Grow Missouri Coalition, a collection of business groups that supported the tax bill. \u201cPeople thought, he\u2019s a Democrat but he\u2019s fiscally conservative. He took conservative positions on social issues. People responded well to that.\u201d Now 58, he is prevented by law from seeking re-election again, and his term is up in January 2017. Some politicians in Missouri have suggested that Governor Nixon is spending his last term moving further to the left, attempting a Medicaid expansion, voicing support for same-sex marriage and opposing deep tax cuts. \u201cIn the past, he\u2019s always portrayed himself as a moderate,\u201d said George Connor, the head of the political science department at Missouri State University. \u201cNow, since he\u2019s been re-elected, he\u2019s been more liberal, thundering away about issues, using a tone that\u2019s more strident and more ideological. He\u2019s been acting more like a Democrat.\u201dDemocrats have suggested that it is the Republicans who have moved to the right and are using tax cuts as a ploy to generate enthusiasm among constituents, despite the risk of destabilizing the economy. All 159 current members of the House are up for re-election this fall. \u201cWhen a law professor looks at the bill and says there are errors, and they say, \u2018Do it anyway,\u2019 well ...\u201d Governor Nixon said, his voice trailing off. \u201cThe bottom line is, I\u2019ve had agreements and disagreements, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll give up on my values. My job is to lay out the clear path for where we want to go.\u201d Yet the governor may face an emboldened Republican opposition, making it more difficult to focus on his legacy with more than two years remaining in his final term. Some Missourians have been speculating about his future beyond the governor\u2019s office, looking for signs that he has aspirations on the national stage.\u201cThe big question is, what, if any, plans does he have?\u201d said Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri. \u201cIt could be that he\u2019s going to go into the private sector and help himself financially. But if he wants to play some role in Washington, he has probably made some steps in the last year or two that have made that more possible.\u201d Indicating his support for same-sex marriage, Mr. Squire said, \u201ccould be a signal to national Democrats that he\u2019s comfortable with the direction the party is going.\u201d Governor Nixon did not dismiss the suggestion that he could leave Missouri after his term is up. \u201cI\u2019m trying to live my life so that if there are opportunities in the future,\u201d he said carefully, \u201cI\u2019ve lived my life in a way that people respect it.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "New York Fed President Sees Inflation Drifting Up", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam Dudley, the president of the New York Federal Reserve, said on Tuesday he expected inflation to drift higher over the remainder of the year, though \u201cexcess capacity\u201d in the economy is helping to moderate price pressures. Mr. Dudley\u2019s remarks come as the Fed grapples with several major issues, including when to raise interest rates, and when to start scaling back its more than $4 trillion balance sheet.After more than five years of highly accommodative monetary policy, including near zero interest rates and bond purchases, the Fed is facing pressure from policy hawks to tighten and raise rates more quickly. Mr. Dudley has tended to join the Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, in a more dovish stance. That was reflected in his remarks on Tuesday at a lunch hosted by the New York Association for Business Economics.Speaking at an event in New York, Mr. Dudley said that while headwinds are growing less severe, the trajectory of economic growth continues to disappoint. He also made a point to say that inflation is rising but not sharply, and that the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target is not a ceiling.\u201cI would expect that we would spend as much time slightly above 2 percent as below it, recognizing that we will hardly ever be exactly at 2 percent because of the inherent volatility in prices,\u201d he said.In 2011, the Fed outlined its so-called exit strategy in which halting reinvestments was the first step to shrinking its balance sheet, which now tops $4 trillion, down to around $1 trillion. If the Fed sticks to plan, a decision to stop reinvesting bond proceeds from Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities would precede any increase in interest rates and mark the beginning of the Fed\u2019s first tightening cycle since 2004-2006.Mr. Dudley on Tuesday said he supported the view that the Fed should delay ending its balance sheet reinvestments until after the central bank raises rates. He said that some economists had argued that the amount of slack in the labor market may be smaller than suggested by the official unemployment rate. Mr. Dudley took issue with this notion, a view held by Yellen.He said that in his view some of the factors holding down inflation \u201cwere one-offs and are now dropping out of the year-over-year figures.\u201d He added, \u201cIn some other areas, such as owners\u2019 equivalent rent, price pressures look likely to firm somewhat.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But it is equally clear whom its current owners would like to land there: Chinese property buyers.If all goes according to plan, Koh Pich \u2014 Diamond Island in English \u2014 a 100-hectare, or about 250-acre, spit of land hugging downtown Phnom Penh\u2019s shoreline, will be home to more than 1,000 condominiums, hundreds of villas, two international schools, a replica of the Arc de Triomphe, a near-clone of Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay Sands Hotel and one of the world\u2019s tallest buildings.But in a city with a history of stalled real estate projects, the future of the island, in the Mekong River, is far from certain.Phnom Penh, Cambodia\u2019s capital, is coming into its own as a regional business destination, and investment in its property market totaled $1.9 billion in the first half of 2013, compared with $1.2 billion in 2011, according to Leng Vandy, senior associate at the financial services company SBI Royal Securities. Even as mainland Chinese property investors have pushed prices up in Hong Kong, London and Vancouver, they are also injecting piles of cash into smaller cities, including Yangon, Myanmar; Chiang Mai, Thailand; and Vientiane, Laos.Phnom Penh, a city of nearly two million, is no different.\u201cMainland Chinese, especially Shanghainese, are very impressive,\u201d said Um Bun An, sales manager at Casa Meridian, a development that, when completed in 2017, will feature two 33-story condominium towers. \u201cThey don\u2019t need loans. They make their purchases in cash.\u201dWith street signs featuring the simplified Chinese characters used on China\u2019s mainland (elsewhere in Phnom Penh street signs are in Khmer and English only) and sales executives fluent in Mandarin, Diamond Island seems ripe for Chinese investment.Eight years ago, the entire island was handed over to the local conglomerate, the Overseas Cambodia Investment Corporation, which in Mandarin calls itself the Cambodia Overseas Chinese-Cambodian Investment Corporation. Phnom Penh\u2019s municipal spokesman, Long Dimanche, declined to disclose terms of the deal; there is no public information available about the corporation. The island\u2019s previous residents, small-scale farmers, were either bought out or evicted.Touch Samnang, the corporation\u2019s deputy chief executive, also declined to discuss terms of the deal. The group has sold several plots on the island to developers for projects, including Casa Meridian, the gated villa development Elite Town, the pedestrian mall La Seine and The \u00c9lys\u00e9e, a proposed mixed-use project that is to include a replica of the Arc de Triomphe.After Cambodia passed a law in 2010 allowing foreigners to buy condominiums in towers above the first floor of approved buildings, developers in Phnom Penh have begun catering to growing foreign demand. A report in March by the Phnom Penh office of the property consultancy CBRE noted that 20 condominium projects had been completed or were under construction in the city.The island\u2019s largest such project is the $700 million Diamond Island Riviera: three 33-story condominium towers supporting a 650-foot infinity-edge pool, a shopping mall, hospital, an international school, two pedestrian shopping streets \u2014 plus two additional 29-story condominium towers. In a nod to Chinese superstition, which considers the number four unlucky, the buildings will not have 4th, 14th, 24th or 34th floors.Diamond Island Riviera is a joint venture between O.C.I.C. and the Chinese company Jixiang Investment on a prime plot with the island\u2019s best river view. Mr. Touch said O.C.I.C. sold the land for \u201cclose to $100 million.\u201dA local subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation China\u2019s largest nonrailway construction contractor, which had more than $81 billion in revenue in 2012, is building the 900-condo development. The Vietnam-based Sino-Pacific Construction, a 100 percent foreign-invested consultancy with upper management from China and Taiwan, is in charge of the project\u2019s structural design. The Chinese company Guangzhou Sunho Decoration is responsible for interior design, and A-Seven of Thailand is handling architectural design.Yao Jiguo, the construction company\u2019s project manager for Diamond Island Riviera, said it had plans for additional projects.\u201cWe want to establish the mainland brand here, the China Construction brand,\u201d Mr. Yao said.Mr. Yao estimated that the Riviera project\u2019s first two condo towers would be finished in 2016.Chinese buyers account for roughly half of sales at Diamond Island Riviera, according to Brak Kim Seng, senior sales officer at the O.C.I.C. subsidiary Canadia Bank.\u201cThe majority of Chinese buyers are buying as an investment,\u201d Mr. Brak said in Mandarin. \u201cThey\u2019ll hold on, and when prices rise, they\u2019ll sell off.\u201dSales for the project\u2019s A and B towers, which contain smaller and less-pricey units, and Tower D, with larger, more expensive units, began in 2013. As of April, Canadia Bank had sold 20 percent of the units in Tower A, 50 percent to 60 percent of Tower B and 15 percent of Tower D, Mr. Brak said. Prices per square foot, which had been about $185 earlier this year, now range from $149 to $167 per square foot.Diamond Island is unlikely to become the Chinatown that the Phnom Penh government has long hoped would attract more mainland tourists. Despite the Chinese money flowing into the island\u2019s projects, Chinese tourists and residents are not a common sight in that part of the city.Aside from construction workers, most people on Diamond Island seem to be young Cambodians from elsewhere in the city, who cruise the island\u2019s wide, uncongested streets on motorcycles and socialize wherever they decide to put their kickstands down.\u201cHere there are good views of the rivers, and good people-watching too,\u201d Kat Khemara, 23, said as he sat on a bench with his girlfriend.Some nonresidential projects on Diamond Island have already been completed, including a driving range for golfers, a fire station and an events center replete with columns and fountains that is popular for wedding photos and banquets. An international exhibition center and the Koh Pich Theatre frequently are host to Chinese trade and cultural events.Much remains to be built. Land is being reclaimed at the island\u2019s north end for Phnom Penh\u2019s most ambitious project, a mixed-use tower topping out at 1,820 feet. If built, it would be one of the world\u2019s tallest structures. Mr. Touch said the tower was still in the design stage, and that the land would need to settle for one or two years after reclamation work was finished.Limited demand from Cambodia\u2019s relatively small wealthy class and a heavy reliance on foreign investment has some observers questioning the viability of the projects.Mr. Leng said he saw residential supply outstripping demand in Phnom Penh in coming years, although he believes growing demand from high-net-worth Cambodians and expats as well as the upcoming integration under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, scheduled for the end of 2015, will narrow the gap.Mr. Leng noted that the La Seine pedestrian mall will face stiff competition from the soon-to-open Aeon Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in Cambodia, which is just across a bridge. He cautioned that Diamond Island Riviera was vulnerable to downturns in Chinese investment \u2014 a possibility given the current liquidity crunch on the mainland. In Hong Kong, China\u2019s efforts to wean the mainland economy off cheap money contributed to a sell-off of luxury properties in the first quarter of this year, with some owners cutting 20 percent off the purchase price.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "China Isn\u2019t Overtaking America", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorNEW YORK \u2014 A report last month that China\u2019s economy will soon become the world\u2019s largest has sparked worries. Normally calm observers are taking the news as a sign that China is overtaking America as an economic power.But much as counting warships or troops often provides a misleading measure of military might, tallying up gross domestic product \u2014 the figure behind the latest headlines \u2014 yields a warped picture of China\u2019s economic rise. By most meaningful yardsticks, China is still less economically powerful than the United States. The problem with the new numbers starts with how they compare economies\u2019 sizes. The World Bank tables that show China passing the United States compare the two countries using \u201cpurchasing power parity,\u201d which measures national incomes in terms of what they can buy at home. Because domestic spending is dominated by items such as food and housing that aren\u2019t traded internationally, and because most goods and services are cheaper in China than in the United States, this comparison boosts China\u2019s apparent economic strength. Yet compared using market exchange rates, which measure incomes in terms of what they can buy on international markets (where every country pays the same price), the United States\u2019 economy remains nearly twice as big as China\u2019s. Indeed it is this latter measure that matters most when comparing economic power. After all, one would never compare two countries\u2019 military strengths on the basis of how well each could suppress a domestic rebellion rather than fight a foreign war, and one should not compare countries\u2019 economic power on the basis of what a worker in each country can buy at home. When American and Chinese companies bid against each other to acquire resources or companies abroad, what matters is their wealth as measured by the global market. Oil suppliers, for example, don\u2019t care if the $100 they get for a barrel sold to China can buy more rice in a Beijing market than at a shop in New York \u2014 they care about what their revenues are worth in the world market. Similarly, the attractiveness of the Chinese and American markets to foreign firms depends on the profits to be made in international terms, not as measured by purchasing power. The alarmism about China surpassing America also ignores the critical role of political and institutional strength and flexibility. One wouldn\u2019t compare countries\u2019 arsenals while ignoring their different states of disrepair \u2014 yet Chinese G.D.P. numbers ignore severe pollution problems that are driving successful Chinese abroad. Nor would one compare numbers of aircraft or troops without asking about the training, doctrine and organization necessary to mobilize them effectively in combat. China faces real challenges translating its economic resources into international influence. The need to maintain political stability and the Communist Party\u2019s grip on power constrains what the Chinese government can do to capitalize on the country\u2019s economic heft. The difficulty of getting recalcitrant provincial and local governments to enforce Beijing\u2019s edicts can make it tough for China to take full advantage of its economic power. The Chinese government, for example, has tried to forge packages of infrastructure and resource investment in strategically attractive developing countries, only to have the Chinese companies that would need to implement the schemes refuse to participate. Certainly, China has its advantages. There are some things that matter for international power \u2014 notably military personnel \u2014 that can be paid for domestically, making lower Chinese prices (and wages) a meaningful advantage. The American market may be larger than China\u2019s, but China\u2019s is growing more rapidly, often creating more new opportunities for international firms. And Washington faces political and institutional constraints just like Beijing does. America\u2019s economy can\u2019t compete with a state-dominated behemoth when it comes to rewarding favored partners with economic opportunities. And the United States is less able to direct its outward commerce toward political ends than China is: Beijing is more capable, for example, of persuading Sinopec to pursue geopolitically attractive investments than Washington is of mobilizing ExxonMobil.Twenty-first century rivalry between the United States and China will be as much about economic might as military power. Judging the economic balance correctly will be as essential a foundation for effective international strategy as proper assessment of the military balance was during the Cold War. Avoiding overreaction in the face of the latest headlines about China\u2019s economic triumph would be a great place to start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yellen Won\u2019t Be Pinned Down on Plans", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, told Congress on Wednesday that the economy was growing at a decent rate and that the Fed intended to continue the stimulus campaign that it considered at least partly responsible.Central bankers are paid to worry, and Ms. Yellen also delivered a laundry list of things that could go wrong: The housing recovery has stalled, geopolitical tensions are rising, some asset prices are perhaps a little too high.But the overall tenor of her testimony was upbeat. The economy, she said, is shaking off a grim winter. The labor market is slowly improving.\u201cWith the harsh winter behind us, many recent indicators suggest that a rebound in spending and production is already underway, putting the overall economy on track for solid growth in the current quarter,\u201d Ms. Yellen told the Joint Economic Committee. She will testify before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday.The Fed is steadily cutting its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, now at $45 billion a month, and Ms. Yellen affirmed that it planned to end those purchases in the fall. The bank must then decide when to start raising short-term interest rates, which it has held near zero since December 2008.But Ms. Yellen, who suggested at a March news conference that the Fed might start raising rates about six months after it ended bond purchases, carefully avoided affirming those comments on Wednesday. Investors generally expect the Fed to start raising rates around the middle of 2015. Ms. Yellen said only that the timing would be determined by the progress of the economic recovery.And she made clear that even after the Fed began raising borrowing costs, the central bank did not plan to return interest rates to normal levels, which she defined as around 4 percent, until it was sure the recovery was complete.The hearing reflected the complexity of partisan divisions over the economy. Democrats generally praised the progress of the recovery while pressing for new actions to address unemployment and inequality. Republicans, conversely, highlighted the weakness of recent growth while pressing for the Fed to curtail its efforts and questioning whether the Fed was flirting with inflation.Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the committee, said the Fed\u2019s enormous stimulus campaign could lead to higher inflation, particularly if the central bank did not pull back quickly as the economy recovered.He pressed Ms. Yellen repeatedly to set a timetable for raising interest rates.\u201cWhen do you expect that to begin?\u201d he asked.Ms. Yellen responded that the Fed would choose its moment based on the progress of the labor market and the movement of inflation.Mr. Brady decided to try a new approach. \u201cIf I were to say you\u2019ll begin normalizing interest rates in 2015,\u201d he asked, \u201cwould I be wrong?\u201dThe Fed has \u201cno mechanical formula or timetable,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.Mr. Brady: \u201cIf I were to say this will begin normalizing in 2016, would I be wrong?\u201dMs. Yellen: \u201cThere is no specific timeline for doing that.\u201dMr. Brady tried one more line of questioning, asking when rates would reach 2 percent \u2014 about half the historically normal level \u2014 then closed with a parting shot. \u201cIt strikes me, over time, this \u2018don\u2019t worry be happy\u2019 monetary message isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we need more specifics and a clear timetable on the comprehensive exit strategy.\u201dThe exchange typified the caution that Ms. Yellen has demonstrated in her first few appearances before Congress. Where her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, sometimes sought to educate his interlocutors, and the broader audience attending to the hearings, Ms. Yellen mostly has tried to avoid surprises.Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, labeled Ms. Yellen, who grew up in Bay Ridge, a \u201cBrooklyn Dodger\u201d in a note emailed to clients after the hearing. \u201cYellen successfully dodged any attempts to attach more specific guidance on the timing of the first rate hike,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe did not say anything that sent a novel signal about the Fed\u2019s reading of the economy or the outlook for policy.\u201dMs. Yellen, in a similar exchange with Representative Richard Hanna, a New York Republican, strongly defended the Fed\u2019s commitment to control inflation. She said the high inflation of the 1970s had been a formative experience for the entirety of the Fed\u2019s leadership, and they were determined to keep inflation below the 2 percent annual pace the Fed has described as its target.\u201cI do believe that we have the tools and absolutely the will and the determination to remove monetary accommodation at an appropriate time to avoid overshooting our inflation objective,\u201d Ms. Yellen said. \u201cThe lessons from that period are very real for all of us and none of us want to make that mistake again.\u201dInflation, however, is not the Fed\u2019s primary worry. Prices rose just 1.1 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and Ms. Yellen emphasized that the Fed was focused on the labor market. While the unemployment rate has declined, she noted that other measures continued to reflect that many people could not find full-time work.The government estimated last week that the economy grew at an annual pace of just 0.1 percent in the first quarter of 2014, and some economists expect the government will eventually conclude that the economy actually shrank.Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that growth had \u201cpaused\u201d during the winter months, but she said the Fed already saw evidence that activity was rebounding as the weather turned warmer. \u201cRecent data is certainly much more encouraging on a wide range of fronts from car sales, retail sales, industrial production,\u201d she said.She added a new note of caution, however, saying the housing recovery had stalled. \u201cThe recent flattening out in housing activity could prove more protracted than currently expected rather than resuming its earlier pace of recovery,\u201d she said.Ms. Yellen also devoted a considerable section of her prepared remarks to the risk that the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign would destabilize financial markets. She said that the Fed was watching closely for signs of excessive speculation, and that \u201csome reach-for-yield behavior may be evident.\u201d But she said such signs were limited to small pockets of the markets, and the Fed did not see broad reasons for concern.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lew Urges China to Ease Exchange Rate Controls", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew pushed China on Tuesday to let market forces decide its exchange rate, and pressed senior officials here not to undercut the Obama administration\u2019s sanctions on Russia.On his third trip to China since becoming Treasury secretary, Mr. Lew carried a familiar agenda: greater market access for foreign investors, less government control of exchange rate policy and concern about the overall health of the Chinese economy.The Obama administration warned China last month that the renminbi was too weak, and American lawmakers have threatened to designate China a currency manipulator if the government does not loosen its hold on the currency.The renminbi has fallen about 3 percent this year. Analysts say China\u2019s central bank is intervening in the currency markets to engineer a slide in the value of the currency. That would punish speculators and prevent big capital flows from the entering the country.In March, the People\u2019s Bank of China widened the daily trading band of the currency, increasing the amount the currency is allowed to rise or fall each day.\u201cIt is important that China demonstrate a renewed commitment to move to a more market-dominated exchange rate, which will help provide for more balanced domestic growth, and global trade, while also moving to a more transparent exchange rate policy,\u201d Mr. Lew said in remarks to Wang Yang, the Chinese vice premier.In the long term, China says it plans to let the renminbi trade freely but American officials acknowledge that this is unlikely to happen in the near future. Still, the United States must keep pressing the case for the government to loosen its grip on the currency, American officials say. Among other things, the government control of the currency allows Chinese goods to sell cheaply in the United States, and crowd out American manufacturers.\u201cWe discussed, as we do with many nations, the impact our sanctions are having and the importance that they are not offset by others\u2019 coming in,\u201d Mr. Lew told reporters after his day of meetings.The Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin, is scheduled to visit China next week and is expected to meet President Xi Jinping. There is speculation that the two leaders will sign an energy deal, or inspect joint military exercises involving the Russian and Chinese navies.Either one would be a signal of common cause between Russia and China at a time when the Obama administration is pressing sanctions on Moscow.Advertisement"}

Amoruso\u2019s voice is accessible and charmingly self-deprecating without losing the effortless cool that characterizes her clothes, and her book is a D.I.Y. success manual written for women who were more prone to be voted \u201cMost Unique\u201d than \u201cMost Likely to Succeed.\u201dThe book isn\u2019t without its head-\u00adscratching moments. Some of Amoruso\u2019s advice is relevant to contemporary upstarts, but other aspects of her story \u2014 how she transformed an eBay store into a devoted Myspace following and then a web-retailing pioneer \u2014 reads more like a time capsule from the early social media age than a career blueprint for today\u2019s fledgling businesswoman. Amoruso was a social media expert before the term became LinkedIn filler for \u201cunemployed millennial communications major\u201d; the ground she broke has already been plowed and replanted several times over. Further, her habit of branding her book via the excessive use of \u201c#girlboss\u201d in the text is distracting; an unclickable hashtag makes about as much sense as a scratch \u2019n\u2019 sniff radio commercial.Ultimately, though, Amoruso\u2019s scrappy capitalist narrative makes an admirable attempt to prove that navigating the system isn\u2019t the same as endorsing it. Being anti-\u00adestablishment is the old cool. The new cool is playing by your own rules and still winning by their standards.In their new book, the business consultants Annis and Merron explain the importance of a corporate modus operandi they\u2019ve branded \u201cgender intelligence.\u201d They argue that sensibly and proactively incorporating women into all aspects of a company\u2019s operations isn\u2019t just the right thing to do; it\u2019s the only way for a business to survive in the modern economy.While Annis and Merron\u2019s conclusion might arouse feminist cheers, the way \u201cGender Intelligence\u201d leads its readers there may cause reflexive sighs. The authors claim that women have trouble advancing in the business world not because they\u2019re failing to lean in, but because the businesses of 2014 are inherently male systems \u2014 ones that were designed by male brains, inimitable masculine machines that are structurally different from female brains.Employers, they argue, can best exploit these immutable biological differences by integrating the workplace in a way that respects women\u2019s and men\u2019s strengths, without quotas or retention programs, which they call condescending and ineffective. And from a dusty premise and text that occasionally reads like a late-night infomercial for consulting services emerges a revolutionary verdict: In order to move forward, every business must change, or bow out of the way for its gender intelligent superior. Integrate or perish.In \u201cThe Confidence Code,\u201d Kay and Shipman train a gimlet eye on an unspoken problem among women at all levels of achievement \u2014 nagging self-doubt. Jay-Z would prescribe swagger. Kay and Shipman prescribe confidence.The pair embark on an engrossing trek through interviews with an array of successful women and seek the counsel of behavioral experts. We journey into rat brains, DNA tests, Christine Lagarde\u2019s daily schedule and even her purse. We are invited to contemplate Title IX legislation and its effect on young women\u2019s prospects to lead and to win. We become privy to the formidable journalism careers of Kay and Shipman, including their own moments of wavering confidence.Throughout their exploration of the anatomy of a winning attitude, the authors never quite put their fingers on what, exactly, women need to do to unlock the code, or whether it\u2019s even worth unlocking. Women should be more like men in their willingness to take risks \u2014 but not so much that they cause a global financial meltdown. Women should believe in their own abilities \u2014 but not so much that it prevents them from seeing how they might improve. While Kay and Shipman\u2019s encouraging words on breaking negative thought patterns are helpful, I felt more reassured by their many examples of successful women who have struggled to do just that. If occasional bouts of self-doubt are good enough for Lagarde, the first woman to lead the International Monetary Fund, they\u2019re probably good enough for the rest of us.\u201cMistakes I Made at Work\u201d is a collection of 25 easy-to-digest reminiscences from 25 easy-to-idolize women. \u201cMistakes\u201d shies away from You Go, Girl-isms that have become dull from overuse, presenting instead an unvarnished and candid view of how failures that seemed catastrophic at the time have served as powerful teachers to women who bounced back, and then some.Each essay is introduced with a description of its author\u2019s professional achievements, followed by a firsthand account of a moment when the aforementioned superwoman failed to be super. The effect is occasionally (and no doubt deliberately) jarring, but the collection\u2019s overall message is consistent: Just as there are many ways to succeed, there are many ways to falter.Erin Gloria Ryan is the news editor of the website Jezebel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rhode Island, a State Sized Just Right to Contain Its Pride", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 A lot of people here say that Rhode Island suffers from being the smallest state in the country. Jimmy Saccoccio, manager of the Olneyville New York System, a popular diner, agrees.\u201cThey say in Rhode Island, if you\u2019re going to cheat on your husband or your wife, go out of state because Rhode Island is too small,\u201d he said with a laugh.Poor Little Rhody. Not only is it the smallest state, it is often a punch line. And in many state rankings, it comes out on top for the wrong things, like having the nation\u2019s highest rate of unemployment. These levels of dissatisfaction stood in sharp contrast to the satisfaction of residents in several states out West. Tied at the top were Montana and Alaska, where 77 percent of residents thought highly of their state.Most of the top 10 states feature wide-open spaces and small populations; Rhode Island, by contrast, is one of the most densely packed. But that is cold comfort to Rhode Island, since two other small New England states \u2014 New Hampshire and Vermont \u2014 made the top 10.So what ails Rhode Island?Many people interviewed here on a recent soggy day pinned the blame on the state\u2019s struggling economy. Manufacturing declined after the textile industry moved South, and the jewelry industry has been outstripped by foreign competitors. And the state has been slow to rebound from the recession.\u201cThey can\u2019t get jobs,\u201d said Mario Forte, 85, who is long retired from the jewelry business. He was standing out of the rain in a storefront on Atwells Avenue in Federal Hill, Providence\u2019s Italian neighborhood, which bustles with restaurants. \u201cYou give a man a job, he\u2019s happy,\u201d Mr. Forte said.And just as often, people pointed to Rhode Island\u2019s reputation for corruption.\u201cThe government is corrupt, and the poverty rate is high,\u201d said Gary Balletto, 38, a former professional boxer who was eating lunch at Venda Ravioli.Nonetheless, the perception persists that Rhode Island, measuring just 48 miles from north to south and 37 from east to west, is overstuffed with miscreants and reprobates.\u201cEven in good times, Rhode Island has had a little bit of an inferiority complex, caused in part by being the smallest state and by having a history of political corruption,\u201d said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island.In an interview, Mr. Cianci, 73, now a popular radio host and a potential candidate for mayor again this year, blew off the notion that Rhode Islanders were discouraged by the pervasive aura of corruption. \u201cCorruption is everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cornered the market.\u201dHe attributed their dissatisfaction instead to high taxes, leaders who are \u201cbean counters\u201d instead of \u201crisk-takers\u201d and the state\u2019s size, which makes everyone\u2019s activities more noticeable.\u201cHere, everybody knows what\u2019s going on, and every little nitty-gritty thing they do is under a microscope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could drop an atomic bomb on parts of Texas and no one would know.\u201dRhode Island is heavily Democratic, heavily Roman Catholic and heavily unionized. Some say the state is beholden to its unions, as evinced by its generous pension system. But the high cost of government, said Robert D. Atkinson, the former executive director of the defunct Rhode Island Economic Policy Council, is not matched by a high quality of services.\u201cRhode Island has the high-cost structure of Minnesota but the low-quality services of Mississippi,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. For some politicians, the Gallup results are a call to arms; the governor\u2019s race this year is shaping up in part as a contest over who can best pull the state out of its funk.\u201cLifting the self-esteem of the state is absolutely something I need to address as governor,\u201d said Mayor Angel Taveras of Providence, a Democrat running for governor.Gina M. Raimondo, the state treasurer and also a Democrat running for governor, takes a white board to campaign events and asks voters to list why they believe in Rhode Island. It is her way of getting them to think about the state\u2019s positive attributes.\u201cThe malaise is driven by the economy and the lack of jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cRhode Island needs a leader who has optimism for the future and who knows and believes we can be better.\u201dDespite the complaints, many of those interviewed said they liked living here and would never move. They love the easy access to the ocean. They are proud of Newport, an old-world moneyed coastal community where Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy were married in 1953.Mr. Cianci, the former mayor, suggested that the 82 percent of residents who told Gallup that Rhode Island was not among the best states should spend a weekend in Newport, eat in a Providence restaurant or visit the Rhode Island School of Design.\u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should go to Pocatello, Idaho, and see what they can do there on a Saturday night.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Clash of Ideals and Investments at Swarthmore", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseKate Aronoff didn\u2019t arrive at Swarthmore College in fall 2010 expecting to be an environmental activist. Nor did she know much about the stock market. She knew even less about asset management and college endowments.That all changed her freshman year, when she and about a dozen Swarthmore students made a field trip to West Virginia to meet Larry Gibson, widely known and celebrated by environmentalists as the \u201cKeeper of the Mountains.\u201d A short walk from his two-room cabin on land his family has owned for generations, the students could see thousands of acres laid bare by mountaintop removal coal mining operations.\u201cThe difference between the majesty of the Appalachian Mountains that hadn\u2019t been ruined and the mountain peaks that were flattened was so stark,\u201d Ms. Aronoff told me this week, as she was studying for finals. \u201cWe saw and heard about how toxic the coal mining industry is and how much of the economy is structured around coal mining. It was a moment when the connection between economic injustice and environmental injustice was just so clear.\u201dStanford joins 11 other colleges that, to varying degrees, have pledged not to invest their endowment resources in fossil fuels. But Stanford\u2019s prestige and the size of its endowment have suddenly thrust the divisive issue of fossil fuel divestment, and what is more generally considered socially responsible investment, onto the agendas of investment committees everywhere.But at Swarthmore, one of the country\u2019s most selective and prestigious colleges, where the student-led divestment movement had its origins, the college\u2019s board members and administrators have listened repeatedly to the student activists \u2014 yet have firmly rebuffed their proposals on the grounds that they could hurt endowment income and are unlikely to have any impact on energy companies.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that Swarthmore, which prides itself on social justice, would be so hesitant when you try to involve the institution itself,\u201d Ms. Aronoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s astounding to us to see the ways they continue to resist and won\u2019t put their money where their mouth is.\u201dCollege officials seem sensitive to the point. \u201cThe students are terrific,\u201d Giles Kemp, the chairman of Swarthmore\u2019s board of managers, told me this week. \u201cThere\u2019s no lack of admiration for their idealism. They want to make a positive difference in the world, which is Swarthmore\u2019s mission. The frustrating thing, the ironic aspect is, the board is as much a believer in the threat to us and our children from climate change as the students are. Where we disagree are the tactics. After much deliberation, the board came to a different point of view.\u201dSwarthmore\u2019s endowment is $1.635 billion, and has generated a one-year return of 11.9 percent, a three-year average annual return of 12.5 percent, and a five-year average annual return of 6.4 percent. All three are better than the average rates of return for all colleges and universities. Much of the income is earmarked for scholarships.While the activist students vow to keep the pressure on Swarthmore, they held a retreat this week to strategize and savor the Stanford decision, \u201cWe\u2019re elated,\u201d said Sara Blazevic, a Swarthmore junior who worked closely with students at Stanford. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how this has taken off. It\u2019s unprecedented how quickly it\u2019s grown. When we started our campaign, it was kind of lonely. By the fall of 2012, there were 20 to 30 campaigns and then last year it really blew up.\u201dStudents say the Swarthmore movement, which goes by the name Mountain Justice, was in part inspired by George Lakey, a visiting professor in peace and conflict studies, who led the trip to West Virginia and whose class examined various case studies in nonviolent activism, including the impact of divestiture on ending apartheid in South Africa. Ms. Blazevic also went to West Virginia.\u201cI was shocked to see the degree of devastation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was troubled and disturbed that my tuition money and alumni donations were being invested in that kind of destruction. It was politicizing.\u201dProfessor Lakey agreed. \u201cThe more these Swarthmore students learned,\u201d he said by email from Iceland, \u201cthe more the students connected the dots and understood that the choice of extreme extraction over switching to sustainable energy is a choice that is simply wrong,\u201d He added, \u201cThey felt gravely disappointed to find that their school, a Swarthmore that insists on its devotion to the future of the students, was in fact committed to a policy that makes the students\u2019 future problematic.\u201dMs. Aronoff, who was in Professor Lakey\u2019s class, said she and other students were intrigued by the possibility of divestment, \u201cbut we weren\u2019t even sure what an endowment is or how it works. We had to take a crash course on investing.\u201d That led them to the Responsible Endowments Coalition and its executive director, Dan Apfel, who worked closely with the group. \u201cHe really helped us get the campaign off the ground after we had the idea,\u201d she said.The group got a lift when 350.org, led by the writer and environmental activist Bill McKibben, took up the cause, and started a cross-country bus tour to promote divestment. As interest spread to other campuses, the Swarthmore students were the hosts of a conference on the campus in spring 2013. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d get maybe six other schools to attend,\u201d Ms. Aronoff said. \u201cWe ended up with over 200 students from 75 schools.\u201d A national student divestment network was forged soon after. But Swarthmore itself didn\u2019t budge, although officials always seemed open to discussion of the issue, and the board agreed to an open meeting with students to discuss it.\u201cAs a college that honors its Quaker roots, we encourage students to engage one another and us in matters related to the college and to the world beyond, and we listen to their points of view as we consider important decisions,\u201d Rebecca Chopp, Swarthmore\u2019s president, said. \u201cSometimes this is difficult, sometimes people do not agree, and sometimes it does not work the first time. But we will always be proud that Swarthmore is a college that supports debate and disagreement.\u201dLast fall, the board issued a formal letter rejecting the group\u2019s demands. \u201cThe managers\u2019 decision not to divest is broad and deep,\u201d Mr. Kemp wrote. \u201cIt is our collective judgment that the cost of divestment would far outweigh any potential benefit.\u201d He wrote that divestment would be costly to the endowment, with a decline in income of an estimated $10 million to $15 million a year, and that it would be a \u201csymbolic\u201d act with little if any impact on energy companies or public officials.Mr. Kemp pointed out that Stanford\u2019s endowment charter explicitly permitted the university to consider social causes in making investment decisions, while Swarthmore\u2019s takes the opposite position. \u201cThere are a lot of worthy causes,\u201d Mr. Kemp said, \u201cbut the question is, Should an endowment be used to advance them? Last year, there was a lot of agitation for companies to support Palestine and stop investing in companies having to do with Israel. Those students were as fervent in their cause as these students are in theirs.\u201d He added: \u201cThe board concluded the way our endowment is set up, we weren\u2019t meant to use for social purposes no matter how noble.\u201dAnd some faculty members have taken issue with elements of the board\u2019s position. \u201cI don\u2019t really support divestment,\u201d said Mark Kuperberg, an economics professor. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will affect company behavior. But I don\u2019t think it will hurt the endowment much, either.\u201dStanford\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t appear to have affected the Swarthmore board\u2019s thinking. \u201cUltimately, after considering many diverse viewpoints, the board made its decision,\u201d Ms. Chopp said. \u201cThe board is simply not willing to accept the significant cuts in scholarships, faculty and curriculum offerings that a significantly lower endowment return would necessitate. We believe that to do so would have no measurable effect on halting climate change and, at the same time, would pose an unacceptable risk to the college\u2019s finances.\u201dDespite their differences, Mr. Kemp acknowledged some pride in the students and what they\u2019ve accomplished. \u201cI may not agree with these students, but I think we can learn from them and admire their dedication and if we disagree, it\u2019s not for lack of respect for their commitment and drive.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Solidarity\u2019s Foil, Dies at 90", "Date": "2014-05-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last Communist leader of Poland, who sent tanks to crush Solidarity\u2019s stirrings for democracy in 1981 and went on to preside over the death of the system that had nurtured him, died on Sunday in Warsaw. He was 90. The cause was complications of a stroke he suffered in early May, officials at the Military Medical Institute in Warsaw said in a statement. He had spent many of his last months at the institute, where he had also been treated for cancer. General Jaruzelski led a government that was deeply unpopular in Poland through most of the 1980s. For decades before that, as a career officer and party official, he dutifully worked to entrench Soviet-directed Communism in Poland, an effort that even Stalin, its instigator, recognized as futile, likening it to \u201cputting a saddle on a cow.\u201dOn Dec. 13, 1981, the dour general with tinted glasses, a weak jaw and a ramrod posture set in motion events that would earn him a villainous place in history. On that night, as most Poles slept, he declared martial law and ordered troops to suppress the powerful Solidarity trade union movement, whose demands for greater freedoms were alarming politburos from East Berlin to Moscow. \u201cOur country is on the edge of the abyss,\u201d he proclaimed at 6 o\u2019clock that Sunday morning in an address to the nation as soldiers fanned out. \u201cStrikes, strike alerts, protests have become standard. Even students are dragged into it. There are more and more examples of terror, threats, mob trials and direct coercion. Crimes, robberies and break-ins are spreading like a wave through the country.\u201d General Jaruzelski (his full name is pronounced VOITS-yekh yaroo-ZELL-skee) complained that his government, which had recognized Solidarity, had shown the movement too much good will, tolerance and patience. He asked, \u201cHow long can one wait for a sobering up?\u201d He did not say, as he would later, that he had been under pressure from the Soviet general secretary, Leonid I. Brezhnev, to curb Solidarity and its threat to the Communist system, or that Gen. Viktor G. Kulikov, the Russian commander of the Warsaw Pact forces, was in Warsaw at that very moment. Three days later, Polish troops fired at strikers occupying the Wujek coal mine shafts in southwestern Poland, killing nine workers. General Jaruzelski was reviled. In Western Europe, thousands turned out to protest. President Ronald Reagan moved to impose international economic sanctions against Poland. For the next seven years, Solidarity remained formally outlawed. The strikes subsided, but the union\u2019s clandestine units generated an underground culture, challenging the Communist party\u2019s monopolies with illicit newspapers, magazines, books and educational courses. By the end of 1983, however, thousands of detainees were released, and many of the most repressive measures were eased. As General Jaruzelski seemed intent on placating at least some Solidarity sympathizers, the Communist hard-liners struck out against him.Late in 1984, members of the secret police killed a popular pro-Solidarity priest, the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko. Much of the country interpreted the crime as a provocation organized by party hard-liners against the liberalizing policies of General Jaruzelski. He rose to the challenge by having the police officers tried in open court, something that had never happened in any Communist country. All four were sentenced to long prison terms, another precedent. The Soviet Union itself was suffering a sustained vacuum of leadership as three leaders \u2014 Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko \u2014 died within a period of 26 months. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in Moscow in 1985 pushing reformist policies, General Jaruzelski was quick to ally himself with him.Mr. Gorbachev clearly found the general, at 62, more congenial than any of the 70- and 80-year-old party leaders in the Eastern bloc, like Nicolae Ceaucescu of Romania, Gustav Husak of Czechoslovakia and Erich Honecker of East Germany. Photographs of Warsaw Pact gatherings of the period show General Jaruzelski and Mr. Gorbachev in animated discussion while the others look on glumly.By 1988, the atmosphere in Poland had changed even more. Opposition political groups, still technically illegal, were flourishing. And more strikes were called in Gdansk. Over the objections of hard-line party figures, General Jaruzelski took the momentous step of opening talks with many of the Solidarity leaders he had once imprisoned. A non-Communist majority formed a government. In August 1989, the Communists held their last Congress. And although General Jaruzelski was elected to the presidency, he refrained from using his considerable powers, deferring to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Solidarity. After serving only a year of his six-year term, the general resigned to open the way for a new and popular presidential election, which was won by the Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.The same general who had crushed Solidarity had permitted Poland to shed Communism relatively bloodlessly, setting a pattern that was soon to be followed by the rest of the Warsaw Pact states. He had sawed off the branch that he had been standing on for so long. Wojciech Witold Jaruzelski was born on July 6, 1923, on a large agricultural estate in eastern Poland near Lublin, where his father was the manager. The conservative, Roman Catholic family was of the old, largely impoverished nobility that identified with Poland\u2019s struggles for independence. Wojciech, an only son, was sent to a prominent boarding school outside Warsaw run by priests. On Sept. 1, 1939, when German forces invaded Poland and World War II began, Wojciech and his family joined hundreds of thousands of others who fled to the east, and found work as farm laborers in Lithuania.That is where they were when Stalin, implementing his part of the deal he had struck with Hitler, took the eastern part of Poland and the Baltic States. Most of the displaced Poles, now seen by Stalin as a potential fifth column, were sent to labor camps and remote settlements in Russia. Mr. Jaruzelski\u2019s official biography had barely any details about his life in Russia, and even in his later years he spoke and wrote sparingly about that period. But his only sister, Teresa, who was 11 when the war began, recalled in a private memoir cited by several Polish writers that their father had been sent to a labor camp in western Siberia while she, her mother and her brother were put in a settlement farther east. Their father was eventually freed and managed to find the family but, weak and ill, he died soon afterward. Mr. Jaruzelski\u2019s survivors include his wife, Barbara, whom he married in 1961, and his daughter, Monika. After Hitler broke his pact with Stalin and attacked eastward, Mr. Jaruzelski was sent to a Soviet officer candidate school and was made an infantry officer in the Soviet-sponsored Polish force, which fought alongside the Red Army in the liberation of Warsaw, the Oder and Elbe campaigns, and the Soviet conquest of Berlin. Mr. Jaruzelski was wounded and decorated several times for bravery. When the war ended, he remained in uniform, fighting anti-Communist guerrillas.He joined the Communist Party, advanced in the ranks and at 33 became the youngest general in the Polish Army. In 1960, he was appointed political commissar of the Army, a post that would have needed approval by the Kremlin. General Jaruzelski was elected to the Polish Parliament in 1961 and was named minister of defense in 1968. In 1970, when workers in the Baltic ports, including Mr. Walesa, took to the streets, troops shot and killed at least 44 of them. A year after this violence, General Jaruzelski became a full member of the Politburo, and in 1973, he was promoted to four-star general. Three years later, when workers again demonstrated in protests that paved the way for the rise of Solidarity, General Jaruzelski bucked party hard-liners by proclaiming, \u201cPolish troops will not fire on Polish workers.\u201d Five years later, however, on his watch, that is what happened.Polish society was at boiling point. The economy remained in a shambles, dissident intellectuals were forging links with workers, and Poland\u2019s overwhelmingly Catholic population was growing increasingly heartened by a Polish pope, John Paul II, who had challenged Soviet rule.Edward Gierek, Poland\u2019s leader beginning in 1970, resigned as first secretary in September 1980 after he was unable to control the labor unrest. He was replaced by Stanislaw Kania, who tried to walk the thin line of appeasing Solidarity while warning that Poland must remain in the Soviet orbit. The clamor persisted. A group called Rural Solidarity began organizing farmers. Students demanded more liberalization of their curriculum. In Moscow, Brezhnev was not happy. On Feb. 11, 1981, General Jaruzelski was named prime minister as Mr. Kania withdrew, saying of his successor, \u201cNow, as black clouds hang over Poland, he is the best man to whom the helm could be offered.\u201d General Jaruzelski tried to reach accommodations with Solidarity\u2019s leaders, with the students and farmers, and with the Catholic Church. But textile workers in Lodz staged a strike, and the economy continued to stagnate. After the Soviet Union stepped up pressure, General Jaruzelski began warning that he would order the police and army to suppress \u201cdeepening anarchist tendencies.\u201d Later that year, Mr. Kania resigned as head of the party, and that post, too, went to General Jaruzelski. He now held unprecedented power as head of the government, the Communist Party and the military, and was poised to call out his troops.In his later years, General Jaruzelski was severely injured when a farmer, blaming him for his bankruptcy, hit him with a brick during a book signing. But he recovered and resumed efforts to redeem his reputation. \u201cWe were staring hunger, cold, and blackout in the face,\u201d he said, adding. \u201cI spent the weeks prior to taking the decision on martial law as in some horrible nightmare. I entertained thoughts of suicide. So what held me back? The sense of responsibility for my family, friends and country.\u201dIn 1992, a polling firm in Warsaw reported that 56 percent of those surveyed regarded his decision on martial law to have been justified. Some former Solidarity dissidents even began to speak well of him.Court cases from the Communist era dogged General Jaruzelski in his final years, however. In April 2007, he was charged with violating the Constitution by imposing martial law in 1981, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison. Separately, he faced charges stemming from the shooting of the shipyard workers in 1970.General Jaruzelski was consoled by the idea that his reputation would improve. In 1994, while taking part in a seminar on the democratization of Eastern Europe, he declared: \u201cI am absolutely sure that the best opinion is expressed about anyone after his death. Because I am past 70, probably in the near future they will talk about me even better, when I will be in the cemetery.\u201dMichael T. Kaufman, who covered Poland for The New York Times in the 1980s, died in 2010.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Island Fixer-Upper, Near the Madding Crowd", "Date": "2014-05-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVenice JournalVENICE \u2014 A short boat ride from the elegant tourist horde that is Venice, Poveglia Island could be considered the anti-Venice. There are no souvenir shops, no gondolas and no people. A brick bell tower rises from a jumble of abandoned buildings. The overgrown gardens have been untended for decades. Poveglia might be a forgotten place in the Venetian Lagoon if not for a more recent feature: a digital For Sale sign.Now the island is entangled in two very different Italian problems, one national and one local. Italy\u2019s public debt is so great that the government has put a list of properties, including Poveglia, on the auction block. And Venice\u2019s tourism industry is so booming that many residents complain that ordinary life is becoming less and less tenable, which has turned the online auction for the island into a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Fearing that Poveglia could be developed into a luxury resort for rich visitors, a group of Venetians is proposing that the island should instead be a refuge from the onslaught of tourists, where anyone can go to enjoy the gardens, learn to sail or just to have a picnic. \u201cWe have to find some sort of balance between those who want to see it for the first time and those who don\u2019t want to see it for the last time.\u201dThe auction is being managed under the auspices of the Italian economy ministry. Properties across the country are up for sale, though the process is complicated and Italy has not moved swiftly to sell its cultural assets, often a contentious move. In the case of Poveglia, the government is selling a 99-year lease on the surface of the island, while maintaining ownership.The stakes escalated last Wednesday when the first phase of the bidding process was made public. Two bids qualified, one from an anonymous corporate investor, the other from donations collected by Friends of Poveglia. So far, the citizens\u2019 group is decidedly in second place: It bid 160,000 euros, or about $220,000, compared with 513,000 euros \u2014 $705,000 \u2014 by the corporate investor.Venice is sustained by tourism, even as the relentless growth of the industry is regarded as a rising threat to the city\u2019s environment and stability. Five years ago, when the population in the city center had dwindled to less than 60,000 \u2014after topping 108,000 people in 1971 \u2014 local activists staged a mock funeral, floating a coffin in a gondola down the Grand Canal. (They later opened it up to reveal bottles of Spumante.)The number of tourists coming to Venice now surpasses 20 million a year. Cruise ships deliver thousands of visitors on many days, with the huge boats looming over the narrow canals of the ancient city. And a handful of islands in the surrounding lagoon are being developed as luxury hotels or condominiums accessible only to wealthy guests or owners.Local resistance has steadily coalesced. One contested project involves plans to build an amusement park on an island that once housed the city\u2019s landfill. The developer, Alberto Zamperla, whose company helped redevelop amusement rides in Coney Island, says his project will provide jobs while celebrating the history and culture of Venice. Critics say it is another step toward the city\u2019s Disneyfication. \u201cSometimes when I talk with people, I have the impression that I am before an inquisition or tribunal,\u201d said Mr. Zamperla, who is still awaiting zoning approval.But public frustration seems to have galvanized most over the fate of Poveglia, which is about two miles from St. Mark\u2019s Square and the heart of Venice. The island has remained fairly obscure; some accounts hold that plague victims were buried there centuries ago, though local historians say no such evidence exists. If so, that would be fairly typical for many of the islands in the lagoon. A few sensationalistic accounts have described Poveglia as a \u201chaunted\u201d island, though many ordinary Venetians know it as a place where they once spent languorous weekends to escape the city.\u201cI came out here when I was young,\u201d said Patrizia Veclani, who is now part of the Friends of Poveglia campaign. \u201cWe used to dive in the water and have barbecues. When we were teenagers, we came out with our boyfriends.\u201dWhen the government announced the auction, citizens began a donation drive as the issue drew attention in the local news media. Organizers say they have been stunned by the outpouring of donations, including from many people outside the city sympathetic to their goals. On a recent rainy afternoon on the island of Giudecca, part of Venice, volunteers were collecting donations at La Palanca, a restaurant. Those who donated at least 99 euros would be listed as a \u201cpart owner\u201d of the island if the group wins the auction. Antonio Cirillo, an elementary-school teacher who has worked in Venice for 12 years, offered 100 euros. \u201cI like being part of anything that is doing something for the people who actually live here,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who choose to live here make an emotional choice. It is something you do with your heart.\u201dPier Paolo Baretta, a native Venetian who is an undersecretary in the economy ministry, said he had been impressed by the fervor of the local campaign \u2014 and even acknowledged sympathizing with the cause. \u201cThis is a case study to reflect on what a public asset actually means,\u201d Mr. Baretta said, adding that he thought the campaign over Poveglia had been an important moment for a city struggling to achieve a balance between quality of life and tourism revenue.\u201cPersonally, as a Venetian,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m very happy with what we are seeing now. If I were not in government, I would support the association.\u201dThe next phase of the auction process will be on Tuesday, when the two remaining bidders can compete and raise their offers. Mr. Pesola, the leader of the citizens\u2019 group, said more donations had been coming in, but he questioned whether it could ultimately post the highest bid. He hopes the government might intervene to help. The group\u2019s plans are still developing for the island, which comprises three parts separated by narrow canals, including a small, octagonal naval fortification built centuries ago. Mr. Pesola estimated it would cost several million euros to restore the buildings and the gardens. The group is looking for partners and has been talking with, among others, a local sailing school that is interested in teaching traditional Venetian seamanship. \u201cTwo weeks ago, everyone thought this was a utopian passion for a lost cause,\u201d Mr. Pesola said. \u201cBut no one does anymore.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inequality Has Been Going On Forever ... but That Doesn\u2019t Mean It\u2019s Inevitable", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe have been living with rising income inequality for so long \u2014 in good times and bad, under Republican presidents and Democratic ones \u2014 that it has come to seem inevitable. It is no longer news that the affluent did better than everyone else during the booms of the 1980s and \u201990s and through the mediocre growth of this century\u2019s first years. Or that the rich have recovered from the financial crisis far better than the rest of country.But with exquisite timing, one of the most ambitious (and best-reviewed) books on the subject in years \u2014 Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d \u2014 appeared this spring to argue that rising inequality wasn\u2019t merely a feature of our times. It has been the historical norm, writes Piketty, a professor at the Paris School of Economics. Inequality has risen throughout much of modern history, he writes, with the notable exceptions of wars, depressions and their aftermath, when everyone was forced to rebuild from a more equal place. And inequality is likely to continue increasing for decades, he says. Ultimately, we could end up with a society in which the rich separate themselves from everyone else, perpetuating their wealth from one generation to the next, as nobility of past centuries did.That prospect sounds depressing, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to turn out that way. To say that something is likely, or even natural, is not to say that it is inevitable. Not so long ago, the rich owned a much smaller share of this country\u2019s resources and made a smaller share of its income than many of their predecessors. Perhaps more important, even though inequality has risen abroad, it has done so far less rapidly. Other developed economies (see charts at right), are not more equal simply because they lack success stories, like Warren Buffett, or have fewer investment bankers or hedge-fund executives. Instead, their middle class and poor have enjoyed more aggressively rising incomes, all while their economies grow as rapidly as this country\u2019s in recent years. A more equal society does not mean a less dynamic one. (Germany is notably alone among wealthy European countries in having broad-based income trends nearly as weak as the United States.)Inequality, then, is less an inevitability than a choice. Just as societies have conquered many of the challenges of the natural world \u2014 making childbirth safe for women or beating back common illnesses that once were frequent killers \u2014 we can alter the course of inequality, too.He suggested imagining a hypothetical village from centuries ago in which neither the population nor the economy was growing. Every year, the village produced the same amount of goods for the same number of people to divide \u2014 a reality that was typical before the Enlightenment, when material living standards and human longevity barely rose. (The peasants of the 15th century were not better off than peasants in ancient Rome.) Even in a zero-growth society, however, assets that helped people produce goods \u2014 also known as capital \u2014 had value. Capital, Piketty told me, counts as anything \u201cuseful, any kind of equipment. Basic tools. Stones in prehistorical times.\u201d Anything, in other words, that \u201cmakes people more productive.\u201dIn our hypothetical village, a large farm might produce $10,000 worth of crops in a year and yield $1,000 in profit for its owner. A small farm might have the same 10 percent rate of return: $1,000 in annual crop sales, yielding $100 in profit. If the large farmer and small farmer each spent all of their money every year, the situation could continue ad infinitum, Piketty said, and the rate of inequality in the village would not change.But one of capital\u2019s great advantages is that its owners can make enough income to spend some of their money and sock the rest of it away. If the large farmer saved $500 of that $1,000 profit, he could buy more capital, which would bring more profit. Perhaps a few owners of smaller farms had debts to pay, and one of the large farmers bought them out. Eventually, the owner of the expanding farm might find himself owning land that yielded $1,500 or $2,000 in annual profit, allowing him to put aside more and more for future capital acquisitions. Less-stylized versions of this story have been playing out for centuries.I have come to think of this idea as Piketty\u2019s First Law of Inequality. The fact that the rich earn enough money to save money allows them to make investments that other people simply cannot afford. And investments \u2014 whether stones, land, corporate stock or education \u2014 tend to bring a positive return. Piketty describes the relationship formally as r > g: the rate of return on capital usually exceeds economic growth.Piketty, however, notes that certain things can disrupt this relationship. When a war destroys farms, the big farmers are no longer much richer than anyone else. A depression can play the same role. When income or wealth is taxed at high rates, the rich are not able to save and accumulate as much. It\u2019s no accident that in the decades after World War II, when middle-class incomes were rising even more rapidly than the incomes of the rich, the top marginal income-tax rates were exceptionally high. In the 1950s, the top rate exceeded 90 percent. Today, it is 39.6 percent, and only because President Obama finally won a yearslong battle with Republicans in early 2013 to increase it from 35 percent.Piketty advocates a global wealth tax aimed more directly at capital inequality than income taxes currently are. It would apply to anyone with more than about $1.4 million in net worth and become steeper on higher fortunes than moderate ones. It\u2019s an interesting idea, but it has little, if any, chance of passing the current legislative environment. Yet Piketty mentions another, more politically plausible force that can disrupt his first law of inequality: education. When a society becomes more educated, many of its less-wealthy citizens quickly acquire an ephemeral but nonetheless crucial form of capital \u2014 knowledge \u2014 that can bring enormous returns. They learn to make objects and accomplish tasks more efficiently, and they sometimes create entirely new objects (or services). They become those children in the small village who attended school, went off to work in a factory, became managers and made bigger economic leaps above their parents than those of the large farmer did.The great income gains for the American middle class and poor in the mid-to-late 20th century came after this country made high school universal and turned itself into the most educated nation in the world. As the economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz have written, \u201cThe 20th century was the American century because it was the human-capital century.\u201d Education continues to pay today, despite the scare stories to the contrary. The pay gap between college graduates and everyone else in this country is near its all-time high. The countries that have done a better job increasing their educational attainment, like Canada and Sweden, have also seen bigger broad-based income gains than the United States.Yet the debate over our schools and colleges tends to exist in a separate political universe from our debate over inequality. Liberals often shy away from making the connection because they worry it holds the struggling middle class and poor responsible for their plight and distracts from income redistribution. Many conservatives fear the implicit government spending involved. And so, our once-large international lead in educational attainment has vanished, and our lead in inequality has grown.There are some reasons for optimism in education. Charter schools and school systems that have tried to introduce more accountability offer some lessons about what works and doesn\u2019t in K-12. The total number of college graduates has begun rising again. That said, the changes in education \u2014 not to mention the tax code \u2014 are not nearly large enough to counteract the forces pushing in the other direction. A true attack on inequality would require that the country move the issue to the center of every political debate: how we tax wealth, how we tax the income of the middle class and poor (often stealthily through the payroll tax), how we finance schools and measure their results, how we tolerate income-sapping waste in health care, how we build roads, transit systems and broadband networks. These are precisely the sort of policies pursued by countries with better recent middle-class income growth than the United States.The closest thing to an antihero in Piketty\u2019s book is an economist named Simon Kuznets, who argued in the decades after World War II that inequality was destined to decline. His soothing prediction grew out the experience of the previous few decades, but he and many others confused a trend with destiny. We are now making that same mistake in the opposite direction. Rising inequality is a trend, but it is one we have helped create and one we can still change.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B. Plots Strategy for Staving Off Deflation", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINTRA, Portugal \u2014 The European Central Bank was basically intended to do one thing: keep inflation in a cage. But its mission has turned out to be a lot more complicated than that.That was the challenge facing an elite group of policy makers and economists gathered this week at a golf resort here outside Lisbon to brainstorm about how the central bank can combat the euro zone\u2019s continuing economic problems with only a limited arsenal and a dwindling supply of ammunition.The question has become more urgent in light of a growing recognition \u2014 acknowledged on Monday in perhaps the frankest terms yet by Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president \u2014 that the euro zone is at risk of sliding into deflation, a downward price spiral that can ultimately destroy corporate profits and the ability of businesses to hire.Expectations run high that the central bank will take some sort of action when its governing council meets on June 5. The annual inflation rate, at 0.7 percent, remains well below the central bank\u2019s target of close to 2 percent. But what the officials will do next week is still something of a mystery, and many economists question whether new measures would have any meaningful impact, given that the bank has already cut its benchmark interest rate close to zero.Mr. Draghi said in unusually direct terms on Monday that there was a risk the euro zone could become caught in the trap of falling prices, a \u201cclassic deflationary cycle\u201d that would require large-scale purchases of bonds or other assets to reverse. The statement may have been part of an attempt by Mr. Draghi to prepare the ground for controversial and exceptional measures.\u201cWhat we need to be particularly watchful for at the moment is the potential for a negative spiral to take hold between low inflation, falling inflation expectations and credit, in particular in stressed countries,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in a speech that opened the two-day conference.But Mr. Draghi also said there was still doubt about whether deflation was on the horizon. And he indicated that members of the bank\u2019s governing council, many of whom are also at the conference, were still debating what would be the right response to a combination of falling prices, tight bank credit and uneven growth.The conference, a first-time event modeled on a similar gathering organized annually in Jackson Hole, Wyo., by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, is partly an attempt to tap the collective wisdom of leading economists. The conference has been in the works for months, so the timing just before what now looms as a crucial meeting for the bank is a coincidence. But as a result, it has turned out to be a less-relaxed exchange of views than organizers had imagined.\u201cOur ability to detach from the pressures of the moment has been less than we thought,\u201d Mr. Draghi said somewhat ruefully.The specter of deflation threatens to undermine the weak economic recovery in the euro zone. Although some crisis-plagued countries, like Spain, are growing again, unemployment remains at 11.8 percent in the euro zone, just below a record high. Many other countries, most notably Italy, are still in recession and have only just begun the work of making their economies more competitive.Despite its limitations, the central bank has the advantage of being the one euro zone institution able to move quickly.\u201cWe always look at central bankers and say, \u2018Can you fix it?'\u2009\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup organization of finance ministers, said during a panel discussion on Monday. \u201c\u2009'Put some cheap money out there.\u2019 But when you look at the situation, there is no quick fix.\u201dSpeakers at the conference offered no immediate solutions. On the contrary, some fretted that additional powers already granted to the central bank are flawed. For example, they raised questions about its new role as a bank supervisor in the euro zone\u2019s so-called banking union, which gives it more tools to clean up the banking system.Yet Martin Hellwig, director of the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn and an influential economist, said the central bank still did not have all the tools it needed to deal with failed commercial banks. \u201cThat is the elephant in the room,\u201d Mr. Hellwig said. \u201cWe need a viable resolution regime and we don\u2019t have it.\u201dExpectations that the bank will take some form of action on June 5 have been raised by a flurry of statements in recent weeks by Mr. Draghi and by other members of the governing council indicating that they were prepared to take further steps to stimulate the euro zone economy.Deflation, which has afflicted Japan for years, is considered particularly pernicious because once it sets in, it is difficult for policy makers to reverse. Expectations of falling prices cause people to delay big purchases, which in turn undercuts corporate profits and makes businesses reluctant to hire.A \u201ctoo prolonged\u201d period of inflation below current expectations, Mr. Draghi said, \u201cwould call for a more expansionary stance, which would be the context for a broad-based asset purchase program.\u201dMany economists have urged the central bank to emulate the United States Federal Reserve and buy large quantities of government bonds and other assets to pump money into the economy.But most analysts do not expect the European Central Bank to announce asset purchases when the council meets next week. More likely, analysts say, would be a cut of the benchmark interest rate to 0.15 percent from 0.25 percent, coupled with a so-called negative deposit rate that would charge lenders for parking money at the central bank.A negative deposit rate would tend to push down the value of the euro against the dollar and other currencies, because investors would earn little or no return on euros. In his speech on Monday, Mr. Draghi said the increase in the euro\u2019s value against the dollar since 2011 had driven down the price of commodities like fuel in euro terms, contributing to low inflation.Mr. Draghi also hinted that the central bank might take steps to encourage banks to lend more. He cited data showing that even profitable companies in Spain and Portugal have trouble getting bank loans. A quarter of Spanish firms and one-third of Portuguese firms face credit constraints, Mr. Draghi said, compared with only 1 percent in Germany and Austria.There has been speculation that the European Central Bank might issue cheap loans to euro zone banks, with strings attached to ensure they lend the money to businesses rather than invest in government bonds, as has happened in the past.The governing council is still debating what action to take, Mr. Draghi indicated. But all the members \u2014 the central bank governors of the 18 countries in the euro zone and the six members of the central bank\u2019s executive board \u2014 agree that inflation is too low, he said.\u201cThere is no debate about our goal,\u201d Mr. Draghi said, \u201cwhich is to return inflation toward 2 percent in the medium term.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Analysis Pours Cold Water on Expanded TV and Film Subsidies", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The California legislative analyst\u2019s office on Wednesday offered what it called \u201cpreliminary observations\u201d on the push for expanded film and television subsidies in the state \u2014 and its that initial advice was to proceed with a great deal of caution.To date, California has offered $100 million a year in tax credits to support film production; proposed legislation would expand the program considerably. No dollar amounts have yet been assigned, but backers have talked privately of subsidies matching New York\u2019s program, which is capped at about $420 million a year.But the report offered a list of reasons to be wary: film and television production is growing more slowly than the rest of the economy, and may decline even with help; competing with other states could become hugely expensive; any benefits from an expanded credit would be concentrated largely around Los Angeles; and, other industries, some with arguably greater social utility, might well demand subsidies of their own.The state analyst is expected to issue a full report on California\u2019s film subsidies by the end of 2015. By then, however, legislators and California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown, will already have decided whether or not to enact an expansion proposal that is working its way through the State Legislature.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women and the \u2018I Don\u2019t Know\u2019 Problem", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk a PollsterNews organizations generally conduct their polls on issues that are in the headlines, and it\u2019s usually a safe assumption that Americans are familiar with the basic issues and should be able to offer an opinion.Is the economy getting better, worse, or staying about the same? Do you approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling his job? These are very basic questions, and most people should be able to answer quickly and easily.What pollsters have learned is that people generally have formed opinions on a topic, but can be easily tempted to pick the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d option, if it is provided.On that answer, we\u2019ve seen what seem like small gaps between men and women get magnified. For example, we asked, \u201cWould you like to see Marco Rubio run for president of the United States in 2016, or not, or don\u2019t you know enough about Marco Rubio to say?\u201d The results, at first glance, gave Mr. Rubio what looks like an 8-point advantage among Republican and independent men over women. But in reality, his \u201cdon\u2019t knows\u201d among Republican and independent women were 17 points higher. So it was actually hard to tell what women really think of him.Jon Krosnick, a professor of communication, political science and psychology at Stanford University, gives two reasons for people selecting the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d response.In asking questions, we pollsters are communicating to our respondents that they need to have a level of certainty for having an opinion. The respondent is left guessing as to that level of certainty. \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d provides an easy out.\u201cPlenty of people don\u2019t have maximum certainty and therefore decide to edit themselves,\u201d Mr. Krosnick says. But women do it more. \u201cIn polling, women\u2019s voices can become silent or muted if you give them a no-response option.\u201dThe second reason that people will pick the \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d option is known as \u201csatisficing,\u201d or picking the answer that makes it easiest to reduce the burden of answering the question. We know that when we call people for a survey, many of them are making dinner, or trying to get their children to do their homework, or just want to get back to their TV show. With the \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d people have a shortcut to get the poll over with. But then we fail to measure people who genuinely have opinions.So, for most of the questions in our polls, we don\u2019t offer shortcuts. We allow respondents to say \u201cdon\u2019t know,\u201d but it is a volunteered response, not one that is read to them by interviewers.When we do offer respondents the chance to say they don\u2019t know, it tends to be for questions that are asking for an opinion about someone or something we think they may be unfamiliar with, such as candidates new to the national political scene, or an event or issue that may not have reached the headlines.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Consumer Debt Suggests Growing Confidence", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsCONSUMERS appear to be growing more confident and are less likely to be behind on their bills, according to figures released this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Using figures from Equifax, one of the major credit reporting companies, the New York Fed estimated that consumers owed $8.69 trillion in mortgage debt at the end of the first quarter, 2 percent more than they owed a year earlier. That figure includes both first mortgages and home equity loans. It was the first year-over-year increase since 2008.That amount remains 13 percent below the $9.99 trillion peak that Equifax estimated consumers owed at the end of the third quarter of 2008. As many Americans defaulted on mortgages and lost their homes during the financial crisis, the amount of outstanding mortgage debt declined. There was also a sharp decline in new mortgages as fewer homes were sold.The New York Fed report also indicated that the proportion of all four major categories of consumer debt that was seriously delinquent \u2014 behind by at least 90 days in payment \u2014 declined during the quarter. Only 8.5 percent of credit card loans were in that category at the end of the first quarter, a figure that was lower than at any point previously recorded in the data, which goes back to 2003. The serious delinquency rate on student loans fell to 11 percent from 11.5 percent, but remained higher than the rate for any other category.The data indicated that in 2013, the proportion of adults age 27 to 30 with home mortgage debt continued to decline, falling to 21.6 percent among those with student loans outstanding, and 22.3 percent of those with no such loans.Before 2012, young adults with student loans were more likely to have purchased homes than were those without such debt. That was taken as an indication that such people were more likely to be college graduates, with better-paying jobs. The change, the Fed researchers said, may reflect that people with student loans are now more burdened by them. And, they added, it may reflect that 30-year-olds with student loans on average have lower credit scores than those without such loans, and thus have a harder time getting mortgages to buy homes. Another indication of improving confidence is that younger people now seem more willing to take on debt to buy cars. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the proportion of people 22 to 25 years of age with auto loans rose in 2013 for the first time since the recession began. That was true for both those with student loans and those without.As can be seen from the charts, the recession caused substantial declines in the amount outstanding of three of the four major categories of consumer debt \u2014 mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. Auto loan volume was the first to begin growing again. Credit card debts outstanding appear to have leveled out but have yet to rise significantly. By contrast, the amount of student loans outstanding never fell during the recession, although the rate of growth did slow in 2011 and 2012 before accelerating in 2013. In 2012, student loans replaced credit card debt as the category with the highest proportion of delinquent accounts. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Bud Light-ification of Bud", "Date": "2014-05-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyThere are many things that bother Jon Cooper about the market for marijuana.\u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible to find a consistent product,\u201d said Cooper, one of the legion of tech start-up guys and M.B.A.s plunging into the world of pot. \u201cYou go into a dispensary and buy something called \u2018Sour Diesel\u2019 and try it. You go to another dispensary, buy \u2018Sour Diesel,\u2019 and it\u2019s a different experience. You go back to the first dispensary, buy it again and it\u2019s not the same, either.\u201dDespite the inconsistency, nobody doubts marijuana\u2019s popularity as a consumer product: 38 percent of Americans admit to having tried it, and 7 percent use it on a regular basis. But for decades, it has been produced and sold primarily on the black market, which has only recently developed shades of gray and white.This has wrenched the ancient psychotropic substance into the machinery of 21st-century consumer capitalism \u2014 with all the consultants, marketers, brand advisers and scientists that come with it. A joint might never be as easy to access as a can of beer or a cigarette. But thousands of people and millions of dollars are hard at work to make it as predictable and dependable as one. Call it the Bud Light-ification of bud.There\u2019s a pressing economic reason for the pot industry to get better if it is to survive, aside from its formidable legal challenges. The plant is relatively cheap and easy to grow, and not complicated to process either. Left to the whims of the open market \u2014 meaning ignoring taxes and regulations \u2014 the price of a joint could plummet to the price of a tea bag or a packet of sugar. So how will investors help the market mature while still making money?The inefficiencies continue to pile up after the harvest. Marijuana has to be cured, then trimmed, before it is sold, and much of this work is still done by hand. Workers use scissors to cut away tough outer leaves and expose the smokable part of the plant. It\u2019s a labor-intensive process, the kind that in other instances is completed by a machine, like a thresher or a cotton gin.Already, the booming industry has started ironing things out. Growers House, a Tucson-based \u201cindoor gardening center,\u201d offers a wide variety of mechanical trimmers on its website. At the low end, for a few hundred dollars, they resemble salad spinners studded with blades; on the high end, they look more like propane grills. One of these, the Triminator ($17,900), can process 18 pounds of \u201cmaterial\u201d in an hour \u2014 90 times faster than hand-trimming, by the company\u2019s own estimate.Peter Adams, the executive director of Rockies Venture Club, an investment group that is researching the cannabis industry, thinks numbers like that mean an inevitable plunge in the price of pot. \u201cPeople selling the ancillary products won\u2019t see that,\u201d Adams said. \u201cYou\u2019re still going to have the same cost for LED\u2019s, soil, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, those things.\u201dWith costs and prices falling, producers might try to scramble up the value chain, complicating or sophisticating their offerings to get an edge. (Why sell nail polish when you can sell French manicures? More to the point, why sell cornmeal when you can sell Doritos?) There, they\u2019re going to have to do a better job of luring and keeping customers if they want to midwife pot into the great big American consumer market, where consistency is king.Crack open a can of Bud Light, then another and another. The beers should taste identical. Try the same with a McDonald\u2019s hamburger, a Marlboro red, a stick of Wrigley\u2019s gum or even a glass of name-brand, middle-market wine. Unless something has gone terribly wrong, it should feel as if you were sipping or smoking or eating the exact same product again and again and again.In spite of marijuana\u2019s significant popularity, there is still an element of roulette when it comes to smoking a legal joint or eating a legal brownie. Federal law does not require companies to test for and disclose levels of the drug\u2019s active ingredients, like tetrahydrocannabinol. (Federal law does not hold that pot is legal, after all.) Many dispensaries and producers fail to test for potency, contaminants or mold. And different states have different disclosure laws with different levels of efficacy. As such, a gram of \u201cAK-47\u201d bought in an Oakland dispensary might affect you differently than a gram of the same purchased in Colorado. (As Cooper pointed out: \u201cWhat is AK-47 supposed to be, anyway?\u201d)\u201cUnder a commercial system, the rules could be a lot tighter,\u201d said Mark Kleiman of the University of California, Los Angeles, an adviser to Washington State.\u201cRight now, you have some products where you\u2019re supposed to eat, say, an eighth of a cookie. Who\u2019s going to take a circular cookie and geometrically divide that friable object into eighths?\u201dSensing the opportunity for something more predictable, Cooper and his partner at Ebbu, a Colorado pot start-up, are creating a variety of predosed products \u2014 like prerolled joints, or little Listerine-style strips. They have eschewed the silly strain names, instead labeling their products \u201chigh-energy,\u201d \u201crelaxed,\u201d \u201cbliss,\u201d \u201ccreate\u201d and \u201cgiggles.\u201dLauren Ely, a librarian from Erie, Colo., is working on a start-up called DisposaBowls \u2014 prepacked, disposable ceramic pipes.\u201cI joke around and tell everyone I\u2019m the old, fat Nancy Botwin,\u201d she said, referring to the character from the Showtime show \u201cWeeds.\u201d She said that she hoped the product would appeal to experienced smokers looking for a convenient way to bring the product with them while they go on a hike, for example. But she also saw it as a good way to introduce novices, seniors and medicinal smokers to pot, with gentle, predictable results.The legal pressure on even legitimate marijuana businesses helps to explain much of the immaturity, by scaring away capital, both monetary and human: The industry until now has mostly been made up of potheads and lawbreakers, after all. But the investors I spoke with said that pitches have gotten better, and money has been rushing in, too.Despite the potential, many investors are still hesitating at spending the money that might make joints and brownies less ad hoc, more corporate. Why spend $20 million on a grow site that might be shut down, or a new brand that might get stamped out by the next administration\u2019s Justice Department? A surfeit of laws \u2014 and confusion between them \u2014 is holding the market back.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Alice in Wonderland,\u201d said Adams, of Rockies Venture Club. \u201cAll the rules of physics are broken, and you\u2019re trying to figure your way through a strange place.\u201d To be fair, it will probably feel like that to new consumers too.The It\u2019s the Economy column on May 18 about growing marijuana misidentified the cable network that broadcast the show \u201cWeeds.\u201d It was Showtime, not HBO.Annie Lowrey is an economics reporter for The Times.Deep Thoughts:\n1.

{"Headline": "Narendra Modi\u2019s Ambitious Agenda Will Face Difficult Obstacles", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople took photographs of a map of India with a portrait of Narendra Modi on Friday in Gandhinagar, in the western Indian state of Gujarat.NEW DELHI \u2014 Addressing a euphoric crowd Friday afternoon, Narendra Modi rallied the public to join him in taking on challenges of a vast scale. He has floated the idea of building \u201ca hundred new cities,\u201d of extending a high-speed rail network across the subcontinent and undertaking the herculean task of cleaning the Ganges River.He has been inspired by China\u2019s model of high-growth, top-down development. But the country he will govern is India: messy, diffuse and democratic.Mr. Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party won a historic mandate in the country\u2019s general election on Friday, emerging with 282 of 543 parliamentary seats, more than enough to form a government without having to broker a post-election coalition. For months, Mr. Modi\u2019s advisers had focused on crossing such a threshold, which they regarded as a signal that the country was behind an agenda of radical change.The nature of that change has never been clear, though. Voters are seeking immediate economic opportunities. The party has proposed pro-business legislation like the easing of labor and land-acquisition laws. Mr. Modi is drawn to large-scale building and infrastructure projects, which he pursues with a single-minded \u2014 critics say dictatorial \u2014 style.\u201cHe has a fairly clear idea of what he wants to accomplish, and he does not look for ratification from the market,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a Cornell University economist who has consulted informally with Mr. Modi\u2019s economic team. \u201cOne could argue that in a country where there are far more words than actions thrown around, that this is far more preferable: a man who acts.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s planned economic reforms are certain to encounter obstacles once he takes power, among them a federal system that puts essential functions like land acquisition in the hands of state leaders.Entrenched national-level functionaries will resist efforts to strip their authority by eliminating red tape, a goal that was central to Mr. Modi\u2019s plan to attract investors to the state of Gujarat. Changing tax policy or labor and land laws would require the support of the upper house of Parliament, which the Bharatiya Janata Party does not control. Meanwhile, voters\u2019 expectations of immediate economic improvement are perilously high, setting the stage for rapid disappointment if Mr. Modi is seen as not delivering.But Friday\u2019s enormous victory will give Mr. Modi \u201ca much freer hand than the typical leader of such a large democracy,\u201d Mr. Prasad said. The reasons Mr. Modi\u2019s party succeeded in defeating the Indian National Congress, which has controlled India\u2019s government for nearly all of its postcolonial history, will be studied for years. But they clearly reflect a rapid change in Indian society as urbanization and economic growth break down old voting patterns.For decades, the Congress party\u2019s trademark initiatives have been redistributive, and the party introduced a package of major subsidies for the poor before the election. Voters, however, proved to be more captivated by Mr. Modi\u2019s promise to create manufacturing jobs, which he has done quite successfully in Gujarat, the state he has governed since 2001.Despite a period of rising incomes, a tide of economic discontent helped make Narendra Modi the prime minister-elect.A cultural conservative, he is no admirer of the liberal intellectuals who traditionally support the Congress party. Swapan Dasgupta, a journalist who supports Mr. Modi, said Delhi elites were worried \u2014 justifiably \u2014 that the space for their work would shrink when the new government settles in.\u201cI cannot say what the contours of the future political elite or political class will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has brought in lots of people who have risen from local politics, less of those people who are traditional dynasts. A new sort of people, perhaps a little technocratic. People not from the Anglophone elite, maybe.\u201dThe mood at Congress headquarters on Friday was funereal. Top officials had prepared for a loss, but not for the crushing defeat they faced; according to final results from the Election Commission, the party had secured only 44 seats, a surprisingly low number for the party that was integral to India\u2019s founding narrative.\u201cWe believe that in a democracy winning and losing is part of the game,\u201d Mrs. Gandhi said. \u201cThis time the mandate is clearly against us. I accept the mandate with humility. I hope that the incoming government will not compromise with the interests of society.\u201dA Congress-led coalition won a solid majority of seats in 2009 parliamentary elections, but the term was tarnished by corruption scandals and a slowing economy. Party workers, dully flipping through television news channels in a room with portraits of four generations of Nehru-Gandhi politicians on Friday, complained that the party\u2019s grass-roots workers no longer had contact with Mr. Gandhi and his advisers, and had failed to identify shifts among young voters.Rajendra Pal Singh, a clerk with the party for more than 30 years, sadly recalled a time when the party faithful streamed in and out of the party\u2019s bungalow as if it were \u201ca place of worship.\u201d\u201cGone are the days of the Gandhis,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cWe have not seen people coming here to hug Rahul for the past decade on any of those festivals. That culture is dead and long gone, like the Congress party now.\u201dAddressing a euphoric throng in the city of Vadodara after votes were counted on Friday, Mr. Modi was forced to pause repeatedly as he waited for the audience to stop chanting his name. Mr. Modi, normally an intensely solitary man, draws visible pleasure from his interactions with crowds, and he seemed on Friday to enlist their support for vast undertakings.\u201cBrothers and sisters, you have faith in me, and I have faith in you,\u201d Mr. Modi said. \u201cThis is the strength of our confidence \u2014 that we have the capacity to fulfill the common man\u2019s aspirations. The citizens of this country have done three centuries of work today.\u201dHis supporters celebrated. Drummers, stilt-walkers and women in colorful saris converged at B.J.P. headquarters in New Delhi, where party workers had laid out 100,000 laddoos, the ball-shaped sweets that are ubiquitous at Indian celebrations. Among the revelers was Surinder Singh Tiwana, 40, a lawyer.\u201cI can equate my jubilation today, probably, to my mother\u2019s on the day I was born,\u201d Mr. Tiwana said. \u201cThis is a huge change for our country, a change of guard. A billion plus people have announced their mandate in no uncertain terms.\u201dSuhasini Raj, Hari Kumar and Neha Thirani Bagri contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On-Site Fixes for What Winter\u2019s Potholes Wrought", "Date": "2014-05-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMotoringJennifer Franz of Sacramento scraped a wheel on her three-year-old Honda Accord last August in an encounter with a curb. To keep her mother from finding the damage, she made an appointment with a local business, Kelly Wheel Repair, that travels to its customers. The job of restoring the rim would be done discreetly \u2014 in the parking lot of the television station where Ms. Franz was working as an account executive. A truck pulling a trailer specially outfitted for cosmetic wheel repairs pulled into the lot at 9 a.m. the next day. When the work was completed, Ms. Franz was left with a wheel that looked \u201cspanking new,\u201d she wrote on Yelp, the review website. Nine months later she is still pleased with the work, and she plans to use the service again, she wrote in an email. The cost: $150, far less than a replacement rim.In recent years, carmakers have moved from steel wheels to alloy rims made mainly of aluminum. At the same time, wheels have grown in diameter, and the tire sidewalls have shrunk proportionally. Larger and lighter rims can improve handling and fuel economy, but replacements are costly, from about $400 for an original-equipment 17-inch Honda Accord rim to more than $1,000 each for some luxury models. And with the smaller tire sidewalls providing less protection, the wheel is more exposed to curb and pothole damage, said Jeff Smith, president and owner of Kwicksilver Systems of Washington, Va., a wheel-repair business. So this spring, the potholes left by the harsh winter have brought an increase in business, Mr. Smith said, \u201cespecially bent rims in the Northeast.\u201dBut not every victim of curb or pothole damage can get the on-site service that Ms. Franz received. Though Kwicksilver operates nearly 50 franchises nationwide, many equipped with mobile wheel-repair units, some services don\u2019t make house calls and on-site fixes. \u201cThese customized trucks and trailers are pretty expensive,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re primarily designed to go to a car dealership and do wheel after wheel.\u201dNonetheless, in some parts of the country up to 10 competing wheel-repair businesses might be vying to meet customers at a location of the car owner\u2019s choice. The materials, skills and range of services vary. Some technicians touch up a wheel while it\u2019s still attached to the vehicle; others remove it and do the repair in a mobile workshop that may have just come from serving a Mercedes-Benz dealership. Many repairs can be done without removing the tire entirely from the wheel, just deflating it and pushing the sidewall back from the edge.\u201cSome guys do this from lawn chairs,\u201d said Todd Ford, referring to a less professional level of wheel repair. Mr. Ford\u2019s company, Custom Upfits in West Sacramento, Calif., operates on a higher level, modifying trucks and trailers for several wheel-repair businesses around the country at a cost of $35,000 to $40,000. Mr. Ford said that all of his vehicles met strict standards for environmental and fire safety, which may vary by locality.New York\u2019s regulations are a problem for mobile wheel repair, Wayne Headley, owner of a Kwicksilver franchise in Queens, said. \u201cIt was like playing Russian roulette with the city,\u201d said Mr. Headley, who operated out of a mobile unit in 2007-11, often facing challenges over fire- and building-department permits. Now he works exclusively from his shop on Rockaway Boulevard. Other wheel-repair operations in Manhattan and Brooklyn also said they did not travel to customers\u2019 locations.Not far away, however, is a rolling repair shop that will go to consumers. Michael Trento, a New Jersey franchisee of the Alloy Wheel Repair Specialists chain, works mainly for car dealers. But he can also send one of his four trucks to a car owner\u2019s workplace or home in Rockland County in New York or Bergen and Passaic Counties of New Jersey.His trucks are equipped to let a technician work on two rims at a time; repairing a wheel generally takes 25 minutes to an hour. His custom-built 14-foot box trucks have two rooms: a paint area and a section with a rim-straightening machine that can handle some, but not all, bent wheels.Mr. Trento, like many people in this industry, said that damaged wheels made with a machine-cut finish, rather than a smoothly polished surface, need to be refurbished completely in a shop, not just touched up on their front surfaces. In the Charlotte, N.C., area, a number of wheel-repair businesses serve customers at their homes or offices. \u201cWe love retail,\u201d said Derek Mickler, vice president of operations for one service, Rimguard Xtreme. The company mainly serves dealerships, but it also serves car owners in North and South Carolina and the Danville, Va., area. The company has 15 mobile repair units, primarily box trucks but also some Ford Rangers that are dispatched for \u201ccurb damage or color,\u201d Mr. Mickler said. Repair of a painted wheel generally takes from 30 minutes to an hour, while polished wheels take somewhat longer. Prices start at $75 for cosmetic repairs like curb rash; bends might be straightened for $125 to $150. Chrome repairs, which could cost up to $500, can be done only at the company\u2019s shops in Charlotte and Wilmington, N.C.The company also advertises nationwide, providing UPS labels for shipping rims. Turnaround time is 48 to 72 hours, and customers can track the progress of the repair online. Then there are the one-person businesses like Kelly Wheel Repair, which did the work on Ms. Franz\u2019s car. The owner, Hayden Kelly, bought a purpose-built trailer from Custom Upfits after more than a decade of repairing wheels while they were still bolted on the car. \u201cIt hurt my back,\u201d said Mr. Kelly, who also prefers the dust-free conditions and privacy of the mobile unit, where he does cosmetic repairs but does not fix bent or cracked wheels.Still, Mr. Kelly said it was possible for a skilled technician to do a good cosmetic repair on a wheel without removing it from the car. He said that practice remained widespread in the San Diego area, where he worked until moving to Sacramento in 2011. In his former territory, a security guard once chased him from a small parking lot where he was working on a repair, forcing him to drive 10 miles to a customer\u2019s home to complete the work.There were no such issues for Ms. Franz, the pleased Accord owner. She said parking-lot repairs for other matters, like windshields, were common in her area, and anyway, \u201cit was done so quickly no one even noticed he was there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three-Day Rally Ends, Despite Positive News", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEncouraging news on the economy was not enough to lift the stock market on Thursday after three consecutive days of gains.Manufacturing grew faster in April than in March as exports rose and factories accelerated hiring. Shoppers increased their spending in March at the fastest pace in almost five years, and construction spending also rose.The reports, a day after the Commerce Department said that growth stalled in the January to March quarter, suggest that the economy is gaining momentum after the unusually harsh winter.\u201cThe data was good, but not robust enough to completely eliminate doubts over whether the first quarter was entirely weather-related,\u201d said Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for LPL Financial. Investors\u2019 reaction to the economic reports was also muted ahead of Friday\u2019s report on April employment. Economists polled by Bloomberg estimate that employers added roughly 218,000 jobs last month. Economists also forecast that the unemployment rate dipped to 6.6 percent from 6.7 percent.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 0.27 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 1,883.68. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.97 points, or 0.13 percent, to 16,558.87, after reaching a nominal (not adjusted for inflation) high on Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 12.90 points, or 0.31 percent, to 4,127.45. On Thursday, stocks moved between small gains and losses as investors also assessed the latest round of company earnings and reports of a potential deal.DirecTV jumped $3.16, or 4.1 percent, to $80.76 after The Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had approached the company about a possible $40 billion acquisition. Dish Network, DirecTV\u2019s competitor, climbed $3.35, or 5.9 percent, to $60.21. In earnings news, Avon Products slumped $1.56, or 10.2 percent, to $13.72 after the company said its first-quarter loss widened, stung by volatile currency moves in Venezuela and weak revenue across all regions. Profit and revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations.MasterCard and Yelp were among the companies that gained after reporting their latest quarterly earnings.MasterCard rose 67 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $74.22 after the company reported that its net income climbed 14 percent in the first quarter on the strength of more spending by cardholders around the world.Yelp rose $5.70, or 9.8 percent, to $64.02 after the company said late Wednesday that its first-quarter loss narrowed as more local businesses signed up for its services. The results were better than the market expected, and the company raised its revenue forecast for the year.Over all, the trend in corporate earnings has been steady, if not spectacular, improvement.More than 60 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 have reported earnings for the first quarter. Analysts expect earnings for the period to rise 1.7 percent, compared with growth of almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter and 5.2 percent in the same period earlier, according to data from S&P Capital IQ.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise around the trend, but the trend is positive,\u201d said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Investment Management. \u201cEarnings are coming in O.K., and that makes me happy.\u201d In the bond market, interest rates declined. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.61 percent from 2.65 percent late on Wednesday and is close to its lowest level of the year. The price of the 10-year note rose 9/32, to 101 6/32.

{"Headline": "Deflation Threatens Europe. Policy Makers Wait.", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyEurope is staring into the face of the kind of deflationary cycle that has paralyzed the Japanese economy for the better part of two decades. Prices are rising far more slowly than its central bank wants, against a backdrop of astronomical unemployment on much of the Continent.Mario Draghi\u2019s response: Give us another month.Mr. Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, did everything he could on Thursday to hint, insinuate and flag the possibility that the central bank will unleash some new tools to combat Europe\u2019s drift toward lower prices. Just not now. Check back with us in June, he suggested. Really. Or at least probably.The decision to wait, even as economic risks gather, highlights a pattern of behavior that has become common among central banks over the last few years \u2014 behavior that the banks themselves often come to regret. When faced with evidence that economic growth is weak and inflation too low, bankers have acted slowly and cautiously, often citing the risks of using untested tools and offering projections that better times are just around the corner.But the mistakes the central banks have made since the crisis ended in 2009 have overwhelmingly been the opposite: not of acting too rashly in response to economic weakness, but of moving too slowly and being overly confident that things will turn around without a monetary boost. This pattern of caution is one reason the economies in the United States and Europe remain so weak almost seven years after the financial crisis began.\u201cThere is consensus about being dissatisfied with the projected path of inflation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in a news conference in Brussels on Thursday. In the period from March 2013 to March 2014, prices rose 0.5 percent in the 18 countries using the euro. The central bank\u2019s goal for inflation is slightly under 2 percent. \u201cThere is a consensus in not being resigned to this and accepting this as a fact of nature. Which would lead to having consensus about action, but after having seen the staff projections that will come out in early June.\u201dThis low inflation is dangerous for Europe for a few reasons. It makes the large overhang of debts more onerous; repaying what they owe is harder for consumers, businesses and governments. It is intertwined with a rise in the value of the euro on currency markets, making European exporters less competitive on the global marketplace by increasing their costs relative to competitors in the United States or Asia. And it risks becoming self-fulfilling, as the Japanese know too well, as stagnant or falling prices lead people to hoard cash rather than spend freely.The lowflation, as people have taken to calling it, is particularly dangerous in that it could easily turn into outright deflation, or falling prices, should one nasty shock come along. For example, if tension between Ukraine and Russia boils over into a full-scale war, it could easily tip the European economy back into recession and send prices tumbling.Mr. Draghi gave every sign on Thursday that he agreed with the premise that the combination of low inflation and a strong euro was dangerous. He and his colleagues just want time and more data before doing anything about it.A deliberative, cautious manner is, in general, desirable in a central banker. But what is dangerous about the E.C.B.'s sluggishness in the face of deflation risks is its asymmetry: The risks of too little action may be greater than the risks of too much.Imagine the opposite case. Inflation has been moving higher for two years straight, reaching 3 or 4 percent. There are some signs of the economy slowing, but unemployment is low and growth rates basically healthy.What would the bank do? It would raise interest rates pre-emptively, trying to nip those inflationary pressures in the bud.How do we know that? Because that\u2019s what the central bank did in the summer of 2008. It\u2019s what it did again in the spring of 2011. In both cases, there was high inflation (4 percent in the year ended July 2008, a peak of 3 percent by the fall of 2011). In both cases, a financial catastrophe lurked just round the corner: the global financial crisis in 2008 and the deepening of the euro zone crisis in 2011, and the rate increases were reversed within months.The bank has declined to show the same urgency when deflation and high joblessness are the risks instead.Throughout the last seven years, central banks have moved with speed and creativity when there is an imminent financial crisis: Think Ben Bernanke in the fall of 2008 or Mario Draghi in the summer of 2012, when he pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the Eurozone.But when it has come to the slower-moving, grinding challenge of trying to get the major Western economies on track to avoid a lost decade (or, in the Japanese case, two), they have appeared much readier to let debates stew for months, even as the evidence becomes more and more persuasive that they are undershooting their inflation goals and growth is falling short.This is surely due in part to the fact that the tools they have available are increasingly exotic. The European Central Banks\u2019s target interest rates are already scraping near zero, as they are in each of the biggest central banks, which means they are having to experiment with less tested tools.If Mr. Draghi makes good on his strong suggestion that the bank will act in June, it may find itself joining the other major Western central banks with \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d buying assets on the open market as a way to pump euros into the financial system even with interest rates near zero. It could also shift to a negative interest rate for its key bank deposit rate, the idea being to give banks greater incentive to lend money out rather than park it at the central bank.The uncertainty around these types of policy tools is clearly feeding Mr. Draghi\u2019s go-slow approach. But it is also true that these things aren\u2019t as exotic as they once were. The Fed and the Bank of England have been doing quantitative easing for half a decade, the Bank of Japan for much longer. The Danish and Swedish central banks have dabbled in negative deposit rates.No one expects the central banker in charge of one of the world\u2019s most important currencies to become an impulsive, impetuous radical. But with a clear and pressing economic danger staring Europe in the face, it may not be the worst thing to see Mr. Draghi loosen his tie and display the same urgency he would be likely to show if inflation were too high rather than too low.The Upshot: The Upshot provides news, analysis\nand graphics about politics,\npolicy and everyday life.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaving History Behind in South Africa", "Date": "2014-05-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJOHANNESBURG \u2014 Twenty years have passed since South Africa\u2019s first democratic election, and 24 since Nelson Mandela walked free. Yet last week the ruling African National Congress still used Mr. Mandela\u2019s photo as its symbol on the ballot instead of President Jacob Zuma\u2019s, recognizing that the party\u2019s popularity was being sullied by a president caught in a web of corruption charges.The A.N.C. won with 62 percent, down from over 65 percent in 2009. Despite its gradual slide, the party has repeatedly managed to retain power without the need for coalitions or compromises. A strong A.N.C., free from effective opposition, should have delivered a strong South Africa in line with its policies. But it hasn\u2019t.Indeed, what was missing from all parties were policies. It\u2019s as if political leaders no longer had anything new or imaginative to say or offer.The hitherto white-dominated Democratic Alliance finished second, with 22 percent of the national vote. It devoted a great amount of its resources to breaking out of its Western Cape stronghold and targeted Gauteng Province, which includes the huge metropolis of Johannesburg and neighboring Pretoria. It put money behind its candidate for the premiership of Gauteng, Mmusi Maimane, who is young, handsome and black. Echoing Barack Obama, he asked for a mandate to move beyond history and toward an agenda of technocratic planning for the benefit of all.Mr. Maimane\u2019s was not the only youthful face. Those who deserted the A.N.C. or were expelled clustered around Julius Malema and his populist Economic Freedom Fighters, standing on a platform of radical redistribution. Dali Mpofu, the E.F.F. candidate for premier of Gauteng Province, resembled Mr. Maimane. Both parties recognized the special nature of Gauteng \u2014 a province of first world facilities and third world squalor, all drawn together by a desire for advancement; the poor to be less poor and the rich to be richer.The E.F.F. became the nation\u2019s third-largest party, with 6 percent. And it gained huge leverage over Johannesburg, reducing the A.N.C.\u2019s share of the urban vote to 53 percent. The A.N.C. claims the legacy of history, and that is apparently still enough to carry it to victory. But there was a new generation of voters in this election \u2014 the \u201cborn frees\u201d \u2014 those born after 1994 and voting for the first time. Even though the A.N.C. won, it\u2019s not clear how long it will be before born-frees start to outnumber the made-frees and the fought-frees.The corruption at the heart of the A.N.C., as exemplified by accusations to do with Mr. Zuma\u2019s own palatial homestead in rural Nkandla, will at some point start to alienate its key support base of the urban and rural poor, who will not see rapid improvements in their lives, if any, while the oligarchic lifestyle of senior A.N.C. members becomes ever more visible. Since a two-thirds majority is needed to push through radical constitutional changes, everyone is looking at the A.N.C.\u2019s 62 percent and the E.F.F.\u2019s 6 percent and wondering whether there could be a compromise on the nationalization of land and mining that paves the way for an A.N.C. reunion.But a reunited A.N.C. wouldn\u2019t be a party for the young. It would be the next generation of \u201cold guard,\u201d plus young firebrands, in an uneasy alliance that would be simultaneously conservative and radical, without any logical policy connections between the two.If the D.A. turns to its next generation, led by Mr. Maimane, could the urban gloss and educated glamour of the rebooted party attract the destitute in the rural areas? After all, youngsters in impoverished urban townships see the elite institutions nearby and many of them aspire to go to school and get a university education. Those in the deep rural areas do not; they have nothing tangible to which to aspire.South Africa lacks widespread formal-sector employment, particularly for women without degrees, and, in the absence of future economic opportunity, many such voters cling to the A.N.C. as the embodiment of their hopes from the past. The D.A. has nothing to offer these people. And although they have every right to feel overlooked or betrayed, they have not yet shown it at the ballot box.How Mr. Zuma reconfigures his own front bench will be key to how South Africa is governed over the next five years. Unfortunately, no one thinks he will deploy the young and technocratic in a presidency built on patronage and the deployment of old friends.But in the next election, in 2019, the discourse is much less likely to be about liberation politics and legacy. Mr. Mandela won\u2019t loom as large and may even be subject to ugly re-evaluations of what he did and didn\u2019t achieve. After all, he was not a good president; he was a bridge-builder. Five years from now, Mr. Mandela\u2019s rosy vision of a rainbow nation will be judged against the even larger inequalities that will beset South Africa.The waterfront restaurants of Cape Town and the soaring skyscrapers of Johannesburg may continue to entice foreign tourists and financiers. But South Africa will likely grow more and more like Brazil; the great divisions will not be between black and white, or even old and young, but between the informal and the formal economy. The informal sector offers cheap essential goods to its customers and is growing; it intersects at key points with the formal economy, but also draws close to the lawless and criminal parts of the economy. And as the economic survival strategies of the rich and the poor grow further apart, the political class, in whatever configuration, won\u2019t be able to do anything for the poor, even if it tries.

{"Headline": "After Vote Upset, E.U. Grapples With Filling a Key Post", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 European Union leaders consigned a decision about who should lead the organization\u2019s most important agency to a potentially lengthy and acrimonious selection process on Tuesday, two days after populist upstart parties on the right and left surged in legislative elections.Looming over a dinner here attended by the leaders was the drubbing of mainstream parties in the voting for the European Parliament by groups like the National Front in France and the United Kingdom Independence Party, which are seeking to diminish, or even dismantle, the six-decade effort to integrate the Continent.The victory of the far-right National Front was a \u201ctrauma for France and for Europe\u201d and had \u201ctarnished the image of France,\u201d said President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who spoke at a news conference after the dinner.Many voters worried about \u201ctheir identity in the future\u201d and had turned to the National Front for comfort, Mr. Hollande said. But he insisted that France as a whole was not turning its back on the union.In the wake of the election, the main issues at the dinner, the leaders\u2019 first meeting after the balloting, which ended Sunday, was how to develop future European Union policies in the face of such anti-European results and how soon to choose a new president of the European Commission to replace the departing president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, batted away suggestions that leaders immediately nominate Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, whom she had supported during the campaign and whose center-right party won the election.Ms. Merkel said she had not forgotten Mr. Juncker. But she said European Union leaders had decided to look at a range of candidates for president as part of a process laid out by the union\u2019s treaties as well as to take other issues into account, like placing more women in top jobs and addressing the wishes of all European Union leaders.\u201cWe have not been able to finish this tonight,\u201d she said, adding that the process might last into the summer. After being pressed about whether she still favored Mr. Juncker, Ms. Merkel betrayed uncharacteristic frustration: \u201cTwo days after the election you expect me to have everything solved \u2014 I think that\u2019s probably going too far.\u201dMr. Hollande said at a separate news conference that the discussion among leaders on Tuesday night was about what the commission president should focus on, not about that person\u2019s identity.Mr. Hollande also said his government would push to have the workings of the union\u2019s bureaucracy in Brussels \u201creorientated\u201d and \u201csimplified\u201d to make the 28-nation bloc more comprehensible and appealing to ordinary citizens.The selection of the next head of the commission is a delicate matter for the leaders, marking \u201ca critical moment for the E.U. in terms of signaling how leaders are responding to the rise in populist anti-E.U. sentiment,\u201d said Simon Hix, a professor at the London School of Economics.For the first time, the leading parties in the European Parliament have formally put forward their own candidates for that job.One of those is Mr. Juncker of the center-right European People\u2019s Party, which won 213 seats. Mr. Juncker is expected in the coming days to try to form a majority. The runner-up group in the polls is the center-left Socialists and Democrats group, with 190 seats, whose candidate is the current president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz.\u201cIf you want to respect the new democratic way of choosing commission presidents, you\u2019d pick Juncker, but Juncker looks very much business-as-usual when it comes to responding to growing public opposition to Europe,\u201d Professor Hix said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a very tricky dilemma.\u201dThe commission presidency is a powerful role, and Parliament\u2019s effort to decide the post is a sharp break with the past, when it was assumed that government leaders would assign the top European Union jobs behind closed doors.The president, who will eventually need Parliament\u2019s approval, sets the tone for a body that proposes legislation in a huge range of areas, like workers\u2019 rights and bankers\u2019 bonuses, and represents the bloc jointly with the president of the European Council, which represents European Union leaders, at important international gatherings.Crucially for national governments, the president also plays a major role in allocating portfolios like trade, competition, financial services, monetary affairs and digital policy at the top of the commission\u2019s hierarchy.In her remarks, Ms. Merkel suggested that the next commission adopt a more robust industrial policy, including taking a far more aggressive stance toward American companies like Google to improve the union\u2019s competitiveness.\u201cWe can ask questions as to Google \u2014 that is important with regard to antitrust laws,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cWe can actually, in a way, define the standards in the marketplace\u201d so that Europe \u201ccan actually hold its own in this new world,\u201d she added, identifying the aircraft manufacturer Airbus as among the most successful examples of the ability of Europe to generate successful companies.In some ways, the hesitancy in nominating Mr. Juncker was no surprise.There are deep misgivings, particularly in Britain, about whether Mr. Juncker could deliver the kind of changes to the European Union that would enable Prime Minister David Cameron to persuade voters to keep Britain in the union in a promised national referendum on the issue in 2017.Yet another factor weakening the claim by the European Parliament to name the commission president is that both Mr. Juncker\u2019s group and the Socialist group lost seats in the election to insurgent parties.As in the past, the leaders will probably agree on the nominee by consensus, but that could take time.The outcome of the dinner on Tuesday was for leaders to give Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, a mandate to negotiate with the leaders of the main parties in Parliament to find an acceptable president.Among the center-right alternatives to Mr. Juncker discussed in recent weeks are Jyrki Katainen, the Finnish prime minister; Enda Kenny, the prime minister of Ireland; and Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister. Some diplomats have also suggested that nominating a woman to the post might break a looming deadlock with Parliament. That has generated speculation about the prospects for Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund; Dalia Grybauskaite, the newly re-elected president of Lithuania; and Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Danish prime minister.The process of selecting the commission president is also likely to determine candidates for other top jobs, including replacements for Mr. Van Rompuy, a new chief of European Union foreign policy to replace Catherine Ashton of Britain, and a new head of the so-called Eurogroup of finance and economy ministers from countries that are part of the 18-member currency bloc.But some commentators have emphasized that ignoring the results of the elections by choosing an outside candidate could create further resentment of Brussels.The people have been told that they are voting indirectly for the next commission president, said Corina Stratulat, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cSo how will you be able to justify in the end not going for one of the candidates?\u201d she said. \u201cIf this time, it didn\u2019t lead to what was promised, then why would people engage with it next time?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Plying Social Media, Chinese Workers Grow Bolder in Exerting Clout", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDONGGUAN, China \u2014 The call to action, carried by social media to thousands of smartphones across this bleak factory town, roused the workers from their jobs making Nike and Adidas sneakers.Their Taiwanese employer, Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings, the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of branded athletic shoes, had for years underpaid the social security contributions that employees were counting on for retirement.News of the shortfall, discovered and disseminated by a newly retired worker, stirred familiar resentments. But it was the company\u2019s refusal to make amends that led to one of China\u2019s largest strikes in recent memory, involving 40,000 workers who stayed off assembly lines for two weeks and cost Yue Yuen about $27 million in losses.Last week, after government officials stepped in to resolve the impasse, the company announced it would make up the missing payments and start fully funding worker pensions as required by Chinese law.The proletariat may be a vaunted pillar of Mao\u2019s Communist revolution, but the workaday reality for China\u2019s low-wage army of factory workers long ago eclipsed their hallowed status. On paper, Chinese workers are afforded generous rights and protections, but since the introduction of market reforms in the 1980s, factory owners, many of them multinational companies from Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong, have often set the terms of employment.Independent trade unions are illegal in China, and government-backed unions are more interested in quickly defusing labor disputes than delivering on worker grievances. For years, a seemingly limitless supply of pliable young workers, many of them uneducated migrants from China\u2019s rural hinterland, ensured that the factory owners could dictate wages and work hours.But that power dynamic has begun to shift, fueled in part by increasing opportunities in the country\u2019s expanding service sector and a shrinking work force. The mounting labor shortage has strengthened the hand of Chinese workers, who increasingly demand better work conditions, higher pay and perks like days off.Last year, China\u2019s 269 million migrant workers earned an average of $410 a month, an increase of nearly 14 percent from 2012 and almost twice the growth rate in the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.These gains do not come easily. In recent years, workers across the country have been turning their aspirations into action, staging more than 1,100 strikes and protests between June 2011 and the end of 2013, according to China Labor Bulletin. In a sign that labor unrest is rising, there have been more than 200 strikes, including 85 in the manufacturing sector, in the past two months alone, the group said.Technology is aiding that trend. Better educated than their parents and as nimble on a computer as they are on an assembly line, blue-collar workers have become well versed in labor law, less tolerant of onerous schedules and more willing to share complaints beyond their immediate circle of co-workers.Perhaps most worrisome to Chinese authorities, during the Yue Yuen strike, workers and administrative staff joined together largely without the help of protest leaders, who can be easily neutralized by the police. Employees turned to social media and spread messages faster than censors could stop them. Their most effective weapon was the popular mobile messaging program Weixin, which has nearly 300 million users in China and is also known by its English name, WeChat.\u201cBefore, we were na\u00efve and always getting tricked,\u201d said Xiao Zhixiong, 30, a migrant from China\u2019s central Hunan Province who makes sneaker molds. \u201cNow, we\u2019re learning to be smart.\u201dSprawled along a fetid river that winds through Gaobu township, the No. 3 Yue Yuen complex includes factories, dormitories and a basketball court. Just beyond the gates, fruit vendors and noodle restaurants compete for workers\u2019 hard-earned cash, as does a sleek Footzone shoe store owned by the company. Above its doors, a purple billboard advertising Nike Air Max sneakers is emblazoned with the word \u201cdefy\u201d \u2014 an exhortation that might sound empowering to Western consumers, but is downright subversive in China.On April 14, defy is what tens of thousands of workers did. A month earlier, Yue Yuen employees discovered that the company was calculating pension contributions on their base wages, rather than total incomes that included lucrative overtime. Despite sporadic street protests and entreaties to the government-backed union, the company repeatedly rejected their demands for the unpaid benefits, as well as a pay raise and an improved contract, workers said.\u201cThe factory director told us, \u2018If you\u2019re looking for us to repay, I can tell you it\u2019s not going to happen,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Liu Hai, 52, an assembly line worker who attended a morning meeting of management and a group of employees. \u201cThat afternoon, people just started walking off little by little.\u201dFueled by social media, the trickle became a flood. Huge crowds gathered outside the factory gates, while others just sat idly at their workstations. Mr. Liu, who earns a monthly base wage of $210 after 20 years with the company, was careful not to protest outside, where thousands of police officers stood guard. Though the police interrogated Mr. Liu for his online comments, forcing him to sign a document promising not to cause trouble, he remained defiant. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our rights,\u201d he said recently over a plate of stir-fried pig intestines. \u201cEven if I go to prison I won\u2019t regret it.\u201dWhile Yue Yuen agreed to reimburse pension contributions and increase a monthly living subsidy by $37, the outcome is something of a Pyrrhic victory for its workers. In order to claim the past benefits, employees must pay matching funds, which for many amounts to years of savings they do not have.\u201cWorker wages are barely enough to feed their families now,\u201d said Wang Kongxia, 38, who has worked at Yue Yuen for 19 years. \u201cA lot of people feel quite helpless.\u201dDespite those misgivings, workers say, Chinese authorities and Yue Yuen used subterfuge to force employees back to the assembly lines. According to Ms. Wang, factory management removed the time clocks for four days this week, requiring employees to sign in every two hours or be fired. Supervisors were also asked to photograph each employee. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it,\u201d she said.Yue Yuen did not respond to repeated phone calls requesting comment.Zhen Fanfei, 35, has gone back to making Adidas midsoles, but he doubts the company will be more respectful of workers\u2019 demands without a major change in the government\u2019s attitude. \u201cCapitalists will always be capitalists,\u201d he said.Chen Jiehao contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Home Depot Leads Weak Retail Sector Ahead of Spring Spending Thaw", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA variety of retailers reported disappointing earnings early this week, showing the strain of the slow, uneven economic recovery and weighing on the stock market on Tuesday. Home Depot; the TJX Companies, the parent of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls; and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods all missed earnings expectations.While retailers have been eager to point to the weather to explain some of their first-quarter weakness, analysts have instead focused on the economy and discretionary spending.\u201cIt\u2019s across sectors, across merchandise and across formats,\u201d Craig R. Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail consulting firm, said of the lackluster results.\u201cThe more discretionary you are, the more you\u2019re probably hurting,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if you look up \u2018discretionary spending\u2019 in the dictionary, you see a picture of a department store and an apparel store.\u201dAt Staples, which announced earlier this year that it would close up to 225 stores, total sales were down 2.8 percent for the quarter. Urban Outfitters, which reported earnings on Monday, said that its Free People and Anthropologie brands sold well but that sales at Urban Outfitters stores were down sharply. Last week, Walmart, the country\u2019s largest retailer, said its profit had fallen 5 percent over the same period the year before, and it offered weaker-than-expected predictions for its second quarter.Several other retailers offered weaker earnings forecasts on Tuesday, including Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods.At Home Depot, however, the news was a bit less grim, though still troublesome, and weather appeared to be a more significant factor.For home improvement retailers, spring is the most important selling season of the year, as customers head into the garden or start home improvement projects. But who wants to patch up the roof or plant flowers if the weather is cold or rainy?\u201cOur sales for the quarter were below our expectations,\u201d Frank Blake, Home Depot\u2019s chief executive, said on a call with analysts and investors. \u201cIn 2013, we experienced a delayed spring in the U.S. and Canada, and we expected more normal weather for this spring. Instead, much of the U.S. and Canada had an even colder spring, and this had a significant impact on our sales.\u201dThe company said it saw significant regional differences because of the weather.Executives said that in colder regions \u2014 including New England and the mid-Atlantic \u2014 stores open at least a year, an important metric, reported a drop in sales. In New York and New Jersey, which the company said were also affected by the weather, the performance was especially difficult to compare because sales associated with repairs from Hurricane Sandy pumped about $145 million into the company\u2019s first-quarter sales last year.The sales figures for stores open at least a year in the retailer\u2019s southern and western divisions, where weather was less of a factor, were positive, at almost twice the company\u2019s average for its United States business.Many retailers, including Walmart and Macy\u2019s, have said that when the weather finally turned warmer this spring, sales improved, and Home Depot joined that chorus on Tuesday. Carol B. Tom\u00e9, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said that sales were \u201crobust\u201d in May.Many retailers finished the day on Tuesday with their stock prices down.

{"Headline": "Call of Nature Becomes a Call to Arms in Hong Kong", "Date": "2014-05-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 A mainland couple\u2019s decision to let their child urinate in public last month set off a video-recorded tussle on a street here, igniting a social media uproar that became a proxy battle for a larger question: Is Hong Kong, a former British colony, now being colonized by mainland China, whose visitors increasingly flood the territory with their money and alien manners as Beijing seeks to impose its political control?The video started a cross-border debate over Beijing\u2019s dominance of the territory and Hong Kong\u2019s fealty to its political overlord, and came just as China is considering whether to grant Hong Kong more say over choosing its leaders, with protest groups prepared to act if China does not loosen its grip.Underlying local hostilities toward mainland Chinese are the economic pressures brought by a flood of cash into the territory. Not only are wealthy mainland Chinese accused of driving up real estate values, but their free-spending ways \u2014 encouraged by the absence of sales taxes in Hong Kong and favorable long-term currency valuations \u2014 have been blamed for widespread inflation. The minimum wage here is about $4 an hour, but prices for common household goods approach those found in a New York supermarket.Rachel Cartland, a former Hong Kong official who once oversaw its social welfare system, said local residents have seen their shops increasingly stock higher-priced items geared toward mainland Chinese buyers.\u201cPeople find that the shops they used to go to, the composition has changed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve turned into shops dedicated to mainland Chinese.\u201dShe also likened the antagonism Chinese encounter to that found by American tourists during the post-World War II years in Europe, when America swaggered with political and economic clout, much as China does in Asia today.\u201cAmerica was very dominant politically and economically, and their tourists were often unfairly regarded as \u2018ugly Americans,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said, known for flashy clothes and boorish manners that ignored local customs.The incident involving the child is two weeks old, but the passions surrounding it are not dying down. Last week, a protest against mainlander behavior drew 30 people who mimicked the toddler\u2019s act; social media sites said a counterdemonstration was in the works by people who planned to relieve themselves in the street. Even the prospect of such a protest led to warnings from local officials.\u201cThe law in Hong Kong prohibits anyone from littering or urinating in public,\u201d said Ko Wing-man, the territory\u2019s secretary for food and health. \u201cI am not criticizing any race or nationality. The law and this principle will be implemented fairly.\u201d\u201cThis incident, which should have been over and forgotten, was surprisingly reignited by some Hong Kong radicals,\u201d the piece said. \u201cHumiliating mainlanders must be the only aim these protesters were trying to achieve. But it turns out that who they embarrassed and humiliated was nobody but themselves and all of Hong Kong society. Hong Kong\u2019s image was badly tarnished by them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding a Better Fix for Britain's Housing", "Date": "2014-05-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyThe Achilles\u2019 heel in Britain\u2019s strong economic recovery is the mess in the housing market.House prices are rising yet again \u2014 by 10.9 percent in the year to April, according to Nationwide. This raises the risk of yet another cycle of boom and bust, so much so that the Bank of England recently described rising house prices as the \u201cbrightest light\u201d on its risk dashboard.What is more, there are not nearly enough new homes being built to cope with the soaring number of new households. Rising divorce rates, people living alone in old age and immigration are the main factors behind that.True, house building is on the rise. In the year that ended with March, work began on 134,000 new houses \u2014 a 31 percent increase from the previous year, according to official figures. But the number of households is growing about twice as fast.The high cost and low availability of housing are already causing political trouble. It is one of the arguments used by the UK Independence Party, which is expected to do well in the European Parliament elections this week, for pulling out of the European Union and controlling immigration.The housing mess is also prompting Britain\u2019s mainstream political parties to come up with foolish policies. The Conservative-led government\u2019s flagship program, Help to Buy, helps people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise have a big enough deposit to buy a home. Its main effect will be to increase demand further, thus pushing up prices, rather than increasing the supply of homes.Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party has promised to institute a type of rent control if it comes to power. That sounds nice for tenants. But it too would rig the market, deterring landlords from building new homes to rent.A better solution is not to distort the housing market but to remove existing distortions so it operates more freely.At the top of the list is freeing up the planning system, so that it is easier to build homes on both greenfield sites and so-called brownfield ones (former factories and the like). The current system artificially restricts the pace at which housing can be built, inflating prices and giving home builders an incentive to sit on their undeveloped land, knowing that prices will just keep rising.London and the southeast of England are crowded. So it is understandable that people there do not want lots of new homes to be built on the patches of greenery that remain. But a better balance between the need for green space and the need for new homes needs to be struck.The tax system also needs reforming. At present, housing is undertaxed compared with other assets. No capital gains tax is paid on first homes. Nor is the \u201cimputed income\u201d people get from living in their own homes \u2014 essentially their not having to pay rent \u2014 taxed. And the two housing taxes Britain does have, stamp duty and council tax, both have defects.Stamp duty is a transactions tax, which rises to 7 percent for properties over 2 million pounds, or about $3.4 million. It therefore gums up the top end of the market, giving people a reason to pause before selling.Meanwhile, the council tax is a highly regressive charge imposed by local authorities. Take Kensington and Chelsea, in central London. Residents living in the borough\u2019s most expensive properties, worth over \u00a3100 million, pay \u00a32,134 a year \u2014 only three times as much what residents in the cheapest property pay.The Labour Party has promised to impose an extra charge, a \u201cmansion tax,\u201d on properties worth more than \u00a32 million. While that would be a step in the right direction, a better solution would be simply to change the council tax to make it proportionate to the value of people\u2019s homes, with no cap at the top.The main effect of such a change would be in London and southeast England, where there is the biggest shortage of homes. People would think twice about whether they needed such big houses. In particular, old people, who no longer had big families, would have a strong incentive to move to smaller homes, releasing more big homes onto the market.Another change that would help the overheated London housing market would be to change the way \u201cnon-doms\u201d are taxed. Non-doms are people who are not domiciled in Britain but who are still living there. If they make an annual payment of \u00a350,000, they can avoid paying tax on their foreign income. While this is a large sum for most non-doms, it is a pinprick for London\u2019s multimillionaires and billionaires.An alternative, fairer plan would be to charge non-doms who do not want to pay tax on foreign income a flat percentage, say 2 percent a year, of the value of their homes in Britain. That would not just raise money; it might take some of the heat out of the top end of the market.If freeing up planning and rejiggering the tax system are the main ways of increasing housing supply, two things still need to be done to restrain the demand. The government should scrap its Help to Buy scheme; and the Bank of England should ask for the right to cap the size of mortgages relative to the value of a property.None of these measures would be popular. But failure to act will cause much more damage in the long term.Advertisement"}

Analysts said it also seemed to show that voters were willing to reward established parties that initiate changes themselves, without the prodding of the political extremes.\u201cItaly was the country where anything could have happened, instead it became the place that sent a most surprising message of hope,\u201d Mr. Renzi told reporters at a news conference in Rome on Monday. Italy would work from this mandate, he said, to \u201cchange the setup of Europe and the approach that Europe has had all these years.\u201dThe choices that the European Union will have to make after the elections do not depend on nationalities, he said, but on a shared vision of Europe. \u201cWe have greater ambitions, we want to lower the tones and raise ambitions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to help Europe change.\u201dThe shared vision should be a middle ground between the \u201crestoration\u201d of an idea of Europe \u201cthat has not worked, that has failed,\u201d and populism, he continued.Actually, European issues had often receded into the background during the hard-fought campaign in Italy that tested the staying power of the coalition government against that of emerging parties, like the Five Star Movement of Mr. Grillo and the conservative forces of Mr. Berlusconi.Analysts like Roberto D\u2019Alimonte, who teaches Italian politics at the Guido Carli Free International University for Social Studies in Rome, saw the vote as a mandate for Mr. Renzi to push through the political and economic changes he has promised since he took power in February.The vote \u201cis a message to go ahead, do what you promised to do, bring about change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a vote for change, not the kind of change that Grillo advocated \u2014 wiping the slate clean \u2014 not radical change, but change.\u201dMr. Renzi quickly rose to the fore of Italian politics by pledging to enact far-reaching changes that aim to lift the economy and renovate the country\u2019s sclerotic political and bureaucratic structures. \u201cPeople believe in what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Alimonte said. \u201cThey\u2019re giving him a line of credit. They\u2019ve perceived that there is widespread resistance to the kind of change he has promised, and they\u2019re saying \u2018we\u2019re behind you.'\u2009\u201dMr. Renzi signaled Monday that the message had been received.\u201cWe know this vote is for an Italy that wants to change,\u201d he said, and the result \u201chas removed all alibis\u201d for those in power.He continued: \u201cThere is no room to put off reforms, be they institutional, constitutional, electoral, or dealing with labor, public administration, justice or taxes.\u201dVoter turnout in Italy was 58.7 percent, eight percentage points lower than in the last European elections, when voting was held over two days, but still higher than expected.The center-left had a strong showing in many local elections, too. With votes still being counted, it was leading in regional elections in Piedmont and Abruzzo, taking the lead in more than a dozen municipal elections, and had won some cities \u2014 including Florence and Modena \u2014 outright.Nevertheless, Mr. Berlusconi wrote on his Facebook page on Monday that Forza Italia remained \u201cthe irreplaceable keystone of the center-right, the axis around which to reconstruct a coalition\u201d for the next elections. He acknowledged, however, that his party \u201chad a result inferior to my expectations.\u201dThe other big loser was Mr. Grillo, who had said repeatedly during the campaign that he would step down if the Five Star Movement did not do better than in national elections last year, when it received 25 percent of the vote. It received just over 21 percent of the vote on Sunday.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a defeat, we went beyond defeat,\u201d Mr. Grillo said in a video posted on his website. But the Five Star Movement, he said, remained the chief opposition party and the second party in the country.Anti-European sentiment did not find a firm hold among those who voted, though the Northern League, the anti-immigrant party that put anti-Europeanism at the core of its campaign, received 6.2 percent of the vote. It was a better result than expected given recent scandals within the party.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, at one point, the surname of the leader of the Five Star Movement. He is Beppe Grillo, not Mr. Beppo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Local Policies Help an Indian Candidate Trying to Go National", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy in the state of Gujarat has grown 10 percent a year for much of the last decade, higher than the Indian average. Narendra Modi, the state leader and the front-runner for prime minister, is promising the country an economic jump start, pointing to his record in Gujarat as proof that he can deliver.AHMEDABAD, India \u2014 To anyone familiar with the quagmire that typically engulfs large building projects in India, the reconstruction of the Sabarmati riverfront \u2014 championed for the last decade by Narendra Modi, the leader here in the state of Gujarat \u2014 is a startling sight.Slum neighborhoods have been bulldozed off the riverbank, leaving behind vacant land to be sold to developers. A broad, modernist concrete promenade extends in either direction. And the seasonal droughts that left the Sabarmati dry for much of the year? Those, too, have been taken care of, by rerouting torrents of water from a nearby canal.To admirers of Mr. Modi, currently the front-runner in the race for prime minister, few things recommend him more than his ability to push through the projects he supports, brushing aside the political and regulatory blockages that stall infrastructure improvements and factory construction in other parts of India.To a country that once flirted with growth rates that rivaled China\u2019s but has slipped into the doldrums, Mr. Modi is promising an economic jump start, pointing to his record in Gujarat as proof that he can deliver. Gujarat\u2019s economy has grown 10 percent a year, higher than the Indian average, for much of the last decade.But an examination of some of Mr. Modi\u2019s methods in Gujarat suggests that his successes owe much to his personal power, which is amplified by a federal system that puts land use in the hands of state leaders rather than the prime minister. Among his projects are some that show little understanding of market conditions, relying heavily on government allocations. And some in Gujarat question whether his penchant for grand, earth-moving building projects makes sense when the state is still struggling with social problems like infant mortality and malnutrition.A story often told to illustrate the so-called Gujarat Model dates to 2008, when Tata Motors, the Indian automaker, ran into trouble in the state of West Bengal. Tata had bought land to produce its new low-cost car, the Nano, but farmers were protesting, claiming that they had been underpaid or forced from their land. Exasperated by two years of mounting resistance, Tata announced that it was pulling out of West Bengal.Within a few hours, Mr. Modi sent a text message to Ratan Tata, the company\u2019s president. It consisted of one sentence, Mr. Modi later told an interviewer: \u201cWelcome to Gujarat.\u201dGujarat transferred land to the company within a few days. The plot was mostly on unused government property, so it was not as miraculous as it might have seemed, but it sent a powerful message. Over the next several years, Ford, Peugeot and Maruti Suzuki followed suit with their own plans to build factories in Gujarat. Mr. Modi began to market speedy land acquisition \u2014 \u201cno red tape, only red carpet,\u201d as he put it \u2014 to investors as one of his state\u2019s selling points.Reams of academic work, positive and negative, have been devoted to defining Mr. Modi\u2019s recipe for development, but experts say he has not made substantial changes to laws governing land use. Much of it boils down to personal control over a bureaucratic system notorious for delays and corruption.Arvind Panagariya, a Columbia University professor whom Mr. Modi may choose as his chief economic adviser if he becomes prime minister, said Mr. Modi \u201ccertainly, on any of the major projects, gets involved and sees to it that the necessary permissions get granted.\u201d He described one occasion in which an applicant jumped the line for project clearances, presumably by paying someone off, and reached Mr. Modi directly.\u201cHe said, \u2018I will clear your project, but only if I know how you got here,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dr. Panagariya said. Once the applicant told Mr. Modi who had helped him, \u201che goes back and punishes the person who tried to mess up the system.\u201dCritics say that concentrated power has created problems as well, allowing Mr. Modi\u2019s less sound ideas to go unchallenged.One case study can be found around seven miles from the airport in Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat, where two modern office buildings stand in the middle of a dry, empty field. This is GIFT City, short for Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, intended as an international finance center. The project was introduced to fanfare in 2007, after Mr. Modi was inspired on a visit to Shanghai.The initial plans, drawn up by a Chinese design institute, were grandiose, calling for the simultaneous construction of 125 glassy skyscrapers, the highest reaching 1,000 feet, with underground roadways and midair pedestrian bridges.But the plan ignored market conditions. R. K. Jha, director of the project since 2010, said it needed to be radically scaled down, and reduced the first phase of construction to two 29-story office buildings, the tallest structures in Gujarat. So far, there are only four tenants, including the state electricity commission and the development company behind the project.Last year, Mr. Modi oversaw the drafting of a new city plan by the Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority. Reminded that land should be set aside for low-income housing, Mr. Modi suggested creating a belt for that purpose around the city\u2019s periphery, near its ring road, two people familiar with the plan said.The flaws in the idea were apparent to planners \u2014 the city\u2019s poor would be forced to commute great distances to their jobs, and private developers would be reluctant to build there \u2014 but those who were present kept their reservations to themselves, and the belt was added. \u201cThe problem is that his style of operation is to put the fear of God into people, so he does not even hear the truth,\u201d said a person who has observed Mr. Modi\u2019s management at close range, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Mr. Modi was deeply impressed, after becoming leader of Gujarat, by visits to the manufacturing economies of Southeast Asia. Goh Chok Tong, the former prime minister of Singapore, has been described as one of his mentors.In Gujarat, Mr. Modi has resisted the notion of subsidies, rolling out policies that would pass the Margaret Thatcher test. He built gates and imposed entry fees for one of Ahmedabad\u2019s most popular parks, in an effort to prove that the poor would be willing to pay for superior products. He introduced a health insurance system for the poor, hoping to steer them toward private hospitals instead of public clinics.Economic advisers hope he will go further along this free-market road by privatizing major state firms and scaling back national welfare programs, though they acknowledge that those moves would almost certainly meet with resistance.\u201cThis is a country where, for most people, Barack Obama is a right-wing economic thinker,\u201d said Ashok Malik, a columnist who supports Mr. Modi. The candidate, he added, \u201cis not Milton Friedman, but he is as right as one can get in the Indian political class. He is selling this as a manufacturing economy, that we should make things in India. He would say, \u2018Jobs, jobs, jobs.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAlready during the campaign, Mr. Modi, the candidate of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, has come under heavy criticism from the ruling Indian National Congress party for the incentives he has offered in an effort to attract manufacturers. Gujarat has had impressive growth over the last decade, and its roads, electricity and water services are excellent. But critics argue that Gujarat had performed well on these measures for many years before Mr. Modi took office, and note that the state still lags on social indicators, in particular infant mortality and child malnutrition. Gyanshyam Shah, a political scientist in Ahmedabad, said those shortfalls reflected the priority Mr. Modi put on the middle class. So, he said, does the Sabarmati riverfront project, which displaced around 10,000 poor families.\u201cThese projects are meant for the middle class,\u201d Mr. Shah said. \u201cThose who are living on the bank of the river and working as laborers in various sectors, they are pushed behind, far behind.\u201dThere are also serious questions about whether Mr. Modi can replicate at a national level the success he has had bringing manufacturing to Gujarat, a state with the advantages of a long coastline and expanses of vacant land. India\u2019s federal system makes land use a state issue. Mr. Modi\u2019s advisers hope he will find ways to wield influence from the center, perhaps by creating a \u201cunion government\u201d that includes state leaders to oversee projects. But it will be hard to use his Gujarat model in New Delhi, they admit.\u201cThere is a much more entrenched bureaucracy at the national level, and there\u2019s going to be much more stiff resistance,\u201d said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cTrying to limit red tape \u2014 that immediately cuts at the purse strings that politicians have access to. So this is a very tricky issue for him.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Twists in Turning Hot Air Into Horsepower", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTechnologyIn the half-century since it first appeared under the hood of production cars, the turbocharger has gone from a silver-bullet amplifier of horsepower to a device so widely used it seems on its way to becoming a fixture of every new model. In truth, the old dog has learned impressive new tricks, schooled in part by 2014 rules changes in Formula One racing that mandate smaller, less thirsty engines. In its new job description, the turbocharger is also a producer of electrical power for potent hybrid systems. The basics have not changed: Turbochargers still harvest the energy of the hot exhaust stream to pump air into the engine under pressure, increasing horsepower. For everyday use, this technology lets carmakers install downsized, highly efficient engines that can still produce the power required for highway driving. There are limits to how far the technology can be pushed. In Formula One racing, where turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 engines are used in place of the naturally aspirated 2.4-liter V8s of recent years, those limits also prove to be opportunities. Because an engine can stand only so much pressure in its cylinders, and because a turbocharger should spin only so fast to assure reliability, engine designers add a valve that can open to dump some of the exhaust gases before they reach the turbine section of the turbocharger. This device, called a waste gate, is a necessary sacrifice, throwing away some of the combustion heat in trade for engine longevity.Grand prix cars in the Class of 2014 effectively double-dip by using the turbo shaft to also turn a motor-generator unit. The obvious benefit is generating electricity for the racecar\u2019s hybrid drive system \u2014 good for a maximum of 160 horsepower under the new rules \u2014 but there\u2019s more to it. The generator\u2019s output can be dialed up as engine speed rises, and the increased load limits the turbocharger pressure, a more efficient solution than using a waste gate. It gets better still: The unit can shift functions to become a motor, spinning the turbo in, say, a low-speed corner, to make sure boost pressure is instantly available when the driver floors the gas for the straightaway. The lag that plagued early turbo engines becomes a distant memory.All this, and the cars will complete each race consuming about one-third less fuel than they did last year.Automakers are not saying exactly when this technology may reach family cars, but the notion of racing improving the breed is not lost on participants like Mercedes-Benz, Renault, Ferrari (owned by Fiat) and, starting next season, Honda. Work is well underway to bring some of the principles to mass-production cars.The V6 hybrid systems that power the Formula One field \u2014 now called power units instead of engines \u2014 may be on the leading edge of development, but the concept of driving a generator from a turbine is at least 130 years old. Turbo-generators were first used on a large scale in the 1880s to generate electricity from water power or steam, and they saw widespread use on railroad locomotives for heat and lighting. Formula One\u2019s path to greater efficiency employs a turbo-generator, known as the MGU-H or motor generator-heat, and a motor generator-kinetic, or MGK-K, which recovers kinetic energy from braking. Together, the systems deliver twice the power of the energy-recovery system called KERS that was used before 2014. This year\u2019s electric one-two punch brings the output of the V6 engines back to the level of last year\u2019s V8s, the teams say.The MGU-H is essentially an electric motor connected to the turbocharger\u2019s impeller shaft. As engine r.p.m. rises, and the hot exhaust gases spin the turbo up to its 100,000-r.p.m. peak, this motor can operate as a generator, converting heat energy from the exhaust gas into electricity. That electrical energy is then sent directly to the MGU-K to provide a burst of acceleration, according to demand, or to the lithium-ion battery pack for use later. \u201cThe new Formula One energy-recovery systems go hand-in-hand with the direction of the automotive industry, particularly as it applies to the U.S. market,\u201d said Mark Christie, vice president for engine engineering at Ricardo, an engineering consultancy in suburban Detroit. Combining electric motors with turbochargers, superchargers or both, is a promising solution for road cars. As in the racecars, using an electric motor to drive a turbo or supercharger makes it possible to build pressure quickly so the engine can produce high levels of torque even at low r.p.m. Without electric muscle, devices that increase power by pumping air have inherent performance limitations, Mr. Christie explained, because of the wait for pressure to build as engine r.p.m. increases and brings the internal components up to speed.One workaround is to use smaller turbos, which have less low-speed lag because they spool up more quickly, but they can quickly run out of breath. A supercharger driven by the engine is excellent for delivering air at low speeds, but its efficiency diminishes at high r.p.m. \u201cTraditional boosting devices present a balancing act \u2014 how to ensure good low-to-high speed transient response while still being able to meet the power target,\u201d Mr. Christie said. Among the possible solutions are compound systems like the Volkswagen TwinCharger and Volvo Drive-E. Such arrangements use a conventional belt-driven supercharger at lower speeds and shift over to a turbo for higher r.p.m. operation. Ricardo chose to use a compound design in its recently unveiled HyBoost concept engine, but with an electric twist. HyBoost pairs an electrically driven supercharger with the conventional turbocharger. Accelerating from low speeds, the electric supercharger kicks in briefly to force additional air into the turbo\u2019s compressor section to eliminate lag. Electricity for the motor comes from a 12-volt starter-generator. Tailoring the turbo or supercharger to the electrical power on board the vehicle is one of the challenges, according to Dan Ouwenga, an engineering manager at Eaton, a supercharger manufacturer.\u201cThe major limitation is related to how much electric energy is required versus how much air flow you need from the supercharger,\u201d he said. Eaton\u2019s solution is being evaluated by automakers. It uses a 12- or 48-volt electric-assist and a variable-speed supercharger that is pressed into service according to load and demand. In this system, gears are engaged to link the electric motor with the supercharger under certain load conditions, reducing the losses that occur when the supercharger is continuously driven by the crankshaft. The motor uses electrical energy recovered during braking and coasting. \u201cWe designed the system to maximize the benefit of boosting, being aware that we might be limited to about two kilowatts of electrical energy on many vehicles,\u201d said Mr. Ouwenga, noting that typical supercharger systems can require 10 times that amount to supply air to the engine. Tests on a 1.4-liter engine have shown up to 17 percent better fuel economy than with a comparable 2.4-liter mild hybrid, he said.BMW is also developing an electric boosting system, rumored to be for the next-generation M3, that uses an electric motor positioned between the turbocharger\u2019s turbine and compressor. Volkswagen is preparing to introduce a family of electrically driven turbos for gasoline and diesel engines. Depending on engine displacement and turbocharger size, either a 12-volt or 48-volt electric motor will be used, Heinz-Jakob Neusser, VW\u2019s chief powertrain engineer, said.Advertisement"}

Mr. Polsky, who turned 35 on May 3, is the junior member of this odd couple, but as the newly lauded director of one of the festival\u2019s most pleasurable surprises, he\u2019s doing fine.

At around the same time, he received a call from someone at Wild Bunch, a powerful French sales company, who had seen a promotional trailer. Soon after, Wild Bunch snapped up \u201cRed Army\u201d and Cannes extended its life-changing invitation. \u201cThere was no chance,\u201d Mr. Polsky said. But here he was. \u201cRed Army\u201d is one of a handful of titles that, with the festival less than midway through, are keeping the critics from grumbling too loudly.

It\u2019s hard to believe that the jury for the section Un Certain Regard will warm to Keren Yedaya\u2019s \u201cThat Lovely Girl,\u201d a badly directed, profoundly wrongheaded movie about an Israeli woman in her early 20s who, besides being in an incestuous relationship with her father, is a bulimic and cuts herself. It\u2019s unfathomable how this mess was selected other than to fill a gender or national diversity slot. The lapidary technique and grave intelligence of \u201cWinter Sleep,\u201d from the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, has unsurprisingly made it an early contender for the Palme d\u2019Or. Mr. Ceylan, a familiar presence at Cannes with titles like \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Anatolia,\u201d has slowed down his already leisurely pacing for \u201cWinter Sleep,\u201d which takes place in the eerily beautiful Cappadocia, in Central Anatolia. There, dwarfed by fantastic rock formations, an arrogant landlord and hotelier writes newspaper columns, primarily on the flaws of others. Mostly, he engages in Chekhovian talkathons that echo \u2014 sometimes with pinprick delicacy and, at other times, with needless overstatement \u2014 the carefully choreographed happenings affecting the story\u2019s rich and poor, its men and women. Mr. Ceylan\u2019s movie is likely to make its way onto American screens despite the challenges presented by its 3-hour-and-16-minute running time.

This often cruelly funny Argentine movie, directed by Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n with more than a few nods to O. Henry, stitches together a series of tidy morality tales that begins with a spectacular crash and ends with a crackup. Equally pleasurable, if at a deeper, more perverse register, is \u201cThe Blue Room,\u201d the latest from the actor and director Mathieu Amalric.

{"Headline": "Merkel and Hollande Send Russia a Warning", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTRALSUND, Germany \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel invites only the most select of visitors to this pretty Baltic Sea port, the center of her parliamentary constituency and a rich symbol of Germany\u2019s centuries of trade with Russia and the country\u2019s revival after the fall of the Berlin Wall almost 25 years ago.So the invitation extended to President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, who came for a brief visit that ended Saturday, was clearly intended to underscore the Franco-German alliance, the traditional motor of European unity, which has sputtered recently as its two members become ever more unequal.Above all, the leaders agreed, Ukraine\u2019s presidential election on May 25 must be allowed to proceed freely and fairly, including in southeastern Ukraine, where armed separatists and pro-Ukrainian forces are locked in violence that has claimed scores of lives in the past two weeks. As a step toward calming tensions, nonmilitary combatants should turn in weapons starting Thursday, said Ms. Merkel, a conservative, and Mr. Hollande, a Socialist. The statement did not explain how Europeans sent to observe and monitor the election could carry out that task.Mr. Putin \u201cmust send more signals of de-escalation, to allow the elections to happen,\u201d Ms. Merkel told reporters at a joint news conference. \u201cEverything else would lead to more steps on the sanctions path.\u201dThe camaraderie on display during a boat ride and sightseeing trip on Friday and a stroll on Saturday around the center of Stralsund symbolized both the strengths of European unity and the Continent\u2019s troubles.Differences between the two countries\u2019 economies are part of the problem. Germany\u2019s economic success is the envy of other Europeans, but Mr. Hollande has proved unable to reduce unemployment or spur meaningful growth in France.The two countries are undergoing \u201ca divorce of situation,\u201d said Dominique Mo\u00efsi of the French Institute of International Relations in Paris. Germany is successful and at ease with itself, while France is uncertain. \u201cThe big thing needed for Franco-German relations to work again is that France should feel more confident,\u201d he said.Senior officials from both sides painted a picture of harmony and assured reporters that the two leaders relished chatting at length about Ukraine and what happens to Europe after another May 25 election, the vote for the next European Parliament.That vote was not mentioned once by Germans interviewed during Mr. Hollande\u2019s visit \u2014 suggesting that many of the Continent\u2019s 380 million eligible voters feel distant from European governance in Brussels, and are likely to skip the election.In contrast to their seeming indifference to the European elections, some residents of Stralsund held strong views that Germany should stay out of the crisis in Ukraine.Stralsund was in Communist East Germany, where Ms. Merkel grew up and worked as a scientist until entering politics as the country was reuniting.Opinion polls in Germany have indicated that residents of the former East Germany are more inclined than those in the western part of the country to endorse the view that Mr. Putin is merely protecting Russia\u2019s interests in Ukraine, above all against what he calls NATO encroachment on Russia\u2019s western borders.As is sometimes the case in the former East \u2014 whether out of general German reserve about expressing a contrary view, or memories of Communist rule \u2014 none of those who said Germany should stay out of the crisis would give their names.\u201cUkraine should get on with its own affairs,\u201d said one man, a retired 63-year-old sailor.J\u00f6rg Orlowski, 52, who runs a business fitting kitchens, was more supportive of Ms. Merkel and the gains of the post-Communist era. But he and his wife, Katrin, 48, also hesitated when considering the risks posed by the Ukraine crisis. \u201cNot even the Russians know what will happen there,\u201d she said.Most stressed the gains of reunification. Without funds from the West, and hard work to save buildings that were crumbling under communism, \u201cStralsund would have completely collapsed,\u201d said Sylvia Hoff-Lorenz, 48, an office worker.Stralsund owes its architectural beauty to the Hanseatic League, the German-dominated alliance of mostly Baltic port cities that first traded Russian raw materials for German finished goods centuries ago.The modern version of that trade is Russian energy for German engineering, which nurtures a dependence on Russian natural gas in Germany and in other former Soviet bloc countries now in the European Union.In a reflection of how much the Ukraine crisis may change Europe, Poland recently proposed a European energy union that would wean Europeans off Russian gas and involve coal, nuclear and other measures to restructure energy supplies.European leaders have resisted such proposals for decades. But Mr. Hollande and Ms. Merkel both said they were now prepared to contemplate a European energy union.In general, Mr. Hollande noted, France is very positive about increased cooperation with Germany and Poland, the sizable neighbor to Germany\u2019s east. \u201cWe are in perfect coherence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what makes Europe strong is its unity.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The April result supports the view that the economy stands to benefit in the coming months from increased production at factories, which should bolster growth and spur further hiring.Buttressing that view on Tuesday, the Conference Board said that its consumer confidence index rose to 83, from a revised 81.7 in April. That is the second-highest reading since January 2008, just after the recession began. Only March was higher at 83.9.The increase is \u201cenough to suggest decent, but not spectacular, gains in consumers\u2019 spending,\u201d Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients.Orders for core capital goods, a category viewed as a proxy for business investment plans, fell 1.2 percent in April. It was the weakest showing since a 1.9 percent drop in January.A harsh winter dragged overall economic growth to a barely discernible 0.1 percent in the January-March quarter. That figure will be updated on Thursday, and many economists say it could slip into negative territory.But economists were encouraged by the moderate increase in April orders, which was better than the decline they had been forecasting. They also took heart from solid upward revisions that showed more strength in March than previously believed.\u201cWe would expect to see capital goods orders and shipments continuing to trend upwards,\u201d Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \u201cSecond-quarter growth in equipment investment should be notably better.\u201dConsumer confidence has climbed steadily since it bottomed out at 25.3 in February 2009. It sits significantly above last year\u2019s average of 72.3, but it still has not returned to healthy levels. The figure regularly topped 90 before the recession.Over all, Americans are much more bullish about the job market, the Conference Board\u2019s survey showed. That is a good sign that hiring may have been healthy this month. The government will report May\u2019s jobs figures on June 6.The number of Americans who consider jobs easier to find rose to a six-year high. And 15.4 percent of consumers expect hiring to pick up in the next six months, up from 14.7 percent in April.The survey also showed that nearly one-fifth of Americans expect their incomes to grow over the next six months, the highest level since December 2007. The 1.2 drop in demand for core capital goods, a category that covers nondefense equipment excluding aircraft, followed a 4.7 percent surge in March. Analysts expect business investment will rebound in coming months.However, there is concern that slower growth in China, the world\u2019s second largest economy behind that of the United States, could damp demand for exports in coming months. China\u2019s manufacturing sector barely grew in April, according to Chinese government statistics. A private survey found that Chinese factories actually had production fall in April for a fourth straight month. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Spanish Riots, Anguish of Those Recovery Forgot", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBARCELONA, Spain \u2014 Four nights of rioting here in Spain\u2019s tourism capital have highlighted the country\u2019s persistent social tensions and belied signs of relief from a fragile economic recovery, which has yet to alleviate rampant joblessness.The rioting started on Monday when Barcelona\u2019s City Hall ordered the eviction of squatters from Can Vies, a warehouse abandoned by the city\u2019s transport authority. The site, in the Sants district, was taken over by squatters 17 years ago and turned into a makeshift social center. City officials said they wanted to reclaim the site for a park.After attempts to clear the site, protesters threw stones, barricaded streets, smashed bank and shop windows, and set fire to garbage containers and a television van. The rioting has since spread to other parts of the city, and police officers have arrested scores of people.On Friday, City Hall backed down and said in a statement that plans for the demolition of the site would be halted to help \u201cfavor a climate of dialogue.\u201d The squatters nonetheless pledged to continue their protests and to rebuild the half-destroyed center over the weekend.Joan Maria Sol\u00e9, deputy director of the Federation of Neighborhood Associations of Barcelona, said the attempt to replace the Can Vies building with \u201ca hypothetical park or green area\u201d showed that City Hall was insensitive to the widening income gap among residents.Since hosting the Olympic Games in 1992, Barcelona has become one of Europe\u2019s biggest tourism hubs, with a record 7.5 million visitors last year. The rise in tourism has helped Barcelona weather the economic crisis that hit Spain in 2008 better than many cities. Over all, the city of Barcelona\u2019s unemployment rate is nearly 18 percent, roughly 8 percentage points lower than the national average, although there are big discrepancies between the city\u2019s poorest and richest neighborhoods. \u201cBarcelona is full of contradictions, especially between those who are now unemployed and those who are just focused on earning even more from tourism,\u201d Mr. Sol\u00e9 said. Can Vies, he added, \u201cis unfortunately a more realistic image of Barcelona than the brand City Hall tries to sell.\u201dMr. Sol\u00e9 described Can Vies as \u201csomething of a symbol for the deprived.\u201d As in Burgos, he added, \u201cit is the kind of spark that can set ablaze a fire that has long been simmering.\u201dJoan Carles Gallego, the head of the Catalan branch of the Workers\u2019 Commissions, one of the two main trade unions in Spain, said the fighting over Can Vies reflected growing frustration in Barcelona as investors flock back to Spain but unemployment remains nearly 26 percent. Youth unemployment is roughly double that. \u201cThe message is that our economy is recovering, but most people aren\u2019t feeling that recovery,\u201d Mr. Gallego said. In the coming months, he warned, \u201cthe social conflict could get more radical because people won\u2019t want to be left further behind.\u201dAlfredo Pastor, an economics professor at the IESE business school in Barcelona, said that \u201cfrom an outsider\u2019s perspective, the question might be how this has not happened more in a country of 26 percent unemployment.\u201d The problem for Spain, he said, is that \u201cunemployment is likely to be the last part of our economy to recover.\u201dThree years ago, a youth-led movement took over Puerta del Sol in downtown Madrid, in a giant protest against Spain\u2019s establishment that was a precursor to Occupy Wall Street and similar movements.Advertisement"}

The first quarter recorded a contraction of 0.6 percent from a year earlier.The agency, the National Economic and Social Development Board, lowered its G.D.P. growth forecast for the year to 1.5 to 2.5 percent, from 3 to 4 percent.The outlook for the April-to-June quarter and beyond is grim, analysts say.\u201cChances are, we are going to see another technical recession in the economy, given that the second-quarter G.D.P. number is likely to be rather poor as well,\u201d said Gundy Cahyadi, an economist with DBS Bank in Singapore.\u201cThe longer the economy is without a functioning government, the more the drag to economic growth,\u201d he added.Consumer confidence is at a 12-year low, tourists are staying away from Bangkok and public spending has been delayed. Many parts of the economy are feeling the pinch, even the property sector, which proved resilient during previous bouts of unrest.\u201cIf the political crisis drags on until the end of this year, the overall sector could see a contraction of as much as 10 percent,\u201d Rutt Phanijphand, chief executive of the home builder Quality Houses, said last week.The planning agency revised the figure for fourth-quarter growth to 0.1 percent from the previous three months from 0.6 percent. It left year-on-year growth for the October-December quarter at 0.6 percent.Thailand, the second-biggest economy in Southeast Asia, is the only one in the region that is contracting. Malaysia reported annual growth of 6.1 percent in the first quarter, while Indonesia, the largest regional economy, this month announced its slowest growth in years, although its annualized growth in the January-March quarter was still 5.2 percent.Given the lack of a functioning government and the worsening economy, there may be increasing pressure on the central bank to cut its benchmark rate at its June 18 policy meeting. In April, it left the rate unchanged at 2 percent.\u201cThe weaker-than-expected G.D.P. data will put the spotlight back on the Bank of Thailand,\u201d said Benjamin Shatil, an economist with J. P. Morgan in Singapore. \u201cBut when domestic activity is being weighed down by falling sentiment amid an uncertain political environment, there is only limited support that monetary policy can provide to the economy.\u201dThe political turmoil is also hurting Thailand\u2019s big auto sector, which accounts for 11 percent of G.D.P. and is the largest in Southeast Asia. Domestic car sales are falling and about 30,000 industry jobs have been lost his year.Thai Airways last week reported a quarterly loss and expects further losses in the second and third quarters. \u201cWe have been severely affected by the politics,\u201d said its chairman, Prajin Juntong.Tourism accounts for about 10 percent of G.D.P., and the number of visitors dropped about 5 percent in the January to April from a year earlier.This month, the Tourism Authority of Thailand cut its forecast for 2014 tourist arrivals to 26.3 million, the lowest number in five years, from 28 million.Pornthip Hirunkate, vice president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, said political unrest had probably contributed to the loss of about 100 billion baht, or $3 billion, in tourism revenue so far.More than 60 percent of Thai G.D.P. comes from exports, and some analysts expect these to start to pick up along with a global recovery. So far, the political unrest has been largely contained to Bangkok and has not disrupted ports and factories.But the state planning agency on Monday cut its projection for export growth this year to 3.7 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 5 to 7 percent.\u201cThe unrest has had a minimal impact on shipments, and most exporters are still confident about business,\u201d said Nopporn Thepsitthar, chairman of the National Shippers\u2019 Council. He expects exports to grow 2 to 3 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier.In the January-to-March quarter, exports fell 0.8 percent from a year earlier and about 0.5 percent from the previous three months, central bank data showed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Euro Zone Inflation Edges Up in April", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Inflation in the euro zone rose slightly in April, according to a preliminary official estimate, but probably not enough to ease fear of a damaging downward price spiral, nor enough to take pressure off the European Central Bank to undertake new measures to stimulate the economy.Very low inflation is considered bad for the economy, in part because it becomes more difficult for borrowers to repay their debts. People who owe money benefit from modest inflation, which erodes the value of debt. In Europe, excess debt remains a problem for governments as well as for many businesses and individuals.There is fear that persistently low inflation could add to the woes of countries like Greece that face a crushing debt burden. Some economists also warn that the euro zone is at risk of deflation, a broad, sustained decline in prices that can undercut the profits of corporations and make them reluctant to invest or hire.Analysts had expected inflation to rise at a faster rate during April because providers of package vacations, a component of the Consumer Price Index, typically raise their prices after Easter. But expectations of a larger increase faded after Germany, which has Europe\u2019s largest economy, reported Tuesday that inflation in April was 1.3 percent, lower than expected.At the same time, however, a survey conducted by the central bank indicated that it could become slightly easier for companies and individuals in the euro zone to get bank loans, thus removing an impediment to growth.For the first time since 2007, banks became more willing to issue credit to companies, according to loan officers questioned by the central bank. But the increase was small. Demand for loans has increased, according to the survey conducted in late March and early April, while banks expect credit to become more available in coming months.The inflation report raised expectations that the European Central Bank will take action soon to stimulate the economy. Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, has said several times this month that the bank is considering using the same method as the United States Federal Reserve to stimulate borrowing \u2014 namely by buying up bonds as way to push down market interest rates, a process known as quantitative easing.But economists at Nomura in London said the central bank would probably cut interest rates once more before resorting to large-scale bond purchases. And the E.C.B. will probably wait until its June meeting to act, rather than next week, Nick Matthews, an economist at Nomura, said in a note to clients. The central bank\u2019s Governing Council will meet in Brussels on May 8.\u201cWhile pressure for action may be high going into the 8 May meeting, we expect the Governing Council to defer any interest rate action until the June meeting, to allow for a more complete assessment,\u201d Mr. Matthews wrote. He predicted the central bank would cut its benchmark rate to 0.15 percent in June, from 0.25 percent.In the United States, the Fed, under its quantitative easing program, has purchased Treasury bonds and other securities to push down market interest rates. A quantitative easing program by the European Central Bank would be much more complicated because each country has its own bonds and there is no Pan-European government debt that the bank could buy in large enough quantities to have an effect.\u201cLarge-scale purchases of sovereign debt still remain the nuclear option for the E.C.B.,\u201d Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING, said in a research note, \u201cand is only likely if the recovery scenario completely falls apart.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Victor in India Promises to Make Country Strong", "Date": "2014-05-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 Narendra Modi, the man expected to become India\u2019s next prime minister, swept into the capital on Saturday morning in a triumphal procession to the colonial bungalows here that still serve as India\u2019s power center and promised that he \u201cwill try to make India self-reliant and strong.\u201dMr. Modi, who engineered a historic victory over India\u2019s long-governing Gandhi family, was surrounded at several places along the route by well-wishers who chanted paeans to him. When he stopped to greet the crowds, they showered him with rose petals.Mr. Modi gave a brief speech at the headquarters of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which on Friday won a decisive majority in Parliament. It is the first time in India\u2019s history that any party other than the Indian National Congress Party, led by the Gandhi family, has managed such a feat. \u201cI am thankful to you for the way in which you received me with so much gratitude from the airport,\u201d Mr. Modi said. After a meeting of top party members, Mr. Modi departed for Varanasi, the holiest city in Hinduism, where he won election to the lower house of Parliament. He went to the famous Kashi Vishwanath temple, which is devoted to Lord Shiva, a virile, muscular and meditative god. He then went to the banks of the Ganges, India\u2019s holiest river and one Mr. Modi has promised to clean. In some spots, the Ganges is little more than an open sewer.One of the onlookers, Rajeev Bind, 26, had come from a village nearly 30 miles away from Varanasi because Mr. Modi \u201cis the only politician who can make this country strong and powerful.\u201d\u201cAll politicians say that they will do something but when he speaks you believe it,\u201d Mr. Bind said. \u201cHe makes you believe.\u201dThe electricity in much of Varanasi was disrupted Friday as the election returns made clear the size of Mr. Modi\u2019s victory, and the power failure led many to wonder whether Mr. Modi could truly fix India\u2019s huge problems.While Mr. Modi was accepting congratulations in New Delhi, not far away Manmohan Singh, who has been India\u2019s prime minister for 10 years, delivered a brief farewell address, tendered his resignation and wished the new government well.\u201cI owe everything to this country, this great land of ours where I, an underprivileged child of Partition, was empowered enough to rise and occupy high office,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cIt is both a debt that I will never be able to repay and a decoration that I will always wear with pride.\u201dMr. Singh will retire to a simple bungalow and a $1,000-a-month pension. He is widely acknowledged to be an honest man who presided over a government riddled with corruption. And his humble acceptance of his role as a seat-warmer for Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the country\u2019s leading political family, was eventually seen as undercutting the institution of the prime minister\u2019s office.Despite a period of rising incomes, a tide of economic discontent helped make Narendra Modi the prime minister-elect.It is an office that Mr. Modi has promised to restore, and in his own speech he said his victory \u201cbelongs to 1.25 billion Indians.\u201dAmong those listening to Mr. Modi was Byas Tiwari, 68, who struggled to make his way through the throng of party supporters. Mr. Tiwari took a train on Friday night from a distant village in a neighboring state so that he could see Mr. Modi with his own eyes. He said that he had not eaten or bathed for nearly 30 hours. Mr. Modi \u201cis an honest politician, and I had prayed to God to give him a huge mandate,\u201d Mr. Tiwari said.Like hundreds of millions of others, Mr. Tiwari has high hopes for Mr. Modi. For instance, Mr. Tiwari said he believed that Mr. Modi would provide pensions to old people like him.In fact, Mr. Modi\u2019s party has largely promised to end the redistribution efforts that have long been the accepted political formula of the Gandhi family, policies that have not been terribly beneficial for India\u2019s economy. Disgust with the governing Congress Party was so intense that Mr. Modi managed to avoid having to detail many of his policies during the campaign, but expectations are so high that he may face keen disappointment if he does not rapidly improve the country\u2019s struggling economy. Nearly a million people in India join the search for work every month, and the economy is not creating nearly enough jobs for them all. Half of India\u2019s population is under the age of 25. Mr. Modi must find a way to accommodate this youth bulge, and fairly quickly, or Friday\u2019s electoral earthquake may not be the last.Hari Kumar and Vishnu Varma contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Betwa Sharma from Varanasi, India.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Jobs Market Still Stagnant, March Data Show", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European labor market remains stagnant in spite of recent signs that growth might be ticking up, an official report showed Friday.For the whole European Union of 28 nations, the jobless rate was 10.5 percent, unchanged from the revised February figure.About 25.7 million people across the European Union, including 5.3 million young people, were counted as unemployed. That was down slightly from March, but not enough to change the unemployment percentage.And investors have returned in force, once again buying the sovereign debt of Spain, Italy and other countries that took a beating during the euro crisis. On Friday, the yield on Spain\u2019s 10-year government bonds fell below 3 percent for the first time since 2005.But the pace of job growth has been a drag on the euro zone, where the number of unemployed fell by only 22,000 compared with February and 316,000 compared with March 2013.Employment is a lagging indicator, as employers \u2014 especially those bound by the rigid labor market rules common in many European countries \u2014 tend to hold out until their prospects are certain before adding to their work forces.Christian Schulz, an economist in London with Berenberg Bank, said in a research note that the economic recovery, which began in the second quarter of 2013, was \u201cgradually feeding through to the labor market.\u201d But while the number of unemployed has fallen by 310,000 since September, he wrote, at that meager pace it may take \u201cyears, if not decades\u201d to restore the 7.5 million jobs Europe has lost since 2008.Nonetheless, \u201cit is a start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect the labor market improvement to accelerate soon following stronger momentum in the economy since the beginning of the year.\u201dEurope\u2019s lowest jobless rates remained those of Austria, at 4.9 percent, and Germany, at 5.1 percent \u2014 both of which use work-sharing programs to hold down unemployment. Greece, at 26.7 percent in January \u2014 the latest figure available \u2014 and Spain, at 25.3 percent in March, continued to experience depression-level unemployment.France, where President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government has announced 50 billion euros, or roughly $69 billion, in new austerity measures to meet European Union fiscal targets, posted a 10.4 percent jobless rate.The United States, in contrast, had an unemployment rate in March of 6.7 percent. Employment data Friday from Washington showed the jobless rate in April dropping to 6.3 percent and the economy adding 288,000 jobs, far better than economists had expected.Mario Draghi, the central bank\u2019s president, has said that the E.C.B. is considering the use of the bond-buying policy known as quantitative easing, which is already employed by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, to provide monetary stimulus. Such unconventional tools are one answer to the challenge of conducting central bank policy when interest rates, the traditional lever, are already near zero.Advertisement"}

Detroit filed for bankruptcy protection in July, with an estimated $18 billion in long-term debt. This summer, a federal judge will decide whether to approve a plan that would allow the city to exit bankruptcy court by mid-October.In recent days, the city has been lobbying to secure nearly $200 million in funding from Michigan lawmakers, who are wary of setting a precedent by using taxpayer dollars to bail out a major metropolis. If approved, the state funding would be part of a so-called grand bargain that would also include hundreds of millions of dollars from philanthropic foundations. The money would be used to cushion pension cuts for Detroit retirees and avert the sale of the city\u2019s art collection. The Legislature is weighing a package of bills regarding the outside funding this week.\u201cThe city\u2019s challenges remain significant \u2014 unprecedented, in some regards \u2014 but JPMorgan Chase believes that Detroit has the ingredients and intrinsic strengths to reshape and rebuild a dynamic modern economy and make the city a great place to live, work and invest,\u201d said a company document detailing how the $100 million would be spent, which The Detroit Free Press posted online on Tuesday. \u201cWe are committed to helping make that future a reality.\u201dThe bank will direct half of the money to community projects that would otherwise lack access to capital. It will put $25 million toward assisting groups like the Detroit Land Bank Authority and the Detroit Blight Removal Task Force, which have begun aggressive demolition campaigns to rid the city of its estimated 78,000 vacant structures. The rest will be diced up: $12.5 million for work-force training, $7 million for small-business assistance and $5.5 million toward economic growth projects such as a new streetcar system.The company announced another five-year initiative in December that infused $250 million into Detroit and other big cities for job-skills training. Both efforts come as JPMorgan emerges from a period of intense scrutiny. The bank reached a $13 billion settlement in November over its sale of questionable mortgage securities in the prelude to the financial crisis.Goldman Sachs, another bank that has been buffeted by regulatory woes, pledged $20 million to Detroit in November for job creation and economic development.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Year, Buying in May Might Be the Best Bet", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 Sell in May and go away. This time-honored stock market adage has served investors well for four years in a row. Every year since 2010, global stock markets have undergone significant corrections between a high reached in May and a low point in the summer or early autumn: by 15 percent in 2010, 19 percent in 2011, 9 percent in 2012 and 5 percent in 2013, as gauged by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index. Given that the Dow Jones industrial average hit its highest level ever on April 30, while the S.&P. 500 peaked less than 1 percent shy of a record, it may seem sensible to follow the seasonal adage, almost regardless of one\u2019s views about the longer-term prospects for the world economy. That is exactly how financial markets have behaved since May 1. In the past week, investors around the world have responded negatively to what have been by any standards extremely favorable economic figures from the United States, Britain and even Europe. The most striking case of this perverse behavior was the reaction last Friday to United States employment figures, which frequently set the tone for global investor sentiment every month. Not only did the employment gain of 288,000 comfortably exceed the expectations on Wall Street, but the revisions to the three previous figures suggested strongly that the slump in the United States economy at the turn of the year, which caused a brief market panic in January, really was a weather-related aberration whose effects diminished steadily through the winter. Better still, the good news on growth was neatly counterbalanced by some softer figures in the payroll report on wages, which allowed Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, to reassure the markets in her congressional testimony on Wednesday that there was no prospect of early monetary tightening, despite the fall in unemployment to just 6.3 percent, the lowest level since Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in September 2008. Yet despite all this good news, Wall Street closed with losses last Friday. More significant, long-term interest rates, which generally move in the same direction as economic expectations, fell very sharply, with the 30-year United States Treasury yield plunging to its lowest level since last June. This bond-market action strongly implied that investors did not believe the improvement in the outlook for the United States or smelled a rat somewhere else in the global economic scene. Where might the rat be hiding? For once, it is difficult to blame Europe. The purchasing management indexes from all over Europe announced since last Friday show substantial and widespread improvements, with even Greece, Italy and Spain climbing well above the 50 mark, which separates contraction from growth, for the first time since 2011. Most emerging markets have also improved sharply in the past two months after their bout of near-panic at the start of the year.What, then, might explain the churlish response to good news and especially the plunge in bond yields, which clearly suggests a slowdown in global economic growth instead of the acceleration implied by all the recent news? There are two plausible explanations and one implausible.Many analysts think the bond market \u201cknows\u201d something negative about global economic prospects that statistics are not yet showing, but this is unlikely. Experience since at least 2000 has shown bond market gyrations to be a poor leading indicator of economic events. That leaves the two plausible explanations for market jitters \u2014 geopolitical risks and high stock market valuations, compounded by seasonal expectations of a sell-off in May. The geopolitical problems are obvious but luckily seem to be waning for the reasons discussed here since the start of the Ukraine crisis. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is close to achieving his main objectives: Western acceptance that Crimea will be part of Russia and Ukrainian acceptance that their country will be ungovernable without Russian acquiescence. As he consolidates his winning position in this diplomatic chess game, Mr. Putin is naturally shifting from aggressive to conciliatory mode. Assuming that the conflict in Ukraine continues subsiding, the final question for investors is whether valuations, combined with the seasonal factor, are a decisive reason really for caution on stocks in the weeks ahead. The answer is, probably not. Valuations on Wall Street are still well within historic ranges, as Ms. Yellen pointed out on Wednesday, while stock markets elsewhere are generally cheaper than in the United States.Moreover, equity market gains in the first four months of this year have been much smaller than in any year since 2009 \u2014 just 1.6 percent on the S.&P. 500. Meanwhile, bond markets (which tend to move in the direction opposite to equities) have done better than in any January-April period since 1988. This once-in-a-generation divergence suggests that this is could be an ideal time to rebalance portfolios by buying equities and selling bonds \u2014 the opposite of the strategy that worked every May since 2010. In short, it may be time for investors to forget their seasonal habits, and instead \u201cBuy in May.\u201d Advertisement"}

Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said at Wednesday\u2019s open meeting of the council: \u201cOur job is not done. We must continue our collective efforts to monitor risks, address vulnerabilities and build a stronger and safer financial system.\u201dThe \u201cchief accomplishment\u201d in recent years has been the improvement in big bank holding companies\u2019 balance sheets, Ms. Yellen said, adding that the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress tests had \u201cprovided a level of confidence in our assessment of how financial institutions would fare\u201d in another downturn.The oversight council \u2014 made up of the heads of the Treasury, Fed and other regulators \u2014 also cited the completion of the so-called Volcker rule restricting certain firms from making bets with their own money, as well as new rules on bank capital, leverage ratios and swaps markets.But threats old and new abound, and the annual report acts as a guide to what Washington is worried about when it comes to Wall Street.The perception that big, interconnected financial firms might be \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d persists, the report warns. The markets where many banks look for short-term cash loans remain potential weak spots, too.\u201cThe risk of fire sales continues to be a major source of financial instability in the tri-party repo market,\u201d the report said, referring to a market for short-term loans. \u201cNo single regulator has an ability to support orderly liquidations across all investors in the market. Market participants will be critically important in defining a solution to this collective action problem.\u201dOn top of those concerns, sharp increases in interest rates might hit firms that have soaked up riskier assets on the cheap in the last few years.The report also notes that there has been no progress in overhauling the housing finance market, with lawmakers loathe to touch Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in part because the entities, which were taken over by the government during the financial crisis to prevent them from failing, are currently returning tens of billions of dollars to the Treasury.\u201cAccess to mortgage credit remains unnecessarily tight,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said at the council\u2019s meeting. \u201cThe housing finance system needs fundamental reform.\u201d This uncertainty about the future shape of the system was holding back a broader housing recovery, he added.The markets also might remain overly reliant on a global benchmark interest rate, known as Libor, that bank employees have been accused of manipulating.There are potential new or emerging threats as well, the document warns. The nonbank mortgage servicers that collect fees on a growing number of home loans \u201care not currently subject to prudential standards such as capital, liquidity or risk management oversight.\u201dAnother potential risk is that some big asset managers are providing indemnification to securities lenders. But such asset managers are not required to set aside money to cover potential payouts, nor do they have banks\u2019 deposit funding base, the report noted.A person close to the development of the annual report stressed that such developments might not be any kind of threat, but that the council wanted to keep tabs on them.The council also updated its own rules, issuing a new transparency policy that will give the public more access to information before and after its meetings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Price Tag on Carbon as a Climate Rescue Plan", "Date": "2014-05-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Big Fix10 PhotosKEWAUNEE, Wis. \u2014 Bryan T. Pagel, a dairy farmer, watched as a glistening slurry of cow manure disappeared down a culvert. If recycling the waste on his family\u2019s farm would help to save the world, he was happy to go along.Out back, machinery was breaking down the manure and capturing a byproduct called methane, a potent greenhouse gas. A huge Caterpillar engine roared as it burned the methane to generate electricity, keeping it out of the atmosphere.\u201cWhen they came out here and told us they were willing to send us checks, we were thrilled,\u201d Mr. Pagel said.California\u2019s program is the latest incarnation of an increasingly popular \u2014 and much debated \u2014 mechanism that has emerged as one of the primary weapons against global warming. From China to Norway, Kazakhstan to the Northeastern United States, governments are requiring industries to buy permits allowing them to emit set levels of greenhouse gases. Under these plans, the allowable levels of pollution are steadily reduced and the cost of permits rises, creating an economic incentive for companies to cut emissions. The system encourages companies to find the least expensive ways to make the cuts, either by adopting cleaner energy technology or by investing in outside emission-control projects, like the Pagels\u2019 methane digester. Congress rejected a national plan of this type during President Obama\u2019s first term, but 10 states, including most of those in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, have developed their own programs. And the approach is expected to get a huge lift on Monday when Mr. Obama unveils a long-awaited national plan requiring states to lower their power plant emissions. One likely effect will be to encourage more states to adopt systems like California\u2019s. Already, the approach is spreading worldwide, with the number of people living in places that have such a system nearing one billion, or 14 percent of the world\u2019s population, including about 80 million Americans. \u201cThe point now is to say, look, this can work, it can be scaled, and please join,\u201d said Frank A. Wolak, an economist at Stanford University.Yet in the decade it has been used to tackle global warming, this approach has had a turbulent history. The world\u2019s largest such system, in Europe, has had severe problems, including gyrations in the prices that polluters have to pay. Given a lack of evidence that the system can actually solve the emissions problem, some environmental groups and scientists have developed serious reservations. \u201cThe reason I don\u2019t support what we\u2019re doing is not that I don\u2019t think something needs to be done,\u201d said Myles R. Allen, a leading British climate scientist at Oxford University. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective, and I don\u2019t see it ever being effective.\u201dDrought-plagued California, which Gov. Jerry Brown recently called the \u201cepicenter\u201d of climate change, hopes to prove that capitalism can work in the fight against global warming. The state took great care in setting up its system, which is now being seen as a global test case.Eighteen months into the venture, it is still too soon to tell how well it will work. But the state has so far managed to avoid some of the mistakes that have plagued efforts in other parts of the world. Hundreds of industrial facilities have been brought under the plan, prompting those businesses to study how to use less energy, and fuel suppliers will be pulled into it next year. By the end of the decade, the state is expected to collect about $5 billion a year in permit fees, with the bulk of the money being recycled into clean-energy projects. Worldwide, other approaches to global warming are also being considered. A more ambitious push could be made on renewable energy, like solar and wind. Power companies might be ordered to capture their carbon emissions and bury them underground. Forests could be preserved or allowed to regrow to absorb more carbon dioxide from the air.But all those methods have drawbacks, and interviews by The New York Times with more than 80 experts in nine countries revealed sharp disagreements about which to embrace.Experts say that limiting the effects of the human-induced warming will almost certainly cost trillions of dollars over generations and require an unprecedented level of cooperation across states and nations \u2014 if it can be done at all.\u201cHow do we deal, as a global civilization, with a problem that is decades in the making and is caused by everything we do?\u201d asked Peter Miller, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s the challenge of our time, and there is no road map.\u201dDrought, Rain and FireThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body of scientists and other experts appointed by the United Nations, found last year that total emissions of carbon into the atmosphere must be kept below one trillion tons if global warming is to be held to tolerable levels. More than half that amount has been emitted since the beginning of the industrial era, and at the rate emissions are going up, the limit will be reached in 30 years or less. \u201cClimate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,\u201d the National Climate Assessment said.Some environmental groups have contended that the best way to combat climate change would be for governments to impose tight regulations on businesses that produce greenhouse gases.Economists have argued, instead, that governments should put a price on emissions. The simplest way to do that would be a tax \u2014 the same sort of sin tax applied to liquor and cigarettes, albeit on a vastly larger scale. In the 1960s, economists in Canada and the United States developed an alternative concept: a market in pollution rights, which they believed would allow companies to decide for themselves how to limit their emissions at the lowest cost.That approach got its first major tryout in 1990 when the administration of George Bush embraced it to battle acid rain, persuading reluctant congressional Democrats to go along. It reduced emissions of sulfur dioxide far more cheaply than expected, and it was seen as a triumph of conservative thinking about the environment. The strategy, called cap and trade, is now being applied to greenhouse gases. Governments impose a limit, or cap, on the amount of the gases that can be spewed into the atmosphere by polluters like power plants and refiners. It then issues permits, often called carbon allowances, equal to the level of the cap, with each permit representing a ton of emissions.The government requires industries to acquire enough permits to equal their emissions. Companies that need permits buy them, either from the government or on a commodity market, with the value set by supply and demand. Over time, the government reduces the cap and the number of permits, driving up their value.The system is intended to ensure that polluters reduce their emissions, but do it in a way that makes the most financial sense. A company might spend money to upgrade to more efficient equipment, for instance, if that is less expensive than buying permits at the market price at that time. The sale of permits also creates a flow of funds to reduce emissions in economic sectors not covered by the permit system, such as farming or forestry.Yet a few of these government-created markets have been seriously flawed, and some experts argue that time is being wasted on an effort that could, ultimately, fall short.Problems in EuropeWhile the United States has been embroiled in a political argument over the past decade about whether climate change is even real, the European Union has largely embraced the science and moved forward. The European Emissions Trading System, which went into operation in 2005, has proved that a market in pollution permits can be made to work across barriers of language and national interest. Yet the European Union has also come to be seen as a case study in what can go wrong if such a system is not set up carefully. Early on, instead of scrutinizing data on emissions, European regulators trusted companies to tell them how much greenhouse gas they were emitting. Since those numbers would be used in setting the initial emissions cap, the companies had an obvious incentive to exaggerate. When it finally became clear in 2006 that they had done so, and emissions were actually lower than traders had been led to believe, permits suddenly became less valuable and their price crashed in a matter of hours.Then, just as Europe was tightening its rules, the global financial crisis hit in 2008 and 2009. \u201cYou produced less electricity, less steel, less toilet paper \u2014 less of everything that was included in the system,\u201d said Stig Schjolset, chief carbon markets analyst with Thomson Reuters Point Carbon in Oslo.The European Union had put no mechanism in place to respond to these changing economic conditions, so governments kept cranking out carbon permits even as the decline in output meant that fewer were needed. Carbon prices tanked yet again. Recently the European Union adopted changes that have firmed up prices somewhat. But at just over $7 per ton of carbon dioxide, they are still far below their peak, and below the $30 level that many analysts believe is needed to spur investment in cleaner energy sources. Europe\u2019s broader goals have by no means been a complete failure. The European Union set a target of lowering emissions 20 percent by 2020, and that appears likely to be met \u2014 but several studies suggest that is less a result of the carbon market than of economic weakness, as well as subsidies for renewable power. Many experts in Europe fear that later, more ambitious goals will prove unattainable if companies have too little incentive to invest in clean technology. The experts believe emissions throughout the developed world need to fall 80 percent or more by 2050.\u201cEven if we\u2019re fine to meet the emissions target for 2020, it will be very challenging to meet Europe\u2019s long-term targets,\u201d Mr. Schjolset said. \u201cFor that, you need a higher carbon price now.\u201dCalifornia as PioneerMary Nichols cut her teeth as a young lawyer by successfully suing the California state government for violating the federal Clean Air Act. She has long since become an insider, running the most powerful state environmental agency in the country, California\u2019s Air Resources Board.Ms. Nichols \u2014 chosen by a Republican governor and kept on by the Democrat who succeeded him \u2014 said that when her agency set out to create a carbon market, her European counterparts were candid in advising the state how not to repeat their mistakes. \u201cIt was an act of great generosity on their part,\u201d she said.California\u2019s Global Warming Solutions Act, signed in 2006 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, set a goal of lowering California\u2019s greenhouse gases in 2020 to the 1990 level, a cut of 28 percent from the level they had been expected to reach in 2020 without the law.Even after it was signed, the law was the subject of political and legal battles, with oil companies and other polluters fighting to overturn it. When voters were asked whether they wanted the state to tackle global warming in 2010, they voted 62 percent to 38 percent to move forward with the law, which requires more efficient cars, more renewable power on the state\u2019s electric grid and many other steps. A centerpiece was a provision capping emissions from big polluters, including power generators and gasoline refiners, and setting up a permit-trading system.California spent several years developing regulations, then began its cap-and-trade system in 2013. The project is taking hold gradually. California adopted rules shielding companies vulnerable to out-of-state competition, as well as residential electricity customers, from the full impact of the costs. In the early days, it is giving away many of the required carbon permits for free to ease companies into the system. Nonetheless, at just over $11 a ton, the carbon price in California is now the highest in any cap-and-trade market, 60 percent above the price in Europe. In setting up the market, California took measures to prevent the wild price gyrations seen in Europe. The state spent years getting accurate emissions data, for instance. And it established de facto floor and ceiling prices for its permits. The price so far has been highly predictable, trading in a range from $11 to $14 a ton.As part of its plan, the state decided to allow emission-lowering projects in sectors not covered by the cap-and-trade system, such as forestry and farming. These \u201coffset projects,\u201d which can be located anywhere in the United States, are subject to strict auditing. The projects create credits that can be sold in the California market. John T. Pagel, the owner, said that he had thought for several years about installing a system to reduce odors and capture methane emissions from the manure of thousands of cows. But he could not figure out how to make the economics work. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, but it has to support itself, too,\u201d Mr. Pagel said.Then he met a TerraPass representative at an agricultural fair several years ago and learned he could receive payments totaling tens of thousands of dollars a year.On a tour of his farm near Kewaunee, Mr. Pagel proudly showed off the gear. A 20-cylinder Caterpillar engine, powered by methane from cow manure, throbbed in a large building behind his barns. As it turned a generator, it was pumping enough renewable power into the local electric grid to supply about 1,200 homes.\u201cI love that thing!\u201d Mr. Pagel said.One of his sons, Bryan, described meticulous oversight from California, including instruments that send a stream of data back to TerraPass headquarters to verify that the system is working properly. Otherwise, said Peter Freed, a former TerraPass employee who helped set up the deal, the state might disallow the carbon credits. \u201cThe California system doesn\u2019t have a real tolerance for error,\u201d he said.Still, it will not be clear for years how successful the state\u2019s carbon market has been in lowering emissions, or in spurring investment in clean energy. In the meantime, the Obama administration must decide how hard to push other states toward copying California\u2019s program.\u201cWhat\u2019s good for California, and what others will ultimately look to, is success,\u201d said Richard Corey, chief executive of the Air Resources Board. \u201cThe ultimate test of success is going to be: Did it work?\u201dQuestioning Cap and TradeSome environmental groups and academics have never reconciled themselves to the idea of a market in pollution rights, and Europe\u2019s problems have heightened their doubts. So far, they point out, global emissions are still rising.\u201cI would throw the markets out and start over with something different,\u201d said Doreen Stabinsky, a professor of global environmental politics at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Me. \u201cI think we can\u2019t be sidetracked by playing around with a market, because this objective is so important, so pressing and so difficult.\u201dEconomists and analysts who support cap and trade say they are confident the problems can be worked out, and they believe California is in the process of proving it. The key issue now, they say, is whether governments that adopt these systems will tighten the emissions caps, driving up carbon prices \u2014 and do it soon enough to make a real dent in global warming.But the system has worked smoothly for several years, generating $1.7 billion that nine state governments in the Northeast have used largely to support clean-energy projects. Those investments, as well as utilities\u2019 switch to cleaner natural gas, have sharply reduced carbon emissions in the region.Recently, the nine states decided to cut their emissions cap by 45 percent and to let carbon prices rise. They have nearly doubled, to $4 a ton, and the revisions are expected to spur still more clean-energy investment.Some experts believe that in the long run, carbon markets will make a substantial contribution only if they can be tied together across political boundaries. That would allow polluters to search the world for the cheapest ways of cutting emissions.The world\u2019s biggest carbon polluter, China, has begun experimenting with markets in seven cities and provinces, with a view toward forming a national carbon market this decade. Both California and Europe are tentatively speaking to the Chinese about future linkages.As such developments take hold, the once unthinkable has begun to seem plausible, if by no means inevitable: a linked global carbon price high enough to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.Experts who support cap and trade contend that a market mechanism can reach more deeply into the economy than any other approach, changing the behavior even of people and companies that might not necessarily care about global warming.The Wisconsin dairymen perhaps serve as an example of that.Even as the methane-powered generator roared on his property, John T. Pagel said he was not convinced that the climatic changes happening in the United States were a result of human emissions. He suspects they might be part of a natural cycle. But with Californians dangling cash in exchange for his willingness to cut emissions, he jumped at the chance to build his digester.\u201cWe are doing exactly what they asked us to do to get paid to reduce carbon,\u201d Mr. Pagel said. \u201cIf somebody else believes in it enough to put up the money, that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201dReporting was contributed by Mark Scott from London, Keith Bradsher and Chris Buckley from Hong Kong, and Felicity Barringer from San Francisco.The Big Fix: This is the first in a series of articles examining\npotential solutions to climate\nchange.As the Climate Changes, So Does the LanguageClimate change has created its own vocabulary of concepts and institutions.

{"Headline": "Civil Rights Battlefront Is Now Yearning for Jobs", "Date": "2014-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThere were new people coming in, people with money, in and out of here,\u201d said Mr. Green, whose family has run an automobile repair shop here for 54 years. \u201cEver since they closed, it\u2019s sort of been a steady decline.\u201dBut now, in a county where the unemployment rate has been in the double digits for nearly seven years, there is a rare burst of economic hope involving an improbable source: Kuwait, which could decide to use the former Air Force base as a training complex for up to 300 pilots every year.Since local officials issued a vague announcement this month about the possibility of an \u201cinternational pilot-training program\u201d starting in Dallas County, where Selma is the seat, there has been a rare ripple of cautious optimism around town.But there has also been a deeply held sense of dread that once again, someplace else may outpace a county that residents and experts say cannot seem to get ahead.\u201cSo many things have been promised before that haven\u2019t happened,\u201d Mr. Green, 54, said, \u201ceverything from an interstate highway coming through to just one thing and another.\u201dOthers share his skepticism. Such is the nature of a place where residents talk of the gunshots they sometimes hear, the abandoned buildings they drive past, and the jobs that have faded away and rarely been replaced.They survey the state, especially Prattville, a suburb of Montgomery less than 40 miles away, where the median household income, $58,773, is more than double Selma\u2019s, $22,076, and they speculate aloud about why their city has not thrived.\u201cSometimes you wonder if it\u2019s going to be around, if it\u2019s going to get extinct,\u201d said Juanita Tripp, 70, who has lived in Selma her entire life and now works at a furniture store.But a development at Craig, which for decades trained American pilots and has a runway that can accommodate some of the world\u2019s largest aircraft, could be the catalyst for a reversal of the economic slump in a county, now about 70 percent black, where the biggest annual draw is a re-enactment of the 1965 crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge by civil rights marchers. Researchers note that in a county of approximately 42,000 people, a rush of new jobs related to the training center would move the unemployment rate sharply downward. (The state said Dallas County\u2019s unemployment rate was 11.7 percent in April, the most recent month for which data is available, nearly five percentage points higher than the statewide figure.)Selma would not be the first Alabama city to secure a momentous investment from abroad. Airbus has a significant presence in Mobile, and Honda, Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz all operate large factories in the state. In Wilcox County, which borders Dallas County, a Chinese company runs a copper plant.But in many instances, the story here has been about Dallas County and the longstanding economic struggles of the self-described Queen City of the Black Belt.\u201cThey\u2019ve been in the running for many projects and have not made it to that last point,\u201d said Nisa Miranda, the longtime director of the University of Alabama Center for Economic Development.It is a troubling and grim record that many people here blame for quality-of-life issues that contributed to a population decline in Selma of more than 2 percent in about two years, even as Alabama\u2019s population increased by nearly 1 percent.\u201cWhen we first came to Selma, it was peaceful and quiet, and at night you could walk anywhere you wanted,\u201d Charity Baskin said as she chatted on her porch on a recent afternoon, a short walk from Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, which civil rights protesters used as a meeting place in the 1960s. \u201cBut as the years went by, it started getting violent, and we don\u2019t care for that violence.\u201dThere are far rosier takes on Selma and its prospects, though, and in conservative Alabama, there is a feeling among some here that the plights are more individual than systemic.\u201cIf you work hard, you\u2019ll get ahead,\u201d said Randy Malone, 53, though he acknowledged that Selma \u201ccan always be better.\u201dAnd there is a sense here, in a region of deep and proud religious traditions, that a higher power will someday redeem Selma.\u201cA lot of people prayed for a better economy,\u201d said David Summerlin, whose hardware store customers can also pick up a brownie \u2014 with nuts \u2014 for 75 cents. \u201cThey pray every day, and they pray hard. And I think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201dThat sentiment was evident even to a relative newcomer in a city filled with natives.\u201cA lot of hope and faith, that\u2019s what\u2019s holding them,\u201d said Teja Schmitt, who arrived in Selma four years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s the faith. People so strongly believe that there are going to be changes.\u201dNo one knows whether those changes will include pilots from overseas.\u201cIt will make the economy better if it happens,\u201d said Ray Martin, who owns a barbershop on Alabama Avenue. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to wait and see.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Senate Panel Votes to End U.S. Giants in Mortgages", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Senate panel approved legislation on Thursday to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and reshape the mortgage finance system, but sparse support among Democrats means the measure is unlikely to become law. The Democratic-controlled Senate Banking Committee approved the bill in a 13-to-9 vote, with only half of the panel\u2019s 12 Democrats voting in favor.The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, is unlikely to bring the measure to a vote on the Senate floor, according to Senate aides who said it needed wider support among Democrats.The vote is a setback for the Obama administration, which helped on the legislation and worked to build support for it.\u201cThis bill represents our effort to draft the final chapter of financial reform by addressing the most significant unresolved issue from the financial crisis \u2014 the housing finance system,\u201d Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, said before the vote.The bill would replace the government-run Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a new industry-financed agency that would offer a government guarantee on mortgage bonds, but one that would kick in only after private interests shouldered big losses.Many liberal Democratic senators and housing advocates raised concern that the bill would drive up the cost of mortgages without giving enough attention to ensuring that all creditworthy borrowers had access to loans. Democrats and Republicans also voiced worries it would give big banks too much control of the lending business. Even if the full Senate were to approve it, it is not expected to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives. For years, Democrats and Republicans have said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be abolished, but lawmakers face tough choices deciding how to attract enough private capital to ensure that Americans retain broad access to home loans.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s So Scary About Smart Girls?", "Date": "2014-05-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat\u2019s what extremists do. They target educated girls, their worst nightmare.Why are fanatics so terrified of girls\u2019 education? Because there\u2019s no force more powerful to transform a society. The greatest threat to extremism isn\u2019t drones firing missiles, but girls reading books.In that sense, Boko Haram was behaving perfectly rationally \u2014 albeit barbarically \u2014 when it kidnapped some of the brightest, most ambitious girls in the region and announced plans to sell them as slaves. If you want to mire a nation in backwardness, manacle your daughters.What saddens me is that we in the West aren\u2019t acting as rationally. To fight militancy, we invest overwhelmingly in the military toolbox but not so much in the education toolbox that has a far better record at defeating militancy.President Obama gives the green light to blow up terrorists with drones, but he neglects his 2008 campaign promise to establish a $2 billion global fund for education. I wish Republicans, instead of investigating him for chimerical scandals in Benghazi, Libya, would shine a light on his failure to follow through on that great idea.So why does girls\u2019 education matter so much? First, because it changes demography.One of the factors that correlates most strongly to instability is a youth bulge in a population. The more unemployed young men ages 15 to 24, the more upheaval.That means that curbing birthrates tends to lead to stability, and that\u2019s where educating girls comes in. You educate a boy, and he\u2019ll have fewer children, but it\u2019s a small effect. You educate a girl, and, on average, she will have a significantly smaller family. One robust Nigeria study managed to tease out correlation from causation and found that for each additional year of primary school, a girl has 0.26 fewer children. So if we want to reduce the youth bulge a decade from now, educate girls today.More broadly, girls\u2019 education can, in effect, almost double the formal labor force. It boosts the economy, raising living standards and promoting a virtuous cycle of development. Asia\u2019s economic boom was built by educating girls and moving them from the villages to far more productive work in the cities.Today, Oman is stable and incomparably better off than its neighbor, Yemen, where girls are still married off young and often denied an education. America is fighting Al Qaeda affiliates in Yemen and Pakistan with drones; maybe we should invest in girls\u2019 schools as Bangladesh and Oman did.Girls\u2019 education is no silver bullet. Iran and Saudi Arabia have both educated girls but refused to empower them, so both remain mired in the past. But when a country educates and unleashes women, those educated women often become force multipliers for good.Angeline Mugwendere was an impoverished Zimbabwean girl who was mocked by classmates because she traipsed to school barefoot in a torn dress with nothing underneath. She couldn\u2019t afford school supplies, so she would wash dishes for her teachers in hopes of being given a pen or paper in thanks.Yet Angeline was brilliant. In the nationwide sixth-grade graduation examinations, she had the highest score in her entire district \u2014 indeed, one of the highest scores in the country. Yet she had no hope of attending seventh grade because she couldn\u2019t afford the fees.Educating girls and empowering women are also tasks that are, by global standards, relatively doable. We spend billions of dollars on intelligence collection, counterterrorism and military interventions, even though they have a quite mixed record. By comparison, educating girls is an underfunded cause even though it\u2019s more straightforward.Readers often feel helpless, unable to make a difference. But it was a grass-roots movement starting in Nigeria that grabbed attention and held leaders accountable to address it. Nigeria\u2019s leaders perhaps now realize that they must protect not only oil wells but an even greater treasure: the nation\u2019s students.Obviously, the situation in the United States is incomparably better. But we have our own problems. It\u2019s estimated that 100,000 girls under 18 years old in the United States are trafficked into commercial sex each year. So let\u2019s fight to #BringBackOurGirls in Nigeria but also here in the United States and around the world.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New-Home Sales Rose 6.4% in April", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 New-home sales in the United States recovered in April after slumping the previous two months. But Americans are still buying new homes at a slower pace than they did a year ago.The Commerce Department said on Friday that sales of new homes rose 6.4 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 433,000. That compares with an upwardly revised annual pace of 407,000 in March, when purchases fell 6.9 percent. Buying dropped 4.4 percent in February, in part because of winter snowstorms.Demand for newly built homes remains one of the missing pieces of the nearly five-year-old recovery from the recession. A lack of affordability has limited buying around the country. Sales of new homes are running at roughly half the rate of a healthy real estate market.Warmer weather has yet to heat up the housing market after a harsh winter slowed sales in January and February. Higher prices and mortgage rates over the last year have also sidelined many would-be buyers.Sales during April surged in the Midwest and edged up in the South. Home-buying was flat in the West and fell in the Northeast.Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas, noted that the 47.4 percent increase in Midwest sales were probably attributable to the start of the spring buying season and that similar levels of growth were \u201cnot likely to continue.\u201d\u201cThe broader trend remains one of weak underlying demand,\u201d Ms. Shulyatyeva said in a client note.New-home sales have declined 4.2 percent over the last 12 months.The median sales price, which can be volatile, fell a slight 2.1 percent during the last month to $275,800.Buying has been slow across much of the country after climbing in the first half of 2013. Last year\u2019s gains and a limited supply of homes pushed up prices to levels that strained household budgets for potential buyers.Sales of existing homes in April rose 1.3 percent from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.65 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Purchases of homes over the last 12 months have dropped 6.8 percent. In a healthy housing market, roughly 5.5 million existing homes are purchased each year.The median price for an existing home has risen 5.2 percent to $201,700.Home sales growth over the last year has occurred primarily among homes worth more than $750,000. Buying fell during the same period for homes worth less than $250,000, which make up a majority of all purchases.Much of the increase in construction has been in the apartment sector, a sign that builders expect fewer buyers and more renters. After the housing crisis and recession, Americans have been coping with flat wages and job insecurity, making it hard to save for a down payment. The homeownership rate was 64.8 percent at the start of the year, down from a peak of 69.2 percent during 2004.New homes usually represent about 20 percent of all homes sold. That figure has fallen recently to 10 percent, according to the real estate data firm, Zillow.An index of builder confidence for this month fell a percentage point to 45, the National Association of Homebuilders and Wells Fargo reported Thursday. A reading below 50 indicates that builders consider the conditions for new construction to be poor. The index had been above 50 from June through January.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of President Obama\u2019s Commencement Address at West Point", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing is the full text as delivered of President Obama\u2019s commencement address at the United States Military Academy at West Point.Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you, General Caslen, for that introduction. General Trainor, General Clarke, faculty and staff at West Point, you have been outstanding stewards of this proud institution and outstanding mentors for the newest officers in the United States Army.I\u2019d like to acknowledge the Army\u2019s leadership \u2014 General McHugh \u2014 Secretary McHugh, General Odierno, as well as Senator Jack Reed, who is here and a proud graduate of West Point himself. To the class of 2014, I congratulate you on taking your place on the Long Gray Line.Among you is the first all-female command team: Erin Mauldin and Austen Boroff. In Calla Glavin, you have a Rhodes Scholar, and Josh Herbeck proves that West Point accuracy extends beyond the three-point line. (Laughter.)To the entire class, let me reassure you in these final hours at West Point, as commander in chief, I hereby absolve all cadets who are on restriction for minor conduct offenses. (Laughter, applause.) Let me just say that nobody ever did that for me when I was in school.I know you join me in extending a word of thanks to your families. Joe DeMoss, whose son James is graduating, spoke for a whole lot of parents when he wrote me a letter about the sacrifices you\u2019ve made. \u201cDeep inside,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe want to explode with pride at what they are committing to do in the service of our country.\u201d Like several graduates, James is a combat veteran, and I would ask all of us here today to stand and pay tribute not only to the veterans among us, but to the more than 2.5 million Americans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as their families. (Applause.)It is a particularly useful time for America to reflect on those who\u2019ve sacrificed so much for our freedom, a few days after Memorial Day. You are the first class to graduate since 9/11 who may not be sent into combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. (Cheers, applause.)When I first spoke at West Point in 2009, we still had more than 100,000 troops in Iraq. We were preparing to surge in Afghanistan. Our counterterrorism efforts were focused on Al Qaeda\u2019s core leadership \u2014 those who had carried out the 9/11 attacks. And our nation was just beginning a long climb out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.Four and a half years later, as you graduate, the landscape has changed. We have removed our troops from Iraq. We are winding down our war in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership on the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been decimated, and Osama bin Laden is no more. (Cheers, applause.) And through it all, we\u2019ve refocused our investments in what has always been a key source of American strength: a growing economy that can provide opportunity for everybody who\u2019s willing to work hard and take responsibility here at home.In fact, by most measures America has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world. Those who argue otherwise \u2014 who suggest that America is in decline or has seen its global leadership slip away \u2014 are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics.Think about it. Our military has no peer. The odds of a direct threat against us by any nation are low, and do not come close to the dangers we faced during the Cold War. Meanwhile, our economy remains the most dynamic on Earth, our businesses the most innovative. Each year, we grow more energy independent. From Europe to Asia, we are the hub of alliances unrivaled in the history of nations.America continues to attract striving immigrants. The values of our founding inspire leaders in parliaments and new movements in public squares around the globe. And when a typhoon hits the Philippines, or schoolgirls are kidnapped in Nigeria, or masked men occupy a building in Ukraine, it is America that the world looks to for help. (Applause.) So the United States is and remains the one indispensable nation. That has been true for the century past, and it will be true for the century to come.But the world is changing with accelerating speed. This presents opportunity, but also new dangers. We know all too well, after 9/11, just how technology and globalization has put power once reserved for states in the hands of individuals, raising the capacity of terrorists to do harm.Russia\u2019s aggression towards former Soviet states unnerves capitals in Europe while China\u2019s economic rise and military reach worries its neighbors.From Brazil to India, rising middle classes compete with us, and governments seek a greater say in global forums. And even as developing nations embrace democracy and market economies, 24-hour news and social media makes it impossible to ignore the continuation of sectarian conflicts, failing states and popular uprisings that might have received only passing notice a generation ago.It will be your generation\u2019s task to respond to this new world. The question we face, the question each of you will face, is not whether America will lead but how we will lead, not just to secure our peace and prosperity but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe.Now, this question isn\u2019t new. At least since George Washington served as commander in chief, there have been those who warned against foreign entanglements that do not touch directly on our security or economic well-being.Today, according to self-described realists, conflicts in Syria or Ukraine or the Central African Republic are not ours to solve. And not surprisingly, after costly wars and continuing challenges here at home, that view is shared by many Americans.A different view, from interventionists from the left and right, says that we ignore these conflicts at our own peril, that America\u2019s willingness to apply force around the world is the ultimate safeguard against chaos, and America\u2019s failure to act in the face of Syrian brutality or Russian provocations not only violates our conscience, but invites escalating aggression in the future.And each side can point to history to support its claims, but I believe neither view fully speaks to the demands of this moment. It is absolutely true that in the 21st century, American isolationism is not an option. We don\u2019t have a choice to ignore what happens beyond our borders. If nuclear materials are not secure, that poses a danger to American citizens.As the Syrian civil war spills across borders, the capacity of battle-hardened extremist groups to come after us only increases. Regional aggression that goes unchecked, whether in southern Ukraine or the South China Sea or anywhere else in the world, will ultimately impact our allies, and could draw in our military. We can\u2019t ignore what happens beyond our boundaries.And beyond these narrow rationales, I believe we have a real stake \u2014 abiding self-interest \u2014 in making sure our children and our grandchildren grow up in a world where schoolgirls are not kidnapped; where individuals aren\u2019t slaughtered because of tribe or faith or political belief. I believe that a world of greater freedom and tolerance is not only a moral imperative; it also helps keep us safe.But to say that we have an interest in pursuing peace and freedom beyond our borders is not to say that every problem has a military solution. Since World War II, some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint but from our willingness to rush into military adventures without thinking through the consequences, without building international support and legitimacy for our action, without leveling with the American people about the sacrifices required. Tough talk often draws headlines, but war rarely conforms to slogans. As General Eisenhower, someone with hard-earned knowledge on this subject, said at this ceremony in 1947, \u201cWar is mankind\u2019s most tragic and stupid folly; to seek or advise its deliberate provocation is a black crime against all men.\u201dLike Eisenhower, this generation of men and women in uniform know all too well the wages of war, and that includes those of you here at West Point. Four of the service members who stood in the audience when I announced the surge of our forces in Afghanistan gave their lives in that effort. A lot more were wounded.I believe America\u2019s security demanded those deployments. But I am haunted by those deaths. I am haunted by those wounds. And I would betray my duty to you, and to the country we love, if I sent you into harm\u2019s way simply because I saw a problem somewhere in the world that needed to be fixed, or because I was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for America to avoid looking weak.Here\u2019s my bottom line: America must always lead on the world stage. If we don\u2019t, no one else will. The military that you have joined is, and always will be, the backbone of that leadership. But U.S. military action cannot be the only, or even primary, component of our leadership in every instance. Just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail.And because the costs associated with military action are so high, you should expect every civilian leader \u2014 and especially your commander in chief \u2014to be clear about how that awesome power should be used. So let me spend the rest of my time describing my vision for how the United States of America, and our military, should lead in the years to come, for you will be part of that leadership.First, let me repeat a principle I put forward at the outset of my presidency: The United States will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it: when our people are threatened; when our livelihoods are at stake; when the security of our allies is in danger.In these circumstances, we still need to ask tough questions about whether our actions are proportional and effective and just. International opinion matters, but America should never ask permission to protect our people, our homeland or our way of life. (Applause.)On the other hand, when issues of global concern do not pose a direct threat to the United States, when such issues are at stake, when crises arise that stir our conscience or push the world in a more dangerous direction but do not directly threaten us, then the threshold for military action must be higher. In such circumstances, we should not go it alone. Instead, we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action. We have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development, sanctions and isolation, appeals to international law, and, if just, necessary and effective, multilateral military action. In such circumstances, we have to work with others because collective action in these circumstances is more likely to succeed, more likely to be sustained, less likely to lead to costly mistakes.This leads to my second point. For the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America, at home and abroad, remains terrorism, but a strategy that involves invading every country that harbors terrorist networks is na\u00efve and unsustainable. I believe we must shift our counterterrorism strategy, drawing on the successes and shortcomings of our experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to more effectively partner with countries where terrorist networks seek a foothold.And the need for a new strategy reflects the fact that today\u2019s principal threat no longer comes from a centralized Al Qaeda leadership. Instead it comes from decentralized Al Qaeda affiliates and extremists, many with agendas focused in the countries where they operate. And this lessens the possibility of large-scale 9/11-style attacks against the homeland, but it heightens the danger of U.S. personnel overseas being attacked, as we saw in Benghazi. It heightens the danger to less defensible targets, as we saw in a shopping mall in Nairobi. So we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat, one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military too thin or stir up local resentments.We need partners to fight terrorists alongside us. And empowering partners is a large part of what we have done and what we are currently doing in Afghanistan. Together with our allies, America struck huge blows against Al Qaeda core and pushed back against an insurgency that threatened to overrun the country.But sustaining this progress depends on the ability of Afghans to do the job. And that\u2019s why we trained hundreds of thousands of Afghan soldiers and police. Earlier this spring, those forces \u2014 those Afghan forces \u2014 secured an election in which Afghans voted for the first democratic transfer of power in their history. And at the end of this year, a new Afghan president will be in office, and America\u2019s combat mission will be over.Now \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that was an enormous achievement made because of America\u2019s armed forces. But as we move to a train-and-advise mission in Afghanistan, our reduced presence there allows us to more effectively address emerging threats in the Middle East and North Africa. So earlier this year I asked my national security team to develop a plan for a network of partnerships from South Asia to the Sahel.Today, as part of this effort, I am calling on Congress to support a new counterterrorism partnerships fund of up to $5 billion, which will allow us to train, build capacity and facilitate partner countries on the front lines. And these resources will give us flexibility to fulfill different missions, including training security forces in Yemen who\u2019ve gone on the offensive against Al Qaeda, supporting a multinational force to keep the peace in Somalia, working with European allies to train a functioning security force and border patrol in Libya and facilitating French operations in Mali.A critical focus of this effort will be the ongoing crisis in Syria. As frustrating as it is, there are no easy answers there, no military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering anytime soon. As president, I made a decision that we should not put American troops into the middle of this increasingly sectarian civil war, and I believe that is the right decision. But that does not mean we shouldn\u2019t help the Syrian people stand up against a dictator who bombs and starves his own people. And in helping those who fight for the right of all Syrians to choose their own future, we are also pushing back against the growing number of extremists who find safe haven in the chaos.So with the additional resources I\u2019m announcing today, we will step up our efforts to support Syria\u2019s neighbors \u2014 Jordan and Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq \u2014 as they contend with refugees and confront terrorists working across Syria\u2019s borders. I will work with Congress to ramp up support for those in the Syrian opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and brutal dictators. And we will continue to coordinate with our friends and allies in Europe and the Arab World to push for a political resolution of this crisis and to make sure that those countries and not just the United States are contributing their fair share of support to the Syrian people.Let me make one final point about our efforts against terrorism. The partnerships I\u2019ve described do not eliminate the need to take direct action when necessary to protect ourselves. When we have actionable intelligence, that\u2019s what we do, through capture operations, like the one that brought a terrorist involved in the plot to bomb our embassies in 1998 to face justice, or drone strikes, like those we\u2019ve carried out in Yemen and Somalia.There are times when those actions are necessary and we cannot hesitate to protect our people. But as I said last year, in taking direct action, we must uphold standards that reflect our values. That means taking strikes only when we face a continuing, imminent threat, and only where there is no certainty -- there is near certainty of no civilian casualties, for our actions should meet a simple test: We must not create more enemies than we take off the battlefield.I also believe we must be more transparent about both the basis of our counterterrorism actions and the manner in which they are carried out. We have to be able to explain them publicly, whether it is drone strikes or training partners. I will increasingly turn to our military to take the lead and provide information to the public about our efforts. Our intelligence community has done outstanding work and we have to continue to protect sources and methods, but when we cannot explain our efforts clearly and publicly, we face terrorist propaganda and international suspicion, we erode legitimacy with our partners and our people, and we reduce accountability in our own government.And this issue of transparency is directly relevant to a third aspect of American leadership, and that is our effort to strengthen and enforce international order.After World War II, America had the wisdom to shape institutions to keep the peace and support human progress, from NATO and the United Nations, to the World Bank and I.M.F. These institutions are not perfect, but they have been a force multiplier. They reducing the need for unilateral American action and increase restraint among other nations.Now, just as the world has changed, this architecture must change as well. At the height of the Cold War, President Kennedy spoke about the need for a peace based upon a gradual evolution in human institutions. And evolving these international institutions to meet the demands of today must be a critical part of American leadership.Now, there are lot of folks, a lot of skeptics who often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral action. For them, working through international institutions, like the U.N. or respecting international law, is a sign of weakness. I think they\u2019re wrong. Let me offer just two examples why.In Ukraine, Russia\u2019s recent actions recall the days when Soviet tanks rolled into Eastern Europe. But this isn\u2019t the Cold War. Our ability to shape world opinion helped isolate Russia right away. Because of American leadership, the world immediately condemned Russian actions, Europe and the G-7 joined with us to impose sanctions, NATO reinforced our commitment to Eastern European allies, the I.M.F. is helping to stabilize Ukraine\u2019s economy, O.S.C.E. monitors brought the eyes of the world to unstable parts of Ukraine.And this mobilization of world opinion and international institutions served as a counterweight to Russian propaganda and Russian troops on the border and armed militias in ski masks.This weekend, Ukrainians voted by the millions. Yesterday, I spoke to their next president. We don\u2019t know how the situation will play out, and there will remain grave challenges ahead, but standing with our allies on behalf of international order, working with international institutions, has given a chance for the Ukrainian people to choose their future \u2014 without us firing a shot.Similarly, despite frequent warnings from the United States and Israel and others, the Iranian nuclear program steadily advanced for years. But at the beginning of my presidency, we built a coalition that imposed sanctions on the Iranian economy, while extending the hand of diplomacy to the Iranian government. And now we have an opportunity to resolve our differences peacefully. The odds of success are still long, and we reserve all options to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But for the first time in a decade, we have a very real chance of achieving a breakthrough agreement, one that is more effective and durable than what we could have achieved through the use of force. And throughout these negotiations, it has been our willingness to work through multilateral channels that kept the world on our side.The point is, this is American leadership. This is American strength.In each case, we built coalitions to respond to a specific challenge. Now we need to do more to strengthen the institutions that can anticipate and prevent problems from spreading.For example, NATO is the strongest alliance the world has ever known but we\u2019re now working with NATO allies to meet new missions both within Europe, where our eastern allies must be reassured, but also beyond Europe\u2019s borders, where our NATO allies must pull their weight to counterterrorism and respond to failed states and train a network of partners.Likewise, the U.N. provides a platform to keep the peace in states torn apart by conflict. Now, we need to make sure that those nations who provide peacekeepers have the training and equipment to actually keep the peace so that we can prevent the type of killing we\u2019ve seen in Congo and Sudan. We are going to deepen our investment in countries that support these peacekeeping missions because having other nations maintain order in their own neighborhoods lessens the need for us to put our own troops in harm\u2019s way. It\u2019s a smart investment. It\u2019s the right way to lead. (Applause.)Keep in mind, not all international norms relate directly to armed conflict. We have a serious problem with cyberattacks, which is why we\u2019re working to shape and enforce rules of the road to secure our networks and our citizens. In the Asia Pacific, we\u2019re supporting Southeast Asian nations as they negotiate a code of conduct with China on maritime disputes in the South China Sea, and we\u2019re working to resolve these disputes through international law.That spirit of cooperation needs to energize the global effort to combat climate change, a creeping national security crisis that will help shape your time in uniform, as we are called on to respond to refugee flows and natural disasters, and conflicts over water and food, which is why, next year, I intend to make sure America is out front in putting together a global framework to preserve our planet.You see, American influence is always stronger when we lead by example. We cannot exempt ourselves from the rules that apply to everyone else. We can\u2019t call on others to make commitments to combat climate change if a whole lot of our political leaders deny that it is taking place. We can\u2019t try to resolve problems in the South China Sea when we have refused to make sure that the Law of the Sea Convention is ratified by the United States Senate, despite the fact that our top military leaders say the treaty advances our national security. That\u2019s not leadership. That\u2019s retreat. That\u2019s not strength; that\u2019s weakness. It would be utterly foreign to leaders like Roosevelt and Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy.I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being. But what makes us exceptional is not our ability to flout international norms and the rule of law; it is our willingness to affirm them through our actions. (Applause.)And that\u2019s why I will continue to push to close Gitmo, because American values and legal traditions do not permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders. (Applause.) That\u2019s why we\u2019re putting in place new restrictions on how America collects and uses intelligence, because we will have fewer partners and be less effective if a perception takes hold that we\u2019re conducting surveillance against ordinary citizens. (Applause.) America does not simply stand for stability or the absence of conflict, no matter what the cost; we stand for the more lasting peace that can only come through opportunity and freedom for people everywhere -- which brings me to the fourth and final element of American leadership: our willingness to act on behalf of human dignity.America\u2019s support for democracy and human rights goes beyond idealism; it is a matter of national security. Democracies are our closest friends and are far less likely to go to war. Economies based on free and open markets perform better and become markets for our goods. Respect for human rights is an antidote to instability and the grievances that fuel violence and terror.A new century has brought no end to tyranny. In capitals around the globe \u2014 including, unfortunately, some of America\u2019s partners \u2014 there has been a crackdown on civil society. The cancer of corruption has enriched too many governments and their cronies and enraged citizens from remote villages to iconic squares.And watching these trends, or the violent upheavals in parts of the Arab world, it\u2019s easy to be cynical. But remember that because of America\u2019s efforts, because of American diplomacy and foreign assistance, as well as the sacrifices of our military, more people live under elected governments today than at any time in human history. Technology is empowering civil society in ways that no iron fist can control. New breakthroughs are lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. And even the upheaval of the Arab world reflects the rejection of an authoritarian order that was anything but stable, and now offers the long-term prospect of more responsive and effective governance.In countries like Egypt, we acknowledge that our relationship is anchored in security interests, from peace treaties to Israel to shared efforts against violent extremism. So we have not cut off cooperation with the new government, but we can and will persistently press for reforms that the Egyptian people have demanded.And meanwhile, look at a country like Burma, which only a few years ago was an intractable dictatorship and hostile to the United States. Forty million people. Thanks to the enormous courage of the people in that country, and because we took the diplomatic initiative, American leadership, we have seen political reforms opening a once- closed society; a movement by Burmese leadership away from partnership with North Korea in favor of engagement with America and our allies.We\u2019re now supporting reform and badly needed national reconciliation through assistance and investment, through coaxing and, at times, public criticism. And progress there could be reversed, but if Burma succeeds we will have gained a new partner without having fired a shot \u2014 American leadership.In each of these cases, we should not expect change to happen overnight. That\u2019s why we form alliances, not only with governments, but also with ordinary people. For unlike other nations, America is not afraid of individual empowerment. We are strengthened by it. We\u2019re strengthened by civil society. We\u2019re strengthened by a free press. We\u2019re strengthened by striving entrepreneurs and small businesses. We\u2019re strengthened by educational exchange and opportunity for all people and women and girls. That\u2019s who we are. That\u2019s what we represent. (Applause.)I saw that through a trip to Africa last year, where American assistance has made possible the prospect of an AIDS-free generation, while helping Africans care themselves for their sick. We\u2019re helping farmers get their products to market to feed populations once endangered by famine. We aim to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa so people are connected to the promise of the global economy. And all this creates new partners and shrinks the space for terrorism and conflict.Now, tragically, no American security operation can eradicate the threat posed by an extremist group like Boko Haram, the group that kidnapped those girls.And that\u2019s we have to focus not just on rescuing those girls right away, but also on supporting Nigerian efforts to educate its youth. This should be one of the hard-earned lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan, where our military became the strongest advocate for diplomacy and development. They understood that foreign assistance is not an afterthought, something nice to do apart from our national defense, apart from our national security. It is part of what makes us strong.Now, ultimately, global leadership requires us to see the world as it is, with all its danger and uncertainty. We have to be prepared for the worst, prepared for every contingency, but American leadership also requires us to see the world as it should be \u2014 a place where the aspirations of individual human beings really matters, where hopes and not just fears govern; where the truths written into our founding documents can steer the currents of history in the direction of justice. And we cannot do that without you.Class of 2014, you have taken this time to prepare on the quiet banks of the Hudson. You leave this place to carry forward a legacy that no other military in human history can claim. You do so as part of a team that extends beyond your units or even our Armed Forces, for in the course of your service, you will work as a team with diplomats and development experts.You\u2019ll get to know allies and train partners. And you will embody what it means for America to lead the world.Next week I will go to Normandy to honor the men who stormed the beaches there. And while it\u2019s hard for many Americans to comprehend the courage and sense of duty that guided those who boarded small ships, it\u2019s familiar to you. At West Point, you define what it means to be a patriot.Three years ago Gavin White graduated from this academy. He then served in Afghanistan. Like the soldiers who came before him, Gavin was in a foreign land, helping people he\u2019d never met, putting himself in harm\u2019s way for the sake of his community and his family and the folks back home. Gavin lost one of his legs in an attack. I met him last year at Walter Reed. He was wounded but just as determined as the day that he arrived here at West Point. And he developed a simple goal. Today his sister Morgan will graduate. And true to his promise, Gavin will be there to stand and exchange salutes with her. (Cheers, applause.)We have been through a long season of war. We have faced trials that were not foreseen and we\u2019ve seen divisions about how to move forward. But there is something in Gavin\u2019s character, there is something in the American character, that will always triumph.Leaving here, you carry with you the respect of your fellow citizens. You will represent a nation with history and hope on our side. Your charge now is not only to protect our country, but to do what is right and just. As your commander in chief, I know you will. May God bless you. May God bless our men and women in uniform. And may God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "South Korea\u2019s Tragic Failure", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUSAN, South Korea \u2014 It was an autumn day 31 years ago. I was a high school freshman, excited about the field trip. After taking the train to the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula to the harbor city of Mokpo, my classmates and I boarded a ferry en route to Jeju Island, the same place the Sewol was headed on April 16 when it sank, leaving more than 300 people presumed dead, scores of them schoolchildren. We were given no information about safety or evacuation procedures. I never saw life vests or lifeboats. The black ocean had its gaping maw wide open before us, but danger was not on our minds. We were young and the big ship was nothing more than a huge playground to us. The banner hanging over the school gate where we gathered for the trip read, \u201cFor the Creation of an Advanced Fatherland.\u201d Chun Doo-hwan, the military dictator at the time, proclaimed his intention to make South Korea an advanced nation every time he spoke, and as a result, this slogan was plastered everywhere. After a long period of hardship under imperialism, civil war and division, the drive to become a modern nation was something akin to a national religion. Most South Koreans, myself included, believed that the manufacturing and selling of products that the West wanted was our ticket to modernity. Just as Chun Doo-hwan promised, the South Korean economy took off. In 1988, we were host to the Summer Olympics in Seoul. The eastern coast, where once only fishermen had lived, was transformed into an enormous shipyard. Hyundai started making automobiles and Samsung started making televisions. South Koreans\u2019 sense of national pride soared. When traveling abroad, we would be greeted by ads for South Korean products the moment we stepped foot outside a foreign airport. We became one of the world\u2019s top 10 trading nations. Our soccer team represented Asia in consecutive World Cups. South Korean films played in theaters around the globe.The Sewol tragedy has called into question all of these great achievements. Many South Koreans have begun to wonder if the unfettered growth \u2014 and the lax government regulation that accompanied it \u2014 has come at too high a price. To outsiders, the Sewol disaster may seem like another tragedy that we will inevitably overcome. But here in South Korea, it feels like the country may never be the same again. It has traumatized our national psyche and undercut our self-image. We are awash in self-reflection. Has all of our progress been a facade? Are we, in fact, an advanced country? One inconsolable parent put it best on the cover of a national weekly: \u201cIs this what we call a nation?\u201d It\u2019s difficult to find meaning in a tragedy of this proportion \u2014 which was a preventable accident \u2014 especially when emotions are still so raw, but there are some practical lessons to be learned. According to many news reports, the Sewol was carrying more than three times its legal limit of cargo, and with that load improperly secured to the decks, the boat tilted and sank, taking with it with hundreds of passengers. The captain appears to have violated procedure by leaving the ship in command of a young and inexperienced mate during his break. No more than two of the 44 lifeboats on board the ship were deployed as the ship sank, and the necessary safety protocols either weren\u2019t followed or never existed. Crew members ordered passengers over the intercom to stay in their cabins when they should have been ordering an evacuation. Like many South Koreans, I\u2019m furious that the senior crew members, including the captain, were among the first people to escape from the sinking ship. Other South Koreans with the responsibility of taking care of passengers acted completely differently from the crew of the Sewol when faced with an emergency. Last July, the crew of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, which crash-landed in San Francisco, stayed aboard the aircraft until the end and heroically guided their passengers to safety. Female flight attendants carried injured male passengers on their backs off the burning airplane. What was the difference between these two groups? Rigorous training. Asiana and Korean Air are both well-known for the exhaustive safety training their flight crews receive. New crew members must go through several weeks of safety training on an aircraft simulator, practicing emergency evacuations, water landings, fire safety protocols and emergency medical treatment. The airlines enforce mandatory annual refresher courses for their flight crews.By contrast, throughout all of last year, Chonghaejin Marine Company, the owner and operator of the Sewol, only spent about $520 on safety education for its employees. (Their entertainment expenses, on the other hand, were about $59,000.) Surviving crew members spoke of having to consult the emergency manual as the ship was going down. But the lack of training is only partly to blame for the Sewol disaster. Poor government oversight of the shipping industry was also a factor, which explains much of the anger among South Koreans for President Park Geun-hye, whose approval ratings are dropping fast. The government, it turns out, has been neglecting safety regulations for passenger ships and did not mandate safety education requirements for the crews of passenger ships. As a result of the Sewol sinking, several current and former officials from a maritime inspection have come under investigation. Ferry crews must have much more stringent training requirements. The coast guard should conduct periodic surprise inspections to check the crews\u2019 knowledge of safety procedures and to confirm that all of the safety equipment is in good working order. And the government should drastically step up its maritime inspection regime.Three weeks after the Sewol sinking, South Korea is still reeling. We can already see subtle shifts in society. Public trust in authority appears to have collapsed. On May 2, two Seoul subway trains collided, knocking out the power in the cars. The passengers ignored the announcement asking them to stay put, and immediately began prying open the train doors to escape. It\u2019s unlikely South Koreans will ever again trust the voice on the intercom when a disaster is unfolding. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ryanair Feels the Squeeze as Rivals Lower Fares", "Date": "2014-05-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 A decade of uninterrupted growth for the European budget airline Ryanair stalled last year, the company confirmed on Monday, as the region\u2019s flagging economy and high unemployment drove more rival carriers into the race for cost-conscious travelers.But the airline, Europe\u2019s largest by number of passengers, said investments in a new digital strategy and measures to improve customer service were paying off in the form of increased bookings.Michael O\u2019Leary, Ryanair\u2019s chief executive, described the performance as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but predicted that slightly higher fares, combined with a modest increase in traffic, would lift profit this year to \u20ac580 million to \u20ac620 million.With several large European airlines in the midst of deep restructurings aimed, in part, at competing with Ryanair, the scramble for passengers on regional routes has grown more intense. Pressure to lower ticket prices has eroded short-haul revenues for most carriers, while fuel costs have remained stubbornly high globally.Although airlines like Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and Iberia of Spain have extensive networks in Asia and North America that generate significant revenue to offset their underperforming European business, the core of Ryanair\u2019s business remains tied to the fates of the fragile economies in Britain, France, Italy and Spain.Ryanair said on Monday that its average fares fell by 4 percent last year, compared with the previous 12 months, while the number of passengers rose 3 percent to 81.7 million.The airline said it would limit the addition of new routes and aircraft to its fleet this year, which should lift average fares for the year by 2 percent, while traffic was expected to increase 4 percent to just under 85 million passengers.But Mr. O\u2019Leary said that Ryanair remained \u201cvery cautious\u201d about the second half of the year, about which he said \u201cwe currently have zero visibility.\u201d While bookings so far this year had been strong, bolstered by strong Easter traffic, the airline warned that fares could fall as much as 8 percent in the winter season, traditionally the weakest period for airlines in the Northern Hemisphere.Led by Mr. O\u2019Leary, Ryanair in October began an aggressive charm offensive on social media networks like Twitter and Facebook, aimed at softening its public image. In addition, it revamped a notoriously cumbersome booking website and began cutting some of the fees it charged for checking bags and modifying boarding passes. This year, Ryanair introduced \u2014 for a fee \u2014 services like reserved seating and priority boarding, in the hope of wooing business travelers.Such fees, in addition to onboard sales of food, lottery tickets and other products, led to a 17 percent jump in ancillary revenue last year, Ryanair said, adding that such revenue now represented 25 percent of the airline\u2019s total sales.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rise in U.S. Producer Prices Suggests Healthier Inflation", "Date": "2014-05-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prices that companies receive for their goods and services rose in April by the most in 19 months, a sign that inflation may be picking up from very low levels.The Producer Price Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent from March to April, the Labor Department said on Wednesday, after a 0.5 percent increase from February to March. April\u2019s increases were led by higher food prices and greater retailer and wholesaler profit margins.Over the last 12 months, producer prices have risen 2.1 percent, the biggest 12-month gain in more than two years. That figure is roughly in line with the Federal Reserve\u2019s inflation target of 2 percent. The Producer Price Index measures price changes before they reach consumers.Excluding the volatile categories of food, energy and retailer and wholesaler margins, however, the month-to-month increase in April was smaller. Core prices rose 0.3 percent from March.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the profit margins dropped sharply over the winter before increasing in the last two months, \u201cso we can\u2019t yet say an upward trend is emerging.\u201dStill, the report suggests that inflation may be picking up after coming in below 2 percent for two years. That could reflect better economic health: Higher inflation is generally a sign of rising consumer demand.Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said that a sharp gain in profit margins for machinery and equipment wholesalers drove overall margins higher. That is a sign that companies are stepping up their purchases of large equipment after a weak first quarter, he said.A crucial question is whether the sharp increases in producer prices of the last two months will flow into consumer prices. Wage increases have been weak, and unemployment remains high at 6.3 percent. The squeeze for consumers means that manufacturers and retailers have not been able to raise prices much. April\u2019s Consumer Price Index will be released on Thursday.Mr. Dales said he expected that consumers would pay a bit more by 2015. The two months of big increases have lifted wholesale inflation from historically low levels. The producer price index rose just 1.2 percent in 2013 after a 1.4 percent increase in 2012.Food costs jumped 2.7 percent in April, the highest in more than three years, driven by an 8.4 percent increase in meat prices.Profit margins received by retailers and wholesalers rose 1.4 percent in April, the same as in the previous month. Margins are rebounding after sharp drops over the winter months. Profits had been held down by discounting after the winter holidays and by harsh weather in January and February that kept shoppers at home.Low inflation has enabled the Fed to pursue stimulus programs to try to bolster spending, hiring and economic growth. It has begun to unwind some of its stimulus, cutting its monthly bond purchases to $45 billion from $85 billion last year. The bond purchases are intended to lower long-term interest rates.But the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate at nearly zero since December 2008. Higher inflation could raise pressure on the Fed to increase that rate earlier than it had planned.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Recommits to a Sweeping Overhaul of Market Policies", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySHANGHAI \u2014 China pledged on Friday to push ahead with a broad range of overhauls to its financial markets as it seeks to encourage more efficient capital allocation, increase foreign investment and improve transparency of its markets.In a wide-ranging statement of policy principles, the State Council, China\u2019s cabinet, said it would develop a system for direct bond issuance by local governments, streamline the approval process for initial public offerings and remove some restrictions on the use of financial derivatives.Separately on Friday, the Securities Association of China issued new rules governing I.P.O.s, a possible sign that listings will be allowed to resume after they being halted this year.While the government has previously discussed many of the changes mentioned by the cabinet, the statement signals a fresh commitment to enact the proposals.\u201cChina\u2019s capital markets are still not mature, and some systemic problems still exist,\u201d the State Council said in a statement on its website late on Friday. \u201cNew problems are continually appearing.\u201dIn China\u2019s policy-making process, the State Council sets out goals and principles, leaving relevant agencies \u2014 including the People\u2019s Bank of China, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Banking Regulatory Commission \u2014 to follow up with specific regulations.Quotas would be increased for both inward and outward foreign investment under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor and Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor programs, the cabinet said.The council also said it would create a system for direct bond issues by local governments. Currently, they are forbidden from directly selling bonds or borrowing from banks, but have skirted this ban using opaque special-purpose vehicles to borrow.On derivatives, the council promised to develop more varieties of commodity future and options, commodity indexes and tradable carbon emission credits. It pledged to reduce restrictions on the use of derivatives by both institutional investors and companies for the purpose of hedging and risk management.The council also said it would strengthen enforcement against false disclosures by corporate bond issuers and against insider trading in the bond market. It said it would work to develop the market for private equity investment funds, private asset management plans and venture capital funds, while cracking down on illegal fund-raising practices. The council said it planned to allow some bonds to trade on both the interbank bond market and stock exchanges; currently, the two markets are strictly segregated.The release of the new, detailed rules governing I.P.O.s might be a signal that new listings will be allowed to come to the market soon, after a two-month hiatus while regulators adjusted regulations.The new set of rules, published on the website of the Securities Association of China, are technical in nature, dealing with standards for underwriter and investor participation in I.P.O. share auctions.In a bid to shore up weak domestic markets, the China Securities Regulatory Commission put an unofficial freeze on I.P.O.s in late 2012. The halt was widely seen as an attempt to support market indexes, which retail investors complained were being diluted by a constant influx of new listings even as net capital inflows into Chinese stocks generally stagnated.The suspension was relaxed only this year, when the securities regulator allowed a batch of previously approved companies to list in January and February.But problems with the listings, including accusations of overpricing and insider manipulation, resulted in dozens of companies\u2019 canceling their I.P.O. plans while the securities regulator investigated underwriters and inside investors. At the same time, the securities regulator effectively held off from processing applications from more than 600 companies in order to revise regulations.Late last month, the securities regulator resumed publishing I.P.O. applications on its website, and so far nearly 300 companies have submitted preliminary prospectuses. Several companies have been approved to list, but none have yet entered the final phrase of the process in which the I.P.O. dates and fund-raising targets are formalized.While this is seen as good news for brokerage firms, investment banks, underwriters and for the companies themselves, individual investors are less sanguine. The securities regulator has been strengthening management of the auction system and the way I.P.O.s can be priced, trying to restore confidence among retail investors concerned that the system is set up to benefit insiders.Beijing has committed to eventually stepping out of the I.P.O. approval process, switching to a registration-based system similar to that employed in developed economies, where the market effectively decides who gets to list and at what price.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "State Energy Plan Would Alter New York Utilities", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York State is proposing to turn its electric utilities into a new kind of entity that would buy electricity from hundreds or thousands of small generators and set prices for that electricity and for the costs of running the power grid.The proposal anticipates a radically different electric system, dominated by decentralized production, much of it of renewable, intermittent energy sources like solar or wind power. The Public Service Commission is considering how the utilities would have to change.\u201cIt\u2019s really quite a revolutionary change that\u2019s being proposed,\u201d said Charles A. Zielinski, a lawyer in Washington who specializes in electricity and who was chairman of the New York commission from 1978 to 1981. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Mr. Zielinski said. \u201cIf New York can pull this off, it would be huge.\u201dIn the 1990s, the state pushed companies like Con Edison to sell their generating stations to independent producers, and to become primarily distribution entities. Now they would become traffic cops in a two-way flow of power.The underlying idea is that the existing system of regulation does not encourage the utilities or independent parties to produce a cleaner, more efficient energy grid.The Public Service Commission will hold a public session on the proposal next Monday.One group that could be hurt is the companies that build and own central power stations. But Gavin J. Donohue, the president and chief executive of their trade association, the Independent Power Producers of New York, said his members could prosper building smaller, \u201cdistributed\u201d generators as well, depending on how the rules are written.Distributed generation could provide electricity to local areas even after a hurricane or other natural disaster. \u201cThe state has made a real compelling case, certainly in light of natural disasters and storms we\u2019ve dealt with, to deliver energy in a more innovative, progressive way,\u201d Mr. Donohue said.Ahmad Faruqui, an electricity expert at the Brattle Group, a national consulting firm, said the New York report was drawing widespread interest because it addressed a critical national issue: how the proliferation of rooftop solar installations is making the current system of pricing electricity obsolete. Utilities calculate the costs of maintaining their systems, and add a charge onto every kilowatt-hour sold.\u201cThe rate design they\u2019ve had for years is not going to work,\u201d Mr. Faruqui said.But the Public Service Commission proposal has few numbers and does not project how energy costs in the future might compare with costs today.Advocates of efficiency argue that the price per kilowatt-hour might rise, but with households and industries using fewer kilowatt-hours, their bills would decline.It is also not clear from the report how the new framework would ensure the presumed environmental benefits, like lower output of climate-changing emissions. And some experts say that if the system encouraged more small generators fed by natural gas, it might also move the production of conventional pollutants into more populated areas. Burning natural gas in thousands of locations would make it almost impossible to capture carbon from power plants and pump it underground to avoid worsening climate change.But the proposal also holds out the possibility that investments in small-scale generation, or in reducing peak demand, could be far better focused than they are today. Stuart Nachmias, a vice president of Consolidated Edison, said the value of such investments to the system depended on precisely where they were located, and whether they were in places that would otherwise require new spending on substations or feeder cables.For example, Mr. Nachmias said, Con Ed would pay more for extra kilowatt-hours of energy, or reduction in peak demand, in places that were currently overloaded. \u201cBut if the wires are fine and there\u2019s capability, it\u2019s not going to help us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a nighttime peaking area, solar isn\u2019t going to help us.\u201d He said, however, that under the proposed system, Con Ed might find it cost effective to subsidize energy storage in such areas, or tiny gas-fired plants.The proposal, hailed by Gov, Andrew M. Cuomo and other state officials, comes at a time of uncertainty for utilities around the country. And it represents a shift in focus, from trying to balance supply and demand over a broad area to concentrating on the neighborhood level.But the concept faces several challenges. The economics of wind plants do not favor small or isolated turbines. Solar power is also cheaper in larger concentrations. In both cases, local generation would reduce the amount of energy lost in transmission, but it is far from clear that the saving would outweigh the economies of scale from bigger plants.

{"Headline": "What Housing Recovery?", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorLOS ANGELES \u2014 RECENTLY there\u2019s been a lot of happy talk about the nation\u2019s housing recovery. Frequent reports about rising prices suggest that the tens of millions of people whose homes lost value just have to wait until the recovery reaches their neighborhood to lift them out of crisis. But this supposed housing recovery is bypassing many of our cities and towns.The total value of America\u2019s owner-occupied housing remains $3.2 trillion below 2006 levels. According to Zillow, a real estate database, 9.8 million households still owe more on their mortgages than the market value of their homes. That\u2019s one-fifth of all mortgaged homes. Without government intervention, many of them are at risk of joining the almost five million households that have already suffered through foreclosure since the housing bubble burst in 2007.How bad is it? More than 10 million Americans, spread across 23 states, live in ZIP codes where between 43 percent and 76 percent of homeowners are under water. The biggest concentrations are in Georgia, Florida, Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. The cities in the worst shape are Las Vegas, Atlanta, Jacksonville, Orlando and Chicago. Places with so many underwater homes are toxic; they depress the value of surrounding homes and undermine local governments\u2019 fiscal health.The blame for this tragedy lies mostly with banks\u2019 risky, reckless and sometimes illegal lending practices. The story is a familiar one. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, millions of Americans bought or refinanced homes in an overheated market. Mortgage brokers lied or misled borrowers about the terms of these mortgages, often pushing borrowers into high-interest subprime loans, even when they were eligible for conventional mortgages.They particularly targeted minority areas. In 2006, when subprime lending was at its peak, 54 percent of blacks, 47 percent of Latinos and 18 percent of whites received high-priced loans, according to the Federal Reserve Board.Not surprisingly, the nation\u2019s worst underwater areas are disproportionately in black and Latino neighborhoods. In almost two-thirds of the hardest-hit ZIP codes, African-Americans and Latinos account for at least half of the residents.The banks\u2019 risky loans eventually came crashing down, devastating communities and causing financial havoc. The federal government rescued the banks, but nobody came to the rescue of the communities the banks left behind.The best solution to this quagmire is for banks and other financial institutions to modify underwater mortgages to their current market value, an approach called \u201cprincipal reduction.\u201d If lenders rewrote the loans to reflect fair-market values, owners would have lower monthly payments, which would free them to put millions of dollars into local economies. Cities would have more stable property tax revenues, and lenders would ultimately benefit by having fewer delinquent loans.Of course, many banks no longer own the loans they made. They pooled large numbers of subprime loans into private securities and sold them. The companies that service these securities generally refuse to countenance the idea of \u201cprincipal reduction.\u201d Yes, some homeowners have been able to persuade lenders to reset their loans, but most get the cold shoulder or a bureaucratic runaround.In some cities, though, nonprofit lenders, like New Jersey Community Capital and Hogar Hispano, have stepped into the void, raising capital and purchasing troubled loans in order to modify them on affordable terms. But too few loan holders have been willing to sell to these homeowner-friendly groups.In 2012, some of the biggest banks signed a settlement agreement with 49 state attorneys general to modify mortgages, but many of them continue to heap abuse on their customers, and sufficient relief has not reached trapped homeowners.The Obama administration created several initiatives to help troubled borrowers, but these programs do not require banks to reset loans as a condition of getting federal funds. The government\u2019s Home Affordable Modification Program has helped only one-quarter of the four million homeowners it was supposed to reach.Worse, the federal government has actually been an obstacle to reform. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has refused to allow these two mortgage giants to reduce the principal on underwater mortgages that they own or guarantee. All it would take is for President Obama\u2019s new appointee as F.H.F.A. director, former Representative Melvin Watt, to change the policy, an action that does not require congressional approval. He should do so immediately.Meanwhile, faced with this predicament, some municipalities have been trying to take matters into their own hands. Late last year, Richmond, Calif., was the first city to develop a plan to use its power of eminent domain to buy underwater mortgages at their current market value and to refinance them, but many other localities are likely to follow. A number of responsible for-profit and nonprofit lenders stand ready to do business with them so that local governments don\u2019t have to use tax dollars to purchase these loans.Dealing with this problem on a city-by-city basis may not be the most efficient way to confront a national crisis, but in the face of Wall Street intransigence and federal indifference, cities have had to find their own way to restore the lost wealth of their constituents.Peter Dreier is a professor of politics at Occidental College.

{"Headline": "Why License a Florist?", "Date": "2014-05-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMINNEAPOLIS \u2014 IN Minnesota, more classroom time is required to become a cosmetologist than to become a lawyer. Becoming a manicurist takes double the number of hours of instruction as a paramedic. In Louisiana, the only state in the country that requires licenses for florists, monks were until recently forbidden to sell coffins because they were not licensed funeral directors. These regulations are not just unusual cases of state laws run amok but deliberate policies from one of the fastest growing labor market institutions in the United States: government licensing of jobs. This form of regulation \u2014 largely established by state governments and implemented through their licensing boards \u2014 is often referred to as \u201cthe right to practice.\u201d Under these laws, working in a licensed occupation is illegal without first meeting government standards.In the 1970s, about 10 percent of individuals who worked had to have licenses, but by 2008, almost 30 percent of the work force needed them. With this explosion of licensing laws has come a national patchwork of stealth regulation that has, among other things, restricted labor markets, innovation and worker mobility. There is a role for government in protecting the public from incompetent or unscrupulous service providers, but there is little reason for math teachers to be relicensed every time they move from one state to another. These requirements put additional burdens on teachers that reduce the ability of good teachers to find work and schools to find good teachers. Having more flexible reciprocity between states for occupations like teachers would allow these professionals to move to jobs more easily. But even better would be to stop requiring licenses for jobs whose potential harm to the public is minimal, like tour guides, and instead allow for certification. This lesser form of regulation provides a distinction in the eyes of a consumer but does not forbid others from offering the service. Yet the growth of occupational regulation has prompted rare bipartisan opposition. On the left, there are concerns about inflated prices for essential services like plumbers and the availability of those services for people in or near poverty. Many of the jobs that require licenses are relatively low-skilled, like barbers and nurse\u2019s aides, and licensing creates a barrier that might keep low-income people out of those positions. Occupational licensing, moreover, does nothing to close the inequality gap in the United States. For consumers, there is likely to be a redistribution effect in the \u201cwrong\u201d direction, as higher income consumers have more choice among higher quality purveyors of a service and lower income individuals are left with fewer affordable service options.On the right, the issue is one of economic liberty. From that perspective, government-issued licenses largely protect occupations from competition. Conservatives often see members of the regulated occupation supporting licensing laws under claims of \u201cpublic health and safety.\u201d However, these laws do much more to stop competition and less to enhance the quality of the service. Also, all consumers do not demand the same level of quality. If licensure \u201cimproves quality\u201d by restricting entry into the profession, then some consumers will be forced to pay for more \u201cquality\u201d than they want or need. Not everyone wants a board-licensed hairdresser. If both the left and right oppose more occupational regulation, why is it growing? From the time of medieval guilds, service providers have had strong incentives to create barriers to entry for their professions in order to raise wages. The Dartmouth economist Charles Wheelan\u2019s research showed in the late 1990s that respiratory therapists who organized themselves and raised their profession\u2019s dues in order to lobby for licensing laws tended to be more successful in getting these statutes passed. In contrast, consumers who will be affected by the higher fees of, say, a licensed manicurist are unorganized and arguably underrepresented in the political process. Occupational licensure has a large and growing impact on labor markets and consumers, but has yet to draw significant public attention or scrutiny. The left and right seem to be in agreement that policy makers need to revisit the process for creating licensure regulations and consider amending or rolling back existing laws in favor of lesser forms of regulations such as certification. Ultimately, we all would benefit from wiser, not more, occupational licensing. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Thai Military Declares Martial Law, Protesters Continue Their Rallies", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Questions intensified about the intentions of Thailand\u2019s military\u00a0on Wednesday, a day after the head of the army declared martial law and curbed media freedoms but allowed protesters to continue their demonstrations \u2014 which they did with enthusiasm.It was at least the 12th time the military has intervened in Thailand since the country switched from an absolute monarchy to a democracy eight decades ago. It was the first military intervention in Thailand\u2019s latest political convulsions, which began six months ago and have paralyzed the government.In the first few hours, nobody knew exactly what to make of the declaration, which gives the military broad powers to disperse and arrest protesters, censor the news media and control many government functions.Military vehicles and armed soldiers took positions on Bangkok streets, some television stations closed, and the military issued a warning against provocative comments on social media. Yet, in many neighborhoods, not a soldier could be seen. Workplaces and schools remained open, people shopped, the stock market closed the day 1 percent lower and traffic backed up as it would have on any other workday. Tourists could be seen snapping photographs with smiling soldiers.Thousands of Thais determined to show their opposition toward the governing party assembled along a broad avenue, dancing and cheering in the oppressive heat.\u201cPlease protest with joy!\u201d said Sathit Wongnongtoey, a former member of Parliament whose voice boomed over them. \u201cOur protest will get even more intense \u2014 24 hours a day!\u201dPro-government demonstrators also continued their rallies on the outskirts of Bangkok.Thitinan Pongsudhirak, one of the foremost experts on Thai politics, said, \u201cIt\u2019s technically martial law, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it.\u201dYet the business-as-usual scenes on the streets of Bangkok masked what analysts described as a high-stakes intervention in Thai politics by a military that has a long, checkered past of overthrowing governments and ruling despotically.Martial law was imposed without any notification to the caretaker government, according to Chaturon Chaisang, the education minister, who questioned the military\u2019s motives.Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the army chief, a brash and outspoken career soldier who for months had publicly expressed reluctance to become involved in the political crisis, cast himself on Tuesday as a mediator who would summon all parties and forge an agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I declared martial law; otherwise, no one would listen,\u201d he said.General Prayuth denied that the action was a military coup. But he was evasive about how long martial law would be in force. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me how long this will last,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants to implement it for too long. I want all sides to seek a solution quickly.\u201dHe deflected reporters\u2019 questions about whether he would answer to the caretaker government.General Prayuth faces a daunting challenge: to cajole some form of reconciliation in a society split between the old-money elites in Bangkok who are backing the antigovernment demonstrators and a populist governing party with a power base in the provinces, led by a nouveau riche tycoon, Thaksin Shinawatra.The last military coup was in 2006, and it overthrew the same political movement that dominates the country today. But analysts say the current impasse is more intractable than anything the military has taken on in the past.Thailand, a leading economy of Southeast Asia, has been without a functioning government since December. And with the eyes of the world watching, the country is so gravely divided that it has lost the ability to govern itself.\u201cThe army is taking a big risk here,\u201d Mr. Thitinan said. \u201cThey will have to bang heads to make a compromise happen. They will be pulled in different directions. If they are seen as sliding toward one side, things could turn nasty very quickly.\u201dForeign reaction was largely critical. Human Rights Watch called it a \u201cde facto coup.\u201d \u201cThe military has pulled a 100-year-old law off the shelf that makes the civilian administration subordinate to the military, effectively rendering the executive, legislative and judicial branches powerless,\u201d Brad Adams, the director of the organization\u2019s Asia division, said in a statement.The Thai military sought to convince the public that the army had acted in the country\u2019s best interests. A message Tuesday morning on a military-controlled television station read: \u201cWe urge people not to panic. Please carry on your daily activities as usual. The imposition of martial law is not a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201dIt remained unclear late Tuesday which side would benefit from the military\u2019s intervention.If the military decides to force an election \u2014 and ensures that the opposition does not obstruct it \u2014 the governing party would probably be seen as the ultimate beneficiary. But if the military postpones elections, it will strengthen the hand of the Bangkok establishment.The United States urged respect for \u201cdemocratic principles\u201d in a statement released hours after the announcement of martial law. \u201cWe expect the Army to honor its commitment to make this a temporary action to prevent violence, and to not undermine democratic institutions,\u201d the statement said.Japan, long one of Thailand\u2019s largest investors, said it had \u201cgrave concerns about the situation in Thailand.\u201dGeneral Prayuth was prickly in responding to questions.When reporters repeated a question about whether and when elections would take place, he snapped, \u201cI suggest you go visit a doctor and do something about your ear.\u201dPoypiti Amatatham contributed reporting.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Struggle to Turn Economic Gains Into Political Ones", "Date": "2014-05-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe White House is certain to seize on the jobless rate \u2014 along with a rising stock market and economic forecasts predicting faster growth in the months ahead \u2014 to try to retain control of the Senate and hold off Republican gains in the House. But the positive economic news is no guarantee of electoral success for the Democrats, even if the trend continues through the summer.Although the unemployment rate is now at the lowest level of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, his job approval rating is also near a record low for him. The president has struggled to capitalize politically on the improving economy, in part because so many middle-income Americans are not reaping the fruits of the recovery. Wages remain flat for millions of people, enormous stock market gains have flowed largely to the most affluent Americans and housing remains depressed around the country. \u201cOne number, good or bad, won\u2019t change everything\u201d for voters, said Robert Gibbs, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s first press secretary. \u201cA sustained pattern of good numbers, from unemployment to wages to consumer confidence, could make a real difference come November. But for that to happen, it has to feel real to them.\u201d For that reason, Mr. Obama on Friday tempered his enthusiasm for the economic news with a sharp message about improving the welfare of the middle class. \u201cWe have to keep a relentless focus on job creation and creating more opportunities for working families,\u201d Mr. Obama said, hailing the \u201cgrit and determination of the American people\u201d for creating \u201c9.2 million new jobs over 50 consecutive months of job growth.\u201dMr. Obama no longer has to worry about an election of his own. But the job numbers remain critical to his party\u2019s fortunes in elections in November that will have a drastic impact on the balance of his term and help shape his legacy. A Republican takeover of the Senate, which a number of Democrats say is possible, would limit Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to shape the judiciary, including the Supreme Court, and would give Republicans a new platform from which to attack the president\u2019s agenda.Republicans were quick to point out that the jobs report on Friday also showed a surge in the number of people not participating in the labor market, indicating what they say is a growing sense of hopelessness among those who are consistently unable to find a job. In addition, Republican lawmakers noted that the country\u2019s economy barely grew in the first quarter. \u201cPresident Obama ought to call on his Democratic-led Senate to take up the stacks of House-passed jobs measures so we can get this economy moving again,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner said in a statement.Republican candidates, aided by independent campaign groups with deep pockets, are already waging intense attacks on Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, which remains unpopular among voters in many of the most contested races. They have seized on crises overseas to paint Mr. Obama as a weak leader, betting that his slumping approval numbers will be a drag on the Democratic candidates.Republicans are hoping to return the favor this year, in part by arguing that Mr. Obama\u2019s policies have kept economic growth and job gains smaller than they should have been. Democrats will argue against returning to economic policies they say created the recession.At the White House, where administration officials were happy about the employment news, they nonetheless tread carefully in public, knowing that broad economic improvement is often disconnected from the individual success or failure that translates into people\u2019s choices at the ballot box.\u201cThese macro numbers aren\u2019t particularly meaningful to your average American and to voters,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, the president\u2019s communications director. \u201cThey experience the economy through their own lives. For the people in the middle class and below, it continues to be a very hard struggle.\u201dIn his remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama spent only a moment trumpeting the good news about jobs, then quickly shifted focus to repeat his demand that Republicans in Congress sign on to Democratic economic proposals.\u201cThere\u2019s plenty more that Congress should be doing, from raising the minimum wage to creating good construction jobs rebuilding America,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd I want to work with them wherever I can, but I keep acting on my own wherever I must.\u201dWhile White House officials said there was no question that an improving economy was helpful to the president and Democratic candidates \u2014 \u201cIt creates a friendly environment for our message to be received in,\u201d Ms. Palmieri said \u2014 Democrats said the party\u2019s success would depend more on how well Mr. Obama and the Democratic candidates do in convincing voters that overall economic improvement will make a difference in their lives.\u201cHe\u2019s got to keep challenging Republicans to put their obstruction aside and help build even more progress on these numbers,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, who as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is charged with leading the uphill battle to regain control of the House. \u201cWhen he does that, they have no defense.\u201dMr. Israel said the economic news would be a \u201cbig time\u201d part of his party\u2019s message in this year\u2019s most competitive contests. \u201cWe will clearly contrast Democratic progress on the economy and job growth with House Republican obstruction on the economy and government shutdowns,\u201d Mr. Israel said in an interview on Friday. \u201cThese will be defining issues.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Factory Activity Shows Positive Signs", "Date": "2014-05-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 This month, China\u2019s factory sector turned in its best performance in five months, a preliminary survey by HSBC showed on Thursday, though overall manufacturing still contracted slightly, in a suggestion that the outlook remains uncertain.The HSBC flash China manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index, or P.M.I., recovered to 49.7 in May from April\u2019s final reading of 48.1, beating a Reuters poll forecast of 48.1.But the data remained just below the 50-point level, which separates a monthly growth in activity from a contraction, indicating that manufacturers actually experienced a slight drop in business.Still, those hoping for any sign of stabilization in China\u2019s wobbly economy may find some relief in Thursday\u2019s report.Asian stocks and emerging Asian currencies extended early gains after the report, while the Australian dollar edged higher.A breakdown of the survey results showed the handful of closely followed indexes that measure output and domestic and foreign demand all improved substantially in May to rise above the 50-point mark, from sub-50 levels in April.New export orders, an indicator of foreign demand, showed the biggest turnaround. The index climbed 3.4 points to 52.7, a level not reached in more than three years.\u201cThe improvement was broad-based, with both new orders and new export orders back in expansionary territory,\u201d said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC. \u201cDisinflationary pressures also eased over the month, and output prices increased for the first time since November 2013.\u201d\u201cSome tentative signs of stabilization are emerging, partly as a result of the recent mini-stimulus measures and lower borrowing costs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut downside risks to growth remain, particularly as the property market continues to cool. We think more policy easing is needed to put a floor under growth in the coming months.\u201dHe also noted the employment index had fallen further to 47.3, which implies that this month\u2019s uptick in sentiment had not yet filtered through to the labor market. Of the 11 subindexes in the survey, all but those for employment and stocks of finished goods rose from April.In the case of employment, the index fell more than a point to well under 50, the 13th consecutive month that jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector.Any marked weakening in the labor market would raise alarm bells for China\u2019s government, which regards healthy employment levels as a top policy priority and an important condition for social stability.Premier Li Keqiang said in March that it is all right if economic growth comes in slightly below the government\u2019s target of 7.5 percent, as long as the job market holds up.Hit by unsteady global demand, slowing domestic investment growth and a cooling property market, China\u2019s economic growth fell to an 18-month low in the first three months of this year.Economists polled by Reuters believe growth in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, will dip to a 24-year low of 7.3 percent this year, just ahead of the 7.2 percent expansion that Mr. Li has said is necessary for a robust labor market.Japanese manufacturing activity also contracted in May but at a slower pace than the previous month, a similar preliminary survey showed, in a sign of tentative recovery after a sales tax increase in April led to a slowdown in consumer spending.The Markit/JMMA flash Japan manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to a seasonally adjusted 49.9 in May from a final reading of 49.4 in April.The index for new export orders fell to a preliminary 48.2 from a final reading of 49.1 in April. Exports have been a soft spot for the recovering economy, and policy makers have been counting on a rebound in shipments to offset the expected drop in consumer consumption in the immediate months after the sales tax increase. But there is growing evidence that damage from the tax hike will be limited. A Reuters survey showed companies expect sales to bounce back and are more willing to raise wages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Stock Market, in Six Charts", "Date": "2014-05-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestor OutlookWhen you buy a share of a stock (or a mutual fund that gives you little bits of hundreds of them), what you\u2019re really buying is a claim on the future profits of a company. You shouldn\u2019t be paying much attention to the absolute level of the Dow Jones industrial average or Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, or even to the amount it has risen over the last one or three or five years. Here are the three questions that really matter then, in deciding whether stocks are a good deal or not:How much are the companies you invest in earning relative to what you pay for the stock? What alternative return can you get by investing in other assets, particularly bonds? And how will corporate earnings and the risk of investing in stocks evolve in the future?Let\u2019s walk through each of those.Step 1: EarningsPeople like to talk about the price-to-earnings ratio of stocks \u2014 the familiar P/E ratio \u2014 but I argue it can be more helpful to think of the inverse of that: How much in profits are you buying a claim to when you invest in a stock? Robert Shiller, the Yale economist, uses the average of corporate earnings over the last decade to calculate whether stocks are valued fairly, which has the important advantage of smoothing volatility and avoiding drawing the wrong conclusion from earnings that are temporarily depressed or soaring.But we can make it simpler than that (though more volatile) by looking at how much the companies of the S&P 500 have earned in the past year divided by their current price. And right now that earnings-to-price ratio is 5.8 percent (which we derive by dividing 1 by the current price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500, which is now 17.2).That tells you that if you invested $10,000 in a S&P 500 index fund, you would be buying shares of America\u2019s major corporations that, based on last year\u2019s profits, would earn you $580. Just two or three years ago, you could get a much better deal. In the third quarter of 2011, that same $10,000 bought you $821 in earnings. That\u2019s a different way of saying that over the past three years, stock prices have risen a lot faster than corporate earnings have.As a shareholder, you won\u2019t get all of the $580 in earnings. On average, only about a third of that ($195) will be paid out as a cash dividend. The rest the companies are either using to buy back their shares on the open market (which directly rewards shareholders, because it means that future earnings must be divided among fewer remaining shares), letting sit in cash in their accounts (which has also happened on a large scale in recent years) or investing in projects that should pay off in the future.Step 2: AlternativesLet\u2019s keep it simple and assume that you\u2019re choosing between only two possible investments: Stocks, with all their attendant risks and potential; and U.S. government bonds, traditionally viewed as risk free.A ten-year U.S. treasury note is currently yielding about 2.7 percent.So the gap between the 5.8 percent a stock investment will generate in earnings and what you would earn by putting the same money in Treasury bonds is a bit over 3 percentage points. That is, in effect, your compensation as an investor for putting up with the risk of investing in the stock market.As long as the United States government meets its obligations, if you put $10,000 in a Treasury bond, you will get paid $270 a year for the next decade, then get your $10,000 back. If you put the same money into stocks, you\u2019ll be buying shares of companies that made $580 last year, but no assurances of whether that number will rise or fall in the years ahead. You don\u2019t know how much of that money will be returned to you (through dividends or share buybacks), how much will be wisely invested, and how much might be unwisely invested (as was the case during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s or the real estate boom of the mid-2000s).How does that stack up to the past? Is 3 percentage points really enough for taking on all that risk (as well as, it should be added, extra potential return)?There\u2019s no question that by this measure, stocks were a far better deal two or three years ago. At the end of 2011, an investor got more than 6 percentage points in extra return by investing in stocks. As recently as a year ago, it was around 4 percentage points. But in the last 12 months, stock prices have risen sharply, corporate earnings have risen only somewhat, and Treasury bonds have started yielding more. So investors are getting less compensation for taking risks than they were even a year ago \u2014 though more compensation than they were getting in the mid-2000s, when this measure of risk was below 2 percent.Step 3: The futureThis is where it gets really interesting and a bit more complicated.If you invest in stocks, as opposed to keeping your money in cash or investing in low-returning bonds, you are making a bet on the future. If corporate earnings rise sharply from here, that\u2019s good news. If they stagnate or fall, that\u2019s bad news. So what does the data tell us about the future?One way for corporate earnings to grow would be for the overall economic pie to grow. And here, there does indeed seem to be room for growth. The economy has never fully bounced back from the deep recession in 2008-2009, and by the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, the United States remains 4.5 percent below its economic potential.If it\u2019s right, that means the American economy could expand by nearly $800 billion before running into things that might hold it back, such as inflation (and Federal Reserve interest rate increases meant to combat inflation). If that growth materializes in the next few years, corporate earnings could rise along with the overall economy. Fair warning, though: Economists at the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve and among private forecasters have been projecting that a return to the nation\u2019s longer-term economic trend is just around the corner for years \u2014 and keep being proved wrong.And even if stronger economic growth does materialize, there\u2019s an important caveat if you\u2019re thinking of investing in stocks. Corporate profits have risen sharply as a share of the overall economic pie \u2014 higher in recent quarters than at any time in the post-World War II era for which there are solid data.The flip side of this is that worker compensation is falling relative to the overall economy. The intuition is straightforward: With unemployment high, businesses have been able to squeeze workers\u2019 wages and increase profitability.But a world in which the economy is growing more quickly is one in which joblessness is falling and workers will have more leverage to demand raises. Already the unemployment rate is down to 6.3 percent (from a peak of 10 percent), and private-sector wages have shown hints of rising in the last few months.If those trends accelerate, it is entirely possible that any growth in gross domestic product will show up more in the form of higher wages and salaries than it will in higher corporate profits. That means that growth alone isn\u2019t enough for stocks \u2014 bullish investors need to hope for more rapid economic growth coupled with persistent success by businesses in winning an outsize share of the gains.In other words, for the future, there are two big questions: How quickly will the economic pie expand? And will the proportion of the pie going to workers, as opposed to shareholders, shift?Add it all up, and and it leads you to a conclusion similar to what the earlier piece on The Upshot suggests: Stocks may not be wildly overvalued relative to fundamentals. But for them to rise much from here, a lot of things will have to go just right for investors.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Workers Seize City in Eastern Ukraine From Separatists", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIUPOL, Ukraine \u2014 Thousands of steelworkers fanned out on Thursday through the city of Mariupol, establishing control over the streets and banishing the pro-Kremlin militants who until recently had seemed to be consolidating their grip on power, dealing a setback to Russia and possibly reversing the momentum in eastern Ukraine.The workers who took to the streets on Thursday were among the hundreds of thousands in the east who are employed in metals and mining by Ukraine\u2019s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, who only recently went beyond paying lip service to Ukrainian unity and on Wednesday issued a statement rejecting separatism.Critics say Mr. Akhmetov could have prevented much of the bloodshed in the east if he had taken a strong stance sooner. But his lieutenants say he decided to confront the separatists out of a deep belief that independence, or even quasi-autonomy, would be disastrous for eastern Ukraine. Mr. Akhmetov urged his employees, whose jobs were at risk, to take over the city.The workers, who were wearing only their protective clothing and hard hats, said they were \u201coutside politics\u201d and were just trying to establish order. Faced with waves of steelworkers joined by the police, the pro-Russian protesters melted away, along with signs of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic and its representatives. Backhoes and dump trucks from the steelworkers\u2019 factory dismantled the barricades that separatists had erected.Metinvest and DTEK, the metals and mining subsidiaries of Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s company, System Capital Management, together employ 280,000 people in eastern Ukraine, forming an important and possibly decisive force in the region. They have a history of political activism stretching back to miner strikes that helped bring down the Soviet Union. In this conflict, they had not previously signaled their allegiance to one side or the other.It remains possible that the separatists could regroup and challenge the industrial workers, though few were to be found in and around Mariupol on Thursday, even in the public administration building they had been occupying.\u201cWe have to bring order to the city,\u201d Aleksei Gorlov, a steelworker, said of his motivation for joining one of the unpaid and voluntary patrols that were organized at Ilyich Iron and Steel Works. Groups of about six steelworkers accompanied two police officers on the patrols. \u201cPeople organize themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIn times of troubles, that is how it works.\u201dWorkers from another mill, Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, took one side of the city, while the Ilyich factory took the other. Both groups were trying to persuade longshoremen to patrol the port, Mr. Gorlov said.The two steel mills fly Ukrainian flags outside their headquarters, though like so much else in Ukraine, the lines of loyalty are muddled. At least a portion of the police in the city mutinied last Friday, leading to a shootout with the Ukrainian National Guard that killed at least seven people.The chief executive of Ilyich Steel Works, Yuri Zinchenko, is leading the steelworker patrols in the city. He said the company had remained on the sidelines as long as possible, while tacitly supporting unity with Ukraine by conveying to workers that a separatist victory would close export markets in Europe, devastating the factory and the town.Though the workers had differing views of the new government in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on the whole they supported the patrols to restore order, employees and managers said. \u201cEverybody can have their own opinion, but not at work,\u201d Sergei Istratov, a shift boss at the factory, said. \u201cAt work, you have to do what the factory demands.\u201dYuri Ryzhenkov, the chief executive of Metinvest, which is ranked among the top five steel producers globally, said managers had been conveying to workers: \u201cThe most important thing you have is the steel mill. If you have the steel mill, you have jobs, salaries and stability for your families.\u201dOnce patrols began, he said, representatives of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic visited the Ilyich factory, demanding to know what was happening. \u201cThey were not very friendly at first,\u201d Mr. Ryzhenkov said. But the patrols were welcomed in town, he said, and militants had little option but to acquiesce, at least in Mariupol.\u201cThe Donetsk People\u2019s Republic understands if they attack unarmed local people, they will lose all support here,\u201d he said.The effort is more than ad hoc. The coal and steel workers will soon have uniforms for the street patrols, Metinvest executives said, with patches identifying them as members of the \u201cVolunteer People\u2019s Patrol.\u201dIf the patrols are successful, they said, they will try the tactic in most major cities in the Donetsk region, though not in Slovyansk, a stronghold of pro-Russian militants where Metinvest and DTEK have no factories or mines.Ilyich Iron and Steel, a grimy scene of mid-20th-century industrial sprawl, is one of Ukraine\u2019s most important factories, producing five million tons of slab steel a year. About 50,000 people work in the steel industry in Mariupol, a city of 460,000. So far, 18,000 steelworkers have signed up for the patrols, Metinvest executives say.\u201cThere\u2019s no family in Mariupol that\u2019s not connected to the steel industry,\u201d Mr. Zinchenko said in an interview at his desk, which was decorated with a miniature Ukrainian flag. He said he had negotiated a truce with local representatives of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, but not with the group\u2019s leaders.Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s statement detailed the daunting problems facing the regional economy \u2014 and his assets \u2014 if the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic were to win its struggle with Kiev.\u201cNobody in the world will recognize it,\u201d he said in a videotaped statement. \u201cThe structure of our economy is coal, industry, metallurgy, energy, machine works, chemicals and agriculture, and all the enterprises tied to these sectors. We will come under huge sanctions, we will not sell our products, cannot produce. This means the stopping of factories, this means unemployment, this means poverty.\u201dRussia itself exports steel, so it has never been a significant market for the output of the Donetsk region.Residents welcomed the steelworker patrols for bringing an end to chaos and insecurity. They said masked men had robbed four grocery stores, a shop selling hunting rifles and a jewelry store, and that they had burned down a bank.The crowds of pro-Russian protesters who had jeered and cursed Ukrainian soldiers last week were nowhere to be seen. On the city\u2019s central square Thursday afternoon, a pro-Russian rally drew a few dozen protesters, who were watched over by a group of steelworkers.The government in Kiev rebutted reports that the police chief had been found hanging and dead in the town. He had indeed been kidnapped by gunmen and was severely beaten, the Interior Ministry said, but he was eventually rescued.\u201cThere are a lot of idiots with guns in my city,\u201d said Aleksey Rybinsev, 38, a computer programmer who added he welcomed the new patrols, though he feared they might develop into another informal militia group. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a policeman all day. I didn\u2019t see them, and I didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Elegance Meets Eros", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt Review\u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion,\u201d at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute, is the largest retrospective of the Anglo-American couturier\u2019s work in this country.The exhibition comes in two parts. On the first floor, in the large special-exhibition galleries, 15 of James\u2019s most extraordinary ball gowns form a tour de force of masterworks, while resembling a well-spaced grove of exotic trees. Downstairs, the show inaugurates the two gallery spaces in the institute\u2019s renovated ground-floor quarters, which have been christened the Anna Wintour Costume Center. Here you\u2019ll find a wonderful 35-year account of James\u2019s development beside a dense display of material from his archives, recently donated to the Met by Homer Layne, his loyal assistant in the years leading up to James\u2019s death from pneumonia in 1978. The Met\u2019s dedication to James as a major American artist is clear: The exhibition includes 20 recent acquisitions, as well as more than 40 garments from the Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection, which came to the Met in 2009. It makes no difference which part of the show you visit first, but I highly recommend seeing both twice. They form an expansive, mutually illuminating yin-yang. James, who was born in England in 1906, began as a hat designer and settled permanently in the United States in 1939, building his art on the simplified lines and bias cuts of the early-20th-century French modernists Paul Poiret and Madeleine Vionnet. He also synthesized forms from the deeper past \u2014 the imposing split skirt of the 18th-century robe \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, several kinds of bustles, army greatcoats \u2014 but his best garments exude an undeniable modernity. They are, in their own way, as organic, forward-looking and self-evident as a Brancusi sculpture, an Eero Saarinen tulip chair or a Pollock drip painting. They transcend yet celebrate function, elucidate while mystifying form, and reveal by adorning the female body in sometimes startlingly erotic terms. In the exhibition\u2019s lavish catalog, James describes fashion as \u201cwhat is rare, correctly proportioned and, though utterly discrete, libidinous.\u201d Similar references dot the walls of the galleries where James refers to his innovative shapes as \u201ca high form of eroticism\u201d and describes his driving passion \u201cfor form related to movement and, above all, to erotic grace.\u201d He notes that bluejeans are \u201cfunctional and, being functional, highly sexual\u201d and that the true function of fashion is as \u201ca rehearsal for propagation.\u201d After all, what could be more crucially functional than the propagation of the species? There is much to see and learn. James is in the details as well as in the larger shapes. He grants every aspect of his garments \u2014 seams, draping, fabric, color \u2014 a distinct autonomy, and you see them for themselves and as part of a whole. This is a feature of their abstraction. He constantly uses asymmetry to surprise and slow the eye, and does much the same with his logic-defying seams. Sometimes they are scarce, just a single one spiraling up around the body. Sometimes they are overly elaborate, sectioning off a garment to achieve a closer fit while also creating unexpected complexities, or converging in points that direct the eye to the waist, pelvis, knees, or across the shoulders. The four bustles of the half-open parachute dress meet at the waist in a sharp-toothed zigzag seam that is the perfect counterpoint to its draped protrusions. The ball gown gallery, where each dress is a feat of engineering, is one of the great demonstrations of how shape and color convey meaning and pleasure. James is at his most erotic in a 1948 ball gown partly inspired by a Georgia O\u2019Keeffe retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in 1946. The dress is an explicit yet elegant combination of vulval drapes and labial folds in pale peach silk faille and orange silk taffeta. Variously sheathed and geometric, or layered and voluminous, the gowns are often named for the forms they invoke: umbrella, butterfly, swan and, in the most architectural and extravagantly cantilevered, a four-leaf clover. Brilliant use is made of textures and contrasting colors. The \u201cLampshade\u201d evening dress, a sheath that expands at the knees into an almost perfect hemisphere, is made of black rayon velvet so dark that the black silk-cotton satin it\u2019s paired with looks gray. A bonus here is a roomlike display of six of James\u2019s cotton maquettes for the gowns, displayed with the 1951 \u201cButterfly Sofa,\u201d a couch James designed for the collector and museum co-founder Dominique de Menil. The tableau is in itself a beautiful work of installation art. The pedestal of each ball gown has a built-in screen, where a digital animation details the dress\u2019s structure, down to boning and hoops, and is never less than entrancing. But there\u2019s also a programmed light projector on a moving robotic arm that does little except suggest that each dress is being stalked by an ugly duckling. It creates a fake, puppet-show effect, most hilariously when the projector dips beneath the voluminous tulle skirts of the \u201cSwan\u201d evening dress. Since the projector is not a camera, you know that the close-ups on the screen are prerecorded. The sense of growth, occasional struggle and artistic temperament shown in the downstairs gallery plays well against the grandeur upstairs. The larger of the Wintour Center\u2019s two sections (the newly named Lizzie and Jonathan Tisch Gallery) presents some 50 garments, including several remarkable cocktail dresses with asymmetrical necklines in deep russets and browns, and James\u2019s coats, which are just as sculptural but more Minimalist than his ball gowns. Several items seem distinctly dated, especially gowns with excessive ruching and others made of ribbons. Four cameras on extended arms swooping down from tracks on the ceiling nose around, providing live close-ups of parts of the clothes that aren\u2019t so visible. But they are often too slow and too close to reveal as much as they might. At times they linger on the backside of a dress as if enacting the male gaze.The trove of archival material in the smaller, newly named Carl and Iris Barrel Apfel Gallery includes scrapbooks, dress forms, a few of the early hats, storyboards for an autobiography and scroll-like work notes. One from the 1960s begins, \u201cClients whom I would have liked to dress ... Sometimes could have but did not,\u201d and lists Gertrude Stein, Virginia Woolf and Mick Jagger. Most impressive are a score of drawings executed in an emphatic synthesis of early modernist styles, from Constructivism to Surrealism. One form that rises up like a genie is so richly black you may think of Richard Serra; it turns out to have been drawn in shoe polish. It is just one more detail confirming James\u2019s ceaseless artistry. \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion\u201d continues through Aug. 10 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.com. videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finally, Some Optimism About Obesity", "Date": "2014-05-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsWith two-thirds of adults and one-third of kids overweight or obese, it\u2019s hard not to feel discouraged. If current trends continue, by 2030, the incidence of obesity-related conditions like Type 2 diabetes could be 20 times what it is today, costing the American economy up to an additional $580 billion annually. Are we \u201closing the war on obesity,\u201d as the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, put it, and not doing enough to defeat it? No. In fact, if we compare the fight against obesity to the last public health challenge of similar size \u2014 the fight against smoking \u2014 it turns out that we are being much more aggressive today.Research linking smoking to lung cancer began appearing in medical journals as early as the 1920s, but the dangers didn\u2019t reach the popular press until 1952, when Reader\u2019s Digest published \u201cCancer by the Carton.\u201d Still, smoking rates continued to rise. Between 1940 and 1964, consumption more than doubled to nearly 4,500 cigarettes per adult per year. They were everywhere: Hollywood movies, military rations, the workplace, you name it. Finally, in 1964, Luther L. Terry, the surgeon general, unveiled a report titled \u201cSmoking and Health.\u201d He called a Saturday news conference in which, for the first time, the government acknowledged that \u201csmoking is causally related to lung cancer.\u201d It still took until 1970 for Congress to ban cigarette advertising on TV and radio; until 1975 for the military to stop including cigarettes in rations; until 1982 for the federal cigarette excise tax to be raised; until 1990 for Congress to ban smoking on domestic flights; until 1997 for President Clinton to ban smoking in most government buildings; until 1998 for cigarette manufacturers to acknowledge that smoking was addictive and caused cancer; and until 2003 for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to ban smoking in New York City\u2019s restaurants and bars. And it wasn\u2019t until 2009 that the federal excise tax on cigarettes became truly effective, when it was raised to $1.01.This multipronged effort \u2014 comprising advertising restrictions, prohibitions on where people could smoke and taxation \u2014 changed behavior and ultimately the nation\u2019s health. Beginning in the mid-1970s, per capita cigarette consumption steadily declined. Today, the percentage of adult Americans who smoke is less than half what it was in Dr. Terry\u2019s day \u2014 18 percent \u2014 and per capita cigarette consumption is less than 1,500 per year. As a result, in the early 1990s, lung cancer deaths for men began to decline. For women the decline began in the mid-2000s. There is more to be done, but we have bent the tobacco curve.When it comes to obesity, the country has responded much more nimbly. Researchers first reported serious upticks in childhood and adolescent obesity in the mid-1980s, and policy makers quickly took notice. Within a decade, in 1994, the Clinton administration limited the salt and saturated fat in school lunches. In 2001, the surgeon general issued a \u201cCall to Action.\u201d In 2006, three of the largest beverage companies voluntarily agreed to limit their offerings in school vending machines to water or low-calorie options. In 2010, Michelle Obama started her \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign to end childhood obesity in a generation. And that same year the Affordable Care Act passed, with a provision requiring large restaurant chains to post calorie counts on their menus. In 2012, Disney banned junk food advertising on all of its child-targeted TV and radio platforms. Today, 34 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some kind of additional tax on sodas and sugary drinks.True, many proposals have been stymied. The Food and Drug Administration seems to have given up on its consideration of front-of-the-pack labeling. Regulations implementing menu labeling still haven\u2019t been issued. Proposed restrictions on advertising to children were suspended amid Republican attacks. And the soda industry has successfully repelled excise taxes in many states by deploying the same tactics the cigarette manufacturers used \u2014 sizable political contributions and charges of discrimination against the poor. But there do appear to be tentative signs that the obesity curve is flattening. A Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report last year found that adult obesity rates remained level in every state except Arkansas. And despite the dueling studies on childhood obesity rates nationwide, the rates among children in some of America\u2019s largest cities appear to be coming down. In places like Philadelphia, New York City and Los Angeles, rates are down 3 to 5 percent compared with a few years ago.We can\u2019t ease up now. Fully implementing calorie count provisions, requiring more explicit nutritional labeling and banning advertising of sugary sodas and other less nutritious foods to children would be good ways to keep up the momentum. But there is reason to be optimistic: We are moving much faster against obesity than we did on the successful effort against tobacco. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a contributing opinion writer and the author of \u201cReinventing American Health Care,\u201d is a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania, where Andrew P. Steinmetz is a researcher.

{"Headline": "Hotel Boycott Grows Over Brunei Penal Code", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The response here to the planned imposition of Islamic law in Brunei, with extreme penalties for adultery and gay sex, has become more pointed in recent days as two Hollywood-related charities moved events from the Beverly Hills Hotel, which is owned by the Brunei Investment Agency.According to the Deadline Hollywood news site, a fund-raiser on Wednesday for the youth organization Teen Line will be moved from the hotel to the Sony lot in Culver City, Calif. The event will honor Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Jenny Pascal, her sister.Separately, the Hollywood Reporter wrote that the annual \u201cNight Before the Oscars\u201d fund-raiser for the Motion Picture and Television Fund, usually held at the Beverly Hills Hotel, will now be held elsewhere.The sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, last week began phasing in a new penal code based on Islamic law, or Shariah, that by 2015 will make gay sex and adultery punishable by stoning to death. The sultan\u2019s investment agency owns the Dorchester Collection, which manages a chain of hotels that includes the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Hotel Bel-Air and other luxury hotels.In a statement, Christopher Cowdray, chief executive of the Dorchester Collection, acknowledged \u201cpeople\u2019s concerns\u201d without specifically mentioning the treatment of gays and others in Brunei.\u201cWe believe this boycott should not be directed to our hotels and dedicated employees,\u201d Mr. Cowdray said. Pointing to the boycott\u2019s potential to adversely affect workers and suppliers financially, he added: \u201cToday\u2019s global economy needs to be placed in a broader perspective.\u201dThe cancellations reported Monday followed moves by others to shun the Beverly Hills Hotel and other Dorchester properties, as word of the sultan\u2019s action spread rapidly among entertainment figures and others. Last week, the Global Women\u2019s Rights Awards, co-chaired by Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis, moved from the Beverly Hills Hotel to another location. On Monday, its sponsor, the Feminist Majority Foundation, staged a protest at the hotel, joined by Mr. Leno. Richard Branson, the entrepreneur; Tim Gill, a social rights advocate; and Ellen DeGeneres are also among those who have voiced support for the boycott.Long frequented by movie stars and those who like to watch them, the hotel and its famous Polo Lounge, perched on a slight rise above Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills, are known for a clubby sense of casual luxury. But even regulars rapidly turned their backs, as Hollywood figures as influential as Jeffrey Katzenberg, who founded the \u201cNight Before the Oscars\u201d and has staged it at the hotel for more than a decade, declared it off limits. Mr. Katzenberg did not immediately respond to a query on Monday. The Motion Picture and Television Fund in a statement said its representatives had told managers of the hotel group of their decision to withhold business because of what they called Brunei\u2019s \u201coutrageous and unacceptable legal code.\u201d One executive who endorses the boycott \u2014 and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures \u2014 said he now expects prominent people who are spotted at the hotel to receive private calls from one or another of their peers, urging them to honor the boycott.At the same time, the Hollywood Reporter announced plans to relocate its annual Women in Entertainment breakfast, which is scheduled for December.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Interest Rates Are Falling. Thank Vladimir Putin.", "Date": "2014-05-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyIf there was one thing that market analysts thought they could agree upon at the start of the year, it was that interest rates were set to rise. The economy was improving. The Federal Reserve was pulling away from its program of pumping money into bond markets. The era of cheap money seemed to be coming to an end after all these years.Never mind.Longer-term interest rates have been falling this year, including hitting a new six-month low on Wednesday. Ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds yielded 3.03 percent at the end of 2013 \u2014 and 2.54 percent on Wednesday. They continued to decline on Thursday morning. Lower borrowing costs filter through to homebuyers, as well; the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.17 percent on Wednesday, according to Bankrate.com, down from 4.54 percent at the end of last year.What\u2019s going on? Part of it is that, while the economy has held up fine so far this year, it has showed few signs of the kind of sharp acceleration that might prompt an end to easy money policies out of the Fed. The 3 percent 10-year rates of late last year may have been premised on sharper improvement than has materialized.And in her congressional testimony last week, the Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, showed concern about a possible faltering in the housing market, which was interpreted as meaning the Fed will keep rates lower for longer should the weakness continue.But Americans looking to refinance their mortgages may have unlikely help coming from Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader\u2019s aggressive stance toward Ukraine may be making some global investors increase their appetite for safe-haven assets, particularly U.S. Treasury bonds. Lower rates on Treasuries tend to also translate into lower rates on mortgages and other forms of consumer and business borrowing.In other words, half of the decline in longer-term rates since the start of the year can be attributed to global political risk, in the view of one of the world\u2019s biggest asset managers.These lower rates are hardly a return to the ultra-low longer-term interest rates that prevailed in the spring of 2013, before the Fed signaled it would slow its purchases of bonds. But it should provide a bit of welcome relief in a housing market that could use some support.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Bet on Florida Pays Off", "Date": "2014-05-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 In 2008, when American businesses were almost universally hoarding cash in a struggle to survive the financial crisis, Harris Rosen made a different call.Instead of pulling back, Mr. Rosen, the biggest independent hotel owner in this city built on tourism, hit the gas. He committed to spend $130 million to renovate his seven hotels, then added more international marketing staff members to sell them to tour groups from faraway places like Brazil and South Korea.Today, Florida\u2019s economy is on the rise again, shaking off the dead weight of a housing bust that hit Florida harder than almost any other state in the country. So far this year, Florida has led the country in job growth and it has chalked up the third-best record over the last 12 months.The roots of the comeback can be found in decisions like Mr. Rosen\u2019s.In contrast to American business in general, which slashed spending after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, tourist operations all through Central Florida invested through the downturn, giving operators something new to sell to visitors when consumer spending rebounded.The tourism surge was not the whole story, but it ignited the economic kindling the recession left behind, fueling a recovery that has now spread to construction and other businesses.Migration from other states, which turned negative during the financial crisis, resumed in 2010, adding as many as 20,000 new consumers each quarter.And, crucially, the financial markets bailed out Florida\u2019s residents. As the value of existing bonds rose and the stock market took off, Floridians\u2019 income from interest, dividends and rents rose 25 percent between 2010 and last year, with the biggest gains in 2011, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Florida, with its concentration of retirees, gets 27 percent of personal income from those sources, compared with 18 percent nationally, said Karl Kuykendall, a regional economist for IHS Global Insight.\u201cIn the retirement centers like Naples, it\u2019s an even larger component, up to 40 percent,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat happened was Harry Potter \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said Anthony Crocco, Central Florida regional director of Metrostudy, a new-home industry consulting firm.Statewide, leisure and hospitality jobs are up 16 percent, for an additional 149,300, since the Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened, almost double the rate of job growth generally. Leisure and hospitality companies have added 54,500 workers in the last year, including 14,800 in Orlando. Universal alone plans to add 3,500 local jobs this year, according to John Sprouls, chief administrative officer of Universal Parks and Resorts Orlando.And Florida\u2019s unemployment rate, which topped out at 11.4 percent in early 2010 \u2014 well above the national peak of 10 percent \u2014 fell to 6.2 percent in April, below the national rate of 6.3 percent.\u201cYou have to give all the credit to the private sector,\u201d said Gov. Rick Scott, who faces a tough re-election campaign this fall in which the economy is the most important issue. \u201cWe in government can do all the right things, but the private sector has to show up.\u201dNathan Cross, an Orlando home builder, said, \u201cThese are $50,000-a-year jobs \u2014 better than the tourist industry pays.\u201d He pointed to his plumbing subcontractor, who had doubled his staff to eight.One example of newly confident Florida consumers is Jonathan Osorio, 23, an electrician laid off from a warehouse job in mid-2012. Last fall, he landed a job helping build the Orlando Eye complex. The new job\u2019s steady outlook has emboldened him to buy a Hyundai Accent, and he and his wife are talking about buying a single-family home.\u201cEverything was going down like, two years ago,\u201d Mr. Osorio said during a recent lunch break. \u201cNow I can see so many things going on, so many places to be able to help. I\u2019m not concerned about losing the job.\u201dIn one sense, things became so bad in Florida that it opened the door to bargain hunters looking to make money off the misery of others.Both consumers and businesses are moving to exploit assets, especially land, left much cheaper by the collapse in housing prices after 2006. Merlin built Legoland at a deep discount partly because Cypress Gardens \u201clanded in our lap in 2008,\u201d the park\u2019s general manager, Adrian Jones, said.In Naples, Irwin Novack in January opened the 18th outlet of Kane\u2019s Furniture, a midprice chain, adding 50 jobs.\u201cWe bought a piece of land we looked at in 2005 and 2006, at a fraction of the cost,\u201d said Mr. Novack, the chain\u2019s chief executive. He had not opened a store since 2007.\u201cFurniture is tied very, very closely to housing, and we see the housing market starting to turn,\u201d Mr. Novack said.Evan Patterson, a banker, played his own land arbitrage in moving to Odessa, near Tampa, last year. With he and his wife, Abbie, living in a Los Angeles apartment with \u201ctandem parking\u201d \u2014 one car parked behind the other \u2014 and with their second child coming, Mr. Patterson swapped the bright lights for a $390,000, 3,800-square-foot house with a pool, for $500 a month less.That was possible partly because the average Tampa house price fell 53 percent from the peak by late 2011.\u201cWe realized the quality of life we wanted was unattainable in California,\u201d said Mr. Patterson, 37, who estimated his home would cost at least $1.5 million in Southern California.Despite the improvement, there are still clouds hanging over the Sunshine State, economists say.The state\u2019s reliance on low-wage industries means personal income is lower than the national average, and Florida depends more on part-time jobs.A slowdown in home building in recent months, caused in part by a rise in mortgage rates since last spring, may challenge Florida\u2019s recovery as well.But housing is still undervalued in most of the state, in part because foreclosures continue to trickle onto the market, said Jed Kolko, chief economist of Trulia.com, \u201cleaving the median home within reach of the average family on most of the state.\u201d Pressure on prices from old foreclosures has spared most of Florida the sharp home-price spikes cramping California builders, he said.And the tourism openings are still coming. Walt Disney World is introducing attractions that will nearly double the size of Fantasyland. Disney says that the Fantasyland additions, some of which are open and some still forthcoming, represent the largest expansion ever of the Magic Kingdom park at Walt Disney World. Universal, exploiting its greatest asset, is unveiling another Harry Potter attraction this summer.\u201cWe came for Harry Potter \u2014 we\u2019re big fans,\u201d said Jennifer Murphy of Watertown, Conn., who was taking her daughter Mackenzie, 7, around an entertainment site that had not opened when they last visited Florida. \u201cIt was time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Russia and 2 Neighbors Form Economic Union That Has a Ukraine-Size Hole", "Date": "2014-05-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byASTANA, Kazakhstan \u2014 The presidents of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus formally signed an agreement on Thursday to create a limited economic union \u2014 an alliance hobbled by the absence of Ukraine but one long pursued by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to confirm his country as a global economic force.\u201cToday we are creating a powerful, attractive center of economic development, a big regional market that unites more than 170 million people,\u201d Mr. Putin said during the ceremonies. He underscored the significant energy resources, work force and cultural heritage of the combined nations.Sitting at a table with his two fellow leaders in front of their respective flags, Mr. Putin said that the group, formally known as the Eurasian Economic Union, had the potential to create a global transportation hub joining the trade flows of Europe and Asia.While that may eventually prove to be the case, the alliance that comes into force on Jan. 1 will be a pale imitation of what the members first envisioned: an eastern version of the 28-member European Union.\u201cThree weak economies getting together and integrating: How much good can come out of it?\u201d said Nargis Kassenova, the director of the Central Asian Studies Center at Kimep University in Almaty, who is part of a small but vocal opposition to the union in Kazakhstan. \u201cNow, it is even worse because one is under sanctions and drifting away from the West,\u201d Ms. Kassenova added, referring to Western economic sanctions against Russia.Although the presidents of Armenia and Kyrgyzstan attended the signing ceremony and expressed an interest in joining, the missing guest at the party was Ukraine. That country\u2019s previous government in Kiev tacked back and forth on whether it would join the European Union or the new Eurasian group, eventually choosing Mr. Putin\u2019s offer and igniting a public uprising that ended up bringing down the president in February.\u201cWe lost someone along the way, I mean Ukraine,\u201d said Aleksandr Lukashenko, the president of Belarus. Mr. Lukashenko, who received a $2 billion loan and energy concessions from Russia just before the signing, acknowledged that the union as constituted was something less than he had anticipated. \u201cUnfortunately, it is not the agreement that our partners originally announced,\u201d he said, according to Belta, the official Belarus news agency.He also called for economic union to be followed by political and military unity, a concept that Kazakhstan rejected.\u201cWe are not creating a political organization; we are forming a purely economic union,\u201d Bakytzhan Sagintayev, the first deputy prime minister of Kazakhstan and lead negotiator, said in an interview. \u201cIt is a pragmatic means to get benefits. We don\u2019t meddle into what Russia is doing politically, and they cannot tell us what foreign policy to pursue.\u201dThe agreement coalesced with great fanfare \u2014 and quickly \u2014 with members changing trade laws in a matter of years, a process that required decades for the European Union. But in the end, it became less about promoting economic development than about providing Russia with a diplomatic victory, analysts said.\u201cIt is meant to signal that these Western programs and opprobrium are not having an effect on the economy and that Russia is developing into a distinct pole in the multipolar system,\u201d said Alexander Cooley, a professor of political science at Barnard College.The idea of a Eurasian union was first floated 20 years ago by Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the president of sprawling, sparsely populated Kazakhstan. As the Soviet Union disintegrated, Mr. Nazarbayev suggested that a union could provide the economic, national and military security that had evaporated.But a curious thing happened over the intervening years. By the time Russia came around to the idea, under Mr. Putin, the former Soviet republics had developed on their own. In Kazakhstan, for example, 47 percent of its trade activity was with Russia in 1995. By 2011, 40 percent of its exports went to Europe, while only 9 percent went to Russia.Russia adopted the idea of a Eurasian union for three main reasons, according to analysts.First, Mr. Putin wanted to create his own economic pole that would raise Russia to the status of other major global trading powers like the European Union, China and the United States.Second, the union would secure Moscow\u2019s influence over the economic development of its former republics, particularly in Central Asia, before they began to look elsewhere \u2014 to China, for example.Third, many analysts believe that Mr. Putin came to see the Eurasian union as an almost physical manifestation of his budding ideology that Russia and its satellites represent the anti-West, a bastion of more conservative, traditional and religious values opposed to aspects of Western culture, like equal rights for gays, an independent news media and political activism.It was the first reason that Mr. Putin stressed in an essay he published in the newspaper Izvestia in December 2011, laying out his vision. \u201cWe suggest a powerful supranational association capable of becoming one of the poles in the modern world and serving as an efficient bridge between Europe and the dynamic Asia-Pacific region,\u201d he wrote.Mr. Putin denied that he was trying to recreate the Soviet Union, a charge frequently leveled by critics of the plan, including the United States.\u201cHis political vision is of a greater Russia,\u201d said Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former secretary of state, in a speech in March. \u201cI said when I was still secretary that his goal is to re-Sovietize Russia\u2019s periphery.\u201dProblems were manifest even before the Ukrainian crisis. The fundamental flaw, experts noted, is that all the governments involved in creating the union are run by authoritarian figures loath to share power within their own governments, much less with other states. Even the democracies of the European Union wrestle with power-sharing issues constantly.Some analysts suggest that the loss of Ukraine as a potential member was the death knell for the Eurasian Economic Union. On a purely economic scale, losing Ukraine meant losing a market of more than 40 million people. Ukraine also provided economic diversity when paired with the two energy exporters.More important, Russia\u2019s use of its military has spooked the other members. At the last moment, some senior figures questioned the idea of the union itself.Kazakhstan also felt vulnerable in particular because one-quarter of its population consists of ethnic Russians, concentrated along the northern border. Mr. Putin and other senior figures have stressed Russia\u2019s right to safeguard the 25 million ethnic Russians outside its borders.Russia proposed several attributes that mirrored the European Union, including a common passport and currency, a collective parliament, a common border force and a common economic foreign policy. But Kazakhstan applied the brakes to anything other than economic ties.The speeches glossed over such differences, and Mr. Putin suggested that the wider world was already enthusiastic.\u201cWe are forming a major market of 170 million people with huge industrial, scientific and technical potential, with colossal natural resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWherever I go and whomever I meet, everyone wants to know how to establish relations with the new Eurasian union.\u201dAlexandra Odynova contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

And that shift in our gait and our gumption has been palpable for many years, during an unusually sustained period of frustration that has the feel of something more than a temporary dive: a turned corner, the downward arc of a diminished enterprise.\u201cAt the core of Americans\u2019 anger and alienation is the belief that the American dream is no longer attainable,\u201d Sosnik wrote. \u201cFor the first time in our country\u2019s history, there is more social mobility in Europe than in the United States.\u201dWe\u2019re laggards, slackers, and everywhere you turn, the evidence mounts.American bridges crumble. American trains crawl. American flights leave from terminals that pale next to many Asian and European counterparts. Joe Biden acknowledged as much three months ago when he compared La Guardia Airport to a third-world country. I\u2019ve been to La Guardia and I\u2019ve been to Guatemala, and if I were Guatemala, I\u2019d sue for defamation.We seldom build big things anymore. We just talk about building them and usually decide to take a pass or to wait, whether it\u2019s a high-speed train in California or another tunnel between New Jersey and New York. And while each of these demurrals has a reason, the sum of them has an inescapably defeatist bent. We\u2019re tentative. Timid.These three stories are threads in one tapestry, a faded panorama of American possibility. We\u2019re contemptuous of the federal government. We distrust interventions abroad. The fertility rate is down. And we\u2019ve gone from \u201cSex and the City,\u201d with its fairy-tale lilt and candy-colored palette, to \u201cGirls,\u201d with its infinite shades of gray.Which may not be so bad. Less assertiveness could mean less overreach. Less confidence could mean less hubris. And money isn\u2019t everything.A thoughtful college junior I know told me that while he didn\u2019t envision a richer American economy in his future or a mightier American role in the world, he looked forward to a country with a warmer embrace of diversity, including gay marriage in every state. He itched to be a part of its creation.Still, I worry. Can a nation so long defined by its faith in an expansive frontier accept limits so easily? If we become convinced that the pie won\u2019t grow, do our politics degenerate into endless squabbling over the slices? And isn\u2019t pessimism a self-fulfilling prophecy?Perhaps. But we\u2019re no better served by settling into the dusk.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Right and Left on March to Populism", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cI come across as a guy who yells,\u201d Mr. Grillo admitted recently on a television talk show, \u201cPorta a Porta.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true. I am angry and sometimes I exaggerate, but it\u2019s an anger that has united the dreams of 10 million Italians.\u201dOr so Mr. Grillo hopes. With voting for the European Parliament to conclude on Sunday, the elections will provide the best indicator yet of the depth of disillusionment and anger in southern Europe. The belt of Mediterranean countries has borne the worst of the five-year economic crisis and churned with seething resentment and outright fury over the austerity policies imposed by the elites perceived as running Europe.For months, media attention has primarily focused on far-right, euro-skeptic parties making gains in northern Europe, including the National Front in France and the United Kingdom Independence Party, which showed strongly in local elections Friday and now seems poised to shake up the politics of Britain.Even so, the stakes are arguably higher in the south. Especially in Italy and Greece, poor showings by the governing parties could increase pressure for early national elections, and make it more difficult for the fragile coalition governments to carry through on political and economic reforms. This type of instability worries European leaders and could also rattle financial markets.\u201cWe are exporting instability,\u201d cautioned a political commentator, Antonio Polito, in a front-page editorial this week in Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian newspaper. \u201cWhat is abnormal \u2014 because it does not happen elsewhere \u2014 is that such a result might blow up the entire, very fragile balance upon which acrobats like the government and Parliament are hanging on.\u201dEurope\u2019s parliamentary elections are still a relative novelty, with a low turnout expected, which is why many analysts warn that voters might use the races to send a protest message that they have had enough.In Italy and Greece, voters have a pick of choices to express their anger: from the left, there is Syriza in Greece; from the right, there is the neo-fascist Golden Dawn in Greece or the anti-immigrant Northern League in Italy; and there is the pox-on-all-their houses ethos of Mr. Grillo, an anti-establishment wrecking ball.In Spain, the two dominant parties, the Popular Party and the Socialists, are expected to lose seats to smaller parties, some with anti-Europe positions but most to the political left of the Socialists.\u201cThere is no one populism in Europe,\u201d said Brigid Laffan, an expert on European politics at the European University Institute. \u201cPopulism and the neo-right predated the crisis. But the crisis gave a new opening.\u201dAt a \u201cState of the Union\u201d conference this month in Florence, European leaders convened to discuss the coming elections and the recurrent theme of voter anger. In a midday speech, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy warned that only a few years ago, during the height of the financial crisis, Italy\u2019s problems centered on lending rates \u2014 known as \u201cthe spread.\u201d Now, he said, the problem was the spread of angry, political populism.Mario Monti, the professorial technocrat who served as Italy\u2019s prime minister at the height of the crisis, said Mr. Grillo\u2019s rise had also pushed mainstream, center-right parties such as Mr. Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia and the New Center Right to become more anti-Europe, anti-Germany and anti-European Central Bank.He said that nationalist parties in northern Europe wanted to reclaim sovereignty from Brussels, but Mr. Grillo wanted to destroy the status quo.\u201cGrillo\u2019s movement came up essentially as a challenge to the establishment, to traditional politicians and political parties,\u201d Mr. Monti said. \u201cThe real enemy for him is the politician.\u201dMr. Grillo\u2019s political organization, the Five Star Movement, unexpectedly finished a strong third in last year\u2019s inconclusive national elections, with 25 percent of the total vote. His momentum then seemed to stall as lawmakers from his party began to bicker, with some complaining that Mr. Grillo was acting like an autocrat.The infighting also coincided with the emergence of the charismatic Mr. Renzi, who wrested control of his Democratic Party and became prime minister in February on promises of sweeping reforms.But now Mr. Grillo is reinvigorated, traveling the country and posting tirades on his blog. The most recent polls have shown the Democratic Party with a lead, but Mr. Grillo has been drawing large crowds as he vows to finish first, gleefully lashing out at the establishment and promoting a vaguely defined system of direct representation through online referendums. Those, he says, will also allow voters to punish what he calls the three \u201cdestroyers:\u201d journalists, industrialists and politicians.\u201cThis horrendous trio has to be judged via a popular media trial that will start after the European elections,\u201d he wrote on his blog. \u201cIt\u2019ll take place on the Internet, where there\u2019ll be a reconstruction of a virtual castle, with prison cells.\u201dA surge by the Five Star Movement could undermine Mr. Renzi, who is trying to push an economic and electoral reform package through Italy\u2019s Parliament as European officials are increasing pressure on the government to move faster to reduce the country\u2019s massive public debt and reduce its fiscal deficit.In Greece, Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is trying to rally support for his coalition government, arguing that a victory by the left-wing Syriza, which is narrowly leading in polls, could threaten the country\u2019s slightly improving economy \u2014 a charge Syriza dismisses as a desperate scare tactic. He has stepped up his attacks in recent days, even as Syriza\u2019s leader, Alexis Tsipras, has continued to challenge the terms of the financial bailout that saved Greece from bankruptcy but inflicted punishing austerity.Two years ago, Mr. Samaras\u2019s New Democracy pulled out a slim victory in national elections, as the rest of Europe was fraught with concern that a Syriza victory might threaten the stability of the euro.Now, Mr. Samaras must contend with Syriza on the left as well as Golden Dawn on the far right. Last year, the government declared Golden Dawn a criminal organization, not a political party, and arrested several party leaders, including some elected officials.The party\u2019s electoral status was unclear until this month, when Greece\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Golden Dawn could participate in the European elections. Now many analysts predict that the party could finish third, or better. At a rally this month, about 300 flag-waving supporters gathered in an outdoor basketball court in a leafy, middle-class neighborhood of Athens. Golden Dawn\u2019s local candidates stood together on a platform \u2014 mostly heavily muscled men with close haircuts, wearing black shirts and pants.\u201cPositive, extremely positive,\u201d answered Ilias Panagiotaros, a Golden Dawn leader watching the rally, when asked about his party\u2019s electoral prospects. \u201cWe are going for second place, if not first.\u201d\u201cTwo years ago, we had a debt that was 129 percent of gross domestic product,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were dying. That\u2019s what they were saying. Now we have a debt that is 170 percent of G.D.P. And they say we are going well. That is unexplainable.\u201dHe relished the thought of not only destabilizing Greek politics but sending his party\u2019s candidates to Brussels.\u201cFor the first time, the next European Parliament will have something different to deal with,\u201d he predicted. \u201cThere will be 10 or 15 nationalist parties, plus euro-skeptic parties. And they will change the agenda.\u201dDimitris Bounias contributed reporting from Athens, and Gaia Pianigiani and Elisabetta Povoledo from Rome.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ex-Senators on Both Sides of Aisle Join Forces on Health Care", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongressional MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 As a Republican senator, Trent Lott was among those who successfully dug in against the Clinton-era health overhaul. Tom Daschle, then the Senate Democratic leader, fought Republicans on their prescription drug plan. John B. Breaux, a centrist Democrat who led a blue-ribbon Medicare commission, often found himself at odds with both parties.Now these three retired Senate powers are combining to push an expansion of tele-medicine as a way to improve health care access and cut costs. They say the idea of using the nation\u2019s growing digital capacity to provide more health care has significant bipartisan support and could be an solution to the partisan schism over the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThey have been fighting so long on the A.C.A.-Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Breaux said during a joint interview with the three. \u201cTo have something we can all agree on is an opportunity to say yes, we can come together on health care.\u201dIn their post-Senate careers, the three former lawmakers have relocated to K Street, home to lobbyists, and are working on behalf of the Alliance for Connected Care, a nonprofit collection of health care providers, insurers, pharmacies, technology firms and telecommunications companies, to pursue legislative and regulatory changes to let more Americans essentially get much of their health care remotely.They are beginning an effort to raise the profile of their initiative in a series of events this week and have won participation from high-level lawmakers such as Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who leads the Finance Committee; Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the senior Republican on the Commerce Committee (and the man who defeated Mr. Daschle in 2004); and several House Republicans. All three former lawmakers said they became interested in the potential of digital technology to deliver health care when they were representing states with pockets of poverty, where access to health care can be difficult for geographic and economic reasons. Mr. Daschle, who enlisted his former Senate colleagues, said the health care industry is lagging in its embrace of technology for remote diagnosis and care.\u201cYou look at any other aspect of our economy and digital applications are so much a part of it,\u201d Mr. Daschle said.The goal is not immediate legislation; they are trying to build a consensus to move forward with a focus on winning insurance reimbursement for remotely delivered care, while putting in place safeguards against fraud in the still emerging field. Success may take some time.\u201cI don\u2019t get involved in things now where somebody says, \u2018We need to get this done in 30 days,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Lott said.If anyone still knows how to play a long game in Congress, it might be these three. Between them they have accumulated more than 100 years of service in the House and Senate. All of them have experienced ups and downs in their careers, were in and out of the majority and remain influential voices in political and policy circles.They all shake their heads at the current state of the polarized Senate. Though they share the notion that things have gone off the rails, they offer different perspectives on the solutions. Mr. Breaux said the leadership of the two parties does not communicate. Mr. Lott said he thinks the Senate needs to return to regular order, put bills on the floor, work through amendments pushed by both parties and find a way to lessen the impact of the often politically charged votes.\u201cIt\u2019s always \u2018gotcha\u2019 time when you have amendments, but we always found a way around it,\u201d Mr. Lott said.To Mr. Daschle, the Senate needs to just work. Period. Fund-raising and hectic travel schedules have senators flying out of town early and returning late. What used to be a challenge, to get lawmakers to stick around late in the week for votes, has become impossible, Mr. Daschle said.\u201cPeople leave on Thursday afternoon, they come back Tuesday morning and they try to govern on Wednesday,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201dThe former lawmakers\u2019 push for health care changes, while it has Republican support, could run into the tension surrounding the health care law and whether it should be repealed or massaged. Even Mr. Lott, the Republican, conceded there is no chance the health law will be stripped off the books, though he would not advise Republicans to back off in their efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act.\u201cI\u2019m a realist,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows it is not going to be repealed before 2017, if ever.\u201dMr. Lott and Mr. Daschle worked closely together as Senate leaders and famously managed the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton to make certain the Senate did not implode or sustain permanent damage from the tense proceedings.Mr. Daschle has also worked post-Senate with Bill Frist, the former Senate Republican leader, on economic and health issues, even though Mr. Frist was accused of breaking an unwritten rule of Senate leadership by traveling to South Dakota to campaign against Mr. Daschle in 2004. Over the years, other senators have come together after retirement from Congress to work on issues outside the political pressures of holding office.But given the current state of the Senate, it could be a fading practice. Somehow it is hard to imagine the fiery conservatives now in the Senate working with the outspoken liberals on some subject of common interest after their Senate tours.Still, Mr. Breaux said, \u201cThere is life after Congress.\u201d\u201cAnd it is bipartisan,\u201d Mr. Lott added.Advertisement"}

And you can just imagine what will happen when the E.P.A., buoyed by the smog ruling, moves on to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.What do I mean by crazy climate economics?Why is this crazy? Normally, conservatives extol the magic of markets and the adaptability of the private sector, which is supposedly able to transcend with ease any constraints posed by, say, limited supplies of natural resources. But as soon as anyone proposes adding a few limits to reflect environmental issues \u2014 such as a cap on carbon emissions \u2014 those all-capable corporations supposedly lose any ability to cope with change.Now, the rules the E.P.A. is likely to impose won\u2019t give the private sector as much flexibility as it would have had in dealing with an economywide carbon cap or emissions tax.

{"Headline": "Glare of a Gilded Age", "Date": "2014-05-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe financial heart of India has long been Mumbai, but it is Delhi, increasingly, that seems to be driven by money, galvanized by it, besotted with it. Delhi is India\u2019s capital. It is where the nation\u2019s networks of crony capitalism converge, where money seeks license to earn more money. Delhi talks to itself about money \u2014 about what money can buy, about the cabinet minister pocketing kickbacks, about the suburban swatch of land that a lawyer\u2019s untaxed, all-cash fee has purchased and, in near-reverential tones, about the ingenious and illegal ways more money can be made. This last subject, in particular, exercises the city\u2019s soul enormously. Delhi is flatulent with greed.When Rana Dasgupta moved to the city from New York in 2000, the reimagination of Delhi had just begun, and there was, he writes toward the beginning of \u201cCapital,\u201d a thrilling anticipation and a \u201cutopian clamor\u201d to the city\u2019s first paddles into the global market economy. Even as Dasgupta watched, however, the transition went off-kilter: \u201cThe land grabs and corruption-as-usual that became so blatant in those later years, the extension of the power of elites at the cost of everyone else, the conversion of all that was slow, intimate and idiosyncratic into the fast, vast and generic \u2014 it made it difficult to dream of surprising futures any more.\u201d Real development slowed, but the personal fortunes of the elite soared. \u201cEven as people made more money, things made less sense.\u201dIn \u201cCapital,\u201d his third book, Dasgupta attempts to unscramble the disquieting city that Delhi has become. His first two books were works of fiction; the second, \u201cSolo,\u201d won Dasgupta the 2010 Commonwealth Writers\u2019 Prize and drew warm praise from James Wood for his \u201csentences of lancing power and beauty.\u201d \u201cCapital\u201d grew out of an article entitled \u201cCapital Gains\u201d that Dasgupta wrote for Granta, but the book is more uneven and less artful than its parent. His sentences remain skilled and frequently beautiful, and Dasgupta is excellent at recognizing irony, assembling quiet metaphors and prizing the most resonant details out of the world around him. But while he is also effective at capturing and communicating the low horror of the malaise that afflicts Delhi, \u201cCapital\u201d proves unconvincing in its diagnoses of the reasons behind that malaise. Delhi has been born out of trauma, Dasgupta proposes \u2014 or, to be precise, out of a procession of traumas, spread through its long history. He gives us a sharp, lovely idea: \u201cThis is both the reality and the fantasy of Delhi: The city is always already destroyed.\u201d Rulers took and retook the capital, sacking or abandoning it at will. Many of these were Islamic invaders from the west, imposing a humiliation from which the Hindu right still smarts today. There was the pain of British colonialism and then of the subcontinent\u2019s partition in 1947, an event of near-biblical mayhem, during which millions of Hindu refugees fled from the newly formed Pakistan into India, just as millions of Muslims bolted in the opposite direction. Hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered in riots.The Punjabi refugees arriving in Delhi were both impoverished and emasculated, Dasgupta argues, and in reaction to these awful conditions, they fashioned for themselves a post-partition culture of material excess and machismo. \u201cThis is why the city seems so emotionally broken \u2014 and so threatening \u2014 to those who arrive from other Indian cities.\u201d From this Punjabi machismo, Dasgupta gleans the latent aggression of Delhi, which ripples under the city\u2019s skin and which has contributed to a recent spate of sexual violence against women. From the lust for excess, he extrapolates Delhi\u2019s avidness for wealth, an avidness that quickened after 1991, when the Indian economy was thrown open to foreign investment. As a thesis, this is interesting, but it also feels too slight and too neat, unaccommodating, for instance, of the dozens of other communities that make up Delhi or of the multiplicity of motives for avarice. Yet Dasgupta parses his contention over a wearying chunk of the book, just as he rehearses, at inordinate length, the already antique trope that globalization has been a destabilizing if exciting force \u2014 a traumatic force, even \u2014 in the world\u2019s poorer markets. Dasgupta also makes the case \u2014 again, tenuous but interesting \u2014 that Delhi\u2019s unsettling present is the future of most of the world\u2019s urban centers, that elites everywhere will withdraw from their territories as they have done in Delhi, and that even Western cities will face the social frictions and resource scarcities that Delhi is already facing. But there is some sleight of hand here. Dasgupta has just tried to persuade us that Delhi turned out very differently from New York and Paris because of its particular history and culture, yet now he forecasts that New York and Paris will be doomed to Delhi\u2019s fate, ignoring the particular histories and cultures of those two cities.\u201cCapital\u201d is a choppy book, bouncing between slabs of history, Dasgupta\u2019s thoughts on the sociology of the city and his interviews with people drawn largely from Delhi\u2019s upper classes. The interviews are puzzling artifacts, often consisting of transcripts that run on for pages at a time. The style is modeled perhaps on Studs Terkel\u2019s oral histories, but Dasgupta never allows his subjects\u2019 distinct voices to emerge and, curiously for a novelist, he seems to lack much interest in filling them out as characters. A few spring somewhat to life of their own accord, notably a bumptious young man he calls Mickey Chopra, the 28-year-old scion of a billion-dollar business empire who wants to move on from running his nightclub to buying land and establishing an agribusiness empire in Africa, and whose idea of self-restraint is to wait awhile before buying his \u201cnice Gulfstream plane.\u201d But most of the others \u2014 the retired drug dealer, the auto parts czar, the survivors of various wrecked marriages, the assorted entrepreneurs \u2014 are just mouthpieces for the moneyed life. A reader makes the same discovery many visitors to Delhi make soon after their arrival: Hearing people talk about how they earned their money, and about what they want to do with it, isn\u2019t very entrancing.Within the convolutions of Delhi\u2019s greed, Dasgupta manages to smuggle in one improbable hope: that politicians and entrepreneurs, hurrying their ill-gotten gains home from foreign tax havens, will now invest heavily in India, spurring its progress in a way its government seems unable to do. (The suggestion comes from an acquaintance of Dasgupta\u2019s who moves illegal money for the Indian elite.) But there are alternative, bleaker futures, and in his sparkling 1970 book \u201cDelhi: Capital City,\u201d a civil servant named Asok Mitra hinted at one of them.Peering back into history and noting the rise and fall of nine cities on the site where Delhi now stands, Mitra was reminded of Hercules\u2019 fight with the wrestler Antaeus, son of the earth goddess. Every time he was thrown to the ground, Antaeus was healed by his mother\u2019s touch, and Hercules could win only by hoisting his rival into the air and crushing him. \u201cI sometimes wonder,\u201d Mitra wrote, \u201cif this is how the nine cities of Delhi perished in successive periods of history\u201d \u2014 if Delhi, heaved up to new heights of wealth and vulgarity, lost contact altogether with the ground realities of the country it governed and propelled itself into disaster. Today\u2019s Delhi may never perish in quite the manner of its nine predecessors, but \u201cCapital\u201d is filled with signs that the city needs urgently to be brought back to earth.

{"Headline": "The Greening of Business Travel Gains Momentum", "Date": "2014-05-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBusiness TravelOn a single afternoon recently, Rob Bernard had a meeting in Kenya, one in Ireland and one in Finland \u2014 three countries and two continents in less than 24 hours.But he never left his desk in the United States. \u201cI\u2019m able to do that digitally now, instead of physically, and that saves massive amounts of time, massive amounts of carbon emissions and makes me far more productive because I\u2019m not trying to figure out all these time zones with my body clock,\u201d said Mr. Bernard, the chief environmental strategist at Microsoft.By using digital conferencing technologies like Skype, Lync and Polycom\u2019s telepresence solutions, Microsoft says it has been able to reduce travel in its field offices by 59 million miles in the last fiscal year alone.Given the necessity of some trips, business travel is not going to be fully replaced by its virtual equivalent. But as more companies try to understand where their activities hurt the environment, they are finding that travel is far and away the biggest part of the equation.That fact, combined with the ever-pressing need to control costs, has made business travel in recent years the focus of sustained attention by corporations looking to reduce expenses and their carbon footprint. Companies also hope that putting greener travel policies in place will appeal to a younger generation of environmentally knowledgeable employees \u2014 and perhaps more important, prospective recruits \u2014 and burnish their brands as good corporate citizens.\u201cIt\u2019s one of these things that is embedded in corporate travel departments and facility management these days,\u201d said Mr. Makower. \u201cEnvironmental responsibility is part of how you do business.\u201dWhat are some of the ways to diminish the environmental impact of a trip that can\u2019t be avoided? The reality is the options are limited, said Mr. Makower.Airlines are taking the basic steps. \u201cThere\u2019s recycling being done on flights, but one would be hard-pressed to compare United to Virgin America to Delta in terms of their environmental commitment and achievements,\u201d Mr. Makower said. \u201cThere is no green standard for airlines, and since that is the most impactful part of many business trips, one could make the case that we are just nibbling at the edges of the problem.\u201dCorporations, for their part, are taking a number of different steps to make their travel programs more sustainable, whether their travelers are in the air, behind the wheel or bedding down for the night.Marsh & McLennan, a professional services firm and one of the largest companies in the insurance industry, has negotiated deals on hybrid and high-efficiency economy car rentals for its employees. And on its travel booking website it broadcasts the message that employees should consider alternatives to air travel, such as taking the train whenever possible, to help cut carbon emissions.Employees who must be on the road are encouraged to book direct flights instead of ones with multiple stops, to combine trips and to patronize certified green hotels that have preferred provider status. Videoconferencing is suggested as an option, if it is feasible.This approach to travel has produced benefits that go beyond the purely environmental.\u201cWe are seeing it as a selling point all over at recruiting events,\u201d said Elizabeth Barry, Marsh & McLennan\u2019s chief sustainability officer. \u201cHiring managers tell us the prospective employees are even willing to take a little pay cut to work for a company with those types of programs.\u201dFor many millennials, the efforts a company makes to have environmentally friendly policies in travel and other areas are rapidly becoming a critical component in their job selection process, not just a nice-to-have extra benefit. For some, \u201cbeing able to substitute technology for travel is a prerequisite for screening potential employers,\u201d said Mr. Makower.To encourage its employees to travel responsibly, Microsoft has a carbon fee program that charges internal departments for emissions related to their business travel. The fees collected by this model go into a general fund used to make green energy purchases.\u201cIf I travel to New York, I would have a plane trip, and I would have a carbon indicator and a carbon fee associated with that trip \u2014 and Microsoft would offset that carbon I used,\u201d Mr. Bernard said. \u201cThat\u2019s all visible to me when I book the trip, and the fee my group pays is based on that.\u201dAnd these green travel policies are not limited to commercial companies. Many public agencies have green business travel programs as well, either mandating certain practices or simply making options more widely available.Hotel accommodations that are environmentally friendly are now available in most cities across the country and in major business travel destinations around the world. These lodgings typically have recycling programs, use high-efficiency LED lights and conserve water by asking guests to reuse towels. Some hotel operators buy only environmentally friendly supplies like laundry detergent and other cleaning products.Other hotels have gone all out in their green efforts. The Las Vegas Sands Corporation, for example, built a solar thermal system on the roof of its Palazzo resort to deliver hot water for its swimming pools and spas.As some companies are doing what they can to promote more sustainable travel practices, many employees are asking about green travel alternatives without being prompted.When Megan Zanella-Litke accepted her post as sustainability manager at the University of Richmond in 2010, she knew she would be working with faculty, staff and students on a wide variety of sustainability projects, including green buildings, renewable energy plans, a community garden, recycling and composting. But what has surprised her is that her office has become the go-to place for faculty and staff who are heading out of town for work to explore their travel options from an environmental perspective.\u201cIt is astounding how many people stop by to ask how they can limit their footprint going to a conference and learn about public transportation systems where they\u2019re headed,\u201d said Ms. Zanella-Litke.As a result, the university now offers carbon emission comparisons on its website, showing, for example, how much carbon is used if someone is traveling from, say, Richmond to New York City by plane, train, bus or car. \u201cEmployees can see side-by-side what the environmental impact of that travel is and make decisions with that information in hand,\u201d she said.Commuting, which after all is a kind of business travel, is getting similar attention at many organizations.For the last three years, 26-year-old Bennet Huber has pedaled his bike to work at the software development firm Azavea based in Philadelphia. Time allotted for his roughly four-mile commute: around 20 minutes on a 12-speed Raleigh Technium, built circa 1990.The amenities for bike commuters at the firm of about three dozen employees include bike racks inside the office with space for 12 to 15 bikes (depending on how much they are squeezed together), lockers for stashing sweaty cycling clothes, a changing room and a shower.And much to the delight of Mr. Huber, a software developer, anyone who bikes to work receives a $20 a month stipend to use toward bike-related expenses. After he accrued around $400, he bought a new wheel set. \u201cThat was really nice,\u201d he said. \u201cI know someone who bought most of a bike by saving up for two years.\u201dMr. Huber added, \u201cEven the C.E.O. rides his bike to work.\u201dCommuting options at a growing number of companies include a bike-friendly office like at Azavea, ride-sharing programs that provide preferred on-site parking, free bus rides to and from the office and a more favorable stance on telecommuting.\u201cWe encourage our people to work from home or find alternatives when it makes sense, such as car-pooling,\u201d said Shannon Schuyler, corporate responsibility leader at the auditing giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cWhen done well, offering travel flexibility results in better job satisfaction and increased productivity, all while helping manage our overall footprint.\u201dAt Microsoft\u2019s Redmond, Wash., campus, two-wheeled commuters have access to on-site bicycle shops with subsidized tuneups and repair tools, locker rooms with showers and covered parking for 3,443 bicycles.For employees who choose to commute by bike, the company offers a reimbursement program, similar to the one offered by Mr. Huber\u2019s employer, that allows them to receive money for bike-related purchases and discounts at local bicycle shops.Microsoft also offers a shuttle service for Puget Sound area Microsoft employees that has 22 routes throughout metropolitan Seattle. Of the roughly 20,000 employees who have used the service since its beginning, 60 percent drove by themselves before riding it.Since the first 13 buses ran their routes in 2007, the service has grown to include 74 buses and is on pace to surpass 700,000 annual employee rides to and from work this year.That has helped Microsoft eliminate 46.3 million miles of travel and more than 19,936 metric tons of carbon, according to Mr. Bernard.For all the efforts around greening business travel and commuting, however, the immense carbon footprint of air travel can erase many of these gains.\u201cAt my 16-person firm here in Oakland, Calif., almost no one drives to work,\u201d said Mr. Makower. \u201cWe have huge windows, so the lights are out. It takes us a month to go through a ream of paper. But the minute I jump on a plane to go someplace, all of that is meaningless.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Wants Free Love Anyway?", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyWhen Misty Terrell turned 28, she happened to see an ad for a special deal on the dating site eHarmony\u00ad and decided it was time to get serious about her love life. Terrell felt pretty optimistic. The site claims responsibility for 542 marriages a day through its \u201cscientific approach\u201d to finding soul mates: an exhaustive questionnaire, the trademarked \u201c29 dimensions of compatibility\u201d algorithm and its clinical labs where psychologists spend hours analyzing couple interactions. For this sort of comprehensive matchmaking, the company charges $60 a month, which is far more than most dating sites, but perhaps something of a bargain when it comes to finding true love. Terrell signed up to receive five potential matches a day for six months.Her first encounters, however, were not all that great. One guy\u2019s mother chauffeured them to dinner; another date took her to the Chili\u2019s where his ex-girlfriend worked. So Terrell tweaked her settings to encourage better potential matches. She unchecked the box for sci-fi fans but still remained unimpressed by the selections. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like, Whom am I not getting introduced to?\u201d she says.Terrell\u2019s frustration was an age-old conundrum: Not, How do I find true love? But rather, What am I paying for? For as long as we have had middlemen, after all, we have blamed the middleman. (Quite literally, in fact; in ancient Athens, grain merchants were tried as enemies of the state for trying to profit during a food crisis.) And while the Internet may have democratized information \u2014 making it seemingly easier for any of us to sell an apartment or find a spouse on our own \u2014 we now seem more reliant on all sorts of digital middlemen than ever. Some of them, like eBay, perform simple matching functions that help fulfill the Internet\u2019s great promise of, say, connecting someone shopping for rare Slovenian pop LPs with sellers of same in a matter of seconds. But for more complicated searches, it\u2019s not always clear what role the middlemen serve.Nowhere are the middleman\u2019s limitations more evident than dating websites. Consider, for instance, that they don\u2019t even do the thing we perhaps most want them to do: vet potential matches for truthfulness. As a result, you almost have to assume that the lovelorn are lying about their height, weight and income; the entire online dating market, despite its immense popularity, is a giant buyer-beware zone. Some dating sites have tried to address this, writes Paul Oyer, the author of \u201cEverything I Ever Needed to Know About Economics I Learned From Online Dating,\u201d including a Korean site that checks national registration forms, diplomas and proof of employment. Oyer suggests that more and more companies will compete in this heavily vetted space. But it\u2019s difficult to see that type of scrutiny \u2014 in which our profiles are written by some third parties in white coats, after a weigh-in and a background check \u2014 going over in the United States, where privacy concerns are paramount. In the meantime, that buyer-beware zone is likely to continue.The good news is that the more seemingly useless brokers are, somewhat counterintuitively, the more valuable they can be in signaling our interest \u2014 what Oyer might call the \u201cmoney to burn\u201d move. If anyone can wink at you free on a dating website, or for that matter beam in a job r\u00e9sum\u00e9, their actions don\u2019t mean much. On the other hand, if someone fills out hundreds of questions and pays $60 a month \u2014 or in the case of a job applicant, researches a company and writes a detailed proposal \u2014 it signals a much deeper interest. Academic economists, in fact, use this sort of signaling in their own hiring process. When top-tier candidates are interested in working at lower-tier schools \u2014 for reasons of geographical preferences or spousal considerations, perhaps \u2014 they are encouraged to send a special \u201cwinking\u201d signal to schools that might otherwise consider them out of their league. The Korean dating site has tried something similar, holding a special event in which most participants could send two virtual roses. The signaling worked. Not only was the response rate higher for people who received a rose, but the roses worked better on people of middling desirability, those who might not otherwise believe that someone of higher desirability was a serious suitor.So, on some level, an expensive broker does nothing more than indicate the level of your game. Mikolaj Jan Piskorski, a Harvard Business School professor and author of \u201cA Social Strategy,\u201d examined hundreds of thousands of interactions on dating sites and found that the profiles people view on eHarmony\u00ad are very similar to the profiles people view on other sites. The vaunted matching algorithm, he says, doesn\u2019t really do that much that you can\u2019t do for yourself. And as much as we may appreciate having our choices limited, if only to save us from being overwhelmed, from a purely economic standpoint, there is no benefit to limiting your own options, even if it means getting sucked into a time-consuming rabbit hole.And this is particularly important, Piskorski says, for people in a hurry. \u201cOur entire economy has been built on the idea that more competition is better,\u201d Piskorski says. \u201cIt drives innovation and reduces prices. But if everyone competes with everyone else, no one actually wins. Then it is better to restrict competition.\u201d As much as consumers may be intoxicated by the prospect of the democratizing force of the Internet, or the notion that everything should be free, most of them simply don\u2019t have the patience to put up with it. You may make more money by selling your house on your own, but if time is a factor, an agent can sell it faster. If you have all the time in the world to date and don\u2019t mind doing it, you don\u2019t need to pay eHarmony\u00ad. But if you feel that time is running out and you want to meet other people who want a serious relationship, you should.Misty Terrell did meet her husband of more than five years, Corey, on eHarmony\u00ad. And despite her initial doubts, she will enthusiastically tell anyone who asks that it was well worth it. But when they first connected, both Misty and Corey were about to hit the expiration of their eHarmony\u00ad memberships. Their time was running out.Shaila Dewan is an economics reporter for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Older Cling to Jobs, Crowding Out the Younger", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE proportion of Americans with jobs fell sharply during the Great Recession, and has barely begun to recover, according to overall figures.In 2007, before the downturn began, 63 percent of working-age Americans held jobs. That proportion fell to just above 58 percent, and was a little under 59 percent last month.But the underlying reality may not be that grim. Over all, it appears that about one-third of the decline since 2007 can be accounted for by the natural reduction in the proportion of people working as more people reach retirement age. But that leaves two-thirds that came from the weak economy. Since employment bottomed in 2011, adjusting for demographics indicates that about half the decline has been reversed.The accompanying charts show the proportion of both men and women working during the first four months of each year since 2007, broken down into the narrowest age brackets calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They do not consider why someone is not working. So those who are looking for jobs are treated the same as those who are still in school, staying at home to raise families or retired. Because the charts are based on the months of January through April, they include students with part-time jobs during the school year, but not those who took full-time employment during summer vacations.In general, the older the group, the more likely it has been to hold onto jobs through the recession and recovery. In every age group above 62, the proportion of both men and women who are employed is higher than it was before the recession.Much of that change probably does not involve people getting new jobs, but instead shows that those with jobs are more reluctant to retire than their predecessors were before the recession. Such people may have greater fears about paying for retirement, reflecting both the fall in home prices during the downturn and the declining presence of defined-benefit pension plans. Even those with substantial savings may be concerned, with interest rates so low, that they can earn little on their savings without taking on significant amounts of risk. Those decisions collectively may be having a crowding-out effect on younger workers, by not freeing up jobs that could prompt promotions for some and new hiring to replace those who were promoted.If so, you may expect the biggest decline in employment to be among those just entering the labor force. And that is what happened. Among men age 20 to 24, the proportion working fell from 70.4 percent in early 2007 to 58.7 percent in early 2010. That figure has bounced back a little, to 62.7 percent this year. Many people in that age group are college students, of course, and may not be looking for work.Among men between the ages of 25 and 29 \u2014 an age when most are out of school \u2014 the proportion with jobs fell from 85.9 percent in 2007 to only 76.6 percent in 2010. It has since gone back to 79.6 percent, but that figure has barely budged over the last three years. The declines among older prime-age workers have generally been smaller, reflecting, in part, the fact that more of those people were likely to have had jobs before the recession and have been able to hold onto them. In almost all age groups, women did better than men during the downturn. Perhaps more women entered or re-entered the labor force to help out when their husbands lost work or took wage cuts. In addition, some of the hardest-hit occupations \u2014 particularly construction \u2014 were dominated by men.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Experts Seek Smarter Black Boxes for Automobiles ", "Date": "2014-05-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNone of those vehicles were on the roads, though. They were airliners, and the agency was the Federal Aviation Administration. Now, experts are wondering if some of its techniques can be adapted for highway use, and the black boxes in cars can be put to use as the ones in planes have.\u201cThe more data we have, and the more people thinking about it, the more of these problems we\u2019re going to catch,\u201d said David E. Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. Unraveling a problem like the Cobalt\u2019s, with a faulty ignition switch that tended to turn off the engine and disable the air bags, is hard, Mr. Cole said, so \u201cwe\u2019ve got to do a full press on whatever we have that can help us to get to that story more quickly.\u201dThe crash recorders in cars are not nearly as sophisticated as the ones in planes, and they do not store any data unless there is an impact. But looked at as a group, they could give important insights, safety specialists say. The government and automakers already maintain several large databases aimed at identifying problematic vehicles, including warranty claims and consumer complaints, and the black box data could complement those, experts say.But often, the black boxes are not examined at all.\u201cIf these things had been standard and they were being utilized a lot, we probably would have been able to prove this a little faster,\u201d Mr. Lund said, although he and others cautioned that the Cobalt flaw played a role in only a small number of fatal crashes, so spotting a pattern was not a certainty.Planes are easier. Big airliners are equipped with a device that copies the information that goes into the flight data recorder, in a format that allows easy download after ordinary flights. Analysts aggregate information from thousands of flights and look for indications of latent problems, like extreme maneuvers, even if they did not cause death or injury.In cars, the black box captures much less data and none for ordinary trips.But if there is a crash, some will give an indication of whether the engine was running at the time \u2014 the tip-off in Cobalts. The catch is that even in cases of death or injury, the boxes are generally not downloaded, unless there is a need to establish who was at fault. And even then, the data is usually not aggregated in a way that makes an analysis possible across multiple models of car.State Farm, for example, the insurance company that first spotted the link between faulty Firestone tires that were causing Ford Explorers to flip over, analyzes so few black boxes that it does not even bother to count them, a spokeswoman said.The result is that a technique used by the aviation industry to help drive the rate of death and injury to near zero is not available to help reduce motor vehicle fatalities, which run about 34,000 a year. Reducing them even by 1 percent would be a significant change. But the deaths linked to the faulty ignition switch in the Cobalts and other small cars \u2014 General Motors, the maker of Chevrolet, acknowledges 13 \u2014 are a source of outrage, liability and heartbreak, because G.M. and regulators had been alerted to the problem years ago.It would cost money, but not much, experts say. Insurance companies and police departments already send investigators to crash scenes with equipment like digital cameras and laptops; large-scale analysis would require more hardware and software.In contrast, injury crashes cost the American economy $244.7 billion in 2009, according to the National Safety Council, including medical expenses, lost wages and damages to vehicles. That does not count the deaths.Aircraft data is analyzed partly because there is strong public pressure to prevent plane crashes, but that is not so much a factor in highway safety, experts say, even if the number of motor vehicle victims was 11,000 times the number of airline passengers killed last year. The year before that, it was infinite; no airline passengers died.Advertisement"}

Economists had expected it to fall at a rate of only 1 percent in the first three months of the year.Compared with the first quarter of 2013, productivity increased 1.4 percent. Workers put in more hours in the first quarter, but falling output caused labor costs to rise.Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, surged at a 4.2 percent rate after falling at a 0.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Economists had expected unit labor costs to increase at a 2.6 percent rate.

{"Headline": "Theories on Why Housing Is Stalled", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReal Estate and the Recovery\u201cOpening up the spigots of development in high-priced, high-demand areas could \u2026 create a ton of new jobs in the construction sector and related fields. But most the areas of the country where housing demand is strongest are generally the areas most politically dominated by left-wing people who are reluctant to embrace a deregulatory agenda,\u201d Mr. Yglesias writes.There\u2019s a lot to his argument, and work by Mr. Yglesias, Ryan Avent and others over the last few years has convinced me that zoning restrictions and insufficient density in major cities really are inhibiting economic growth. But does it answer the immediate question of why housing hasn\u2019t rebounded to its historical norm as a proportion of the economy? Yes, San Francisco and Washington and Boston restrict developers\u2019 ability to put up tall buildings that lots of people might live in, but it\u2019s not evident that they are more restrictive today than they were in the 1990s, when national building activity was much higher relative to the economy.A second argument from Mr. Ritholtz is more subtle: The number of homeowners with low or even negative equity in their houses is significant enough to gum up the normal ebb and flow of the housing market. When people owe more on a house than they can sell it for, the normal churn in the market dries up. Mr. Ritholtz argues:\u201cWhen you consider the chain of purchasers that typically occurs in a residential real estate market, you will understand why homeowner equity is so important. Any home sale is usually part of a series of interdependent transactions. The newlyweds who buy a starter home are usually doing so from a married couple, who have a 3-year-old and another on the way. They want to buy a larger home with more bedrooms for the kids, and purchase that from the couple who are trading up to a nicer home in a better school district. Those sellers purchase their new home on more land, or with a better view or some other factor. The long chain of buyers and sellers, beginning with the first-time buyers, explains why household formation is so crucial.\u201d\u201cThe sensitivity of economic activity to rising house prices is much lower today than it was prior to the Great Recession,\u201d write Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi, academics who have done groundbreaking work on the relationship between debt and economic growth. \u201cThis is due to a number of factors, such as the rise in investor purchases and the fact that the households who would be most likely to spend out of housing wealth are no longer homeowners.\u201dThat is certainly consistent with the odd pattern that has been displayed in the last couple of years, in which home prices increases haven\u2019t translated into major gains in building activity or consumer spending. The next assignment desk challenge for Mr. Mian and Mr. Sufi: to figure out what will ultimately cause a change in the pattern \u2014 or whether it\u2019s something we should get used to living with for some time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is College Worth It? Clearly, New Data Say", "Date": "2014-05-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEveryday EconomicsSome newly minted college graduates struggle to find work. Others accept jobs for which they feel overqualified. Student debt, meanwhile, has topped $1 trillion.A new set of income statistics answers those questions quite clearly: Yes, college is worth it, and it\u2019s not even close. For all the struggles that many young college graduates face, a four-year degree has probably never been more valuable.The pay gap between college graduates and everyone else reached a record high last year, according to the new data, which is based on an analysis of Labor Department statistics by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Americans with four-year college degrees made 98 percent more an hour on average in 2013 than people without a degree. That\u2019s up from 89 percent five years earlier, 85 percent a decade earlier and 64 percent in the early 1980s.In a similar vein, the new Economic Policy Institute numbers show that the benefits of college don\u2019t go just to graduates of elite colleges, who typically go on to to earn graduate degrees. The wage gap between people with only a bachelor\u2019s degree and people without such a degree has also kept rising.But what about all those alarming stories you hear about indebted, jobless college graduates?I find the data from the Economic Policy Institute especially telling because the institute \u2014 a left-leaning research group \u2014 makes a point of arguing that education is not the solution to all of the economy\u2019s problems. That is important, too. College graduates, like almost everyone else, are suffering from the economy\u2019s weak growth and from the disproportionate share of this growth flowing to the very richest households.The average hourly wage for college graduates has risen only 1 percent over the last decade, to about $32.60. The pay gap has grown mostly because the average wage for everyone else has fallen \u2014 5 percent, to about $16.50. \u201cTo me, the picture is people in almost every kind of job not being able to see their wages grow,\u201d Lawrence Mishel, the institute\u2019s president, told me. \u201cWage growth essentially stopped in 2002.\u201dFrom the country\u2019s perspective, education can be only part of the solution to our economic problems. We also need to find other means for lifting living standards \u2014 not to mention ways to provide good jobs for people without college degrees.But from almost any individual\u2019s perspective, college is a no-brainer. It\u2019s the most reliable ticket to the middle class and beyond. Those who question the value of college tend to be those with the luxury of knowing their own children will be able to attend it.But there is nothing magical about 13 years of education.

{"Headline": "Activity at China\u2019s Factories Increases Slightly", "Date": "2014-05-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Activity at China\u2019s factories increased marginally in April, but export orders fell sharply, a government survey showed on Thursday, adding to questions about whether the economy was stabilizing after its first-quarter slowdown.The data came a day after Prime Minister Li Keqiang pledged to step up support for the trade sector, adding to measures taken over the past month amid concern that the economy might be losing momentum more quickly than expected.The official manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 50.4 in April from 50.3 in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said, in one of the first indications of how the Chinese economy started the second quarter. At just above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction, the reading indicated a slight pickup in activity for the month, although the figure was a notch below economists\u2019 expectations.Zhang Liqun, an economist at China\u2019s Development Research Center, which helps compile the P.M.I., said the index pointed to stabilizing economic growth ahead, but others disagreed.\u201cWe do not believe the economy has passed a turning point,\u201d said Zhiwei Zhang, China economist at Nomura. He expected economic growth to slow to 7.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with the same period last year, from an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter.The official P.M.I. is weighted toward bigger and state-owned enterprises, and tends to paint a rosier picture than the index compiled by HSBC and Markit Economics, which focuses more on smaller, private firms. A preliminary reading of the HSBC index last week suggested that factory activity shrank for a fourth straight month in April, although at a slower pace than in March. The final reading is due on Monday.The subindex for new orders rose to 51.2 in April from 50.6 in March, but the subindex for export orders fell to 49.1 in April from 50.1 in March, meaning export orders moved from gains to losses. Data released last month had shown that exports had fallen in annual terms for a second straight month in March, the weakest run since 2009.Sun Wencun, an economist at Citic Securities in Beijing, said that exports could benefit from a recovery in developed economies but that the property sector was a big concern.\u201cThe economy is showing slight improvements due to recent policy measures, but there is no sign of a bottoming out, and the trend of slowdown is continuing as the sluggish property market weighs on related industries,\u201d he said.Analysts see the property sector as a major risk to growth as evidence mounts of a rapid cooling in what had been one of the few strong spots in the economy.The rate of growth in home prices slowed in April, two private surveys showed on Thursday. The property sector supports some 40 other industries, including cement and furniture, and plays an important role in underpinning consumer confidence. The property market has lost steam since late 2013, after the authorities tightened controls on speculative buying and banks made it harder for home buyers and small developers to get loans.The state-run news media reported this week that the southern city of Nanning had eased rules on home buying in an effort to bolster the local economy, raising speculation that the move could be the start of a series of local-level support measures.The central government is trying to restructure the economy so it is driven more by consumption than the traditional engines of export and investment, but wants to avoid a sharp slowdown that could propel job losses and threaten social stability. The employment subindex of the P.M.I. held steady at 48.3 in April, indicating contraction, although the government has taken steps to create more jobs, particularly for college graduates.Mr. Li, the premier, has said that the economy must grow 7.2 percent annually to create 10 million jobs a year. Economists in a Reuters poll released this week forecast that economic growth would slow to a rate of 7.3 percent in the second quarter. For all of 2014, growth of 7.3 percent is expected, which would be down from 7.7 percent last year and the weakest showing in 24 years.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ripple Effects of Rising Student Debt", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApplied ScienceWhat are the roads not taken because students must take out loans for college? A collection of studies shows that the burden of student debt may well cause people to make different decisions than they would otherwise \u2014 affecting not just individual lives but also the entire economy. When students use up their debt capacity on student loans, they can\u2019t commit it elsewhere. \u201cGiven the importance of an entrepreneur\u2019s personal debt capacity in financing a start-up business, student loan debt, which cannot be discharged via bankruptcy, can have lasting effects later in life and may impact the ability of future small-business owners to raise capital,\u201d the study says. Considering that 60 percent of jobs are created by small business, \u201cif you shut down the ability to create new businesses, you\u2019re going to harm the economy,\u201d Professor Ambrose said.Total student loans outstanding have risen to $1.1 trillion, compared with $300 billion just a decade ago, according to the Fed\u2019s study. The average total debt for student borrowers was around $30,000 in 2013. No wonder borrowers have been reluctant to start businesses or to buy homes. They arrived at their conclusion by studying a well-off university that began meeting students\u2019 financial needs through a combination of work-study money and grants, and dispensing with loans altogether. (The school insisted on anonymity as a condition for participating in the study.) Before the new policy started in the early 2000s, students were more likely to choose well-paid professions like investment banking and consulting, Professor Rothstein said in an interview. After the policy took effect, more students chose jobs in areas like teaching and the nonprofit sector. In many cases, the choices that student borrowers make are just common sense, based on the financial realities they face. Taken together, they seem to be having a substantive \u2014 many would say negative \u2014 effect on the economy. Is that enough reason for schools or the government to step in with a solution? Not many schools are like Anon U (as the researchers above called it), which could afford to take loans off the table. If society wants to change the skewing effect of student loans, some tough decisions about allocating educational resources may well lie ahead. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Memorial Day 2050", "Date": "2014-05-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAndrew Sullivan\u2019s Dish blog last week linked to a very novel approach offered by Thomas Wells, a Dutch philosopher: Since climate change and environmental degradation pit the present against the future, our generation versus those unborn, we should start by giving the future a voice in our present politics.Wells suggests creating a public \u201ctrusteeship\u201d of nongovernmental civic and charitable foundations, environmental groups and nonpartisan think tanks \u201cand give them each equal shares of a block of votes adding up to, say, 10 percent of the electorate,\u201d so they can represent issues like \u201cde-carbonizing the economy\u201d and \u201cguaranteeing pension entitlements\u201d for the unborn generation that will be deeply impacted but has no vote.One way to get us to act with an intergenerational perspective is to enlarge the problem beyond climate \u2014 to make people understand that this is our generation\u2019s freedom struggle. The abiding strategy of our parents\u2019 generation was \u201ccontainment\u201d of communism in order to be free. The abiding strategy of our generation has to be \u201cresilience.\u201d We will only be free to live the lives we want if we make our cities, country and planet more resilient.Even if we can\u2019t attribute any particular storm to climate change, by continually pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we are \u201cloading the dice\u201d in ways that climate scientists are convinced will continue to raise average temperatures, melt more ice, raise sea levels, warm oceans and make \u201cnormal\u201d droughts drier, heat waves hotter, rainstorms more violent and the most disruptive storms even more disruptive. It is crazy to keep loading those dice and making ourselves more vulnerable to disruptions that will make us less free to live the lives we want. How free will we be when paying the exorbitant cleanup costs of endless weather extremes?Moreover, acting today as if climate change requires an urgent response \u2014 like replacing income and corporate taxes with a carbon tax, introducing a national renewable portfolio standard to constantly stimulate more renewable energy and raising the efficiency standards for every home, building and vehicle \u2014 actually makes us healthier, more prosperous and more resilient, even if climate change turns out to be overblown. We would end up with cleaner air and a tax structure that rewards more of what we want (work and investment) and disincentivizes what we don\u2019t want (carbon pollution). We would be taking money away from the worst enemies of freedom on the planet, the world\u2019s petro-dictators; and we would be incentivizing our industries to take the lead in manufacturing clean air, water and power systems, which will be in huge demand on a planet going from 7 billion to 9 billion people by 2050. In short, by taking the climate threat seriously now, we\u2019d make ourselves so much more economically, physically, environmentally and geopolitically resilient \u2014 and, therefore, more free.What containment was for our parents\u2019 generation \u2014 their strategy to fight for freedom against the biggest threat of their day \u2014 resiliency will be for our generation against the multiple threats of our day: climate change, petro-dictatorship and destruction of our environment and biodiversity. Let\u2019s act so the next generation will want to honor us with a Memorial Day, the way we honor the sacrifice of previous generations. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Changed Life of the Poor: Better Off, but Far Behind", "Date": "2014-04-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Is a family with a car in the driveway, a flat-screen television and a computer with an Internet connection poor?Americans \u2014 even many of the poorest \u2014 enjoy a level of material abundance unthinkable just a generation or two ago. That indisputable economic fact has become a subject of bitter political debate this year, half a century after President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a war on poverty. Starkly different views on poverty and inequality rose to the fore again on Wednesday as Democrats in the Senate were unable to muster the supermajority of 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster of a proposal to raise the incomes of the working poor by lifting the national minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. House Republicans, led by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, have convened a series of hearings on poverty, including one on Wednesday, in some cases arguing that hundreds of billions of dollars of government spending a year may have made poverty easier or more comfortable but has done little to significantly limit its reach.Indeed, despite improved living standards, the poor have fallen further behind the middle class and the affluent in both income and consumption. The same global economic trends that have helped drive down the price of most goods also have limited the well-paying industrial jobs once available to a huge swath of working Americans. And the cost of many services crucial to escaping poverty \u2014 including education, health care and child care \u2014 has soared.\u201cWithout a doubt, the poor are far better off than they were at the dawn of the War on Poverty,\u201d said James Ziliak, director of the University of Kentucky\u2019s Center for Poverty Research. \u201cBut they have also drifted further away.\u201dDemocrats have generally argued that addressing this disjunction requires providing more support for the poor, raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance benefits and making health care more affordable by expanding the reach of Medicaid and subsidizing private insurance for those who lack employer coverage.Republicans, by contrast, have proposed reducing government regulations and overhauling existing programs to encourage more work, arguing that would allow Washington to decrease spending on the poor.\u201cThe question isn\u2019t whether the federal government should help; the question is how,\u201d Mr. Ryan said at the hearing on Wednesday. \u201cHow do we make sure that every single taxpayer dollar we spend to reduce poverty is actually working?\u201dFor many working poor families, the most apt description of their finances and lifestyle might be fragile. Even with a steady paycheck, keeping the bills paid becomes a high-wire act and saving an impossibility. Tammie Hagen-Noey, a 49-year-old living in Richmond, Va., tapped at an iPhone as she sat on the porch of the group home where she lives \u2014 its proprietor is a friend of her daughter\u2019s. She earns $7.25 an hour at a local McDonald\u2019s, and makes a little extra money on the side from planting small plots of land for neighbors who want to garden.Ms. Hagen-Noey is trying to rebuild her finances, which have been decimated by divorce, government liens and addiction. At the top of her list of priorities is finding better-paid work. She produced a paycheck that showed her earnings so far this year: $2,938.51.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery cent of that goes towards what I need.\u201d A few months ago, she sold her car for $500 to make rent.Two broad trends account for much of the change in poor families\u2019 consumption over the past generation: federal programs and falling prices.Since the 1960s, both Republican and Democratic administrations have expanded programs like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit. In 1967, government programs reduced one major poverty rate by about 1 percentage point. In 2012, they reduced the rate by nearly 13 percentage points. As a result, the differences in what poor and middle-class families consume on a day-to-day basis are much smaller than the differences in what they earn.\u201cThere\u2019s just a whole lot more assistance per low-income person than there ever has been,\u201d said Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cThat is propping up the living standards to a considerable degree,\u201d he said, citing a number of statistics on housing, nutrition and other categories.Decades of economic growth, however, have been less successful in raising the incomes from work of many poor families, prompting a strong conservative critique this year that hundreds of billions of dollars in antipoverty programs have failed to make the poor less dependent on government.\u201cThat\u2019s the crux of the problem,\u201d Mr. Rector added. \u201cWhat sort of progress is that?\u201dBut another form of progress has led to what some economists call the \u201cWalmart effect\u201d: falling prices for a huge array of manufactured goods.Since the 1980s, for instance, the real price of a midrange color television has plummeted about tenfold, and televisions today are crisper, bigger, lighter and often Internet-connected. Similarly, the effective price of clothing, bicycles, small appliances, processed foods \u2014 virtually anything produced in a factory \u2014 has followed a downward trajectory. The result is that Americans can buy much more stuff at bargain prices.Many crucial services, though, remain out of reach for poor families. The costs of a college education and health care have soared. Ms. Hagen-Noey, for instance, does not treat her hepatitis and other medical problems, as she does not qualify for Medicaid and cannot pay for her own insurance or care.Child care also remains only a small sliver of the consumption of poor families because it is simply too expensive. In many cases, it depresses the earnings of women who have no choice but to give up hours working to stay at home.\u201cThe average annual cost for infant care in the U.S. is $6,000 or $7,000 a year,\u201d said Professor Ziliak of the University of Kentucky. \u201cWhen you look at the average income of many single mothers, that is going to end up being a quarter of it. That\u2019s huge. That is just out of reach for many folks.\u201dTiffany Beroid, a 29-year-old mother who works at a Walmart in Laurel, Md., said she works part time, rather than full time, because she and her husband could not otherwise afford child care. Their incomes already suffered when her doctors told her to stay off her feet during the late stages of her pregnancy, and she said Walmart would not accommodate her with a desk job.\u201cChild care was costing probably $350 a week,\u201d said Ms. Beroid, who makes $10.70 an hour. \u201cI would love to be in full-time work, if I could make enough to cover child care payments.\u201dAnd many poor families barely make it from paycheck to paycheck. For evidence, economists point to the fact that children living in families with food stamps eat more calories at the beginning of the month than the end of it.Economists pointed out that many low-income families struggled to use even the assets they had: keeping gas in the car, paying for cable and keeping the electricity on. Many families rely on expensive credit. And even if those families sold their assets, often it would only provide them with a small buffer, too.\u00a0Anthony Goytia, who works the night shift at a Walmart in Southern California, is reliant on payday loans to pay his bills.\u201cSome of our bills come in at the middle of the month,\u201d said Mr. Goytia, a father of four who makes about $16,000 a year. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got to pay our rent by the first, and when we don\u2019t have the money, we have to take out a payday loan.\u201dBobby Bingham, 38, of Kansas City, Mo., works three part-time jobs seven days a week to make ends meet, but struggles to cover basic living expenses: his apartment, his car, his car insurance, gas and utilities. He is also heavily in debt, owing $30,000 in student loans and about $12,000 in credit-card debt with an annual interest rate of 17 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s hard on my psyche,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no break. There\u2019s no time to breathe. I always have to think about the next step just to survive. It\u2019s not like I can look forward and plan, because I\u2019m just trying to think about tomorrow.\u201dIn the end, many mainstream economists argue, the lives of the poor must be looked at in light of the nation\u2019s overall wealth and economic advancement.\u201cIf you handpick services and goods where there has been dramatic technological progress, then the fact that poor people can consume these items in 2014 and even rich people couldn\u2019t consume them in 1954 is hardly a meaningful distinction,\u201d said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThat\u2019s not telling you who is rich and who is poor, not in the way that Adam Smith and most everyone else since him thinks about poverty.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Antitrust Chief Casts Doubt on Google Deal Over Rivals\u2019 Links", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief said Tuesday that he might yet take a tougher stance toward Google in a long-running case that he and the company have been in talks to settle for more than a year.But whether the announcement was an indication of a new hard line by Mr. Almunia or a diplomatic nod to the company\u2019s many critics in Europe was not clear. And any action would still be months away.Companies critical of Google\u2019s business practices, and prominent members of the French and German governments, have assailed the proposed settlement as doing too little to improve competition in online searches and advertising.Mr. Almunia said at a news conference on Tuesday that he still wanted to settle the case. But he also said he could file formal charges against the company if a further round of feedback about the settlement from 19 groups and companies, including Microsoft and publishers in Germany, was persuasive.\u201cIf, because of the arguments of the complainants, we consider that the proposals that we have on the table are not enough, we will need to decide on the next steps,\u201d said Mr. Almunia, who added that he would make the decision whether to send formal charges after the summer break.The proposed settlement with Google has come under fire before the elections for the European Parliament, which conclude on Sunday, in which the might of American technology companies like Google has become a highly politicized issue.And in criticism that came to light this week, the French economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, and his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, wrote to Mr. Almunia to express their concern about the settlement and to push him to demand more concessions from the company.\u201cSince the start of this procedure, we share entirely the deep concerns of the companies that have complained,\u201d the ministers wrote to Mr. Almunia, according to a copy of the letter seen by The International New York Times. The letter was written this month, though the copy did not show which day it was sent.\u201cWe consider that certain essential aspects should be improved\u201d in the way Google displays links to rival services when users conduct searches, wrote the ministers, who, like Mr. Schulz, are Socialists. If those improvements still did not satisfy Google\u2019s critics, the commission should consider sending the company formal charges, they wrote.Google has also been criticized by Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications giant, and the Open Internet Project, which represents a number of European companies, including the German publisher Axel Springer.Asked at the news conference whether Google might yet be fined, Mr. Almunia replied, \u201cWho knows.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Summer Driving Beckons, Gas Prices Are All Over the Map", "Date": "2014-05-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHOUSTON \u2014 With the Memorial Day weekend representing the beginning of the summer driving season, it might be a good time to plan a trip to the Gulf Coast or the Rocky Mountains. Gasoline prices in the nation\u2019s midsection should be 10 to 50 cents cheaper per gallon than a year ago.For comparison shoppers, trips down California\u2019s coast or out to the Hamptons don\u2019t look quite so appealing. Gasoline prices on the coasts will be 10 to 30 cents higher a gallon than last year.The sharp differences in gasoline prices around the country reflect all the complexities of the global energy markets. Fighting between militias blocking oil exports from Libya, along with persistent unrest in Iraq and Nigeria and uncertainty surrounding Russian oil supplies, are keeping prices high for the types of oil imported on the East Coast. Fitful maintenance at a handful of refineries in California and Washington state are curbing gasoline supplies on the West Coast, pushing up prices.At the same time, growing imports of cheap Canadian heavy oil are arriving at Midwest refineries, where maintenance has been smoother this year. That is helping to keep Colorado, Minnesota and Iowa drivers satisfied. And Gulf Coast drivers continue to enjoy the benefits of an abundance of oil and gasoline thanks to gushing fields in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.When experts take all the price divergences into account, they predict a national average at the pump this Memorial Day that will be virtually the same as in 2013.\u201cWe\u2019ll be slightly below last year and slightly below the year before nationally, and it will be the lowest price at the pump since 2011,\u201d said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst for GasBuddy. But he added that comparisons of national averages were of little use since \u201cit\u2019s really a tale of two countries.\u201dAs of Friday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.66, a fraction of a cent lower than last year. But the range was sizable: in California, motorists paid on average $4.13 a gallon, while in Missouri and Arkansas only $3.40, according to the AAA daily fuel gauge report.The AAA auto club is predicting that the most Americans will travel this holiday weekend since 2005, and that 36.1 million people will travel at least 50 miles, up 1.5 percent from 35.5 million last year.\u201cAs the economy continues to improve at a slow and steady pace, consumer spending, disposable income, consumer confidence and the employment outlook are trending up, which is welcomed news for the travel industry,\u201d said Marshall L. Doney, AAA\u2019s chief operating officer in a commentary distributed by the auto club.AAA estimated that 85 percent of travelers will travel to the beach or other amusements by car. It also estimated that airfares would be 6 percent higher than a year ago, while midbudget hotel prices would be up 2 to 3 percent and car rental prices up 1 percent.The biggest component of gasoline prices is oil prices, and most oil benchmarks are 10 percent or more higher than last year.World supplies and demand have been roughly in balance in recent years, as increasing North American production has taken up the slack for interruptions caused by North African and Middle East tensions. But the supply outlook has weakened since the beginning of the year, when it appeared that nuclear energy talks with the West might loosen oil export sanctions on Iran and hopes brightened that tensions between militias and the weak central government in Libya might ease. Those hopes have been dashed, and Russia\u2019s aggressiveness toward Ukraine has raised the possibility of eventual export sanctions on Russia, which supplies as much oil to world markets as Saudi Arabia.Gasoline prices have generally been higher in recent months than 2013 also because of complex refinery refitting and maintenance on the West and Gulf Coasts. But with the seasonal change from winter to summer blends virtually over, most energy analysts think gasoline prices have peaked, unless a strong hurricane in August or September causes shutdowns of gulf refineries and pipelines.On the bright side, few energy experts say they think that a meaningful drop in Russian oil exports is likely. And while 2.5 million barrels a day of OPEC production in Libya, Iraq, Iran and Nigeria are offline, according to a recent Barclays report, Saudi Arabia and a handful of other producers have kept the cartel\u2019s production near its target of 30 million barrels a day. With the Brent oil benchmark price nearly $10 above the OPEC $100-a-barrel preferred price, there is little likelihood the cartel will cut production meaningfully anytime soon.The Eastern Seaboard has been receiving larger shipments of North Dakota oil by rail over the last year, replacing some more expensive imports. But with pipelines from the Gulf of Mexico refineries full, New York and other coastal states still depend on expensive imports from the North Sea and Africa.For national drivers, on average, Mr. Kloza said, \u201cthe future looks really bright.\u201d He added, \u201cIf you could guarantee no hurricanes this year, we could see a steady drop in gas prices for the remaining seven months of the year.\u201dBut that is still a big \u201cif.\u201d Much of the country\u2019s refinery capacity lies in a relatively narrow coastline between Corpus Christi, Tex., and Pascagoula, Miss. With those refineries having growing export commitments to Mexican and South American customers, a couple of shutdowns could cause gasoline shortages and send prices soaring across the South and the Eastern Seaboard by Labor Day, as it has during some past hurricane seasons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "King Cotton and His Bloody Surrogates", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExhibition ReviewThe show traces its thematic threads through that period\u2019s fabric with such care that, after seeing the patterns, you will not easily look at coarse woven cloth, the American flag, quilts, mourning clothes \u2014 or perhaps even the Civil War \u2014 in quite the same way again. Textiles, we come to see, did not just reflect the war\u2019s events or were just another element of the conflict; in many ways they were at the war\u2019s heart.Intriguing curiosities stand out. Here, for example, is an 1861 pattern for soldiers\u2019 mittens: The forefinger is independent, set apart so it could manipulate a trigger. Or look at scraps of the silk fabric used to make hot air balloons that floated over enemy lines for reconnaissance, foreshadowing air wars as yet decades away. Here too is the first flag made after Congress passed a law near the war\u2019s end that American flags had to be made of American cloth. Other objects touch more intimately on the period\u2019s traumas. Hemp becomes historic in the rope and noose that were used \u2014 according to a donor\u2019s claims \u2014 to hang the violent abolitionist John Brown in 1859. A roll of lint inspires another kind of wince: The medical practice of the time was to pack wounds with lint and then wrap them in a wet cloth. And a man\u2019s white shirt, worn by a Civil War veteran and amputee, has one of its sleeves sewn up \u2014 not an uncommon postwar alteration, as a nearby Winslow Homer engraving shows. But the exhibition goes further. What, after all, was the most important product produced by enslaved labor? Cotton. It accounted for half of American exports by 1850; in 1860, we learn, cotton manufacturing contributed over $115 million to the American economy. And the processing of Southern raw cotton in Northern mills created a network of interwoven economies, complicating allegiances. Often overlooked, in fact, is the clothing worn by the four million American slaves created from what was called \u201cplantation cloth,\u201d \u201cslave cloth\u201d or \u201cnegro cloth\u201d: coarse, thick bolts of linsey-woolsey, kersey and osnaburg. It is startling to learn that in 1860 the state that led the country in slave-cloth production was Rhode Island. We see some swatches from 1835, which, the exhibition notes, were used by a mill owner to show \u201cthe quality expected by their Southern customers.\u201d Then, during the war, the industry collapsed. United States cotton production fell to about 4 percent of prewar output. Both sides suffered scarcities. But the wool industry boomed. Manufacturers mixed old wool with new to make cheaper cloth. Recycled wool was known as shoddy \u2014 a word that permanently entered the language after the \u201cshoddy scandals\u201d of 1861-62 revealed just how shoddy that cheap cloth was. We are also reminded how closely textile crises affected the war; armies don\u2019t travel only on their stomachs. An 1864 photograph shows an array of canvas-topped Union supply wagons parked in a field; more than 6,000 such wagons would trail behind the Army of the Potomac, for 60 miles. Tents were needed (one is here), uniforms, mosquito netting, blankets and extra clothing (because \u201csoldiers in the field found that lice multiplied in the seams of their shirts\u201d). Textiles were so interwoven with the slavery system that they also posed an issue for abolitionists. Quakers established \u201cfree labor\u201d stores, selling goods from sources free of slavery\u2019s stain. A daguerreotype of a fearsome-looking Vermont Quaker farming couple \u2014 they harbored and hired runaway slaves \u2014 accompanies the wife\u2019s astonishingly well-preserved wool and silk dress made of free-labor fabric. And finally, there are quilts, which appear throughout the exhibition as its most imposing artifacts. With their multisectional construction, they can encompass multiple perspectives; and with their long processes of handiwork, they can reflect and recount extended histories. They remind us, as the exhibition points out, that the Civil War was not simply a geographical conflict: \u201cDisagreements were complex and cross-sectional.\u201d And sometimes, ambiguous. A lovely 1859 botanical quilt from the Shenandoah Valley, for example, contains squares picturing 23 native Virginian flowers. They surround another square showing a \u201cTree of Liberty\u201d that holds 30 apples, one for each of the states at midcentury. Is this quilt a declaration of state loyalty or a reminder of Union allegiance? It was made by Esther Matthews for her grandson, who died of wounds in the Confederate Army. Another quilt here is made by a man, Sgt. Stephen Al Lewis, who stitched it from blanket scraps and uniforms while recovering in a Union hospital. Lewis had escaped from Confederate imprisonment, had his life saved by an enslaved woman who hid him, and then, remembering that assistance, gave shelter to an African-American fleeing Oklahoma\u2019s race riots in the 1920s. There is a quilt made by two slaves in Tennessee for their own use; an \u201calbum quilt\u201d made by women in an aid society, each contributing a square with a message for soldiers; and a vibrant quilt patterned with oak leaves and berries from Paducah, Ky., a prewar heirloom that was buried to protect it from ransacking Union soldiers. An 1867 quilt, known as the \u201creconciliation quilt,\u201d was created by Lucinda Ward Honstain in Brooklyn as a postwar folk album; one square shows a black man addressing a white man on horseback, saying \u201cMaster I am Free.\u201dAnd lest we take that sentiment\u2019s optimism as conclusive, the show includes a Ku Klux Klan hood from 1920s Vermont \u2014 a mask of white cloth made for a woman \u2014 when the Klan was agitating to keep Catholic and Jewish European immigrants out of the country. By the exhibition\u2019s end, is there anything about textiles and the Civil War that will ever seem quaint again?

{"Headline": "McConnell Win Leads Night of Victories for G.O.P. Establishment", "Date": "2014-05-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky decisively turned back the first well-financed Republican primary opponent he had faced since being elected in 1984, defeating a Tea Party-backed conservative who claimed the Senate minority leader had been too willing to compromise with Democrats.Once thought to be vulnerable to such a challenge from the right, Mr. McConnell won with ease over his opponent, the businessman Matt Bevin. Mr. McConnell\u2019s victory sets up what will be one of the most serious tests of his political career, a general election matchup against the Democratic nominee, Alison Lundergan Grimes. It is expected to be the costliest Senate race this year.Mr. McConnell\u2019s victory came on a day when five other states \u2014 Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Pennsylvania and Oregon \u2014 held primaries. And in many of those high-profile contests, it was establishment Republicans coming out on top over Tea Party challengers, as in the McConnell-Bevin race.In Georgia, Republicans sent David Perdue, a former chief executive of Dollar General, and Representative Jack Kingston, who has served 11 terms in the House, to a July runoff to fill an open Senate seat. The winner will face the Democratic nominee, Michelle Nunn, a former chief executive of the Points of Light volunteer group and the daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn. She faced nominal primary opposition.Georgia Democrats had hoped that the Republicans\u2019 nominee would be one of two hard-line conservatives who finished behind Mr. Kingston and Mr. Perdue on Tuesday. Tea Party-backed candidates have handed unexpected victories to Democrats in Delaware, Missouri and Indiana in recent years, and it was thought that a similarly conservative nominee would be just as vulnerable in Georgia. Still, Ms. Nunn has raised $6.6 million so far in a state that has not had a Democratic governor or senator in a decade but is undergoing rapid demographic changes thought to favor the party.The races in Kentucky and Georgia are important to Democrats\u2019 chances of keeping control of the Senate because they are the only two states where the party hopes to pick up Republican-held seats.In Oregon\u2019s Republican Senate primary, Monica Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon, easily defeated a more conservative opponent, State Representative Jason Conger. The Senate race there will be competitive only if 2014 turns into a wave year for Republicans, but party leaders think that Ms. Wehby positions them to challenge Senator Jeff Merkley, a first-term Democrat, if that turns out to be the case.The Republican primary for a House race in Idaho also represented something of a proxy war between the center-right and hard-line conservatives, with the more conservative of the two candidates also losing. In that race, Representative Mike Simpson, who has served eight terms, easily fended off a primary challenger from Bryan Smith, who received substantial help from conservative organizations. Washington-based interest groups lined up behind Mr. Simpson, who is close to Speaker John A. Boehner, spending $2 million.Pennsylvania has no Senate race this year, but the governor\u2019s race is being closely watched. Democrats nominated Tom Wolf, a wealthy businessman, as their nominee to take on Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican whose job is considered one of the most at risk in the country.A Philadelphia-area House race has also drawn attention because one of the Democratic candidates was Marjorie Margolies, a former congresswoman who is the mother-in-law of Chelsea Clinton. She was soundly defeated by Brendan Boyle, a state representative. Bill and Hillary Clinton had helped raise money for Ms. Margolies, and Mr. Clinton had recorded a turnout phone call.One of the main lessons emerging from the young primary season is that political fundamentals like candidate strength, fund-raising and incumbency remain paramount, even in an era of deep dissatisfaction with Washington. That Mr. McConnell, 72, so easily defeated Mr. Bevin in Kentucky underscored that point.Mr. McConnell spent over $11 million of the nearly $22 million he has stockpiled to cast himself as an effective conservative and to attack Mr. Bevin, who had never run for office before.Mr. Bevin criticized Mr. McConnell for having been in Washington too long, but Mr. McConnell emphasized what his 30 years in the Senate meant for Kentucky and what benefits the state would receive if he became the Senate majority leader after the election this fall.Mr. McConnell\u2019s wide margin of victory was no surprise; he had been leading in the polls for months. But his aides were quick to note that the threat from Mr. Bevin had been real. He raised over $3.3 million, the most of any candidate who has taken on an incumbent senator during the rise of the Tea Party in the last two election cycles.With an eye on controlling the Senate in 2015, Mr. McConnell has made no secret of his determination to send a message this year to hard-line conservatives by defeating them in primaries. \u201cI think we are going to crush them everywhere,\u201d he predicted in a March interview.But as he works to consolidate power in the Senate, Mr. McConnell must first unify the Republican Party in Kentucky and ensure that Mr. Bevin\u2019s supporters do not stay home this November. Ms. Grimes, the secretary of state, who has already raised over $8 million, faced no primary opposition and has devoted months to hammering the incumbent as the personification of Washington gridlock.Mr. McConnell will do so while carrying dismal approval numbers in Kentucky: A New York Times/Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month found that 52 percent of Kentucky voters disapproved of his performance and just 40 percent approved of his performance.Addressing supporters on Tuesday, Ms. Grimes touched on his vulnerability, criticizing Mr. McConnell for not doing more for Kentucky\u2019s economy and saying he had lost touch with the state.Yet Ms. Grimes, 35, has serious vulnerabilities of her own, most significantly the increasingly Republican tilt of a state that last elected a Democratic senator in 1992 and where President Obama is deeply unpopular. Mr. McConnell and his allies have already begun linking Ms. Grimes to Mr. Obama, who lost Kentucky twice. Just 32 percent of Kentucky voters approve of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance, according to the same New York Times/Kaiser Family Foundation poll.As he spoke at his victory celebration on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell seemed to preview the two themes of his campaign. He argued that support for Ms. Grimes was effectively a vote for Mr. Obama, and, in an appeal to women, he talked about his wife, his mother and three other Kentucky women who are unhappy with the Affordable Care Act.Jason Horowitz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "India's Businesses Seek Labor Changes", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside AsiaGURGAON, India \u2014 When Narendra Modi, the Indian opposition leader, talks about creating jobs in labor-intensive manufacturing, Sudhir Dhingra, a textile entrepreneur, hopes that he is serious.Mr. Dhingra, who employs 30,000 workers in more than 20 factories around the capital, New Delhi, says that politicians, for all of their promises, have shown no interest in acting to avert a looming employment crisis.\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t care,\u201d said the outspoken 66-year-old, who got his first break when he sold a batch of cheesecloth shirts to Britain in 1972.Early on, Mr. Dhingra survived a change of fashion that saddled him with a pile of unsold stock. Learning his lessons \u2014 to keep close tabs on the market and to control costs \u2014 he built Orient Craft into a $250 million business making 200,000 garments daily.Mr. Dhingra says that India\u2019s politicians are obsessed with the size of investments but have given \u201cno serious thought\u201d to how jobs are created.In Mr. Modi, 63, who polls show could become the next prime minister, Mr. Dhingra sees a leader who offers a better recipe: labor reforms, cheap land, steady power supplies and better infrastructure.\u201cModi understands how to promote industry. He has a track record,\u201d Mr. Dhingra said.Backers highlight Mr. Modi\u2019s economic success over more than a decade as chief minister of Gujarat, which has one of the highest growth rates among Indian states, thanks to the type of business-friendly policies that Mr. Dhingra favors.In a recent research report, Goldman Sachs estimated that if other Indian states increased manufacturing employment to levels achieved in Gujarat, India could create 40 million industrial jobs in the next decade.Skeptics counter that Mr. Modi\u2019s \u201cGujarat model\u201d favors capital- intensive industries and has failed to generate better jobs and that his Bharatiya Janata Party had little success on labor reforms when it last governed, in 1998-2004.The Indian economy needs 12 million new jobs every year to absorb a growing work force and urban migrants, a task made harder by the longest spell of growth below 5 percent since the 1980s.The stakes are high: Either India gets its youth to work \u2014 more than half of its 1.2 billion people are younger than 25 \u2014 or it will fall further behind Asian leaders like China and South Korea that long ago embraced jobs-driven growth.That is where companies like Mr. Dhingra\u2019s come in: Each of the 4,000 workers at its factory in Gurgaon, a satellite city of Delhi, makes about $150 a month supplying retailers like Gap and Marks & Spencer.The pay, just above the minimum wage, is low. But there is no shortage of takers. Many cloth cutters or sewing machine operators working at the crowded but orderly plant are migrants from hard-up northern states like Bihar.\u201cBefore, I wasn\u2019t earning, but now I can save enough money to support my family,\u201d Anita, a sewing machine operator, told Reuters. Her son is with her family, but she has been able to go home on leave to visit.Orient Craft could expand further, but rigid hire-and-fire laws mean Mr. Dhingra cannot employ seasonal workers to meet peak summer demand for cottonwear. Overtime is tightly controlled.\u201cIt slows you down \u2014 it\u2019s too much bureaucracy,\u201d said Mr. Dhingra, who still controls the business after handing \u201csweat equity\u201d to two longtime partners.The signature jobs initiative of the present Indian National Congress-led government, a guarantee of 100 days of paid work a year for the rural poor, has been faulted as choking the supply of labor to more productive urban jobs like those in Gurgaon.With Congress heading for a drubbing at the polls, employers hope that the B.J.P., if elected, can make good on its pledges to fix India\u2019s complex and rigid labor laws.Subramanian Swamy, a party strategist, said that a B.J.P.-led government would review the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947, which requires the state to approve layoffs in companies with more than 100 workers.But how far Mr. Modi could go would depend on possible parliamentary alliances and whether he can win over skeptics in his own party.\u201cLabor reform is a sensitive subject,\u201d said Nirmala Sitharaman, a B.J.P. spokeswoman. \u201cSteps would be taken in consultation with all stakeholders.\u201dEven if Mr. Modi wins a strong mandate, India\u2019s constitutional setup may rule out radical change, as responsibility for labor policy is shared between the central government and the states.\u201cModi\u2019s likely instinct would be to amend labor laws to facilitate greater competition among the states,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, at the South Asia program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. \u201cHowever, this would require contentious legislative change and, thus, may not be an early priority.\u201dOne prominent commentator, Omkar Goswami, argues that India\u2019s labor laws \u201care politically impossible to repeal,\u201d and that Mr. Modi should focus instead on growth-promoting investment.\u201cThat \u2014 and not the case for frictionless firing \u2014 is the basis of labor market reforms,\u201d Goswami wrote in \u201cGetting India Back on Track,\u201d a book due to be published by Carnegie in June.Indira Hirway, of the Gujarat-based Center for Development Alternatives, disagrees. She said Mr. Modi\u2019s system has deprived workers of the benefits of gains in their productivity, making it the wrong model for India.For Mr. Dhingra, the textile boss, a smart, if self-interested, solution would be for the state to subsidize his full-time staff rather than pay the rural poor to do 100 days of work a year.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you consider connecting these 100 days to labor-intensive industries?\u201d he told Reuters, volunteering to pay the wage bill for the other 265 days of the year. \u201cOur labor costs come down, and we provide permanent work for the people. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201dManoj Kumar and Douglas Busvine are Reuters correspondents.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Leader Pledges Aid on Africa Tour", "Date": "2014-01-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s prime minister finished a three-nation tour of Africa on Monday in which he offered aid and development projects potentially worth billions of dollars to help his nation catch up with China\u2019s enormous footprint on the continent.The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said he wants to expand Japan\u2019s presence in Africa, and tap a region that can serve as both a source of minerals and energy for Japan\u2019s industrial economy and a new market for Japanese goods.Mr. Abe has made Africa one of the centerpieces of a diplomatic push to complement his domestic growth policies, known as Abenomics, which aim to end Japan\u2019s long economic decline.By placing more emphasis on Africa, Mr. Abe is throwing Japan into a scramble for resources there that also involves companies from China, the United States and other Western countries. Japan is particularly keen to find new sources of so-called rare earth metals, raw material used in electronics and cellphones that it currently imports mostly from China. But Japan also finds itself lagging far behind its rival China, which has been investing heavily in Africa for a decade. As if to underscore that rivalry, at the same time that Mr. Abe was in Africa, China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, was on a four-nation visit to the region.Japanese officials have said that while they cannot match the $75 billion in development aid that China has poured into Africa since 2000, they hope to close the gap in other ways. One is to use Japanese aid to train African engineers and technicians, in order to differentiate Japanese efforts from Chinese projects that have been criticized for employing mainly Chinese workers while offering few jobs to Africans.The tour, which imade stops in Mozambique, Ivory Coast and Ethiopia, also brought an unusual amount of showmanship to Japan\u2019s often drab style of diplomacy. On Friday, Mr. Abe traded jokes and even exchanged soccer jerseys with the president of Ivory Coast, Alassane Ouattara.

{"Headline": "After Buffett, Should Berkshire Hathaway Be Broken Up?", "Date": "2014-05-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter the OracleThere is an uncomfortable question hanging over one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations: Should Berkshire Hathaway be broken up when Warren Buffett retires or dies? The answer might be found in the very underpinnings of how American industry is organized and governed.It also is a standing repudiation of what academic economists thought they had figured out years ago about the pitfalls of conglomerates, those sprawling assemblages of disparate businesses that were all the rage in the 1960s and 1970s \u2014 Figgie International, ITT and Gulf and Western \u2014 and that corporate raiders spent the 1980s and 1990s dismantling.It shouldn\u2019t work, the academics would tell you. But it has. Essentially, it\u2019s because Berkshire Hathaway is a corporate governance hack. It manages to combine a longer-term management philosophy with the practical benefits of being a publicly traded company in the modern age.Warren Buffett, being Warren Buffett, did no such thing. He indicated a willingness to be even more acquisitive; he would even be open to a megadeal on the order of $50 billion. For context, here\u2019s a sampling of the kinds of tiny companies worth about that much: Starbucks, Lockheed Martin and Costco.So should Berkshire break up into smaller units? To get to an answer, you need to understand why conglomerates fell out of favor in the first place.The theory, to the degree there was one, is that these wise allocators of capital in the home office would make better investment decisions than the managers on the ground possibly could, and that investors would love the diversification of owning shares in a company with lots of different business interests.Which bring us back to Berkshire Hathaway. In the popular mind, Mr. Buffett may be known best as a stock-picker, but the company\u2019s investments in shares of other publicly traded companies added up to only 24 percent of Berkshire\u2019s total assets at the end of March.Most of Berkshire\u2019s value is in the operating companies it owns, including giants like the auto insurer Geico, the utility MidAmerican Energy, the railroad BNSF and much smaller ones like See\u2019s Candy and Acme Brick Co.The companies have their own managers running them day-to-day. But in Omaha, this astonishingly large company, with 331,000 employees worldwide, has a corporate headquarters with a mere 25 people on a single floor of an office building. From there Mr. Buffett and his staff allocate capital and contemplate acquisitions or sales, hire or fire people to run those portfolio companies, and otherwise stay out of the way.So is Berkshire Hathaway really any different from the inefficient conglomerates of old? Maybe. Here\u2019s why:At its best, shareholder activism can be a tool to replace irresponsible management. But there\u2019s a good case that it is also making American executives think only about the short term. There is no reward for plowing money into an ambitious project that might take five years to pay off if Carl Icahn and other shareholder activists will be baying for your head after two. Why reinvest earnings into new products when all the external pressure is to pay the money out as dividends?Mr. Buffett has an ironclad grip on the company \u2014 he owns 39 percent of Class A shares \u2014 and combined with a long-term approach, he can ignore the latest pleas by investors and shareholder activists. He can ignore the calls to invest in technology stocks in the 1990s, and ignore the calls to pay out dividends today.He can invest opportunistically at times when no one else would, such as when Berkshire bought preferred shares of cash-hungry Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis. And this sense that Berkshire will allow sound management for the longer term has led many owners of closely held private companies to sell to Mr. Buffett over the years, rather than auction their companies to the highest bidder.In other words, because of Mr. Buffett\u2019s reputation and enormous holdings of Berkshire stock, he can run the company with a long-term view even while benefiting from the wide ownership and liquidity that comes with having shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange.In the post-Buffett era, his conglomerate should remain one if you believe that the Berkshire corporate governance hack \u2014 of a long-term focus within a publicly traded company \u2014 is strong enough to survive him. Mr. Buffett\u2019s strategy has always been to buy companies with a strong \u201ceconomic moat\u201d protecting them from competitors. Berkshire\u2019s own economic moat is a history, management culture and corporate structure focused on the long term that can give it an edge over more short-term-focused public companies.After he spent a lifetime building Berkshire Hathaway into a giant of American industry, Mr. Buffett\u2019s final task may be an even harder one: to turn an advantage that has been tied together with his reputation and ownership of Berkshire stock into something that will outlive him.Advertisement"}
