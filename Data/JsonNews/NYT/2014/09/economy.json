{"Headline": "Google Is Target of European Backlash on U.S. Tech Dominance", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross Europe, Google has been under fire, reflecting the broader challenges facing American technology companies. Google, fairly or not, has become a glaring proxy for criticism of an intrusive American government and concern over America\u2019s unmatched technology dominance. When Google initially settled with regulators in February, it emerged largely unscathed, agreeing to make modest adjustments to its search formula and avoiding a fine. Now, the deal is in jeopardy. If Google does not acquiesce, regulators could toss out the settlement and bring formal charges, which could prompt billions of dollars in penalties and major changes to its operations.Google, with its broad reach, is arguably facing the most pressure. Accusations are mounting that Google unfairly exploits its dominant position in search, giving a competitive edge to its growing stable of businesses, like YouTube videos, its Google Play app store and its news alerts. A landmark European court ruling this year forced search providers to give the public greater sway in purging links to personal information. Its Street View cars, dispatched to scoop up data, have brought fines in France, Germany and Italy.The influence of Mr. D\u00f6pfner, who has rallied a group of publishers against the company, has risen after he played a crucial role in winning German support for Jean-Claude Juncker, the next head of the European Commission.Google has not been idle. While the company has stressed its efforts to negotiate with European regulators, it has also resorted to more familiar tactics.Much has changed since Google was founded in the late 1990s. It was once viewed as an idealistic start-up whose credo was \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re no longer seen as innocent geeks,\u201d said Thomas Tindemans, the chief executive of Hill & Knowlton Strategies in Brussels.Perceptions in Europe have been gradually changing over Google\u2019s dominance. The company commands about two-thirds of the United States search market, according to comScore, but close to 90 percent in Europe, excluding Russia.Anger over mass data collection by the American government has only amplified the concerns. J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Zimmerman, a co-founder of the French Internet activist group La Quadrature du Net, said that when people told him now that they worked for Google, he says, \u201cHow do you like working for the N.S.A.,\u201d referring to the National Security Agency.\u201cMany users were lured by the convenience and comfort of the services,\u201d he said, but he added that the revelations by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden revealed that Google was part of a \u201cmassive breach of our security, of our data and of our sovereignty.\u201dOn another antitrust front, regulators have begun a preliminary investigation of the company\u2019s Android operating system for cellphones and other mobile devices. They are examining many complaints from competitors like Aptoide, a Portuguese app store provider that says Google\u2019s search results favor the Google Play app store. Other complaints have come from an association of photo libraries and a telecom company, claiming that Google skews search results.Digital privacy legislation is also advancing in Parliament. The legislation has accumulated more than 4,000 amendments, a record. Among the main proposals are restrictions on how companies like Google use personal data and requirements that they check with European officials before they comply with American subpoenas.\u201cGoogle was an interesting start-up at the beginning and a helpful website, but that has dramatically changed,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a member of the Green Party who has been the leading legislator shepherding through the legislation. \u201cFor politicians in Europe, it\u2019s clear they have to act and regulate the way Google dominates the market.\u201dTrouble is stirring at the country level, too. In Germany, publishers are fighting in court over compensation for the \u201csnippets of text\u201d that appear with Google News updates.\u201cTaken together, all these issues point to the pressing need for E.U.-wide common approaches to the challenges posed by Google and other players in the digital era,\u201d Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, Europe\u2019s competition regulator, said in a speech this summer. \u201cTheir centrality for Europe\u2019s economy and their pervasive presence in the lives of the vast majority of our fellow citizens are turning this into one of the defining domains of E.U. policy making.\u201dThen there is Microsoft, Google\u2019s longtime nemesis, which spends three times as much in Europe on lobbying and similar efforts. ICOMP, a Microsoft-backed group, has long targeted Google.\u201cGoogle is clearly in the cross hairs,\u201d said David Wood, a London-based partner at Gibson, Dunn, one of Microsoft\u2019s law firms, and legal counsel at ICOMP. \u201cA lot of the aura has faded, and the shine has come off, and people don\u2019t think they\u2019re the good guy anymore.\u201dJames Kanter contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Hardly any economists predicted the 2008 crisis \u2014 and the handful who did tended to be people who also predicted crises that didn\u2019t happen. More significant, many and arguably most economists were claiming, right up to the moment of collapse, that nothing like this could even happen.Furthermore, once crisis struck economists seemed unable to agree on a response. They\u2019d had 75 years since the Great Depression to figure out what to do if something similar happened again, but the profession was utterly divided when the moment of truth arrived.In \u201cSeven Bad Ideas: How Mainstream Economists Have Damaged America and the World,\u201d Jeff Madrick \u2014 a contributing editor at Harper\u2019s Magazine and a frequent writer on matters economic \u2014 argues that the professional failures since 2008 didn\u2019t come out of the blue but were rooted in decades of intellectual malfeasance. As a practicing and, I\u2019d claim, mainstream economist myself, I\u2019m tempted to quibble. How \u201cmainstream,\u201d really, are the bad ideas he attacks? How much of the problem is bad economic ideas per se as opposed to economists who have proved all too ready to drop their own models \u2014 in effect, reject their own ideas \u2014 when their models conflict with their political leanings? And was it the ideas of economists or the prejudices of politicians that led to so much bad policy? I\u2019ll return to those quibbles later, but Madrick\u2019s basic theme is surely right. His bad ideas are definitely out there, have been expressed by plenty of economists, and have indeed done a lot of harm.So what are the seven bad ideas? Actually, they aren\u2019t all that distinct. In particular, bad idea No. 1 \u2014 the Invisible Hand \u2014 is pretty hard to distinguish from bad idea No. 3, Milton Friedman\u2019s case against government intervention, and segues fairly seamlessly into bad idea No. 7, globalization as something that is always good. As an aside, this sometimes makes Madrick\u2019s argument more disjointed than I\u2019d like, with key propositions spread across nonconsecutive chapters. But there is an important point here, and Madrick has clarified my own thinking on the subject.Adam Smith used the phrase \u201cinvisible hand\u201d only once in \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201d and he probably didn\u2019t mean to say what most people now think he said. But never mind: Today the phrase is almost always used to mean the proposition that market economies can be trusted to get everything, or almost everything, right without more than marginal government intervention.Is this belief well grounded in theory and evidence? No. As Madrick makes clear, many economists have, consciously or unconsciously, engaged in a game of bait and switch.On one side, we have elegant mathematical models showing that under certain conditions an unregulated free-\u00admarket economy will produce an efficient \u201cgeneral equilibrium,\u201d in the sense that nobody could be made better off without making anyone worse off. Yet as Madrick says, these assumed conditions \u2014 including the assumption that people \u201care rational decision makers, and that they have all the price and product information they need\u201d \u2014 are manifestly not met in practice. What, then, do the elegant models tell us about the real world?In other words, economists arguing for free markets and limited government try to have it both ways: They claim that their doctrine is a deep insight derived from first principles, but dismiss as irrelevant the overwhelming evidence that these assumed principles don\u2019t hold in practice.Matters are even worse when it comes to the performance of financial markets. Here the proposition that markets should get it right \u2014 that major speculative bubbles can\u2019t happen (bad idea No. 5) \u2014 doesn\u2019t just depend on conditions that clearly don\u2019t hold in practice, but is directly contradicted by evidence on herd behavior and excess volatility. Yet \u201cefficient markets theory\u201d has maintained its academic dominance. Eugene Fama of the University of Chicago, the father of efficient markets, still denies that financial bubbles even exist \u2014 and last year he shared a Nobel in economic science.Still, all of these failings of mainstream economics were obvious long before the 2008 crisis. What has really come as news is the seeming inability of economists to agree on a policy response to mass unemployment. And here is where my quibbles with Madrick get louder.No. 2 on Madrick\u2019s bad idea list is Say\u2019s Law, which states that savings are automatically invested, so that there cannot be an overall shortfall in demand. A further implication of Say\u2019s Law is that government stimulus can never do any good, because deficit spending by the public sector will always crowd out an equal amount of private spending.But is this \u201cmainstream economics\u201d? Madrick cites two University of Chicago professors, Casey Mulligan and John Cochrane, who did indeed echo Say\u2019s Law when arguing against the Obama stimulus. But these economists were outliers within the profession. Chicago\u2019s own business school regularly polls a representative sample of influential economists for their views on policy issues; when it asked whether the Obama stimulus had reduced the unemployment rate, 92 percent of the respondents said that it had. Madrick is able to claim that Say\u2019s Law is pervasive in mainstream economics only by lumping it together with a number of other concepts that, correct or not, are actually quite different.Now, it\u2019s true that the relative handful of economists claiming that stimulus can\u2019t possibly work, or that slashing government spending is actually expansionary, have a much higher profile than their numbers or their influence within the profession warrants. Why? Partly, the answer is that the news media \u2014 especially but not only partisan media like The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page \u2014 have promoted the views of economists they like for political reasons. Partly, also, it\u2019s because politicians listen to economists who tell them what they want to hear. I\u2019m not saying that mainstream economists bear none of the blame; the decades-long retreat from Keynes has undoubtedly allowed old fallacies to make a comeback. But austerity mania has to a large extent spread despite mainstream economics, not because of it.I\u2019d make a further observation here: Academic economists have much less influence in Europe than they do in America. Yet the policy response to the crisis, while poor on this side of the Atlantic, has been much worse on the other. Politicians don\u2019t need bad advice from economists in order to go off the rails.Such quibbles aside, \u201cSeven Bad Ideas\u201d tells us an important and broadly accurate story about what went wrong. Economists presented as reality an idealized vision of free markets, dressed up in fancy math that gave it a false appearance of rigor. As a result, the world was unprepared when markets went bad. Economic ideas, declared John Maynard Keynes, are \u201cdangerous for good or evil.\u201d And in recent years, sad to say, evil has had the upper hand.

{"Headline": "Swimming Through Garbage", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAPE TOWN \u2014 YOU get a good feel for the health of the oceans when you stick your head in them for four weeks. This summer, I swam long distances in the Seven Seas: the Mediterranean, Adriatic, Aegean, Black, Red, Arabian and North Seas. The longest swim was 37 miles and took me two days. The swims were intended to draw attention to the health of the oceans. But I seriously underestimated the urgency of the issue I was swimming for. As the United Nations Patron of the Oceans, I have given many speeches stressing the need to protect our environment for the sake of our children and grandchildren. I now realize it\u2019s not about our children. It\u2019s about us. And the situation is much worse than I thought.I was shocked by what I saw in the seas, and by what I didn\u2019t see. I saw no sharks, no whales, no dolphins. I saw no fish longer than 11 inches. The larger ones had all been fished out.When I swam in the Aegean, the sea floor was covered with litter; I saw tires and plastic bags, bottles, cans, shoes and clothing.The Black Sea was full of Mnemiopsis, a rapidly reproducing species of jellyfish. This species is not native; it was brought in with the ballast on visiting ships, and has wrought havoc on the ecosystem.As I was about to jump into the Red Sea, I asked the boat\u2019s skipper whether I should keep a lookout for sharks. He told me not to worry \u2014 they\u2019re long gone. Well, that\u2019s exactly what does worry me. An estimated 100 million sharks are fished out of the world\u2019s oceans every year. That\u2019s like removing the lions from the Serengeti. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the gazelles, zebras and wildebeests had multiplied and eaten all the grass. And when the land was laid bare the grazers would starve. Predators are crucial for a healthy ecosystem, be it on land or in the water. I\u2019m 44 years old. I like to think I\u2019m only halfway through my life. That\u2019s hardly a comforting thought, though, when I imagine the changes in the oceans in the first half of my life continuing into the second. World population is expected to grow from seven billion to nine billion. As developing countries become developed, they will demand more resources like fuel, fresh water and food. Much of that food is expected to come from our oceans. And they simply don\u2019t have the capacity to provide it anymore.A priest who traveled to the New World with Christopher Columbus described in his diaries the turtles they encountered. \u201cThe sea was all thick with them,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso numerous that it seemed the ships would run aground on them.\u201d We have forgotten what our seas used to look like. Many species are now on the brink of extinction, from the Mediterranean monk seal to the hawksbill turtle in the Arabian Sea. In 2005, I swam in the Southern Ocean, just off Antarctica. It was cold \u2014 very cold \u2014 when I swam over a graveyard of whale bones near an old whaling factory. As far as I could see, there were bleached white bones piled up on the seafloor. Man hunted whales almost to the point of extinction, not seeming to care that we could lose one of the wonders of the sea forever. It is the coldness of the water that preserves the bones and makes it look as if they were left there yesterday, but I like to think they are there as a reminder of man\u2019s potential for folly.Fortunately, in 1986 most countries ceased commercial whaling, and some whale populations have made a spectacular recovery. Whales like the Southern right were brought back from the brink of extinction. Their numbers are now increasing 7 percent year after year. If we can do it with one species, surely we can do it for entire ecosystems. We just need to give them the space to recover.Marine protected areas, which are like national parks for the seas, are the best way to make that happen. In the Red Sea, I saw no coral and no fish. It looked like an underwater desert. But then, a little more than a mile later, I swam into a protected area, where fishing had been restricted. It was a sea as it was meant to be: rich and colorful and teeming with abundant life.We need far more of these protected areas. They allow the habitat to recover from overfishing and pollution, which helps fish stocks recover. When we create them, we protect the coral, which protects the shoreline and provides shelter for fish. They become places people want to visit for ecotourism. They are good for the world economy, for the health of the oceans, for every person living on this planet. This year in the Aegean I swam over tires and trash. In a few years, I hope to return, and swim over thriving coral reefs. Advertisement"}

The officials initially described the encounter on June 30 in San Pedro Lim\u00f3n as a shootout between soldiers and local gang members, with the soldiers firing in self-defense.\u201cThe official story is falling apart,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Americas division.President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto told reporters this week in New York, where he attended the United Nations General Assembly, that the attorney general\u2019s office was delving into the case. His term so far has been defined in part by efforts to focus attention on the economy, and away from crime and Mexico\u2019s dysfunctional justice system, but an agency spokesman said Friday that civil and military prosecutors were conducting separate inquiries and sharing information.Mexico\u2019s National Human Rights Commission is also conducting its own inquiry \u2014 and all of the investigations came about only after The Associated Press visited the site of the shooting, in a rural village of Mexico State, the day after it occurred and reported that there were no signs of a lengthy battle. Instead, The A.P. found what appeared to be a pattern inside the warehouse where the killings occurred: one or two closely placed bullet holes surrounded by blood, strongly suggesting that at least some of those killed were shot at chest level while standing against a wall.Last week, a woman who said she witnessed the events on June 30 in San Pedro Lim\u00f3n told The A.P. that only one person died in the initial confrontation. The rest were shot after surrendering, she said, including her 15-year-old daughter, who had been wounded in the leg and was lying on the ground when a soldier killed her.Esquire magazine\u2019s Mexico edition reported that the girl\u2019s name was Erika G\u00f3mez Gonz\u00e1lez, and that her death certificate showed that she died from a gunshot to the thorax. Given all the evidence and the arrests, said Eduardo Guerrero, a security analyst in Mexico City, it seems likely that the case will lead to punishment for at least some of the soldiers involved. The larger unknown, he added, is whether it will lead to increased accountability and transparency in Mexico\u2019s war on organized crime.Paulina Villegas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sectarian Violence in Myanmar Threatens Livelihood of Muslims", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOutside a mosque in a mainly Muslim area of Mandalay. After the riots in July, Muslim business owners said they had lost 40 to 80 percent of their income.MANDALAY, Myanmar \u2014 It has been more than a month since Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, was rocked by deadly anti-Muslim riots. Broken windows and large dents in the facades of a dozen small Muslim-run businesses are the only visible reminders of when about 300 radical Buddhists rode into town wielding swords and bricks, killing two people.Less visible are the economic scars. But Myanmar\u2019s Muslim community says politically charged anti-Muslim speech and widespread sectarian violence are threatening their livelihoods.\u201cWe were closed for a whole week, so there was no income,\u201d said Mama Gyi, a 56-year-old Muslim who owns a bike rental and convenience store in Mandalay. \u201cI usually make about $300 per month, but now there are not many tourists, so I can only rent out a couple of bikes per day. I am only making about 20 percent of what I was.\u201dMuslim traders and businessmen have been a major part of the country\u2019s economy since colonial times and the rule of the British East India Company. Today, they make up about 5 percent of the population, with many earning their income from small, family-run businesses.Aung, a Muslim who owns a medical supplies firm in Mandalay, said fears of more flare-ups had chased away customers and businesses alike.\u201cSome of the bigger companies had their businesses transferred to other districts,\u201d said Aung, who asked to be identified by his first name only, for fear of retribution. \u201cBut still there is a risk, since we do not know who is out there, and we do not want to get spotted while outside of Mandalay. We have to be careful about maintaining our businesses.\u201dHe said many shop owners moved with their families to Shan State, in the country\u2019s northeast, while others moved to the outskirts of Mandalay.Residents in Mandalay also said the police had blocked off streets where many Muslim shops were located after the rioting. The blockade is now gone, but a heavy police presence remains. Muslim business owners said they had lost anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of their income, which at $300 to $1,000 a month can be the difference between just getting by and poverty.Larger companies have faced resistance as well. The Qatar-based telecommunications operator Ooredoo, which introduced services in Myanmar on Aug. 15, has been the subject of anti-Muslim protests and a smear campaign in social media because of the company\u2019s roots in a Muslim country. In May, anti-Muslim nationalists led by Buddhist monks protested in Mandalay, calling for a full boycott of Ooredoo in Myanmar.Although several monasteries started their own boycotts, there has been no widespread spurning of Ooredoo, which said it had signed up more than a million customers in its first month.Sectarian violence, both against Muslims and the Rohingya minority, is growing worse in other parts of Myanmar, particularly in the states of Rakhine, on the country\u2019s west coast, and Kachin, in the northeast.\u201cSectarian violence is affecting the Muslim Rohingya business community on every scale from small businesses to the bigger companies. There has been no resolving the problem, and the situation is getting worse and worse as Muslims are suffering every day,\u201d said Khin Maung Myint, a Muslim Rohingya and an executive member of the National Democratic Party for Development, a political party defending the rights of Muslims.Since anti-Muslim violence started in 2012, he said, hundreds of thousands of the estimated 1.2 million to 1.5 million Rohingya have fled the country, with another 150,000 winding up in camps. As many as 80 percent of Muslim businesses in Rakhine State were affected by the violence, particularly in the state\u2019s capital, Sittwe.\u201cBusinesses owned by Muslims were looted by Rakhine extremists, and many are now closed, especially in Sittwe,\u201d he said, adding that more than 300 Muslim-owned shops at Myo Ma market, the town\u2019s largest, were quickly abandoned in 2012.In Mandalay, where a curfew was imposed after the July riots, the locally owned Golden Myanmar Airlines said evening flights, which often departed around the curfew time of 9 p.m., were only 30 percent full before the curfew was lifted in August. That has begun to improve, but only slightly, airline officials said.\u201cImmediately after the riots, we had some full flights because people were all trying to leave town,\u201d said Hlene Zar, the Golden Myanmar Airlines branch manager. \u201cThen came the curfew, and we had a hard time getting customers for the evening flights, because people were too scared to break the curfew.\u201dOver the last three years, Myanmar has undergone an economic transformation. The government has awarded foreign companies landmark concessions of its untapped oil reserves and telecommunications spectrum, estimated to be worth billions of dollars.As a result, foreign direct investment has risen to $4.1 billion in the latest fiscal year, up from $1.4 billion the year before, according to the Myanmar Directorate of Investment and Company Administration. The International Monetary Fund has said Myanmar\u2019s economy is poised to grow 8.5 percent this year, a slight increase from 8.25 percent a year earlier.Although there has been no noticeable drop in foreign investment so far, continued sectarian violence throughout the country could change that, at a pivotal point in the country\u2019s development, experts say. Cyn-Young Park, an assistant chief economist at the Asian Development Bank, said religious tension was a \u201cgrave concern\u201d for parts of the economy.\u201cIn Myanmar, where there is large investment need, it affects foreign investor sentiment and can limit F.D.I.,\u201d Mr. Park said, referring to foreign direct investment. \u201cTourism can generate substantial economic gains for Myanmar, but international visitors are largely confined to the central parts of the country even now, due to security reasons.\u201dMyanmar\u2019s $926 million tourism sector is feeling the effects, but mainly in areas hit by violence, said Oliver Esser Soe Thet, the president of the Myanmar Chefs\u2019 Association and a hotelier. He added that the problem was especially prominent in Rakhine State.After as many as 6,000 tourists visited in 2011, the number traveling to the archaeologically significant town of Mrauk U, known for its historic Buddhist shrines, or stupas, has dwindled to hundreds, he said. When the riots started, the violence caused tourist numbers at Ngapali beach, considered one of most beautiful in the country, to fall to 14,000 \u2014 a drop of about 50 percent. The numbers have since rebounded and are on pace for about 20,000 this year.Underscoring the impact of the violence, Yangon, the country\u2019s main city, which has been largely unaffected by unrest, welcomed 817,000 tourists in 2013, a 46 percent increase from the year before.The government believes that continued violence could threaten the country as a whole, said the deputy information minister and presidential spokesman U Ye Htut. \u201cCommunal violence is a big challenge for Myanmar \u2014 not only for foreign investment \u2014 but also for the stability of the country and Myanmar society,\u201d he said by email.Muslims said they were uncertain whether the situation would improve soon.Standing behind the display case in her father\u2019s glasses store in Mandalay, a 43-year-old shopkeeper, who asked to be called by her nickname, Honey, for fear of retribution if the rioters returned, said that eventually things would have to get better.\u201cOne day, the people will understand each other and understand what it is to be Muslim,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia and his Ukrainian counterpart had agreed to the broad terms of a peace plan to stop the fighting in eastern Ukraine. The DAX index in Germany climbed 1.26 percent. The CAC-40 in France picked up 1 percent. Russia\u2019s benchmark MICEX soared 3.5 percent.Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari, said the reports of a cease-fire were \u201cwelcomed with open arms by the markets.\u201dThe hope, he said, must be that economic sanctions on Russia would soon be lifted, which could help the European economy reclaim lost ground.Among the stocks on the move, Delta Air Lines tumbled $2.11, or 5.16 percent, to $38.82, giving it the steepest drop in the S.&P. 500. The airline cut estimates for a measure of revenue, blaming \u201cevents in Russia, the Middle East and Africa,\u201d an apparent reference to fighting in eastern Ukraine, war in Syria and an Ebola outbreak in West Africa.In the bond market, interest rates eased.

Obama wasn\u2019t perfect, but at least he wasn\u2019t Bush.And with the Middle East, those defenders sometimes turn Bush\u2019s epic mistakes into Obama\u2019s hall pass. Perhaps he hasn\u2019t figured out what\u2019s right, but he isn\u2019t guilty of the original wrong, which is constantly being litigated anew, as if a fresh verdict on the events of 2003 could alter the challenges and stakes of 2014.On Tuesday there was another spasm of this. As Congress debated the escalation of airstrikes against Islamic extremists, Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, digressed to inveigh against \u201cthe wholly unnecessary Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq,\u201d a bell that was rung 11 1/2 years ago and can\u2019t be un-rung now.And to judge from my inbox lately and the chatter I overhear, what matters to many of Obama\u2019s most stalwart fans isn\u2019t whether he erred in the way he spoke of those extremists, turned his attention to them quickly enough or is now confronting them with the correct dose of belligerence: not too little, not too much.At least he\u2019s not Bush. He didn\u2019t hallucinate weapons of mass destruction, make a spurious case for war or condone torture. I hear so much about Bush\u2019s failings and Bush\u2019s sins that you\u2019d think he were still huddled over a desk in Washington rather than dabbing at a canvas in Texas.Enough. It\u2019s true that Obama hasn\u2019t replicated Bush\u2019s offenses, and it\u2019s consoling. But it isn\u2019t exactly reason for a parade, and it doesn\u2019t inoculate him. The culpability that lies elsewhere doesn\u2019t relieve the responsibilities that are now his.And not being as bad as someone else is hardly the same as being good. Obama can rise far above Bush and still fall short. The presidency isn\u2019t \u201cThe Voice\u201d (though it is a little like \u201cSurvivor\u201d). You\u2019re not judged only in relation to the other performers who\u2019ve been on stage. You\u2019re judged by how well you respond to the unique circumstances of your time and place \u2014 by your ability to clean up the mess, not whether you made it.This not-as-bad-as defense is a pointless partisan tic. We\u2019ve seen a lot of it over the course of this presidency and will no doubt see a lot of it during the next, be it Democratic or Republican.The I.R.S. scandal was not as bad as Watergate. (Nothing\u2019s ever as bad as Watergate, which serves a nifty historical function as the gold standard of executive malfeasance and mendacity.)The bungled rollout of Obamacare was not as bad as the botched response to Katrina.It\u2019s apples and hurricanes, but they\u2019re put in the same basket, in a manner that recalls a child trying to evade punishment by ratting out a sibling for something worse. Don\u2019t be mad, Mommy, about Operation Fast and Furious and all those guns that ended up with Mexican drug cartels. Ronnie traded arms for hostages as part of this whole Iran-contra affair!I sometimes like to imagine presidential campaigns waged along these lines and what the candidates\u2019 not-as-bad-as bumper stickers might say.\u201cFewer Lies Than Nixon.\u201d \u201cFewer Sweaters Than Carter.\u201d \u201cFewer Interns Than Clinton.\u201d \u201cBetter Speller Than Quayle.\u201dIt works in the other direction, too, and Obama has definitely suffered plenty of not-as-good-as slings. Former presidents are held up not merely as yardsticks; they\u2019re rulers used to rap the knuckles of the Oval Office\u2019s current inhabitant and beat him over the head.George Santayana\u00a0famously said that those who don\u2019t know history are destined to repeat it. But are those who fixate on it blind to how peculiar the present is, and to the fact that no degree of longing for a lost hero or blaming of a departed villain is going to change what lies ahead?If we\u2019re determined to glance back at a figure who flatters Obama, let\u2019s really have at it and look all the way to Warren Harding. Golf wasn\u2019t his only distraction. He also had a thing for poker. And when it came to seeming and feeling overwhelmed, the 29th president, an Ohio Republican, reputedly confessed to friends that he was lost in the job.By that measure Obama is a rock. But it doesn\u2019t make him a boulder.An earlier version of this column incorrectly attributed the dictum that those who don't know history are destined to repeat it. It is from George Santayana, not Edmund Burke.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Desperately Dry California Tries to Curb Private Drilling for Water", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRESNO, Calif. \u2014 The small prefab office of Arthur & Orum, a well-drilling outfit hidden in the almond trees and grapevines south of Fresno, has become a magnet for scores of California farmers in desperate need of water to sustain their crops. Looking at binders of dozens of orders for yet-to-be-drilled wells, Steve Arthur, a manager, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got more stacked up than we\u2019ll do before the end of the year.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s vicious, prolonged drought, which has radically curtailed most natural surface water supplies, is making farmers look deeper and deeper underground to slake their thirst. This means the drought is a short-term bonanza for firms like Arthur & Orum, which expects to gross as much as $3 million this year.But in a drought as long and severe as the current one, over-reliance on groundwater means that land sinks, old wells go dry, and saltwater invades coastal aquifers. Aquifers are natural savings accounts, a place to go when the streams run dry. Exhaust them, and the $45 billion annual agricultural economy will take a severe hit, while small towns run dry.Yet for a century, farmers believed that the law put control of groundwater in the hands of landowners, who could drill as many wells as deeply as they wanted, and court challenges were few. That just changed. The California Legislature, in its closing hours on Friday, passed new and sweeping groundwater controls. The measures do not eliminate private ownership, but they do establish a framework for managing withdrawals through local agencies.It all happened after many farmers slowly rethought their priorities, as they surveyed a landscape of over-pumping, dropping water levels and multimillion-dollar groundwater sales. Ceding some control of groundwater management to local water agencies, an idea long opposed, became palatable enough to win over a significant share of farmers. It helped that the controls were matched by the state\u2019s commitment to expanding existing water storage.But the new legal framework not only empowers local control of groundwater, it sets out another requirement: When localities fail to manage their aquifers sustainably, the state can step in. Water managers in 126 of more than 500 groundwater basins \u2014 the ones designated high or medium priority \u2014 must develop groundwater-management plans by 2020 or give way to the state.Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign the new measures, and California will become the last Southwestern state with to establish groundwater controls.Not everyone is pleased. \u201cI shudder to think that the state will enforce stringent water-removal limits,\u201d Marvin Meyers, an almond grower based in Firebaugh, on the west side of the state\u2019s Central Valley, said in an interview. \u201cFor the government to tell us how we do it is frightening.\u201dWater managers understand Mr. Meyers\u2019s fear, but for many it has been trumped by the risk of ignoring the excessive withdrawals. Water levels in dozens of wells are at historic lows, making Mr. Arthur\u2019s new wells more expensive. In an average year, 39 percent of the water consumed in California comes from the ground, according to a new state report. In areas with little surface water, like the central coast from Carmel to Santa Barbara, groundwater makes up 80 percent of supplies on average. But this year is hardly average. Now, in the third year of a drought, an estimated 60 percent of the water for agriculture comes from underground. The basin under Paso Robles, a wine-growing center, is strikingly low.And while most pumping is to fill taps or keep vines and almond trees alive, a few farmers pump to sell high-priced water to others. Not long ago, The Modesto Bee reported, farmers in Merced County made a $46 million, four-year deal to sell nearly 100,000 acre-feet \u2014 an acre-foot is enough to supply at least two houses for a year, or to cover an acre of land one foot deep \u2014 to buyers in the neighboring county. The deal was challenged and has been scaled back.Not just farmers, but cities like Fresno rely heavily on groundwater supplies. \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this properly, you\u2019re going to see local economies crash,\u201d said David Orth, the general manager of the Kings River Conservation District on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have people go out of business because of the lack of water. We\u2019re going to have an uncontrolled market adjustment.\u201dHe added, \u201cI\u2019ve had growers argue, \u2018We don\u2019t need no stinking groundwater legislation. If I need to pump deeper, I can pump deeper.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Tim Quinn, the executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, whose farmer-heavy association was riven with dissent when it supported groundwater controls earlier this year, said in an interview, \u201cThere\u2019s part of the groundwater legislation that\u2019s going to have us doing some very painful things locally.\u201d But, he added, \u201cGroundwater management is part of a good solution to a problem, a solution that doesn\u2019t involve a contraction of the economy.\u201dHe hopes that a new $7.5 billion water bond that voters will decide on in November will also be part of the solution. It provides $2.8 billion for new water-storage structures. And private parties like Mr. Meyers, as well as local water agencies, are investing millions of dollars to build their own underground water reservoirs. \u201cFarmers are very adaptive,\u201d said Craig McNamara, an almond farmer with land in Winters, who is president of the State Board of Food and Agriculture. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to be.\u201d Lester Snow, once head of the Water Resources Department, now executive director of the California Water Foundation, said, \u201cThe ability of people to keep drilling was the equivalent of deficit spending.\u201d With the law, he said, \u201cwe have to balance our groundwater basins and manage our groundwater sustainably.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Growth Is Sluggish, Raising Fear of Malaise", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMissing: nearly three million American workers.This isn\u2019t the latest dystopian science fiction story or the pitch for a Hollywood thriller. It is the economic trend that has alarmed experts and policy makers alike. A growing number of people \u2014 many in their prime working years \u2014 have simply given up on landing a job. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the overall unemployment rate dropped slightly to 6.1 percent in August. But that improvement was mostly a result of Americans dropping out of the labor force, not of their finding work.The situation helps explain why so many ordinary Americans remain doubtful about the recovery, now in its fifth year. Adding to the discontent, the pace of job creation in August also slowed. Employers added 142,000 workers to their payrolls, the smallest number so far this year; it was the first time since January that monthly job creation fell below the 200,000 level.It is tempting to discount weaker hiring in any single month, and August tends to be especially unpredictable. As millions of people take their summer breaks, a smaller proportion of Americans respond to government data collectors during the month, said Tara M. Sinclair, an economist at Indeed.com, one of the nation\u2019s largest sites for job postings.Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted that August payroll growth had been revised upward in 12 of the last 15 years by an average of 31,000. \u201cThe report was clearly disappointing and contrasts with the otherwise strong economic data we have seen recently,\u201d the bank said in a note to clients. \u201cWe advise not overreacting given the volatility of nonfarm payrolls and possibility of an upward revision.\u201dBut the fall in the labor participation rate cannot be dismissed as an aberration. The rate dropped to 62.8 percent last month, the lowest level since the late 1970s.Although the shrinking proportion of Americans in the work force is often attributed to the retirement of baby boomers, 25-to-54-year-old workers are quitting as well. Just over 81 percent of this group was in the work force last month, compared with 83.4 percent in early 2007, equivalent to the disappearance of nearly three million workers.\u201cThe structure of the U.S. economy has shifted,\u201d said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. \u201cSome of these people dropped out when the labor market was bad, and it\u2019s not clear how many will come back.\u201dFor most Americans who are employed, another challenge has been very slow wage growth since the recovery began five years ago. In August, average hourly earnings increased 0.2 percentage points, while the average workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours.At the Federal Reserve, policy makers have been watching for improvement in the level of unemployment, as well as the participation rate and wage growth, to gauge when to begin the process of gradually increasing short-term interest rates from near zero. While there have been several positive economic reports this week, the August jobs numbers are likely to take pressure off the Fed to move more quickly than expected on rates.Within the economics field and at the Fed there has been an intense debate over the drop in participation. Some point to cyclical factors like the aging population. Others give more weight to structural forces such as the replacement of jobs by new technologies and the loss of skills that make jobs impossible to find for the long-term unemployed.With the pickup elsewhere in the economy this year and booming sectors like technology and energy, the rising number of missing workers has also become a hot issue politically, with conservatives arguing that the expansion of disability benefits and Obamacare have meant that people who could be employed are opting not to work. Liberals blame fiscal austerity in Washington and a weak economy that has pushed college students into jobs formerly held by high school graduates, forcing the latter out of the labor market.While there are merits to the various arguments, they do not account for everything.For one, the retirement of baby boomers and other demographic trends cannot explain why workers between the ages of 25 and 54 are dropping out, says Lawrence F. Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard.The increase in Americans drawing disability benefits from Social Security \u2014 up two million since 2007 \u2014 has been cited as a major culprit in the disappearance of all those prime-age workers. But Mr. Katz says it accounts for only a small portion. The benefits rarely pay as much as full-time work, he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not living high on the hog with disability.\u201d Within the ranks of 25-to-54-year-olds, younger men in particular have given up and dropped out in large numbers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by Barclays. Participation for this group is down to 88.8 percent, from 93 percent before the recession in 2007. What is more, in a new development since the Great Recession, women between the ages of 45 and 54 have also begun to leave the labor force, reversing a decades-long pattern of increasing numbers entering the work force.\u201cIt really does look like there is still a lot of slack in the labor market,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cIf you are out of work, you are still at the end of the queue in getting hired.\u201dDrawing people back into the work force is not easy, says Robert A. Funk, chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, a major staffing company. Last month, for the first time since the recession, Mr. Funk\u2019s company reached out to 5,000 workers in its files who had looked for work in the past. Only 267 indicated they wanted to work again, and he was able to place just 70 people. \u201cA lot of people have lost hope because they don\u2019t think the jobs are available,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going back and trying to encourage people to take temporary positions, but some do prefer to stick with government benefits.\u201d Economists, along with politicians, have been hoping to see a significant rebound in the participation rate as unemployment drops and hiring picks up, but that progress has failed to materialize. Government statisticians also revised their estimates for hiring in June and July on Friday, subtracting 28,000 jobs. Although the slackening in job creation last month took place across the board, some sectors fared better than others. Services outperformed blue-collar sectors like manufacturing, mining, logging and construction. The health care sector was a standout, adding nearly 43,000 positions, a sign that President Obama\u2019s signature health care expansion may be fueling added demand from new patients.At the other end of the spectrum, the factory sector, which added more than 50,000 jobs from May to July, was unchanged in August. Retail employment shrank by 8,400 last month, after a jump of 85,000 jobs in the previous three months.The upper end of the white-collar world is increasingly pulling away from the rest of the labor market, says Michael Durney, chief executive of Dice Holdings, which operates Internet job boards. \u201cThere are skilled professionals and unskilled labor, and there is a dichotomy,\u201d he said.An article on Saturday about the August jobs report misstated, in some copies, the most recent month in which job creation fell below 200,000. It was January, not February. (The data for January was released in February.).Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Push to Keep Scotland in the Fold", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLASGOW \u2014 With nine days left before Scotland votes on whether to become independent, Britain\u2019s leaders went into overdrive on Tuesday with efforts to keep the country intact.Jolted by recent polls suggesting that the outcome is very much in doubt, Prime Minister David Cameron and his counterparts in the other main political parties announced that they would put aside their parliamentary duties on Wednesday and fly north to campaign against dismemberment of the 307-year-old union with England.They rushed ahead with a last-minute plan to grant Scotland more say over its own affairs if it votes to stay in the union. They flew Scottish flags on English buildings. And the head of the Bank of England warned Scots against thinking that they could count on retaining the pound sterling as their currency should they secede.But in Easterhouse, one of Glasgow\u2019s down-at-the-heels suburbs, neither promises of more autonomy nor pledges of English affection nor warnings of economic disruption seemed to be blunting momentum in favor of the pro-independence movement.Sitting in her car outside the Shandwick Square mall, Jane McGeachy, 54, said she would vote \u201cyes\u201d because she wants change. Though independence would be a huge decision for her, her children and grandchildren, she said, the only sleepless nights she has had came from \u201cthe thought that it would be a \u2018no\u2019 vote.\u201dOn Monday, Gordon Brown, the former prime minister and a Scot, promised a series of new political powers for Scotland if voters rejected independence, and all three main parties \u2014 the ruling Conservatives and Liberal Democrats and their Labour opponents \u2014 agreed Tuesday to put the legislation on a fast track. But Ms. McGeachy was unimpressed, saying, \u201cSo why did he not give us more power\u201d when he was prime minister?If the polls are correct, Ms. McGeachy is the sort of voter who is propelling Scotland toward a breach with the rest of Britain. Recent polls suggest that women, who were more cautious earlier in the campaign, are turning toward the \u201cyes\u201d camp, as are working-class voters, even though the Labour Party opposes independence.The Scottish National Party, which is campaigning in favor, seems to have struck a chord with voters in Easterhouse by calling for a more socially inclusive country that it says can be built only with the powers that independence would bring. Ms. McGeachy, a former care worker who is disabled by a spinal problem, said she was comfortably off because her husband owns an engineering business, but she remembers hard times when they were both on welfare and has friends who use food banks.Politicians of all political hues are unpopular here, and the British Parliament in Westminster is seen by many voters as remote and out of touch. The Conservative Party, which leads the current coalition government, has been little loved in Scotland for years, and now holds just one of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats in Parliament.\u201cThe Tories have created a society for the greedy people,\u201d Ms. McGeachy said.Though Easterhouse was once infamous for drug dealing, alcohol addiction and social deprivation, antipoverty activists say that much has improved in the last decade. Crumbling housing projects have been torn down and a big new shopping complex opened. But the British government gets little credit for that.People who are unemployed and living off government assistance seem to be hard for the \u201cno\u201d campaigners to sway, while the \u201cyes\u201d campaign says it is attracting many disillusioned people who normally do not vote at all.Stephen Armour, 44, said he has lived off welfare since he was attacked in the street 19 years ago and suffered serious head injuries that left him with epilepsy and a hearing disability. He said he supported independence partly out of despair with his current situation.His welfare payments amount to little more than \u00a3100 (about $160) a week, he said, and there is no prospect of a job in construction, the work he did before the attack. He said he had depression and found little to fill his days apart from trips to pick up medication. The \u201cno\u201d campaign\u2019s warnings that the Scottish economy would be hurt by independence have had little impact on Mr. Armour, who said that \u201cthings can\u2019t get any worse.\u201dMeanwhile, Alex Salmond, the leader of the \u201cyes\u201d campaign and Scotland\u2019s first minister, seems to have had success in persuading people here that Scotland\u2019s oil wealth could be deployed more equally across society, and that Scots could keep the pound as their currency even if they declared independence.The leaders of the three major parties in London have all rejected sharing the pound, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, said Tuesday said that maintaining a common currency after independence was \u201cincompatible with sovereignty.\u201d Mr. Salmond says they are bluffing and that if London refused to negotiate a currency union, Scotland would walk away from its share of the national debt. Mr. Armour argued \u2014 as Mr. Salmond does \u2014 that \u201cit\u2019s our pound, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sick of the English telling us what to do,\u201d Mr. Armour said, adding that if Mr. Cameron visited Easterhouse, \u201cI think someone would strangle him.\u201dThe positive language of the \u201cyes\u201d campaign, emphasizing freedom and opportunity and a once-in-a-lifetime chance for self-determination, is attractive to many who are still undecided. By contrast, the \u201cno\u201d campaign has struggled to shake off a reputation for negativity.Outside the Morrison\u2019s supermarket, Lorraine Ramsey, a store manager who lives in Cumbernauld north of Glasgow, rehearsed the arguments for and against independence, saying that she had not yet made up her mind. She acknowledged concerns about the economy, and that it was \u201ca huge decision, and not one to be taken lightly.\u201dBut as she waited to withdraw money from an automated teller machine, she also expressed another thought, one that may be stirring other Scots. \u201cWe are a strong nation, a passionate nation,\u201d she said. \u201cTo get our independence would give us pride in our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Some Chinese Tourists Visit New York but Sleep in New Jersey", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe day began early. By 7:30 a.m., the 56 tourists from China were standing in line in the parking lot of the hotel in which they had spent the night.They were eager to do the things first-time tourists do \u2014 sail past the Statue of Liberty, stand atop the Empire State Building and stroll through the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But first they had to get to the city.That meant climbing aboard a shiny tour bus and settling in for a 45-minute ride past roadside billboards and a state prison and through the Holland Tunnel.It is a scene that is repeated many times each morning in a stretch of New Jersey better known for oil refineries, swamps and traffic-choked highways than for providing beds for tourists from halfway around the world.But with the number of Chinese tourists to New York soaring, New Jersey has become an unlikely base camp for many of them, including this group, which had spent the night at the Wyndham Garden Newark Airport, a scant quarter-mile from one of the runways at Newark Liberty International Airport.Chinese sightseers are fueling a subculture of hotels that have cheap rooms and early-morning checkouts to give tour buses a chance to beat the traffic. Some New Jersey hotels, like the Wyndham Garden, have expanded their breakfast buffets to appeal to Chinese guests, serving such Chinese favorites as the rice porridge congee alongside American standards like waffles with maple syrup. The number of Chinese visitors to the city jumped 182 percent from 2010 to 2013, according to NYC & Company, the city\u2019s tourism marketing agency, and New York ranks second as a destination for Chinese travelers in the United States, after Los Angeles. How many Chinese stay in New Jersey is difficult to determine, but the tour company that sent the bus to the Wyndham Garden \u2014 one of many tour operators in the city that specialize in tours for Chinese people \u2014 dispatched 16 buses that picked up more than 600 Chinese tourists from several New Jersey hotels that day. The passengers ventured into the city as day-trippers, spending only a morning and an afternoon in Manhattan.Price is the big factor, industry analysts say. The average hotel room around the Newark airport was $116 a night last year, according to Mark VanStekelenberg, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting USA, which follows the hotel industry. The average in Manhattan was $294 a night, he said. But tour companies command discounts that can drive the cost lower.The result is that many New Jersey hotels are filling rooms, even if they do not offer the same amenities as the Waldorf-Astoria. \u201cPeople in New York and New Jersey think of Newark and New York as two different places,\u201d said Sean Hennessey, the chief executive of Lodging Advisors, a hotel industry consulting company. \u201cOutside this area, it\u2019s all New York.\u201dNew Jersey had benefited as the economy strengthened with the end of the recession and business travel to Manhattan rebounded, said Warren Marr, a managing director of the consulting firm PwC. \u201cWhen you get to where demand in Manhattan is really strong and rates in the hotels go up, you get this swoosh through the tunnels, and the hotels near Newark Airport fill in.\u201dChinese travelers are hardly alone in New Jersey \u2014 tourists and tour operators from other countries book thousands of rooms a year there, especially for groups that fly into Newark. But a surging middle class in China and relaxed visa restrictions have opened leisure travel abroad to a much larger share of the population. Still, Mr. Hennessey said, tourism from China \u201cremains significantly more cost-conscious than tourism from a lot of other countries.\u201d New York tourism officials, not surprisingly, are striving to draw visitors to hotels on the other side of the Hudson.China Southern Airlines, the country\u2019s largest passenger carrier, recently added another destination: John F. Kennedy International Airport. China Southern is scheduling four flights a week from its hub in Guangzhou, in southeastern China. (There are already more than 24 flights a week from China at Kennedy and 14 at Newark Liberty.) For tourism-dependent businesses like hotels, the appeal is straightforward. The average spending by travelers from China totaled about $7,427 a person last year, $941 more than in 2012, according to the Commerce Department. More than that, though, the Chinese market promises significant growth. Some projections put the increase in Chinese travelers to the United States at 35 percent a year. Tour operators who specialize in bookings for Chinese say there are two main areas where Chinese tour operators look for hotel rooms in New Jersey, one around the Newark airport, the other along the New Jersey Turnpike around the exits for North Brunswick and Edison. They appeal to tour wholesalers booking groups that have spent a day in places like Washington or Philadelphia and plan to spend the next day in Manhattan.For the Wyndham Garden, Chinese tourists provide \u201ca steady flow of regular business\u201d that cushions the ups and downs of the domestic market, said Don Sheneman, the general manager. Chinese guests, he said, represent 25 to 30 percent of check-ins, and one of the owners, Steven Wu, said the Chinese had pushed the hotel\u2019s occupancy rate as high as 85 or 90 percent.To accommodate more guests, the hotel recently converted 50 of its 349 rooms to what are called double doubles. The hotel took one king bed out of each of those rooms and installed two double beds, so that more travelers could double up.Even so, Michael Tchong, a tour operator who often books groups at the hotel, said New Jersey did not always have enough rooms to handle reservations for Chinese guests. \u201cThat\u2019s how many there are,\u201d he said. Mr. Tchong said that when Chinese visitors were told they would be staying in New Jersey, 30 minutes from New York City, some complained. \u201cThey say, \u2018We\u2019d rather be 15 minutes away, not 30,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cWe put them in Secaucus.\u201d (Secaucus is about six miles from the city.) Mr. Hennessey cited another advantage of hotels in New Jersey: Tour buses can return to the hotel during the day. \u201cWhen you stay in the city, you have to worry about where you park the bus,\u201d he said, while in New Jersey, \u201cthe bus can park over there.\u201dDavid Zhao, the tour guide on the bus from the Wyndham Garden, said the concept of staying in New Jersey on a trip to New York was hard for some Chinese to understand. \u201cIn China, hotels are usually all inside the city limits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the opposite of the situation here.\u201d He added, \u201cIn Chinese cities there are always hotels that are affordable.\u201dAs if to compound the confusion, some of the Chinese on Mr. Zhao\u2019s bus had arrived a day or two earlier and had stayed in hotels in the city.

{"Headline": "A Simple Equation: More Education = More Income", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneImagine if the United States government taxed the nation\u2019s one-percenters so that their post-tax share of the nation\u2019s income remained at 10 percent, roughly where it was in 1979. If the excess money were distributed equally among the rest of the population, in 2012 every family below that very top tier would have gotten a $7,105 check.This is hardly trivial money. But it pales compared to the gap between the wages of a family of two college graduates and a family of high school graduates. Between 1979 and 2012, that gap grew by some $30,000, after inflation.This clever calculation by Lawrence Katz, a labor economist from Harvard, amounts to a powerful counterargument to anybody who doubts the importance of education in the battle against the nation\u2019s entrenched inequality.Barely 30 percent of American adults have achieved a higher level of education than their parents did. Only Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic do worse. In Finland more than 50 percent of adults are more educated than their parents.And matters are getting worse, not better. Among 25- to 34-year olds, only 20 percent of men and 27 percent of women, both out of school, have achieved a higher level of education than their parents.It\u2019s even bleaker at the bottom: Only one in 20 Americans aged 25 to 34 whose parents didn\u2019t finish high school has a college degree. The average across 20 rich countries in the O.E.C.D. analysis is almost one in four.This pattern of stagnant mobility and rising inequality of education adds up to a dumbfounding paradox. American workers with a college degree are paid 74 percent more than those with only a high school degree, on average, nearly the biggest premium in the O.E.C.D.Given the payoff, the fact that many of those who would benefit most are not investing in a college education suggests an epic failure. And the growing cadre of countries that outperform the United States suggests failure is hardly inevitable.The greatest paradox is that the United States knows how to provide broad-based education to all. More than a century ago a consensus emerged that Americans needed at least a high school education to meet the growing demand for skilled workers. And the nation provided.Between 1900 and 1950, the high school enrollment of Americans aged 14 to 17 increased to 75 percent, from about 11 percent.To European nations happy educating their elites, that was not only unheard-of, it was downright stupid. By the mid-1950s, the full-time enrollment rate of American 15- to 19-year-olds in secondary school was more than double that of any European country.The momentum carried into college. In 1944, when Britain\u2019s government was signing the Education Act, guaranteeing British children a public education up to secondary school, most Americans already had that. In 1944 President Roosevelt was signing the G.I. Bill, which paid the tuition for any veterans attending college.\u201cHistorically, education in the United State was the great equalizer,\u201d conceded Andreas Schleicher, an education expert at the O.E.C.D. who heads its Program for International Student Assessment.Something slipped over the last generation, however. In the 1970s, graduation rates from four-year colleges slowed sharply and even went into reverse for men.And the world caught up. For those Americans between 55 to 64, 42 percent have a college degree, a rate surpassed only by Canada and Israel in the O.E.C.D. But among people aged 25 to 34, the United States is in 11th place, with a college graduation rate only slightly greater, at 44 percent.\u201cWe were the first out of the gate with high school, with coed education, with early access to college,\u201d noted Professor Katz. \u201cSomething went wrong.\u201dToday, the demand for more highly educated workers remains intense. Globalization and fast-paced technical change have wiped out many of the manufacturing jobs with which a worker with only a high school degree could support a middle-class life.What explains America\u2019s educational stagnation? One cause is certainly the high cost of college, which \u2014 unlike high school costs \u2014 families must bear largely on their own and is higher than in any other advanced nation.\u201cIn the U.S., more so than in other countries, you as a family are making a larger and riskier investment in your own future,\u201d said David Deming, a professor at Harvard. \u201cCollege pays off on average but it has a ton of risk. Lower-income families can\u2019t buffer that shock.\u201dAnother factor is the inability of the educational system \u2014 whether because of poverty and segregation or to unfit and underpaid teachers \u2014 to prepare underprivileged Americans for college.Even the big high school push of the 20th century, decentralized as it was, left many out. Blacks and Hispanics lagged the educational attainment of whites. \u201cWe had a great system but we left pockets behind,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cThese have become more important.\u201dBut there is another critical factor that is more intangible, and that is a loss of faith in what might be called a national project.In the mid-1960s, government in the United States took about 25 percent of the economy in taxes, roughly the same as in the rest of the O.E.C.D. Today, the share in the rest of the O.E.C.D. has grown by 10 percentage points. In the United States it remains about the same.As the demand for pensions and health care from an aging population grew, limited budgets did not have the space to engage in a broad effort to fund higher education for all. The ethnic gap between shrinking populations of aging whites and growing populations of younger minorities with school-age children further weakened education\u2019s political base.In their book \u201cThe Race Between Education and Technology\u201d (Belknap Press, 2010), Mr. Katz and Claudia Goldin of Harvard suggest that in the early 20th-century. states with more elderly residents had higher graduation rates because they had more stable communities in which the old could understand the benefits of educating the young.Growing inequality of income could become the last nail in public education\u2019s coffin. It contributes to the residential segregation that cordons off rich school districts from the poor and reduces support for public education among the wealthy Americans who can opt out.Mr. Schleicher told me that, while places like Japan, Singapore and Canada have learned how to educate socially disadvantaged children, in the United States social background plays an outsize role in the educational outcomes.\u201cIt\u2019s harder and harder for education systems to counterbalance those tendencies,\u201d Mr. Schleicher told me. \u201cBut a lot depends on policy. There is a lot we can do.\u201dDecimating public education is not to anyone\u2019s advantage, though. If all America manages to do is provide sterling education for the elite, those Robin Hood arrangements of $7,105 per family will start looking like the better deal to everyone else.An earlier version of this column misstated the authors of research on the growing income gap in the graduation rate of teenagers. They are Martha J. Bailey and Susan M. Dynarski from the University of Michigan, not Richard Murnane from Harvard and Greg Duncan from the University of California, Irvine.The Economic Scene column on Thursday, about the correlation between higher levels of education and greater income, misidentified the party in power when Britain signed its Education Act in 1944. It was a unity government led by Winston Churchill, not a Labour Party government.Advertisement"}

Along class lines. About lesbian sex. Concerning the place of women.Waters\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe Paying Guests,\u201d provides her with a fresh patch of the past \u2014 the London of 1922, a city with quite a bit of the stuffing knocked out of it. In Frances Wray\u2019s family alone, two brothers have been lost in the recent war. Her father has also passed on, leaving behind a nasty stack of debts. Facing these reduced circumstances, Frances, at 26, has given up her girlfriend in the heart of the city, as well as her plans to throw herself into the 1920s that are roaring by without her in London. Instead she finds herself duty-bound to remain in the suburbs, keeping house and cooking for her mother, tasks previously performed by servants. A shared conceit is that, at 55, Mrs. Wray is unable to lift a dust cloth herself. Or boil an egg. Frances imagines her mother\u2019s stunned behavior in the kitchen, where \u201cshe might have been a passenger on a stricken liner who\u2019d just been bundled into the engine room and told to man the gauges.\u201d Considerately, Frances saves the heavier work for times when Mrs. Wray is out of the house and won\u2019t have to witness her daughter\u2019s struggles.This housekeeping is a grim, relentless business. Lunch might be a \u201ccauliflower cheese\u201d and dinner some skirt of beef beaten tender with a rolling pin, then the next day pulled out of the meat safe (whatever that is, it can\u2019t be good) for leftovers and run through a mincer. Wallpaper has to be varnished (don\u2019t ask me why). Skirting boards need daily dusting. An outhouse is also part of this frugal domestic picture. As is reading by a window on the west side of the house to use up the last bit of daylight before turning on a lamp.But these economies haven\u2019t been enough. And so the Wrays have made a separate apartment upstairs to rent to \u201cpaying guests.\u201d The lodgers who turn up are Leonard and Lilian Barber. Like Frances, they are in their 20s, but from a lower social rung. Len clerks at an insurance firm in the city. Lilian stays home, lounging about and making herself attractive in a tarty way. She dresses in a panorama of whimsical clothing \u2014 Japanese wrappers and Turkish slippers \u2014 and decorates their rooms by \u201cadding lengths of beading and swaths of macram\u00e9 and lace to picture rails and mantelpieces, arranging ostrich feathers in jars.\u201d In her spare time, she reads \u201cAnna Karenina\u201d and smokes. She has a tambourine.As she and Frances pass, time and again, on the landing \u2014 one bored, the other oppressed \u2014 the air begins to thicken with possibility. Soon enough they\u2019re picnicking in the park, then kissing in the hall, then pressing each other against the scullery tub in the middle of the night, hitching up nightgowns. Waters\u2019s sex scenes are meticulously detailed, a practice that seems, regrettably, to have gone slightly by the wayside in literary fiction. The erotic passages in this novel offer an argument for reviving the art.The affair steams along. The lovers play out a fantasy-based romance. But then reality arrives, as it will, with its dampening effect. Lilian turns out to be pregnant, with no interest in a baby she would then have to care for. She is no stranger to this predicament, though, and confidently sets off to a sketchy pharmacy to get some pills that will eliminate the problem. No muss, no fuss. What ensues, however, is grisly and in this matter, as well, Waters spares the reader none of the details. What was a bedroom when Len left for the office has become a field hospital by the time he returns. When he finds out why his wife looks like death, why no doctor has been called and why Frances is the sole member of Lilian\u2019s medical team, an unpleasant argument arises, one that winds up with Lilian seriously whacking him with a standing ashtray. When, the next morning, Len is found dead on a garden path, the police cast a wide net for suspects and witnesses, inevitably including Frances and Lilian. Events conspire to separate the lovers. Lilian goes back to live with her mother and sisters. After Len\u2019s funeral, Lilian, wedged in the back of a family car, \u201cput up a gloved hand to the glass, she might have been gazing hopelessly out at her, Frances thought, through flowing water; she might have been drowning.\u201d From there, the plot is constructed of not always probable nuts screwed onto not terribly likely bolts \u2014 an investigation, an arrest, a trial, a verdict \u2014 with new developments at every turn. But we\u2019ve seen this movie before. Much more interesting are Frances\u2019 emotions \u2014 raised like the hair on one\u2019s arm in a cold room \u2014 as she moves from a life of no interest at all to one with way too much.Although Waters is definitely up to constructing a big, entertaining story, her strength seems to be in blueprinting social architecture in terms of its tiniest corners and angles, matters measurable by inches rather than feet \u2014 small moments we recognize but have never articulated, even to ourselves. One such arrives when the Barbers are moving in, with a borrowed van and a helpful friend, and Frances comes through the front garden: \u201cThe Barbers turned, and greeted her through the tail of their laughter \u2014 so that the laughter, not very comfortably, somehow attached itself to her.\u201dThe story is laid out along serious lines \u2014 postwar hard times, forbidden love, murder, justice \u2014 but it is equally a comic novel. The ridiculous martyrdom of Frances\u2019 chores. The tackiness of Lilian\u2019s wardrobe and d\u00e9cor. The mesmerizing ghastliness of her relatives. From Lilian\u2019s mother, Frances hears \u201cstories of other family catastrophes. Hard confinements there\u2019d been plenty of, sudden deaths, maulings, scaldings. A Midlands cousin had got her scalp torn off by a loom.\u201d Perhaps Waters\u2019s most impressive accomplishment is the authentic feel she achieves, that the telling \u2014 whether in its serious, exciting, comic or sexy passages \u2014 has no modern tinge. Not just that no one heats up the cauliflower cheese in a microwave or sends a text message, but that the story appears not merely to be about the novel\u2019s time but to have been written by someone living in that time, thumping out the whole thing on a manual typewriter.

{"Headline": "Reasons to Welcome a Ukraine Deal", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 The war in Ukraine, which has had more impact on the European economy than any news from Frankfurt or Brussels, appears to be ending, despite the sporadic attacks that have wrecked previous cease-fire attempts. Investors have mostly assumed that the cease-fire would not hold \u2014 either because President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is deceitful and greedy for more territorial conquest, or because the Ukraine president, Petro O. Poroshenko, would not accept the splintering of his country that Russia demands. But this fashionable pessimism is probably wrong. The cease-fire no longer relies on good faith or benevolence, but on a convergence of interests: Mr. Putin has now achieved all his key objectives and Mr. Poroshenko has recognized that trying to reverse the Russian gains by military means would be national suicide.Admittedly, there is still a \u201cparty of war\u201d in Kiev, seemingly led by Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who has called on NATO to back his country in an all-out war with Russia. But this week\u2019s vote in the Ukrainian Parliament on temporary autonomy for the rebel regions suggests that most politicians have abandoned hope of winning a war with Russia and understood that Western military assistance is not coming. This may sound like a grimly defeatist analysis, but a modest victory for Russia was actually the least-bad outcome, given that there was never any chance that economic sanctions would stop Mr. Putin. There are several good reasons to welcome the incipient Ukraine deal. First, this compromise is infinitely better for Ukraine, as well as for Europe, than a protracted war. Although Mr. Poroshenko has been forced to make major concessions by offering partial autonomy to the Donbass rebels, this was always inevitable. Second, Mr. Putin shows no sign of wanting to extend Russia\u2019s boundaries after absorbing Crimea and destabilizing Donbass. Mr. Putin has proved that he will fight against any further encroachment onto Russia\u2019s boundaries by the European Union and NATO, which he now views as an expansionist empire. But this does not mean that he hopes to restore Russian control over countries already absorbed by Europe and NATO, like Poland or Lithuania. Whatever Mr. Putin\u2019s personal ambitions, he clearly understands that Russia is too weak economically to compete directly against European and NATO \u201cimperialism.\u201d His record suggests a status quo leader trying to preserve existing spheres of influence. Third, the precedent of carving out parts of Ukraine is not necessarily catastrophic for the operation of international law in Europe. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea was not, as is often claimed, the first attempt since 1945 to move European borders by military force. Borders have been forcibly changed in the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Turkish invasion of Northern Cyprus and the \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan. Finally, what about the economic consequences for Russia and Ukraine? For Ukraine, which has the potential to challenge Poland as the dominant power in central Europe, and to overtake France as Europe\u2019s leading agricultural producer, the key question is how much help the European Union will actually provide by way of financial support and technical assistance. Whether Europe is genuinely willing to devote the huge resources in money, time and manpower necessary to reform Ukraine is much more important for the country\u2019s future than the precise terms of a Donbass autonomy deal. For Russia, the long-term effects of the Ukraine crisis are equally ambiguous. Russia is certainly suffering from the economic sanctions. In the long run, however, it could reap economic benefits from the sanctions, while its politics become even more authoritarian. Russia\u2019s economy is at present based on exporting energy to finance the importing of Western consumer and capital goods \u2014 a glaring example of the \u201cnatural resource curse\u201d described by textbooks of development economics. But textbooks often fail to mention that the resource curse is a logical consequence of the classical free-trade idea that every country should specialize in whatever it makes most efficiently and import other goods. A country that wants to become less dependent on exporting resources must, by definition, take steps to reduce its imports and support domestic production of the goods and services it wants to consume. While policies of self-reliance have sometimes proved disastrous, protection of domestic industries has been crucial for economic development in Japan, South Korea, China and Brazil, as well as the United States and Germany. Russia, in its development since 1992, has zealously applied the theory of comparative advantage. If sanctions push Russia onto a path of greater self-reliance, its manufacturing and service industries will surely grow faster, even if their quality falls further behind Western standards. If Mr. Putin wants to strengthen domestic industries he will have to improve business and strengthen the rule of law. In short, the Ukraine confrontation and subsequent sanctions could help to transform Russia into a poorer economy that is less flashy but better balanced and ultimately stronger. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Factories Slowing, Surveys Show", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Growth in China\u2019s vast factory sector slackened in August as foreign and domestic demand slowed, surveys showed Monday, stoking speculation that further stimulus measures would be needed to prevent the economy from stumbling.At the same time, surveys of purchasing managers across Asia told a tale of fewer new orders and faltering exports, but with brighter spots like India and Taiwan.The official purchasing managers index from China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics fell to 51.1 in August from a 27-month high of 51.7 in July, as factories continued a two-year trend of shedding jobs. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a figure of 51.2 for August. A level of 50 or higher indicates expansion in activity, while anything lower signals contraction.A breakdown of the official survey showed that output, employment, new orders, delivery time and raw material inventory all worsened, with the labor market showing the most weakness.More worrying was the manufacturing index for China released by HSBC and compiled by the research firm Markit, which includes more information on small and medium-size companies than the official index. The HSBC index, which also had a reading of 51.7 in July, retreated to 50.2 in August, roughly in line with a preliminary reading of 50.3.In the HSBC survey, demand appeared to have softened across the board. New orders and new export orders \u2014 proxies for domestic and foreign demand, respectively \u2014 fell to their lowest levels in recent months but managed remain above a reading of 50. The subindex for new orders was the worse performer, shedding two full points from July, to 51.3.Lackluster demand weighed on the labor market, which experienced an even sharper contraction in August than in previous months as companies fired workers or declined to fill job vacancies, the HSBC survey found. The broad cool-down in activity caused both production prices and final sales prices to fall, and a number of companies cut spending, on steel in particular.\u201cThe economy is healthier than it was in early 2014, but the recovery is tepid and patchy, with housing weakness a weighty anchor on both activity and confidence,\u201d said Huw McKay, a senior international economist at the Australian bank Westpac in Sydney. \u201cThe authorities would be wise to stay the course with easier policy settings, especially on the fiscal side.\u201dQu Hongbin, an economist at HSBC, agreed that China needed to stoke its economy: \u201cThe economy still faces considerable downside risks to growth in the second half of the year, which warrants further policy easing.\u201dThe Chinese economy has endured a rocky spell this year. Growth sank to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter before edging up to 7.5 percent in the second. Yet hopes that the mild rebound would gain traction were scuttled last month when growth in retail sales and investments in fixed assets slowed, while the level of money injected into the economy unexpectedly tumbled to a near six-year low.In April, worried that the economy was cooling too quickly, the Chinese authorities started some stimulus measures, which included accelerating certain construction projects, lowering the reserve requirement ratio for some banks \u2014 freeing up money for loans \u2014 and relaxing property controls to support the housing market.Just last week, the central bank said it was lowering the rates charged in lending for agriculture by one percentage point. The government in Hangzhou, one of the Chinese cities hardest hit by an oversupply of housing, said it would abolish all home purchase restrictions.The lull in Chinese demand is rippling across the region.South Korea reported on Monday that exports to China fell in August, compared with the same period a year earlier. It was the fourth consecutive month of decline and the longest contraction in two years. The trend is taking some of the shine off a continued recovery in shipments to the United States and the European Union.South Korean exports over all dipped 0.1 percent in the month, underscoring a tentative recovery and leaving the door open for another interest rate cut before year-end.\u201cToday\u2019s trade data should reinforce the government\u2019s cautious view on growth,\u201d said Raymond Yeung, senior economist at the Australian bank ANZ, adding that another rate cut by the central bank before year\u2019s end remained a distinct possibility.The HSBC manufacturing index for Indonesia, also compiled by Markit, showed that activity shrank in August for the first time in a year, weakened by declining new orders and production.In Japan, a flow of data has shown the economy still suffering the effects of a sales tax increase in April, yet there was modestly promising news on industrial activity for August. The factory index, released by JMMA, held up relatively well in August at 52.2, up from 50.5 in July.Also encouraging was activity in Taiwan, which continues to benefit from being a key cog in Apple\u2019s supply chain. Taiwan\u2019s manufacturers enjoyed the strongest expansion of new orders \u2014 many of which were destined for export \u2014 in more than three and a half years, lifting the P.M.I. to 56.1 in August.India was another standout, with a 10th straight month of expansion as its manufacturing index eased a touch to 52.4 in August. India reported last week that economic growth had quickened to 5.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with the same month a year earlier.\u201cOutput and new orders slowed slightly in August but remained robust relative to their 12-month history,\u201d said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, referring to India. \u201cThe mood remains positive too, with firms accumulating inventory in response to stronger demand.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Wise Delay on Warships", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialAfter resisting months of pressure from the United States and European allies to suspend an arms deal to sell sophisticated warships to Russia, France has finally taken a step in the right direction. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced on Wednesday that the conditions for delivering the first amphibious assault ship \u201chave so far not been met.\u201d This caution cloaks an important admission: France\u2019s continued commitment to helping Russia modernize its military at a time when Russian aggression in Ukraine poses a threat to Europe has simply become untenable. In the arms deal, made in 2011, the French agreed to build two Mistral-class assault ships in France and two more in Russia, along with important military technology transfers. Russia has already paid more than half of the $1.6 billion initial bill for two ships, with the first near completion. Four hundred Russian sailors arrived in June to train in the port city of Saint-Nazaire.If France cancels the deal, the potential economic pain could be severe. France would have to pay Russia back payments already made, plus penalties that could go up to $1.3 billion. Another issue is jobs. The contract guarantees employment for 1,000 shipbuilders in Saint-Nazaire for four years and employs thousands more in related industries at a time when France is facing record unemployment and grappling with a sluggish economy. For the moment, France has postponed delivery of the first ship until November, when it says it will look again at the situation. Workers in Saint-Nazaire have been assured their jobs are safe, and Russian sailors will continue training in France. Whether Russia agrees to a cease-fire in Ukraine, as is being discussed, France\u2019s credibility as a member of NATO and the European Union is on the line. Postponing delivery of the warship is the least the Hollande government can do for now.Advertisement"}

For one thing, both Britain and the United States offered themselves as guarantors of the transition agreement, although they now seem less interested in that responsibility. For another, Hong Kong had begun to establish itself as an economically vibrant society, which China hoped to replicate on the mainland.President Xi Jinping of China has established himself as an autocratic leader, so there is no telling how far he would go if the pro-democracy forces keep standing their ground. He has shown no mercy against Uighur separatists in Xinjiang, and he has made sure that government censors tightened controls on Instagram and other Internet programs in Hong Kong. It is hard not to fear a repeat of the bloody crackdown 25 years ago against protesters in Tiananmen Square that killed hundreds.Such an outcome would be devastating for the people of Hong Kong and would severely damage \u2014 if not obliterate \u2014 the political stability that multinational corporations have long relied on for doing business there. In fact, as tensions over the election issue increased in recent months, some risk-averse corporations in Hong Kong have moved their headquarters to Singapore. The crisis is also raising concerns in Taiwan, a self-governing island that the Chinese government insists is a province of China that must one day be reunited with the mainland.

{"Headline": "NATO Says Russia Pulled Some Troops From Ukraine ", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Russia has withdrawn a large number of troops from Ukraine, but maintains a significant force near the border that could quickly re-enter the country, NATO officials said Wednesday.The assessment signaled growing confidence that the conflict between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russia rebels in the east and the south could be easing, at least for now. Still, a renewed bout of fighting remained a possibility, and NATO was keeping up its enhanced presence at the eastern borders of the alliance.\u201cWe have seen a reduction in incidents and of Russian regular troops inside Ukraine,\u201d Carmen Romero, a NATO spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cBut some Russian special forces remain in Ukraine, plus there remains a substantial Russian military presence on the border.\u201cSo while we welcome all genuine efforts to achieve a peaceful solution, Russia is keeping the option to destabilize Ukraine,\u201d she said.The statement did not say when the withdrawals began, but a military official in Europe who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the intelligence said they started after the cease-fire took effect. They began slowly and by the end of last week the majority of Russian troops had been withdrawn, the official said.Exchanges of artillery fire and other hostilities between Ukrainian and separatist forces have also declined, according to a more detailed assessment from Lt. Col. Jay Janzen, the chief of media operations for the central command for NATO\u2019s military forces.Colonel Janzen said it was hard to determine how many Russian troops remained inside Ukraine, as the separatists controlled several border crossings and troops routinely moved back and forth. With the Russian economy already sputtering, in part from the effects of Western sanctions, Japan on Wednesday imposed limited new sanctions against Russia over the unrest in Ukraine, moving to stay in line with its Western allies even as it tries to keep alive a proposed summit meeting with Mr. Putin.The new sanctions include a tightening of restrictions on exports of Japanese weapons, a largely symbolic move since Japan sells few arms to Russia. Five Russian banks were also barred from selling new securities in Japan, said the top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Japan\u2019s move. Japan has been widely seen as moving more slowly and imposing more modest sanctions on Russia than the United States and other G-7 nations for fear of endangering talks that it is seeking with Russia on issues like energy cooperation and a long-festering territorial dispute.On Sunday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan spoke by telephone with Mr. Putin, according to Japanese news reports. During the call, Mr. Abe proposed holding a summit meeting in November on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\u2019s forum in Beijing, the reports said.Mr. Abe had invited the Russian president to come to Tokyo as early as this fall, a visit that looks increasing unlikely, as Japan has felt obligated to join in tightening sanctions. Before the Ukrainian crisis, Japanese officials spoke optimistically of seeking a breakthrough in a decades-old dispute over the control of islands that lie between Russia and the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Martin Fackler from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Climate Realities", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionCAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 ON Tuesday, world leaders will converge at United Nations headquarters in New York for a summit meeting on the climate that will set the stage for global negotiations next year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the threat of global climate change. The summit is titled \u201cCatalyzing Action,\u201d a decidedly hopeful characterization. I wish I were so hopeful.It is true that, in theory, we can avoid the worst consequences of climate change with an intensive global effort over the next several decades. But given real-world economic and, in particular, political realities, that seems unlikely. There are emerging hints of a positive path ahead, but first let\u2019s look at the sobering reality.The world is now on track to more than double current greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere by the end of the century. This would push up average global temperatures by three to eight degrees Celsius and could mean the disappearance of glaciers, droughts in the mid-to-low latitudes, decreased crop productivity, increased sea levels and flooding, vanishing islands and coastal wetlands, greater storm frequency and intensity, the risk of species extinction and a significant spread of infectious disease.The United Nations has set a goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by no more than two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. (The average global temperature has increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius since 1880, with two-thirds of the warming occurring since 1975.) Meeting this goal would require a worldwide reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40 to 70 percent by midcentury, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That\u2019s an immense challenge.The reality is that 300 years of economic growth in the industrialized countries have been fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels \u2014 coal, petroleum and natural gas. We still depend on these. And the large emerging economies of China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and South Africa are rapidly putting in place new infrastructure that is also dependent on burning fossil fuels.Two points are important to understand if we\u2019re going to be serious about attacking this problem. One, it will be costly. An economic assessment might be \u201cdifficult, but not impossible.\u201d And two, things become more challenging when we move from the economics to the politics.Doing what is necessary to achieve the United Nations\u2019 target for reducing emissions would reduce economic growth by about 0.06 percent annually from now through 2100, according to the I.P.C.C. That sounds trivial, but by the end of the century it means a 5 percent loss of worldwide economic activity per year.And this cost projection assumes optimal conditions \u2014 the immediate implementation of a common global price or tax on carbon dioxide emissions, a significant expansion of nuclear power and the advent and wide use of new, low-cost technologies to control emissions and provide cleaner sources of energy.If the new technologies we hope will be available aren\u2019t, like one that would enable the capture and storage of carbon emissions from power plants, the cost estimates more than double.Then there are the politics, which are driven by two fundamental facts.First, greenhouse gases mix globally in the atmosphere, and so damages are spread around the world, regardless of where the gases were emitted. Thus, any country taking action incurs the costs, but the benefits are distributed globally. This presents a classic free-rider problem: It is in the economic self-interest of virtually no country to take unilateral action, and each can reap the benefits of any countries that do act. This is why international cooperation is essential.Second, some of these heat-trapping gases \u2014 in particular, carbon dioxide \u2014 remain in the atmosphere for centuries, so even if we were to rapidly reduce emissions, the problem would not be solved immediately. Even the most aggressive efforts will take time to ramp up. These realities \u2014 the global nature and persistence of the problem \u2014 present fundamental geopolitical challenges. Reducing greenhouse gas pollution will require the unalloyed cooperation of at least the 15 countries and one region (the European Union) that together account for about 80 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. This will mean resolving deep divisions between industrialized nations and developing countries, which argue they should be able to build their economies, just as the West did, without having to reduce or slow the growth of their emissions. This dispute has prevented progress internationally.In the United States, the issue is mired in partisan politics, and the outlook is not promising for an effective national climate policy that would encourage carbon-friendly innovation and cost-effective emission reductions by putting a price on carbon emissions \u2014 either by taxing them or using a national cap-and-trade system that would make it more expensive to pollute. Rather than rewarding today\u2019s voters with benefits financed by future generations, as Congress typically does, solving the climate problem will require costly actions now to protect those who will follow us.Making matters more difficult, climate change is essentially unobservable by the public. On a daily basis, we observe the weather, not the climate. This makes it less likely that public opinion will force action the way it did 50 years ago when black smoke rose from industrial smokestacks, and chemicals and raw sewage were dumped untreated into rivers, famously causing one to catch fire. Similarly, in China, which leads the world in carbon emissions at 29 percent of the total, the prospect in the near term for a meaningful climate policy appears dim, because of the country\u2019s predominant focus on economic growth.China may achieve its goal of reducing the carbon intensity of its economy (the ratio of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of output) by 45 percent below its 2005 level by 2020. But the country is growing so fast that its coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are expected to continue to increase. China is expected to add the equivalent of a new 500-megawatt coal-fired electric plant every 10 days for the next decade, according to projections by the United States government.The dispute between the developing and developed world over carbon-emissions reductions has its roots in a series of international agreements in the 1990s, when the industrialized nations alone, but not the large emerging economies, agreed to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, since 1990, emissions have been flat or declining in the industrialized world, while increasing rapidly in the large, emerging economies, particularly China. In the face of current United Nations efforts to develop a promising new approach that would require emissions reductions by all nations, most countries in the developing world continue to insist that these reductions should be made only by industrialized countries.Despite these obstacles, a developing convergence of interests of the two key emitting countries \u2014 China and the United States \u2014 offers hope for progress.While America\u2019s annual emissions in 1990 were almost twice the level of Chinese emissions, by 2006 China had overtaken the United States. And China will surpass the United States as the top cumulative global emitter of carbon dioxide over the coming decades.The Chinese government is deeply concerned about worsening local air pollution, which contributed to an estimated 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010. Most actions to improve local air quality will also curb carbon dioxide emissions.Both countries are moving forward with regional, market-based programs to reduce emissions. China expects to link its local and regional cap-and-trade programs together in a nationwide system. In the United States, the failure in 2009 of a meaningful carbon-pricing policy in Congress led the Obama administration to turn to regulatory action, including its June announcement of carbon dioxide regulations for existing power plants, which are likely to be met in many states through cap-and-trade systems. The linkage of such systems both within countries and across international borders holds promise as an environmentally effective and cost-effective approach to reducing emissions in coming years.If the 20th century was the American Century, then leaders in China anticipate (or at least hope) that the 21st century will be the Chinese Century, one of global leadership, not obstruction.Of course, the political climate in the United States presents its own challenges. It will require immense effort \u2014 and profound good fortune \u2014 to find political openings that can resolve the debilitating partisan divide on climate change. But if destructive politics have been at the heart of the problem, the best hope may be that creative politics and leadership can help provide a solution. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rearranging Deck Chairs in France", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialLast week, France\u2019s executive duo \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Prime Minister Manuel Valls shuffled the French cabinet, getting rid of the economy minister, Arnaud Montebourg, after he publicly criticized the government\u2019s fealty to German-imposed austerity measures. Emmanuel Macron, a business-friendly former Rothschild banker and 36-year-old political prodigy, has been anointed his replacement.With this kerfuffle, the Socialist Party has been split into two factions \u2014 one supporting the bitter medicine of slashing government spending prescribed by the European Central Bank and Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Germany, and the other joining a growing chorus warning that austerity is precisely the wrong remedy for the euro zone\u2019s current economic malaise. Mr. Hollande has said that his government will not waver from the course he laid out in a speech on Dec. 31: a responsibility pact where business, in exchange for corporate tax cuts, promises to create jobs. But the pact won\u2019t take effect until 2015. Meanwhile, unemployment, which Mr. Hollande promised to bring down this year, has hit a high of 11 percent. French manufacturing has contracted for four consecutive months. Economic growth for 2014 has flatlined at nearly zero, forcing France to scrap deficit-reduction targets pledged to the European Union. On the domestic front, a Socialist government at odds with much of the party will have a harder time pushing through legislation on clean energy, terrorism and aging. While ridding the government of Mr. Montebourg\u2019s strident protectionism is not necessarily a bad idea, stubbornly hewing to the austerity line dictated by Berlin and the European Central Bank is likely to prove as disastrous for France as it is proving for Europe as a whole. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, may be ready to provide the monetary easing that France and other struggling European economies desperately need. Germany should not stand in his way. Meanwhile, Mr. Hollande should press the European Union to bring its collective resources to support a major stimulus plan to curb the threat of rising unemployment. Advertisement"}

This will be particularly true if it keeps using the pound as its currency. Scottish independence leaders say the country will continue using the British pound, even after independence. That would be a terrible idea. The euro crisis provides a vivid example of the dangers of a currency union that is not accompanied by a political union. The recessions suffered by countries like Greece, Ireland and Spain were particularly devastating because those countries did not have their own independent central banks that could lower interest rates, devalue their currencies, buy government bonds or provide loans to weakened banks when their economies went into recession. Worse, they were forced to enact counterproductive austerity policies by officials from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as a condition for loans to help them get through the financial crisis. Nationalist leaders who are campaigning for a yes vote in this week\u2019s referendum have promised to bolster the Scottish economy by increasing spending on early education programs, transportation, renewable energy and other things they say politicians in London have ignored.

Since the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, Moscow has routinely supported secessionists in bordering states, to coerce those states into accepting its dictates. Its latest such effort is unfolding in the South Caucasus.The latest violence preceded a summit meeting on Aug. 10 in Sochi, Russia, at which Mr. Putin sought an agreement on deploying additional Russian \u201cpeacekeepers\u201d between Armenia and Azerbaijan. On July 31, Armenians began a coordinated, surprise attack in three locations. Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham H. Aliyev, and defense minister were outside their country during the attack and Mr. Aliyev had not yet agreed to attend the summit meeting. But the Armenian president, Serzh A. Sargsyan, had agreed to; it\u2019s unlikely that his military would have initiated such a provocation without coordinating with Russia. (The meeting went on, without concrete results.)Renewed open warfare would give Russia an excuse to send in more troops, under the guise of peacekeeping. Destabilizing the South Caucasus could also derail a huge gas pipeline project, agreed to last December, that might lighten Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian fuel.Washington should put the blame on Russia and resist any so-called conflict resolution that leads to deployment of additional Russian troops in the region.Finally, the West needs a strategy to prevent Moscow from grabbing another bordering region. Nagorno-Karabakh, however remote, is the next front in Russia\u2019s efforts to rebuild its lost empire.

{"Headline": "Swiss Watchmakers Court China\u2019s Young and Trendy Buyers", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpecial Report: WatchesBASEL, Switzerland \u2014 In March this year, as the Baselworld luxury watch and jewelry fair opened at this city\u2019s sprawling convention center, the Digital Luxury Group, a Geneva-based market research firm that focuses on the watch industry, issued a media alert touting its collaboration with the prominent Chinese fashion blogger Peter Xu.Mr. Xu, 27, a former English tutor turned social media star, has more than 1.3 million followers on Sina Weibo, China\u2019s answer to Twitter. He is a frequent guest at the Milan and Paris couture shows. Yet prior to March, the watch world was, for him, uncharted territory.The Digital Luxury Group saw an opportunity. \u201cWe asked ourselves, \u2018Who are the trendsetters?\u201d\u2019 said David Sadigh, its founder and chief executive. \u201cOne of them is Peter Xu. He was talking a lot about fashion and not enough about watches, so we said we\u2019d bring him to Basel as our guest \u2014 to connect some of the novelties of our clients with an audience of highly influential Chinese.\u201dWhile Mr. Xu is among a new breed of gatekeeper in China \u2014 providing access to young, fashionable, digital-savvy consumers \u2014 the effort to endear Chinese taste makers to fine timepieces has been the defining narrative of the Swiss watch industry for the past 15 years. That is when China emerged as the only market capable of absorbing its ambitious production increases.\u201cWe saw little growth in Russia, not so much in the Middle East and very little in Latin America, which was supposed to be a big market,\u201d said Julien Schaerer, managing director of Antiquorum, a leading watch auction house. \u201cSo the growth of the watch market almost exclusively pooled into China.\u201dThat expansion has now slowed \u2014 to single-digit growth today from 20 percent to 30 percent annual increases at the height of the global economy in 2007 \u2014 and watchmakers are re-evaluating their China strategies. This is not the first time the Swiss have had to do some soul-searching over their relationship with buyers in the Far East. Chinese connoisseurship in the realm of timekeeping dates back centuries. Historians cite the elaborate water clocks of the 11th century Song Dynasty as examples of the Middle Kingdom\u2019s age-old fascination with horology. Besotted with automatons and enameled pocket watches from makers such as Jaquet Droz and Piguet & Meylan, the Chinese upper crust enjoyed a steady diet of Swiss-made specialties starting as early as the 16th century.In 1818, Edouard Bovet, a watchmaker from the Swiss village of Fleurier, led a bold incursion into the Chinese market when he arrived in Canton on a ship operated by the East India Company.\u201cHe sold watches directly to the Chinese, completely undercutting any agent system set up by other firms,\u201d said Michael Friedman, a historian with the Swiss brand Audemars Piguet. The appetite for rarefied timepieces among the Chinese elite remained robust until Mao Zedong\u2019s Cultural Revolution. But in the 1970s, when the avant-garde watchmaker Richard Mille made his first trip to China as part of a French delegation selling watches to government officials in Beijing, he found a market distinguished by its simplicity.\u201cThey were choosing one model for gents and one model for ladies \u2014 big units, very cheap,\u201d Mr. Mille said. \u201cIt was very basic. They had to wear watches to read the time.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until the early years of the new millennium that China, with its legions of newly minted millionaires, again began to show interest in the Swiss watch industry\u2019s most elaborate and expensive products.In 2000, Swiss watch exports to China amounted to 45 million Swiss francs, or $48 million, but China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization a year later kicked off a decade of what Jean-Daniel Pasche, president of the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, described as \u201cendless increases.\u201d By 2005, annual exports to China had grown to 351 million francs. By 2010, that figure jumped to 1.1 billion francs. That is not counting the impressive growth clocked by Hong Kong, an important shopping destination for mainland Chinese and the world\u2019s No. 1 market for Swiss timepieces since it overtook the United States in 2008.Intoxicated by the prospect of double-digit year-over-year increases, Swiss watchmakers found themselves engaged in a spirited battle to woo China\u2019s biggest spenders. From wristwatches featuring enameled dials painted with Chinese zodiac symbols, to complicated timepieces in limited editions of 88 \u2014 to signify the good fortune associated with the number eight in Chinese culture \u2014 a slew of products created specifically for consumers in the Far East seemed to reach a crescendo every January, when brands such as Cartier, Jaeger-LeCoultre and Vacheron Constantin presented their newest models in Geneva at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, a high-end trade fair. The Swiss, however, weren\u2019t satisfied with merely selling products to China. They dreamed of colonizing the country\u2019s retail scene as well. Virtually every major brand rushed into the country\u2019s two most obvious retail centers, Beijing and Shanghai, to break ground on extravagant boutiques. Those with an early-mover advantage on the mainland, like Omega, which made a big push into the market in the 1990s, quickly expanded to the country\u2019s second- and third-tier cities, too. \u201cNortheast of Beijing was where the brand really started to thrive: Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan,\u201d said Stephen Urquhart, president of Omega, which further bolstered its position when it served as the official timekeeper of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s not a federalized country; it\u2019s got a central government. But in terms of business and distribution of wealth, it\u2019s like the U.S. \u2014 there are pockets everywhere.\u201dIn the heady years at the dawn of the new millennium, tapping into those seemingly bottomless pockets of wealth was not exactly difficult. \u201cThings evolved very rapidly,\u201d said Stephen Forsey, whose Greubel Forsey brand opened the Time Art Gallery in Shanghai in 2011 to appeal to collectors of high-end timepieces and modern art. \u201cPeople who we met who were in a price bracket that\u2019s quite high, up to $20,000 \u2014 those people in one year moved more to $50,000 and the next year to $100,000.\u201dWhen President Xi Jinping took office last year, that began to change. His much-publicized campaign against corruption hit many Swiss watch brands hard \u2014 particularly those that had placed all their eggs in the China basket and were already feeling the pinch of the country\u2019s economic slowdown. Swiss watchmakers saw their exports to China fall in 2012, and again in 2013.So far, 2014 figures appear to be steadier, but Mr. Pasche of the industry federation remains cautious. \u201cJuly was a positive month for exports to China, but we have to see if this evolution is concrete or not,\u201d he said in a recent interview. The Swiss predilection for discretion means that few watchmakers are willing to say if they\u2019re hurting. In fact, many prefer to minimize the effects of the slowdown.\u201cIt\u2019s all relative,\u201d said Omega\u2019s Mr. Urquhart. \u201cChina\u2019s such a big market, obviously. If we sell one watch less, it\u2019s not going to affect the market overall.\u201dMeanwhile, industry observers note that, slowdown or no, China still represents a sizable chunk of business. \u201cThe China market is extremely strong, but maybe the buyer is not as outlandish as they were a couple years ago,\u201d said Anish Bhatt, founder of Watch Anish, an Instagram feed that has amassed more than 700,000 followers since 2012 and five months ago spawned a China-specific feed, Watch Anish Asia. \u201cIt was only a matter of time before things leveled off.\u201d The most prevalent response to the China question, however, has been to shift attention to Chinese travelers, who, by all accounts, are still spending lavishly. According to the World Tourism Organization, Chinese travelers were the world\u2019s top spenders in 2013, with $129 billion in expenditures, a 26 percent increase over the prior year.\u201cThe Chinese luxury watch business is primarily a business operated outside China \u2014 in Macau or Hong Kong, or Switzerland, Paris, Italy, Germany and U.S., where you have the major flows of Chinese tourists,\u201d said Jean-Marc Pontrou\u00e9, chief executive of the Geneva watchmaker Roger Dubuis. \u201cThe luxury industry is faced with a new development \u2014 that it\u2019s selling more to tourists abroad than on the mainland.\u201dMr. Pontrou\u00e9 said he still considered brand boutiques in China an important tool \u2014 but more as after-sales centers than as direct revenue generators.The focus on boutiques extends well beyond China\u2019s borders. \u201cWe\u2019re opening a big store on Rodeo Drive,\u201d Philippe L\u00e9opold-Metzger, chief executive of Piaget, said of the 2,600-square-foot Piaget boutique scheduled to celebrate its grand opening in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Oct. 9. \u201cOpening stores at the right place and the right time, you kill two birds with one stone: the local population and the traveling mainland Chinese.\u201dTo people familiar with the inner workings of the Swiss watch business, there is some irony in that.What Chinese tourists may not know is that some of the \u201cSwiss\u201d timepieces they purchase abroad originate in China, where factories contracted by Swiss firms handle a portion of production. It\u2019s an open secret in the trade, widely known yet rarely discussed, because it undermines that most valuable marketing tool: the Made-in-Switzerland label.A new standard, however, is poised to bolster that mark. Under current laws, watches can be called Swiss-made if they meet just three conditions: the movement must be Swiss, and the watch must be assembled and controlled in Switzerland. Last year, the Swiss Parliament issued a new law tightening the rules by requiring that a minimum of 60 percent of production, by value, must be done in Switzerland to earn the Swiss-made label. The new law is expected to go into effect at the end of 2015. The changes are taking place against a backdrop of intense political and economic cooperation between Switzerland and China. Last year, the countries signed a free-trade agreement that went into effect on July 1. In addition to cutting or dismantling tariffs \u201con the vast majority of bilateral trade,\u201d according to Switzerland\u2019s economic office, the agreement \u2014 which several watchmakers, including Hublot and F.P. Journe, have celebrated with limited-edition timepieces \u2014 includes a chapter on intellectual property, a nod to the ongoing problem of counterfeiting.\u201cIt\u2019s quite difficult to give a figure because counterfeiters work in the dark, but we think, based on statistics, that the loss is about 1 billion Swiss francs per year,\u201d said Yves Bugmann, head of the legal division at the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. \u201cAlmost all of them are made in China. The phenomenon is too big to eradicate.\u201dYet, despite the tide of Swiss fakes emanating from China, counterfeiting is not the industry\u2019s biggest worry. Rather, the dip in exports to China has brought into plain view a more fundamental, even existential, problem: How does an industry addicted to growth adjust to a more constrained global reality?\u201cSwitzerland for the past 30 years has been able to find new markets where they can really thrive,\u201d said Pierre Halimi Lacharlotte, general manager of F.P. Journe. \u201cFirst was the Middle East, then Russia and Ukraine,\u201d he said, \u201cand then China. The problem with Switzerland: When you have shareholders, investors want dividends. They\u2019re not always looking at the long-term picture.\u201d One solution may lie in shifting the industry\u2019s focus away from high-priced mechanical wonders to more attainable fashion watches, a market sector that Mr. Xu, the Shanghai-based blogger, both represents and promotes. \u201cTraditionally speaking, my parents\u2019 generation \u2014 they still like safe watches, the classic watches that have a heritage,\u201d Mr. Xu said on the video. \u201cBut I believe that in 10 to 20 years when I\u2019ve reached my 40s or 50s, it\u2019s definitely going to be more fashion-driven and design-oriented.\u201dslide showAdvertisement"}

Scotland was still a sovereign nation.Although generations of intermarriage may have watered down our Scottish blood, we still proudly bear a name that\u2019s about as common in Scotland as Smith is in America. I never saw my father in a kilt, but he had Stewart tartan ties, shirts and trousers, and the Stewart family crest hung on our wall.So I\u2019ve had more than a passing interest in the issue of Scottish independence, which will be resolved next week with the independence referendum in Scotland. After more than 300 years of being treated like a poor relation by the English, why shouldn\u2019t Scotland take its rightful place in the pantheon of sovereign nations?But the cause of Scottish nationalism seemed a lot more romantic and safer a few weeks ago, when polls suggested that it was doomed, like Mel Gibson\u2019s valiant but futile quest for Scottish independence in \u201cBraveheart.\u201d This week, the polls shifted, the pro-independence faction surged, and suddenly, this all seems more serious. The pound wavered, the FTSE 100 index dropped and some major corporations based there, even the Royal Bank of Scotland, talked about moving their legal headquarters to England.\u201cThis started as a private effort to educate me and my family,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cThis decision is too important to leave to the politicians.\u201d So he went to an array of experts and asked them to address 16 questions, starting with what effect independence would have on the economy. He said he didn\u2019t want to rely on people with personal stakes in the outcome or who had already chosen sides.\u201cThe answers started coming in,\u201d he said, \u201cand I thought, why not make this available to everyone? I\u2019m not trying to influence people. I\u2019m trying to educate them. Some voters are very emotional. Everyone is different, and that\u2019s democracy. But I\u2019m a businessman. I\u2019m passionate, but I\u2019m trying to look at the facts.\u201dMr. Hunter has the wherewithal for such a project because of the fortune he built in athletic footwear, a business he started when he was 23. His father was a grocer in a Scottish village of fewer than 5,000 people. He later sold his company, Sports Division, to the British retailer JJB Sports. \u201cI started out selling shoes from the back of a van,\u201d he said. \u201cFourteen years later, I got a check for 250 million pounds. I was only 37.\u201dMr. Hunter said he\u2019d always been fascinated and inspired by the example of Andrew Carnegie, who emigrated from Scotland to America in 1848, arriving penniless. He built what became the Carnegie Steel Corporation, which he sold to JPMorgan in 1901 for $480 million \u2014 many billions in today\u2019s dollars. He spent the rest of his life giving away his fortune, notably to finance the many Carnegie libraries across the United States and, of course, Carnegie Hall, but also to support higher education in Scotland, where he maintained a castle.Mr. Hunter said he read everything by Mr. Carnegie, including his famous call to philanthropy, \u201cThe Gospel of Wealth.\u201d One day, Mr. Hunter showed up at the offices of the Carnegie Corporation in New York, the foundation that Mr. Carnegie said he founded to \u201cpromote the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding,\u201d and asked to see its president, Vartan Gregorian. When asked if he had an appointment, Mr. Hunter said, \u201cNo, but I have the time to wait.\u201dMr. Gregorian saw him. \u201cI want to follow in the footsteps of Andrew Carnegie,\u201d Mr. Hunter said, according to Mr. Gregorian, \u201cand I want you to educate me.\u201d Mr. Gregorian quoted Mr. Carnegie to the effect of \u201cthe man who dies rich dies disgraced\u201d and \u201caristocracy is like potatoes \u2014 the best part is underground.\u201d Mr. Gregorian suggested some reading material and gave Mr. Hunter the names of other people to consult. \u201cI figured that was the last I\u2019d see of him,\u201d he recalled. But Mr. Hunter came back and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done everything you said. I\u2019ve started a foundation and I\u2019d like you to be on the board.\u201dThe two have remained close. Mr. Hunter suffered major financial reversals during the financial crisis, and lost a good part of his fortune. His foundation couldn\u2019t meet all of its charitable commitments. He suggested that Mr. Gregorian resign from his foundation, saying he didn\u2019t want to be the cause of embarrassment. Mr. Gregorian said he declined. \u201cYou\u2019re my friend,\u201d he told Mr. Hunter, \u201cand I didn\u2019t join the board because of your money. I told him he could fire me, but I wouldn\u2019t resign.\u201dSince then, Mr. Hunter\u2019s fortunes have rebounded. His foundation has fulfilled all its commitments and entered into new ones, and Mr. Hunter said it had now given away about \u00a355 million, or $89 million. He runs West Coast Capital, a private equity firm in Scotland that helps fund the foundation. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much I want to do,\u201d he said. And, echoing Mr. Carnegie, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up the richest man in the graveyard.\u201dIn contrast with many wealthy Americans, who have spent millions to pursue partisan agendas, Mr. Hunter is avowedly apolitical. Mr. Gregorian said Mr. Hunter was especially proud of the Scottish enlightenment, the period in the 18th century in which Scotland produced the writings of Adam Smith, David Hume and Robert Burns, among others, and which profoundly influenced the rest of Europe and North America.\u201cHe has no political agenda. He wants to educate people,\u201d Mr. Gregorian said. \u201cI told him, \u2018God gave us two ears, two eyes and one tongue.\u2019 He wants people to listen and think before they talk.\u201dMr. Hunter has already cast his vote by mail, but won\u2019t say what it is. His book, \u201cScotland\u2019s Decision,\u201d is painstakingly evenhanded, but after reading the book, I have a pretty good idea how he voted.On the question of whether independence would be good for Scottish businesses, Brad MacKay, professor of strategic management at the University of Edinburgh Business School, concludes in his chapter, \u201cA large majority of business leaders indicate that the costs and risks of independence to business outweigh the perceived benefits and opportunities that might occur.\u201dOn the question of the outlook for an independent Scotland\u2019s economy, David Bell, a professor of economics at the University of Stirling, writes that it is not clear. There are few historical precedents, and they bear little resemblance to Scotland. But he casts doubt on the popular notion that an independent Scotland would be another Norway or Denmark, with abundant social benefits and much less income inequality, goals that many Scots say they support.Professor Bell notes that the Nordic countries\u2019 levels of income equality have less to do with government policy than the fact that their pretax incomes are more equal. And in recent years, the Nordic countries have been buffeted by the same forces that have caused income gaps to widen in most countries, and inequality there has increased faster than in Britain. Professor Bell suggests that one way independence may benefit Scotland is if it manages to unleash \u201canimal spirits,\u201d quoting the economist John Maynard Keynes (an Englishman).But it\u2019s not clear why independence would be the catalyst. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to encourage a more entrepreneurial spirit here for more than 20 years,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re a bit behind.\u201dEven if independent, Scotland wants to keep the monarchy (which seems possible) and the pound (which is unlikely), according to the book\u2019s experts. So why not just stay in the union? After reading Mr. Hunter\u2019s book, I don\u2019t see why the Scots can\u2019t have the best of both worlds \u2014 the benefits of union with a high degree of autonomy.Whatever the outcome, \u201cthis has captured the voters\u2019 imaginations and has caused people to debate the big issues,\u201d Mr. Hunter said. \u201cThat\u2019s very positive.\u201d But next week, \u201cone side will lose,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people will be jubilant, and others dejected. We\u2019ll just have to get on with it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Forecasts: Hopes and Fears About Climate Change", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNature in the BalanceTwo dozen scientists, authors, and world and national figures answered two questions: What is your greatest worry about climate change? What gives you hope? Here are some of their answers, condensed for space.I worry about oceans becoming more corrosive, decimating both fisheries and coral reefs. Oceans have already become 30 percent more acidic since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution; if business-as-usual carbon emissions continue, oceans are likely to be 150 percent more acidic by the end of this century. Yikes!I take heart in knowing that social change can happen very rapidly once a tipping point is reached, that young people are bringing new passion and creativity to the issue, and that climate change is being seen increasingly as the moral issue it is.The worst possible aspect of climate change is that it will be irreversible and irrevocable. Therefore, there is the urgency to do whatever we can to protect the environment while we can.When I was young, even I did not really think about the environment, nor did I hear much about it from others. Today, more and more people are trying to take action. We are beginning to look at this planet as our only home, and I am hopeful that this will lead to the generation of a genuine sense of universal responsibility. We can do this.Something like 90 percent of the world\u2019s cities are on coasts, and in most places, the most vulnerable people in those cities will feel the worst impacts. We have a responsibility to do something about that. We can\u2019t afford to sit back, cross our fingers and hope for the best.A tremendous amount of progress is being made by cities all around the world. Cities account for some 70 percent of the emissions that cause climate change, so together they can make a big difference. In New York City back in 2007, we set a goal of reducing our carbon footprint 30 percent by 2030, and we got to a 19 percent reduction in just six years.The oil industry has lobbied Washington to a state of paralysis, and as is so often true, greed is at the root of the crisis, with the politicians getting in line to feed at the oil trough. The climate deniers are not the real problem. Their transparent propaganda and misdirections are laughable; their scientific ignorance is impossible to miss. The real problem is the cowardice and greed of those who absolutely know better, both in government and industry.We are living in an age of technological breakthroughs that could transform the world economy to a low-carbon energy system by midcentury. Solar, wind, geothermal, carbon sequestration, safe nuclear energy, and energy efficiency are all part of the mix. The oil industry should cooperate, rather than faking it or dodging it as until now.My fear: Catastrophic extinction. We don\u2019t get to make natural laws. Natural law made us, and it ultimately will unmake us. What makes me very sad is that we\u2019re going to take so many species down with us.My hope: We in the United States finally seem to be coming to the table after decades of either denial or argument. It seems as if denial as a political strategy has run its course and that we are stepping up to our responsibilities. I hope that\u2019s true.Ideology and intuition sometimes appear to be trumping science. So people deny the evidence even as it increases. I fear that the pace at which the public understands that the climate is changing, and puts pressure on the political system, will be too slow.We are seeing that communicating scientific knowledge has had an effect, and that makes me happy! The deniers have less and less credibility as the public understands the scientific consensus more and more.I find that to worry about things is to invest emotional energy in ways that do not lead to change. Always better to do something about a problem than to worry about it.What I expect will happen in the coming decades is that beachfront real estate, some of the most expensive in the housing marketplace, will become overrun by storm surges with enough frequency that it will force the wealthiest class (who might have previously been in denial of the phenomenon) to recognize the problem and take action, actions they can take since they are typically captains of industry and are in power and in control.A huge challenge of climate change lies in the fact that for its solution, countries all over the world must collaborate in ways that are entirely unprecedented.Each nation-state has to be fully engaged and take decisive steps outside the conventional economic comfort zone. And that requires more statesmanship that is currently in evidence in any of those countries. The mythology of the market and economistic view of life has to be transcended so people understand that a decent and sustainable quality of life requires a very different philosophy than the one that governs contemporary societies.Here in California, we\u2019re leading the nation in the economic recovery and the creation of jobs, and we are pioneering climate change strategies across a broad front. We have a robust cap-and-trade system. We have a goal of one-third renewable energy in the electricity sector; we\u2019re already at 22 percent. We have the strictest building standards in the world. We have a goal of over a million electric vehicles; we\u2019ve got our first 100,000! We have a certain momentum in California. There are other states where this is also true.The reason it\u2019s a really dangerous situation is that the climate system does not respond quickly to the forces we apply to it. That means that we have not witnessed the impact of the gases we\u2019ve already added to the atmosphere. We\u2019re waiting for the public to see enough to demand effective government response.The public doesn\u2019t see that much yet, but there\u2019s more in the pipeline. We are pumping energy into the ocean at a rapid rate; that energy is accumulating, and its biggest impact is going to be on ice shelves. The sea level will go up many meters. That means all coastal cities will be doomed if we stay on fossil fuel business as usual.The upside is that the only policy that will work is making the price of fossil fuels match their cost. We have an organization determined to focus on exactly that issue: the Citizens Climate Lobby. It\u2019s growing rapidly. Things are changing. But not fast enough.What worries me most is the irrationality of certain interest groups preventing society from addressing the problem. Republicans in Congress are preventing action on an efficient solution such as a carbon tax.There is a solution at hand. It doesn\u2019t cost as much as the deniers claim. The Montreal Protocol [on ozone depletion] showed that you could solve such global problems. It would have been much more expensive not to solve it.For the last 10,000 years or so, the climate\u2019s been relatively stable. But if you start imagining a world with a constantly changing climate, one where, say, rainfall patterns shift dramatically every few decades, then you begin to realize how dependent we all are on that stability. And the world we\u2019re creating is that constantly changing one.So I worry about just about everything, starting with the basics. There are 7.2 billion people on the planet right now, and we all need to eat.Hopefulness or a lack of it is really not the issue here. We\u2019ve already caused a lot of damage; there\u2019s a lot of warming that\u2019s in effect baked into the system. We\u2019re capable of causing a great deal more damage, and we\u2019re also capable of limiting that damage. That\u2019s the choice at this point, and we need to face up to that.It bothers me that people think there\u2019s a big debate in science when there isn\u2019t. Being concerned about climate change is not some whim. When I go to the mall or to Walmart, people ask, \u201cDo you really believe in climate change?\u201d That\u2019s like asking, \u201cDo you believe in gravity?\u201d I mean, the science is clear.What gives me optimism is that many of the people who question the science are of an older generation. The kids get it. When I go to my children\u2019s Scout meetings or when I talk to students on campus, they get beyond the misinformation and politics.Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time because it impacts every single soul in the world. In the conservative Christian world in the United States, we\u2019ve gotten caught up in political partisanship. I\u2019d like to see climate change as a Christian issue and not a partisan issue.We are the stewards of God\u2019s creation. We believe that the earth\u2019s creation belongs to God and that we are charged to care for it.When we started this [network] five years ago, we had 15,000 people we regularly communicated with on this issue. Today it approaches 400,000. It means that we\u2019re starting to overcome the partisan divide and the tide is slowly turning.What keeps me up, the thing that really drives me nuts, is that the rate of change is so fast. I work in one of the most extreme ecosystems on Earth: the Antarctic Dry Valleys. It is the coldest, windiest, driest place on Earth. We\u2019re seeing warming events and very sunny events there, and this is causing a change in the organisms I study. These species have adapted to the conditions there. We don\u2019t know what the impact will be on them or us.My students give me hope.I have a lot more fears than hopes. One aspect that particularly troubles me is that economists tend to underprioritize efforts at mitigation of atmospheric carbon, because the really serious downside of inaction won\u2019t be experienced until the 22nd century and beyond. If action is delayed, it may then be too late to avoid irreversible runaway changes.We shouldn\u2019t discriminate against our fellow humans on grounds of date of birth. The lifetime welfare of the newborn should rate as highly as that of the already middle-aged. Indeed, many philosophers would assign equal value to the rights of those not yet born.For them, foreclosing the potentialities of all future generations would be so catastrophic that we should strive to reduce even the tiniest probability that this could happen.What keeps me up at night are people who talk in absolutes. It\u2019s the people who say \u201chumans cause it\u201d or \u201cpeople have no role in it,\u201d full stop. Science is not exact and the truth is in between. By taking the extreme position, they give an opening to the other side, and then people stop listening.What gives me hope is that there are signs that the American people are beginning to relate some of the frequent weather extremes to climate.Since 1980 our economy has grown, our population has grown and our energy use has grown, and yet our overall pollution has gone down. We are perfectly capable of implementing environmental regulation without stopping economic growth.Global warming is real and a problem, but we need better, more effective solutions. What troubles me most is that we keep focusing on making old-fashioned promises to cut CO2 [even though] these promises have failed to curb emissions rises for more than 20 years.Instead we pretend the solution is more heavily subsidized wind and solar. Right now, the world pays more than $60 billion a year in subsidies and gets less than 0.6 percent of energy from solar and wind. Even very optimistically, the International Energy Agency estimates we\u2019ll get just 3.5 percent by 2035, and they will still need subsidies of about $100 billion a year.More and more countries are realizing we need a smarter approach. The solution is not pushing currently inefficient green technology, but to innovate down the price of future green energy. It makes me hopeful that Japan has now committed more than 20 percent of what is needed to effectively make a long-term difference on climate.What troubles me as a scientist is the potential for vicious feedbacks within the climate system. The warming that we cause through all the carbon we produce could cause a series of cascading impacts that could lead to a much greater warming. The more carbon we produce, the higher the likelihood of these unpredictable risks.What makes me hopeful are people. I\u2019ve been working with cities, states and regional transportation councils, and none of them have to be convinced of the reality of this problem. I was sitting next to an assistant city manager for Dallas, a town not known for being green, and she blew me away with her list of amazing things Dallas has done to save energy. People are preparing for change.The most worrisome thing is the potential death of the ocean. If it dies, we die.What gives me hope is that more and more people are aware of the dangers we face, and many smart people are at work on solutions. Our smart brains got us into this. Let\u2019s see if they can get us out.What worries me is that many people, including scientists and politicians, believe a whole lot of dogmatic nonsense about climate change. The nonsense says that climate change is a terrible danger and that it is something we could do something about if we wanted to. The whole point is to scare people, and this has been done very successfully.Climate has always been changing, and climate has always been lousy. It has always been a background to existence that on the whole we\u2019ve learned to cope with pretty well. What I feel happy about is that there are a lot of ordinary people with common sense who don\u2019t believe the nonsense.When I go home and look at the deteriorating situation there \u2014 increased droughts, the ocean washing away the coast \u2014 I can\u2019t help but be fearful for what the future may hold for Nauru\u2019s children and grandchildren. How will they adapt? Will the international community be there for them? These are most distressing questions to which I don\u2019t yet have answers.Thinking about climate change used to give me images of the sun burning down and icebergs melting \u2014 horrific, but also impersonal and far away. Now I have intimate fears of storms and floods that drive us off this island of Manhattan, and fires that send thousands fleeing \u2014 in other words, just an acceleration of what we\u2019re already seeing.Like millions of others in public opinion polls, I\u2019m willing to lower my standard of living to help create a turning point. We\u2019re waiting for a practical, coordinated, understandable set of instructions that counters the Kochs, the deniers, the profiteers. Meanwhile, we try to do whatever we can.Somehow, I find comfort in the idea that the earth is a living organism with a will of its own. The global women\u2019s movement gives me hope because women are trying to take control of their own bodies and reproduction, which is even more basic than production. Everything we know says that when women can decide whether and when to have children, growth slows down to a little over replacement level. And that would be the single biggest long-term relief for the environment.I\u2019m a grandmother with five grandchildren. What will they say about what we did or didn\u2019t do?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Clinton\u2019s Record of Resilience at Vanguard of Presidential Politics", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Obscured in all the talk about Hillary Rodham Clinton and the 2016 race is a historical achievement unrelated to gender.Twenty-two years after he won the White House and six years after his wife\u2019s near miss for the Democratic nomination, former President Bill Clinton again stands in the thick of the competition for the nation\u2019s highest office.That makes Mr. Clinton, who addressed his first national convention at age 33 and on Friday became a grandfather at 68, the most durable high-stakes player ever in American presidential politics.It does not make him the most successful or influential president, and he tops no academic lists of the all-time greats. Unlike Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon, each of whom appeared on five national ballots, Mr. Clinton stood for election nationwide only twice.His stature on leaving office, in contrast to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s, proved insufficient to secure the election of his vice president to the White House. He never won a majority of the popular vote, as President Obama has done twice. And he is one of only two presidents impeached by the House of Representatives. (Andrew Johnson \u2014 who had been Lincoln\u2019s vice president, and never elected to the top job at all \u2014 was the other, more than century earlier.)Yet Mr. Clinton\u2019s Cal Ripken-like determination to keep showing up, and a White House record that glows brighter in memory, have sustained his appeal across a turn of centuries, three decades and multiple generations of swing voters. As he played host last week to the current president and perhaps the next one (his wife) at the Clinton Global Initiative, one historian likened him to a rare creature built for longevity at high altitudes.\u201cHe\u2019s been a snow leopard longer than any other president,\u201d the historian, Douglas Brinkley of Rice University, said. \u201cThere\u2019s been nobody like Bill Clinton who\u2019s played that long at the very top.\u201dBarring a constitutional amendment, Roosevelt will remain the only American to win the presidency more than twice. But he died in office 13 years after the first of his four victories in 1932.Mr. Nixon ran as Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s vice president in 1952, and 1956. He lost the White House to John F. Kennedy in 1960 before winning in 1968 and 1972 (and resigning in 1974). That run draws comparisons to Mr. Clinton\u2019s longevity.Mr. Clinton \u201cwouldn\u2019t like to hear this, but in a lot of ways he\u2019s like Nixon in that raw determination to keep moving forward,\u201d said Kenneth L. Khachigian, a former Nixon aide.Mrs. Clinton approaches her decision to run on firmer ground than any nonincumbent in years. As senator from New York and then secretary of state, she has built a substantial independent standing and appeal. But Mr. Clinton has profoundly shaped her ability, as well as that of any modern Democratic nominee, to compete.He modernized the aging Roosevelt coalition shattered by Mr. Reagan, showing Democrats how to win the White House after a 12-year drought. The economic growth he presided over has produced such nostalgia that Republicans now invoke him to disparage Mr. Obama.\u201cLike Reagan\u2019s, Clinton\u2019s historical significance, his consequence, has become more apparent with the passage of time,\u201d said Richard Norton Smith, founding director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.Presidents can influence contests for the White House in many ways after they have moved out of it. Mr. Smith, whose book \u201cAn Uncommon Man\u201d chronicled Herbert Hoover\u2019s post-presidency, notes that Democrats used Mr. Hoover for decades as a cudgel against Republicans. Yet during the 31 years he lived after returning to private life, Mr. Hoover headed two presidential commissions on the federal government, and the eponymous institution he founded at Stanford University influenced the resurgence of conservatism.On the other side, former President Jimmy Carter, who turns 90 on Wednesday, was a consistent Republican target after his 1980 loss to Mr. Reagan. Mr. Carter has now been an ex-president longer than any in history \u2014 surpassing Mr. Hoover\u2019s record \u2014 and he spent the decades focusing on human rights and the resolution of international conflicts. He won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.Former President George Bush was unpopular enough within the Republican Party when he left office that his own son President George W. Bush kept his political distance. The younger Mr. Bush, himself, has taken up painting.Mr. Clinton still savors life on the big stage and the nuts and bolts of politics. He has courted Reagan Democrats, soccer moms, baby boom yuppies, tech workers and millennials on his own behalf and for his wife.Mr. Brinkley credited it to \u201ca combination of ambition, will, narcissism and talent.\u201dPaul Begala, a former Clinton aide, cites the lip-biting empathy that Mr. Clinton displays, and that late-night comics once mocked, reasoning that Americans return the apparent concern and affection he has extended to them.The ex-president benefits, too, from simply having served during the first Silicon Valley boom. \u201cThose of us who aren\u2019t Clintonites credit most of it to the fact that a whole new source for our economy was created \u2014 and not by him,\u201d Mr. Khachigian said.Mr. Clinton himself has since grown wealthy. Yet even adversaries do not believe that is why he stays in the game.\u201cHe\u2019d probably give it all up,\u201d Mr. Khachigian said, \u201cif he could have a permanent microphone and an office in the West Wing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Kayden Kross, the Family Business Happens to Be Porn", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveI met Manuel seven years ago on the set of my first porn shoot. I was quiet and nervous and huddled away on a couch in a back room, burning through coffee and the W-9 tax packet I had been handed on my way in. Manuel sat next to me and introduced himself. He had a French accent and a thick mess of dark hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working together,\u201d he said, an innocuous comment under normal circumstances but a loaded one when the work is porn.I was a 21-year-old college student earning good money as a house dancer in a strip club in my hometown, Sacramento. At 19, I had earned my first associate degree and transferred to Sacramento State. What I wanted from a college education was stability and financial security, because during my childhood we had had neither.More than two decades earlier, my mother thought she had done everything right. She had enrolled in college and knocked out the general requirements while working an office job at a firm related to the career she intended to pursue. There she met my father \u2014 a handsome, well-educated finance guy with an aggressive style and big ambitions. They dated for a few years, married and about nine months later welcomed a child into the world: me. They decided that the rest of my mother\u2019s college funds would go toward a down payment on a house, and she would stay home with the baby. It was 1985.Five years later, I sat with my mother on her bed in a house we would soon lose while she read me a last bedtime story before her water broke and she carted us to the hospital for the birth of my sister. By then my father was gone for good, attending to another pregnancy he was responsible for, leaving my mother financially strapped with full-time responsibility for two young children. She never remarried.Growing up, I was constantly aware of my mother\u2019s penny-pinching anxiety: the quiet calculations as she added up the cost of our school supplies, the flashes of anger each time we outgrew clothes. She would sit my sister and me down and hammer home the importance of education, making us promise we would put a college degree ahead of everything. \u201cSecure your security,\u201d she would say.And that\u2019s what I intended to do. Then, a year into college, I began stripping. And the money I made allowed a radical change in my standard of living. In no time, I paid off my car loan. Next came savings, stocks and a mortgage. Meanwhile, I was closing in on a degree in a field that didn\u2019t interest me and one in which I wouldn\u2019t earn close to what I was already making. Throw in a suddenly tanking economy, and college began looking less like the ticket to financial security.When the housing market plunged, I felt trapped. I did, that is, until one slow Friday night at work when a man dropped $30 in my lap to hear him out. The next week I was on a plane for Los Angeles. Porn is a business of surprising contradictions. Many of the roles women play are submissive and subservient: We are the bored housewife, the penniless pizza customer (who must pay her bill in other ways) and the vulnerable secretary. But unlike in the real world, women in porn usually make more money than men for the same work, and with that can come a liberating power, both financially and sexually.In the years that followed my first shoot, I traveled the world \u2014 Europe, Africa, Australia and Asia. By the time I was 23, I had started my own lucrative online subscription club. I also negotiated deals for novelty sex toys and landed one of the highest-paying performing contracts in the industry, a five-year deal that increased in value each year and promised roles in the biggest features.Through it all, I avoided dating anyone seriously because I felt safe and free on my own, and because I\u2019d pledged I would never let a man compromise what I had worked so hard for. Then I found myself on set again with Manuel, for the first time since our last time, four years earlier. I had been too busy to notice that he\u2019d been avoiding me all those years because he had found me cold during our first encounter. And I was. Making porn can be exhilarating, friendly and hot, but those first shoots took courage, and my lack of experience showed in how distant I acted.Manuel greeted me with his customary politeness, which I would later learn was forced, right up until the director called for action and we kissed.O.K., so maybe a kiss is a strange way for two porn stars to fall in love, but for us it\u2019s true. I developed a maddening crush on him, and my affection seemed to be returned. But he was in a relationship, and I was still as career-minded as ever, so our attraction stayed confined to the porn set, once a month as part of my shooting schedule.Two years later, though, our attraction boiled over. Manuel was out of his relationship, and I was comfortably settled in my generous long-term contract, the kind almost nobody got anymore. One day he asked if we could see each other off set. I knew where this could lead and what I stood to lose. If I were to let a relationship derail my contract, I would never get it back. I said yes anyway.Navigating love when both of our jobs involve having sex with other people can be stressful, and this especially began to bother Manuel; he would get jealous and moody in the days before my shoots. He knew it wasn\u2019t fair to ask me to stop, but he couldn\u2019t hide the way he felt. Finally he said he wanted me to quit my contract and move in with him, with the logical next steps being marriage and children. I was 27.It felt like an impossible choice. When I imagined the vulnerability of being dependent on a man, coupled with the irreversible commitment of having a child, I waited for the panic to hit. My biggest fear was repeating the past: becoming a single mother, financially insolvent, halfway through a college degree and left to raise my future children alone. One day, a panic attack came on so strong that I had to drive myself to the hospital with numb hands and dimming vision. Nightmares and weight loss followed. Manuel tried to talk me down. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI want to marry you. I want to have a baby with you.\u201dAt some point, I just decided that nothing I secured on my own could compete with how solid I felt with Manuel, building a life together. Today, more than a year later, we have a child and are engaged. Our daughter\u2019s first tooth has just broken through the gum. Manuel looks at her in awe, then at me the same way, and says, \u201cThis is us!\u201d Although I gave up my lucrative contract, I continue to perform on occasion, though only with Manuel or with other women. I still make a good living in the business, along with my appearances and products. Yes, it\u2019s a double standard that Manuel gets to perform with other women while I don\u2019t with other men, just as it\u2019s a double standard that he still works full time while I have cut back. But I am the mother of an infant daughter, and caring for her is my priority right now, just as providing for us as best he can is Manuel\u2019s priority. In the end, our calculation isn\u2019t so different from the choice millions of other working couples face these days.What is different is that I happen to love a decent, charming man whose work involves having sex with other women. And one strange reality of our lives is I often help ready those women for the shoots. Makeup is done in our dining room, where I assist with wardrobe, props and scripts, and then Manuel carts the cast and crew to the day\u2019s location. Sometimes he performs with the women and sometimes he doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t ask.I\u2019m human, though, and I admit I size up the women in the makeup chair. Is she sexier than I am? Smarter? Better in bed? No woman can be everything. For example, she can\u2019t be the next woman. But here\u2019s the thing: If we lose our lover\u2019s attention to someone else, it doesn\u2019t matter if that erosion happens on a porn shoot, with a secretary at the office or between two academics attending a conference. My sizing up a woman will have zero effect on whether my relationship unravels when I\u2019m not looking. There is simply no way to know. The only safeguard, for any of us, is how we maintain our love along the way and the care we take in choosing a partner in the first place. EMAIL modernlove@nytimes.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Bank Takes Aggressive Steps", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank president, is reaching deep into his toolbox to revive the region\u2019s moribund economy. He is cutting interest rates to the bone. He is charging banks even more to park their money. And he is using the central bank\u2019s financial muscle to spur lending. But the question is whether the new actions, announced on Thursday, will be enough to fix Europe\u2019s problems. If they don\u2019t, Mr. Draghi doesn\u2019t have many options left. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive step by the E.C.B.,\u201d said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. But he added, \u201cno matter how you look at it, monetary policy has done all it can.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s aggressive moves reflect the gloomy, if familiar, state of the European economy. Low inflation and stagnant growth feed on each other in a vicious cycle, making existing debt burdens more onerous and making adjustments between the more prosperous Northern European nations and weaker southern ones more painful. The situation has confounded policy makers and politicians who are now grappling with how to prevent another full-on recession. To some extent, Mr. Draghi is drawing from a new playbook. Significantly, the central bank took the first steps toward large-scale asset purchases, a milder version of the so-called quantitative easing that the Federal Reserve has used in recent years to pump money into the United States economy. Starting next month, the E.C.B. will begin buying asset-backed securities: packages of home loans, business loans or even credit card debt, which banks bundle and sell to investors. For good measure, the central bank also cut interest rates again.The rate at which the E.C.B. issues short-term loans to banks fell to 0.05 percent from 0.15 percent. The central bank also increased the fee it imposes on banks to store money at the E.C.B., to 0.2 percent from 0.1 percent. That so-called negative deposit rate, first instituted in June, has already pushed some market interest rates below zero.The collective goal is to kick-start lending. In effect, the central bank will pump money into the financial system using the asset purchases, then charge banks if they park the money rather than put it to more productive use like loans to businesses or consumers.The moves appeased the market, at least at the outset. Stock and bond prices rose on Thursday. The euro fell sharply against the dollar, a boon for European exporters, since it makes their cars, wine and other goods cheaper abroad. And economists generally welcomed the moves as a sign that the central bank was pulling out all the stops to prevent the eurozone from slipping back into recession. But even Mr. Draghi conceded that the measures would be ineffective unless political leaders in the eurozone overcame their gridlock and took concerted action to stimulate the regional economy. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us to reach our objective\u201d using monetary policy alone, Mr. Draghi said at a news conference. Referring to political leaders, he said, \u201cEach of us has to do their own jobs.\u201dAs the markets start to digest the E.C.B.\u2019s latest strategy, the initial euphoria might fade. The details of the bond-buying program were vague. The central bank offered little information about how much money the measures would pump into the economy. Mr. Draghi said that was partly because of the lack of data on how many assets would meet E.C.B. quality standards.And it was unclear whether the purchases truly would qualify as Fed-style quantitative easing. Mr. Draghi said, in effect, yes and no. The program resembles quantitative easing in that the E.C.B. will purchase assets outright. But the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing, while including asset-backed securities, was based largely on buying up United States government debt in the form of Treasury bills and bonds. By targeting a narrower pool of assets, the E.C.B. effort will be far more modest, at least at first.Mr. Draghi said that the central bank\u2019s governing council was ready to take further measures if needed \u2014 a clear reference to quantitative easing, or broad-based purchases of government bonds or other assets. \u201cThe governing council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at the news conference.That statement was undercut somewhat, however, by his subsequent admission that some members of the governing council had opposed the moves announced on Thursday, a sign that they would probably oppose a broader program of asset purchases. The council includes the central bank governors of the 18 countries in the eurozone.In practice the E.C.B. would find it much more difficult than the Fed to buy government bonds, which would be necessary for full-blown quantitative easing. Government bond purchases would provoke vehement opposition in some European quarters, particularly in Germany, where many people regard such purchases as an abuse of central bank power.\u201cSuch a policy would be at the expense of European taxpayers, who would have to pay for the losses incurred by the E.C.B.,\u201d Hans-Werner Sinn, a prominent economist who is president of the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich, said in a statement on Thursday.As Mr. Draghi also made clear, the E.C.B.\u2019s efforts won\u2019t be enough unless the eurozone heads of state take more action. That might presumably include Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the deeply unpopular president of France, and Matteo Renzi, the promising but largely unproven prime minister of Italy. Mr. Draghi has spoken to both leaders recently, but declined on Thursday to say what they discussed.There is no quid pro quo, Mr. Draghi insisted, in which the E.C.B. doles out stimulus measures if political leaders force through unpopular changes like fewer restrictions on hiring and firing \u2014 the sort of changes many economists say France and Italy, among others, must take. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any grand bargain here,\u201d he said.But there is pressure. Mr. Draghi returned on Thursday to a theme he had raised last month at a Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., complaining of the impediments to entrepreneurship that still plague many eurozone countries.\u201cWe can provide as much credit as we want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if the person who plans to use this credit for a new business has to wait eight months before he or she can open this new business, and then she has to pay lots of taxes, this person will not apply for credit.\u201dPart of any joint action by eurozone leaders would require the backing of Germany and Angela Merkel, its chancellor. And so far the Germans have been reluctant to abandon the philosophy of strict budgetary discipline, often referred to as austerity, that they have preached throughout the financial crisis, and that a growing chorus of critics says is to blame for the eurozone\u2019s inability to resume growth.The most important effect of the central bank measures might be psychological. Thursday\u2019s moves signaled that at least one European institution is doing all it can to avert the threat of deflation \u2014 the pernicious downward spiral of prices that often leads to high unemployment. Annual inflation in the eurozone was 0.3 percent in August, according to an official estimate, worrisomely below the central bank\u2019s target of about 2 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s most important to give businesses, consumers and politicians as well the feeling that we are willing to do something for this recovery,\u201d said Horst L\u00f6chel, a professor of economics at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management. \u201cThe mood is very, very important.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fall TV Season Has Buzz, but It\u2019s Growing Softer", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a throwback, an archaic model, a vestige of a fading business. So why does a ripple of excitement continue to surround the start of another television season?Excitement may overstate the case. But among those in the business, as the broadcast networks once again offer full slates of original programming this week, a sense of eager expectation still beats in some hearts.\u201cLook at the season previews you still see everywhere \u2014 in print, online, in podcasts,\u201d said Preston Beckman, who in his long career has programmed the prime-time schedules at NBC and Fox. \u201cThere is still going to be a lot of focus on the new network shows. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s like it was in the glory days. But I do believe this is the time of year when the networks get a chance to step up to the forefront.\u201dBut the broad pro-network view espoused by Mr. Beckman, who is now a programming adviser for Fox, is not shared in other quarters of the television business. Some in the industry wonder why there is a notion of a season kickoff at all because television programming is increasingly about timelessness and freedom of choice, with viewers deciding when they will watch programs.\u201cWith the growth of mobile devices and on-demand viewing and all the rest, I think premiere week really doesn\u2019t matter much anymore,\u201d said Brad Adgate, the senior vice president for research at Horizon Media, a media buying company. \u201cParticularly among younger viewers, I don\u2019t think premiere week means anything.\u201dIn a recent report on the business, Richard Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG Research said, \u201cConsumer behavior is changing and it appears impossible to stop.\u201dDespite these doubts, the television season system remains intact, at least for now, driven by economic factors and a kind of Darwinian struggle to determine exactly what shows are fit to survive.At the same time, conjecture abounds about things like which network is in the most trouble. The consensus: Fox, after its fortunes have declined in recent years with the descent of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and the failure to find a fall reality series to fill hours \u2014 as \u201cThe Voice\u201d does on NBC, \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d does on ABC, and \u201cSurvivor\u201d does on CBS.The main economic factor driving the fall season is the advertising-sale ritual called the upfront, which takes place every May. Networks unveil their schedules and begin negotiations with advertisers about the rates to be paid for an entire 52-week year \u2014 one that starts in September. Negotiations now include even the terms for rating, such as whether to count delayed viewing over three days or seven.The upfront market was noticeably softer this year, with total spending estimated to have fallen 5 to 10 percent, to a total of slightly less than $9 billion. One explanation for the decline, television and marketing executives say, is that more advertisers have delayed spending to have more money available for commercial time later in the season. The shift can give marketers more flexibility and the chance to bargain for better rates. It also means a network can demand more money if a new show emerges as a major hit.As the networks vie with one another, they are increasingly finding that they no longer have the fall season spotlight to themselves, even in premiere week. The rest of the business used to back off until after the network program stampede. But this year, for example, the FX cable channel is running the final season of its drama \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d right in middle of the network fall debuts, and scoring impressive ratings. Last season, AMC ran the finale of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d on the first Sunday of the network season.\u201cNobody\u2019s afraid to take the networks on anymore, even in premiere week,\u201d Mr. Adgate said.The competition for viewers has never been more fierce. Last year, cable networks alone broadcast 144 original series, up from 29 a decade earlier. Even more original series are in the works this year, including \u201cThe Divide,\u201d on the WE tv network, and \u201cFortitude,\u201d a drama about a murder that shakes an Arctic town, on Pivot, a network focused on the millennial generation.Netflix, the streaming service, has said that it will spend nearly $3 billion on content in the next year. It has several original series in the pipeline, including \u201cMarco Polo,\u201d a historical costume adventure. Amazon plans to release four original series, including \u201cTransparent,\u201d a comedy about a father who comes out as transgender to his adult offspring.\u201cThe competition is not just other TV networks right now,\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, chief executive of 360i, a digital marketing agency with several television networks among its clients. \u201cIt is not just web series. We are in such an attention economy right now. If TV marketers are only looking at other TV programs, they already are way too far behind.\u201dThe flood of new series is coming as people are spending less time watching live television. Live viewing dropped more in the second quarter of 2014 than in the previous eight quarters, with the greatest decline among younger viewers, said Brian Wieser, a media analyst with Pivotal Research.The average adult watched four hours and 36 minutes of live television a day in the second quarter of 2014, down from four hours and 45 minutes two years ago, according to a recent Nielsen report. The time the average adult spent watching time-shifted television, meanwhile, jumped to 31 minutes a day in the quarter, up six minutes from two years earlier.Still, Mr. Beckman argued that in spite of all the factors battering the tradition of the network premiere week, it retains value, mainly for the attention it still brings to a business that needs all the attention it can get.\u201cIt\u2019s not always going to be this way,\u201d he said, \u201cThe eventual demise of a fall season is going to happen gradually, but it will still take a long time before it finally happens.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Parties Stake Claims in Elections", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 The battle for control of the United States Senate, the grand prize of the 2014 elections, with Republicans needing to win a net of a half-dozen seats to take charge, is well framed on Labor Day.Republicans have the advantages of a friendly turf, the history of this political cycle \u2014 which favors the party that doesn\u2019t hold the White House \u2014 and the waning popularity of President Obama, who sometimes seems indifferent.Democrats hope to minimize losses as stronger candidates face a few gaffe-prone opponents, and by benefiting from a superior ground game or voter turnout machine and the waning popularity of the Republican brand.As the nine-week home stretch starts, Republicans have a tail wind. They are solid favorites to capture three seats of retiring Democrats: Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia. Then, of the eight races both sides agree are very competitive, Democrats are defending six. A half-dozen states \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana and North Carolina \u2014 were carried by Mitt Romney two years ago; Colorado and Iowa went Democratic then. There are only two Republican-held seats subject to serious challenge, Georgia and Kentucky, where the party\u2019s Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, is almost as unpopular as Obama.If Republicans hold on to those two seats \u2014 they are slight favorites \u2014 and split the other half-dozen, the party will be in the majority. Both sides harbor hopes for upsets. Republicans insist they have a chance in New Hampshire and Michigan (Democrats disagree) and a long shot in Minnesota. Democrats\u2019 upset hopes are more of a reach, though if their nominee drops out, an independent candidate might be competitive in Republican Kansas against an unpopular incumbent.Democrats like to stress the micro, the unique advantages in some of these contested states: popular family legacies in Arkansas, Georgia and Louisiana; a Republican state legislature in North Carolina that is unpopular, especially on education; and a few trouble-prone Republicans like David Perdue in Georgia, whose business executive background carries the same liabilities as Romney\u2019s did two years ago.Democratic strategists also believe that in a number of states their candidate will outperform polls by a point or two because of a superior voter targeting and turnout apparatus, building on Obama\u2019s campaign infrastructure. Unlike in the last midterm elections, in 2010, when Republicans dominated, they predict respectable turnouts from black voters, Hispanics and unmarried women.Republicans counter that their voters are more enthusiastic and thus more likely to turn out. They acknowledge that the party\u2019s brand name is worse than it was two or four years ago, though they argue that this midterm contest is overshadowed by the president\u2019s negatives. Although they may have a couple of clunker candidates, there are no sure losers like last time, and they say there are some flawed Democratic aspirants such as the candidate in Iowa.On issues, all Republicans will attack the Affordable Care Act, which still gins up their base. More emphasis will be on jobs and the economy, areas where Republicans think they have the upper hand.A sleeper may be immigration; blocking immigration reform in Congress might hurt Republicans in the next presidential election with the fast-growing Hispanic vote. But the president probably will delay any executive action to liberalize immigration rules until after the election because nervous Democrats have warned that, with the current border controversies, it could cost several Senate seats in conservative states.With most of the big races showing a spread of only a few points, the campaign and circumstances over the next nine weeks may be decisive. One thing that won\u2019t change is the country\u2019s foul mood \u2014 and that encourages Republicans. \u201cI like where we are on Labor Day,\u201d said Scott Reed, the chief political consultant to the United States Chamber of Commerce whose mission is to help elect a Republican-controlled Senate. \u201cI\u2019d rather be us than them.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " Growth Revised to 4.6%, Brightening the Outlook ", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The bounce-back in the United States\u2019 economy last quarter from a dismal winter was even faster than previously thought, a sign that growth will most likely remain solid for the rest of the year. The economy as measured by gross domestic product grew at a 4.6 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, the Commerce Department said on Friday. It was the fastest pace in more than two years and was higher than the government\u2019s previous estimate of 4.2 percent. The upward revision reflected stronger-than-expected business investment and exports last quarter. The healthy second-quarter growth was a sharp rebound from the January-March quarter, when the economy shrank at a 2.1-percent rate during a brutal winter that idled factories and kept consumers at home. As the third quarter nears an end on Sept. 30, economists envision a strengthening economy through the end of 2014 and into 2015. Many think the economy is growing in the current July-September quarter at a rate of around 3 percent. Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, is more optimistic than most. He said a brighter outlook for business investment spending and other good economic reports had led him to revise his G.D.P. forecast to 3.2 percent growth for the July-September period, up from 2.8 percent earlier. \u201cThe American economy is firing on virtually all cylinders and cruising at a decidedly stronger rate than in recent years,\u201d Mr. Guatieri said. Friday\u2019s report on G.D.P. \u2014 the economy\u2019s total output of goods and services \u2014 was the government\u2019s third and final estimate for the second quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate, up from 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter. Analysts have sketched a much brighter outlook for 2015. Economists at JPMorgan Chase predict growth of 3 percent next year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scotland\u2019s Independence Vote Shows a Global Crisis of the Elites", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPulse of the PeopleWhen you get past the details of the Scottish independence referendum Thursday, there is a broader story underway, one that is also playing out in other advanced nations.It is a crisis of the elites. Scotland\u2019s push for independence is driven by a conviction \u2014 one not ungrounded in reality \u2014 that the British ruling class has blundered through the last couple of decades. The same discontent applies to varying degrees in the United States and, especially, the eurozone. It is, in many ways, a defining feature of our time.The rise of Catalan would-be secessionists in Spain, the rise of parties of the far right in European countries as diverse as Greece and Sweden, and the Tea Party in the United States are all rooted in a sense that, having been granted vast control over the levers of power, the political elite across the advanced world have made a mess of things.The details of Scotland\u2019s grievances are almost the diametrical opposite of those of, say, the Tea Party or Swedish right-wingers. They want more social welfare spending rather than less, and have a strongly pro-green, antinuclear environmental streak. (Scotland\u2019s threatened secession is less the equivalent of Texas pulling out of the United States, in that sense, than of Massachusetts or Oregon doing the same.) But there are always people who have disagreements with the direction of policy in their nation; the whole point of a state is to have an apparatus that channels disparate preferences into one sound set of policy choices.What distinguishes the current moment is that discontent with the way things have been going is so high as to test many people's tolerance for the governing institutions as they currently exist.The details are, of course, different in each country.In the case of Britain, a Labor government led by a Scottish prime minister (Gordon Brown) and his Scottish finance minister (Alistair Darling) supported the financialization of the British economy, with the rise of global mega-banks in an increasingly cosmopolitan London as the center of the economic strategy.Then, in 2008, the banks nearly collapsed and were bailed out, and the British economy hasn\u2019t been the same. Their failures ushered in a conservative government in 2010 that is even less aligned with the Scots\u2019 preferred policies, bringing an age of austerity when the Scots would prefer to widen the social safety net.In the United States, we watched a bipartisan push toward financial deregulation in the 1990s and 2000s lay the groundwork for the 2008 crisis. The inability of the Bush or Obama administration to contain the damage (and indeed to fight it with financial bailouts) ushered in a Tea Party in 2010 elections that is beyond the control of elder statesmen of the Republican Party.It is in continental Europe that the consequences of bungling by mainstream elites are perhaps the most damaging. The decades-long march toward a united continent, led by the parties of the center-right and center-left, created a Western Europe in which there was a single currency and monetary authority but without the political, fiscal and banking union that would make it possible for imbalances between those countries to work themselves out without the benefit of currency fluctuations. When it all came to a head from 2008 to 2012, national leaders were sufficiently alarmed by the risks of budget deficits that they responded by cutting spending and raising taxes.The details of the policy mistakes are different, as are the political movements that have arisen in protest. But together they are a reminder that no matter how entrenched our government institutions may seem, they rest on a bedrock assumption: that the leaders entrusted with power will deliver the goods.Power is not a right; it is a responsibility. The choice that the Scots are making on Thursday is about whether the men and women who rule Britain messed things up so badly that they would rather go it alone. And so the results will ripple through world capitals from Athens to Washington: People don\u2019t think the way things are going is good enough, and voters are getting angry enough to want to do something about it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Banks Show Tepid Interest as E.C.B. Begins Program of Cheap Loans ", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Banks borrowed less than expected from the European Central Bank in a disappointing start for a program intended to encourage more lending to businesses and households and to pump money into the ailing eurozone economy.The central bank said on Thursday that it would allot nearly 83 billion euros, or about $107 billion, to 255 commercial banks next week. Estimates of how much money banks would borrow had varied widely, but many analysts said before the announcement that anything less than \u20ac100 billion would be a disappointment.The demand for the cheap loans \u201cis disappointing and will raise further doubts about the feasibility of the E.C.B.\u2019s intention to increase its balance sheet by around \u20ac1 trillion,\u201d Martin van Vliet, an analyst at the Dutch bank ING, said in a note to clients.But Mr. van Vliet added that he did not think that the central bank would be alarmed by the outcome, because many banks may be waiting until December, when the E.C.B. will issue another round of the four-year loans.In a statement, the central bank said the money would support lending and was part of a package that would have \u201csizable impact.\u201d In all, the E.C.B. plans to issue eight rounds of the loans through June 2016.Modest demand for the loans could prompt the central bank to be more aggressive next month when it begins buying bundles of mortgages, credit card debt and other loans known as asset-backed securities in further efforts to stimulate the bloc\u2019s economy. The central bank has said that it will provide details of the securities purchases after its next monetary policy meeting, on Oct. 2.Analysts regard the purchases of asset-backed securities as a mild form of quantitative easing, the large-scale purchases of assets that the Federal Reserve has used to funnel money into the United States economy. Unlike the Fed, the E.C.B. does not yet plan to buy government bonds. But pressure to do so could rise if demand by commercial banks for E.C.B. loans remains weak.The euro rose slightly against the dollar in midday trading on Thursday, a sign that investors were not unduly worried about the low demand for the loans.Under the program, banks can borrow money at a fixed annual interest rate of 0.15 percent for four years, but they must repay the money in two years if they do not use it to issue loans to businesses and individuals. The money cannot be used to finance real estate purchases.The banks applied for \u20ac82.6 billion under the program, known as targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and will receive the money on Wednesday, the central bank said.Despite the attractive interest rate, there was uncertainty as to whether banks would want the funds, either because of a lack of demand for credit or a dearth of creditworthy borrowers.The central bank cash was likely to be most attractive to banks in countries like Italy, where the central bank interest rate was about 1 percentage point lower than market rates available to banks, according to economists at UBS.\u201cThe cheap funding opportunity offered by the E.C.B. should benefit Spanish and Italian banks the most, in particular the second-tier banks,\u201d economists at UBS said in a note to investors on Tuesday.In addition, many banks are behaving cautiously until they know how well they have fared in stress tests being conducted separately by the central bank.The results of the stress tests, as well as of a comprehensive review of bank assets aimed at flushing out hidden problems, are due in late October. Many analysts expect banks to take fuller advantage of the cheap cash when the E.C.B. issues a second round of loans in December. By then, banks will have a better idea where they stand in the eyes of regulators.Analysts predicted that the two rounds of loans together would add up to about \u20ac300 billion and that most of the money would be issued in December. The central bank has not said explicitly how much money it wants to inject into the economy through the various measures. But Mario Draghi, the president of the central bank, implied this month that the bank\u2019s goal was to add \u20ac1 trillion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jonathan Hill of Britain Nominated to Key E.U. Post Overseeing Financial Sector", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In an unexpected appointment that delighted the British government and the City of London alike, a Briton was nominated on Wednesday to a crucial financial leadership post in the European Union.Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Commission, tapped Jonathan Hill, a former lobbyist who is now a Conservative member of the House of Lords, to oversee the financial services sector.It looked to be a hand extended across the English Channel, aimed at soothing relations between Brussels and London and easing worries by many British business and political leaders that they have lost influence at the commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm.Prime Minister David Cameron, leader of the Conservatives, had vociferously opposed the appointment of Mr. Juncker to the presidency of the European Commission. Mr. Cameron argued that Mr. Juncker, a former prime minister and finance minister of Luxembourg who presided over the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, had spent his career consolidating power in Brussels at the expense of member states and was the wrong person to lead a reform agenda.Mr. Cameron\u2019s government has also opposed a number of important European Union efforts to rein in what many on the Continent see as the excesses of the corporate and investment worlds, including caps on executive bonuses and a tax on financial transactions. Financial services represent 7 percent of the British economy.Mr. Cameron, if his government is re-elected next year, has also pledged to hold a national a referendum on the country\u2019s membership in the European Union by 2017.Mr. Hill\u2019s appointment may alleviate some of that concern. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive olive branch to say to the U.K., \u2018You matter to Europe,'\u201d said Graham Bishop, a consultant on European integration based in London.Mr. Hill would replace Michel Barnier of France in a delicate role that includes deciding how banks in financial centers like the City of London should be regulated. \u201cMy starting point is that there is much work to do to build on the important legacy of Michel Barnier to ensure we have stable and well regulated financial markets.\u201d Mr. Hill said in a statement.Mr. Hill, who is formally known as Lord Jonathan Hill of Oareford, has held several positions in various Conservative governments, including that of John Major in the 1990s and Mr. Cameron, for whom he was a junior education minister. Last year, Mr. Hill became leader of the Conservatives in the House of Lords. He has also worked extensively as a lobbyist, founding Quiller Consultants, with many clients in the financial services sector.His fluid movement between the halls of government and lobbying raises red flags for some.\u201cEx-business lobbyists should have no place in a Juncker commission committed to cleaning up lobbying, and Hill\u2019s career up to now shows that he has no problem with politicians\u2019 and lobbyists\u2019 enjoying a cozy relationship,\u201d said Corporate Europe Observatory, a private group in Brussels that is critical of corporate ties to government.Some Socialist and Green Party members in the European Parliament called the nomination \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201dMr. Cameron applauded the Hill nomination Wednesday while campaigning in Scotland for that country to remain part of Britain. Financial lobbyists also expressed delight.\u201cIt\u2019s a coup for the prime minister that he could secure a high-profile economic post, and it shows that European policy makers want to keep the U.K. inside the E.U. and they want to listen to the reform agenda that the U.K. and others are making,\u201d said Chris Cummings, chief executive of TheCityUK, a lobbying firm that represents the interests of business and finance in the City of London.Financial service regulation has been a bone of contention between London and Brussels. European Union officials responded to the financial crisis with regulations seeking new curbs on financial traders, hedge funds and banks, and the markets in which they operate. While financial firms and banks have complained about the level of rule-making, critics have insisted that new boundaries were needed for an industry that went off the rails and took Europe with it.Mr. Hill\u2019s portfolio will include financial stability and financial services. In addition, one of Mr. Hill\u2019s primary tasks, said Mr. Bishop, the consultant on European integration, will be to promote the capital markets union, an effort to make credit more readily available to businesses. The dearth of traditional bank lending has been seen as one of the main factors in Europe\u2019s shaky and uneven recovery.When Mr. Hill comes before the Economy and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament for questioning as part of the nomination process, he is expected to be questioned closely on his lack of direct experience in financial services as well as on his views on banker pay and regulation.His confirmation is not assured. Members of the European Parliament could oppose Mr. Hill as a nominee, forcing at Mr. Juncker to push through the nomination or seek an alternative. But in end, the European Parliament will decide on Mr. Juncker\u2019s entire slate of candidates by an up-or-down vote.Those proceedings will show how hard Mr. Hill might be willing to push for himself. He replied \u201cnon, non, non\u201d when asked in June by the website ConservativeHome.com whether he would want to be Britain\u2019s member on the European Commission.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Retail Sales Gain Slightly", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe issue is not a question of whether we\u2019re growing or shrinking, but whether we\u2019re growing or accelerating,\u201d said Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. \u201cThis data says we\u2019re growing, but without accelerating.\u201d\u201cYou do not have this grand expansion in discretionary income,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe consumer has a limited budget to spend.\u201dMichael Gapen, Barclays\u2019 chief United States economist, agreed that the latest data on sales showed \u201cconsumer spending will be modest,\u201d adding \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s downshifting, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s upshifting either.\u201dPerhaps more significant, however, was the government\u2019s revision to the report last month on retail sales for July, raising to 0.3 percent the original estimate of zero. The initial July report spurred worries that \u201cthe consumer-led growth we were taking for granted might be drying up,\u201d said Douglas Handler, chief economist at IHS, a Boston-based global information company. \u201cThe revision really dispels that a bit.\u201dRetail sales \u2014 which rose to a seasonably adjusted $444.4 billion for August \u2014 are a prime economic engine, accounting for about 45 percent of total consumption. This month\u2019s figures are drawing particular attention in anticipation of next week\u2019s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making group.The stepped-up pace of auto and truck purchases helped lift retail sales the most but there were increases in nearly every category, from electronics and building supplies to groceries and clothing. Not counting the increase in auto sales, spending rose by 0.3 percent.Back-to-school sales tax holidays in 16 states may have helped nudge consumers into stores. The falloff in gasoline sales was expected given the dip in gas prices, economists said, which meant that consumers had more cash to spend on other things or put into savings. General merchandise chains, particularly department stores, also experienced a small decline.August\u2019s job growth was disappointing, with employers adding only 142,000 workers. More troubling was the drop in the proportion of working-age adults in the labor force, which reached a 30-year low last month. Some economists fear that millions of people who lost their jobs during the downturn may never return to the work force.Countering some of the disappointing news on jobs have been increased business investments and improved trade figures that recently prompted the government to revise its estimate of overall growth for the second quarter to an annual rate of 4.2 percent, a sharp turnaround from the 2.1 percent decline in the first quarter. The Commerce Department also reported on Friday that businesses increased their stockpiles in July, a sign that they expected buyers would keep their wallets open.Nearly all economists expect growth to slow to a more modest pace during the third quarter, which will end this month. Mr. Gapen said Barclays expected the advance in gross domestic product to run at 2.5 percent for the summer quarter.Some economists are offering more buoyant projections.After reviewing the monthly report, Goldman Sachs Global Macro Research increased its estimate to 3.3 percent. Paul Dales, senior United States Economist at Capital Economics, cited figures released last week by the Autodata Corporation that showed much stronger car sales in August \u2014 reaching an annualized rate of 17. 5 million vehicles \u2014 than those suggested by the Commerce Department figures. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was a bit stronger than 3.5 percent,\u201d he said.The flood of economic data leaves experts plenty of evidence to back up a range of viewpoints on the growth outlook.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Cuomo Lies Low, Teachout Debates a Stand-In: Astorino, the G.O.P. Rival", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many political candidates, the days before an election are a period of pandemonium. For Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, they are a prime time to remain out of sight.On Thursday, just five days before the Democratic primary, the governor held no public events. In his absence, his top challenger, Zephyr Teachout, faced off in a debate on public radio against an unusual stand-in: Rob Astorino, the Republican who hopes to beat the governor in the general election in November.Mr. Cuomo has refused to debate Ms. Teachout, despite her repeated requests; his supporters say it would be political negligence to spar with Ms. Teachout, a law professor who is not widely known, because the governor is expected to win by a large margin.Little was known about Mr. Cuomo\u2019s activities on Thursday beyond his general location: somewhere in New York City. His office issued news releases about a new program to help schools install solar panels, the opening of an archival center at a historic cemetery and a rise in attendance at state parks and campgrounds.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s office also released a statement after the death of the comedian Joan Rivers, in which the governor called her \u201can iconic New Yorker\u201d and expressed his condolences. \u201cYou\u2019re listening to two people who disagree but are principled,\u201d Mr. Astorino, the Westchester County executive, said. \u201cAndrew Cuomo stands for nothing.\u201dMs. Teachout described Mr. Cuomo as \u201cmuch more of a Republican than a Democrat\u201d on economic development. Mr. Astorino said the governor had \u201cfailed miserably\u201d at turning around the state\u2019s fortunes and described his administration as \u201ca fraud and a fairy tale.\u201dBoth candidates criticized Mr. Cuomo over his dealings with the Moreland Commission, the anticorruption panel shuttered by the governor, a matter that is now being investigated by federal prosecutors. Mr. Lehrer asked them if they considered Mr. Cuomo to be \u201ccorrupt,\u201d and both said yes.Sometimes, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s name seemed like a bad word.\u201cIn the last answer, I felt like Andrew Cuomo was here,\u201d Ms. Teachout said after Mr. Astorino laid out his ideas to improve the state\u2019s economy, which she summarized as a \u201ctraditional, conservative, trickle-down Reagan approach towards economic development.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m nothing like Andrew Cuomo,\u201d Mr. Astorino replied.Ms. Teachout predicted \u201ca historic upset\u201d on Tuesday. Mr. Astorino said he was not sure how Ms. Teachout would fare, but offered anecdotal evidence in her favor.\u201cI\u2019ve met about five people so far in nine months, traveling all 62 counties, who have said, \u2018I really like Andrew Cuomo,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said.In a rare acknowledgment that Mr. Cuomo is facing a primary challenge, several of his supporters went on the attack against Ms. Teachout, arguing that her participation in the debate served to bring coveted attention to Mr. Astorino.In a statement, former Gov. David A. Paterson, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, criticized her for \u201cproviding a platform for Rob Astorino to promote his extreme conservative agenda.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Astorino, Jessica Proud, said of the criticism, \u201cThis is what a Cuomo freakout looks like.\u201d Ms. Teachout, in a telephone interview, said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\u201cAndrew Cuomo, despite himself being in hiding, is clearly focused on this race,\u201d she said. \u201cHe seems to be twisting arms to get as many different people as possible to be surrogates, and I don\u2019t think he should be hiding behind his surrogates.\u201dLater, Sheldon Silver, the State Assembly speaker, led a group of lawmakers gathered outside City Hall to raise an unusual issue for a state election: They chastised Ms. Teachout and her running mate, Tim Wu, for what they called insufficient support of Israel. \u201cTheir failure to stand strong with Israel speaks volumes,\u201d Mr. Silver said, arguing that issues related to the country were crucial for a New York governor.Mr. Cuomo traveled to Israel last month on what he called a solidarity mission. Ms. Teachout has declined to express a view of the conflict in Gaza. On Tuesday, after Mr. Cuomo held an event highlighting his Israel trip, Ms. Teachout said New York had a \u201cvery special relationship\u201d with Israel, a bond that she pledged to support as governor. \u201cBut I\u2019m not running for president,\u201d she added, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to second-guess the president or the secretary of state on foreign policy issues.\u201dMatt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Upgrades, and Higher Prices, for Airport Hotels", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesThe airport hotel, that bastion of utility and convenience for marooned travelers, is having a banner year. In the first four months of 2014, hotels in the United States situated near airports sold a collective 27.2 million rooms, a record, according to the hotel research company STR.For travelers and meeting planners, this means airport rooms are more expensive and can be harder to find. It also means that owners of airport hotel brands popular with business travelers are on a renovation binge, sprucing up rooms, restaurants, lobbies and meeting spaces.STR data shows that while the average hotel occupancy rate in the United States was just over 62 percent last year, airport hotels ended 2013 with an occupancy rate of roughly 70 percent.And this year began even better. Occupancy was nearly 72 percent through April, helped by the unusually harsh winter that left many travelers grounded.\u201cThe last few years have been very good to airport hotels, and there is really no reason to think that that will change in the next 24 months,\u201d Jan D. Freitag, senior vice president for strategic development at STR, said via email.Hotel owners in markets where the last building boom left travelers with many overnight options near their departure gate are investing in these airport properties to stand apart from the competition.\u201cThere certainly has been growth in the past decade of full-service hotels near airports,\u201d said Scott Berman, United States hospitality and leisure practice leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers.\u201cI\u2019ve seen more and more under renovation,\u201d added Mark Norman, a real estate director for a hair salon company who said he often stays at airport hotels for the convenience. \u201cThe amenities then make it really appealing.\u201dThese upgrades are happening around the country. The Grand Hyatt DFW, which is situated at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, finished an overhaul of its restaurant, bar and private dining room in March. And the Hilton Chicago O\u2019Hare Airport wrapped up the second stage of a three-part renovation to its meeting space in August.\u201cThe look of the space is much more modern. Sometimes you go to an airport hotel, and they\u2019re all the same,\u201d said Michael McGilligan, general manager of the Hilton Chicago O\u2019Hare. \u201cWe started to see a little bit of momentum and we thought if we could get people in the door with an updated product, they\u2019d be more likely to come back.\u201dAirport hotels have to battle the perception that they serve primarily a captive market of travelers and flight crews with no place else to go.\u201cAs a general comment, they\u2019re usually not the best of the brand,\u201d said Michael Brownfield, a business consultant who spends roughly four days each week traveling for work.This sentiment is a common refrain echoed by frequent travelers, although recent stays have left Mr. Brownfield pleasantly surprised.\u201cThe recent ones I\u2019ve stayed at have been under renovation or recently renovated,\u201d he said. In Houston, a newly renovated hotel near George Bush Intercontinental Airport was nicer than ones of the same brand in other areas where he also had stayed, he said.And Beau Davis, a sales executive for an ad technology start-up, said he had also seen a steady improvement in airport hotels. \u201cWhat I notice more is better, higher-end chain hotels,\u201d he said.\u201cYou never had really high expectations as long as it was adequate,\u201d said Deborah Gaffney, who plans meetings for an association of tax professionals. \u201cNow you do see upgraded lobbies, upgraded room d\u00e9cor, upgraded linens,\u201d she said. These new perks have a price, though. \u201cTheir rates have crept up accordingly,\u201d she said.According to STR, the average airport hotel room rate in April was $102.18, up 4 percent from a year earlier.In some cases, owners are switching brands to attract a more business-class clientele. The Concourse Hotel at Los Angeles Airport, formerly the Radisson Los Angeles Airport Hotel, will become the Hyatt Regency Los Angeles Airport in 2016. In June, a former Holiday Inn became the Crowne Plaza Seattle Airport.With the transition to Crowne Plaza, the hotel is seeing an uptick in transient business and also meetings business, said Gina LaBarre, vice president for brand management in the Americas at Crowne Plaza Hotels & Resorts. The $9 million renovation included the addition of 1,500 square feet of meeting space and an expansion of the lobby.Even with these improvements, however, booking a stay at an airport hotel is still often a matter of necessity, not first choice.Mr. Davis tends to stay at airport hotels when he can\u2019t find a room in urban neighborhoods. \u201cSometimes, by default, I have to, especially when cities are booked,\u201d said Mr. Davis, who travels roughly three weeks out of the month. \u201cIt\u2019s happened more in the last two years.\u201dR. Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research, said experiences like Mr. Davis\u2019s were part of what was driving the airport hotel occupancy boom.\u201cA lot of leisure travelers and international visitors prefer urban environments,\u201d he said. Although travelers are returning to city hotels, a tight credit market and the relatively long time it takes to build a hotel means demand has not kept up with supply. This has the effect of making downtown hotel rooms both more expensive and scarcer, which shifts demand to airport hotels, although there are few of these being built.\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that much new construction, at least on a relative basis,\u201d Mr. Woodworth said.The result is an uptick in occupancy rates at hotels near airports, particularly as the economy has gathered strength recently.\u201cIt really started to pick up in the middle of last year,\u201d said Mr. McGilligan, of the Hilton O\u2019Hare. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly outpacing a lot of our counterparts in urban and downtown locations.\u201dOne company is betting that demand for higher-end hotels near airports is a lasting trend. Intended to be the first of a new hotel brand, the Woolley\u2019s Classic Suites at the Denver Airport opened in May.Marcelo Birckenstaedt, its general manager, said that the hotel\u2019s occupancy so far was about half that of competing properties. \u201cDemand is increasing. It\u2019s hard to gauge because we don\u2019t have a history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are one hotel of a brand new chain with a brand new name.\u201dIts room rates run about $15 higher than competitors\u2019 prices.\u201cTypically, what the chains or franchisees build near the airports is run-of-the-mill, cookie-cutter limited service or full-service hotels,\u201d Mr. Birckenstaedt said. \u201cWe based the business model on building something nicer.\"Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill and Hillary Clinton Sell Their Brand of Sizzle at a Steak Fry in Iowa", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byINDIANOLA, Iowa \u2014 It was a preview of coming distractions.When Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton decided to return to the state where her presidential ambitions first came undone six years ago, the idea was that they would remind Democratic activists about the importance of the midterm elections and honor their host, Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who is retiring from Congress and held his final steak fry fund-raiser here Sunday. And that was what transpired, in part, on a sun-splashed day on a balloon field here, just south of Des Moines.But as is often the case wherever Mr. Clinton goes, what amounted to the unofficial start of the next Iowa presidential caucuses was as much about the Clinton who already served as president as the one who appears to have designs on the office.It concluded with a 30-minute tour d\u2019horizon from the former president on topics including Haiti, his soon-to-arrive grandchild, Senator Mitch McConnell and the impact of the billionaires the Koch brothers on American politics. In between, Mr. Harkin; his wife, Ruth; and Mrs. Clinton herself did their best to focus attention on the other half of the once and perhaps future first couple.In a speech that was her most overtly political since she left the State Department last year, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly hinted at her intentions. She laced her remarks with all manner of pregnant references to the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process and veiled asides about her plans. \u201cHello, Iowa, I\u2019m back!\u201d she exclaimed upon taking the microphone, stretching out the \u201ca\u201d in \u201cback\u201d as she smiled in front of hay bales, an American flag and a John Deere tractor. Speaking to about 10,000 Democrats \u2014 many of whom wore stickers distributed by Ready for Hillary, an outside group that aims to build grass-roots enthusiasm for a potential Clinton candidacy \u2014 the former first lady all but winked and raised her eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she said, teasing the crowd. \u201cI am thinking about it.\u201d In motivating the audience to vote in November, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cToo many people only get excited about presidential campaigns.\u201d She added, after waiting a beat: \u201cLook, I get excited about presidential campaigns, too.\u201d Just to make sure the crowd had not missed her point, she concluded her first speech in Iowa since 2008 by saying, \u201cLet\u2019s not let another seven years go by.\u201dOn Sunday, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly said she was glad to be back in Iowa, but the state holds bitter memories for her. In the 2008 Democratic caucus, Mrs. Clinton came in third behind then-Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina. Her top campaign aides went on to criticize Iowa\u2019s caucus as undemocratic and unimportant in selecting presidents, and she had not been back since the late-night results came in on Jan. 3, 2008.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign started here, with schmoozing at Mr. Harkin\u2019s steak fry. At the event in 2007, the Clinton campaign, once seen as inevitable, saw firsthand the grass-roots support Mr. Obama had garnered in the crucial early voting state.\u201cIt really does feel like just yesterday when I was here,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told the crowd. \u201cAs I recall, there was a young senator from Illinois there.\u201dMrs. Clinton has devoted much of her time since leaving her post as President Obama\u2019s secretary of state to paid speeches and discussion of foreign policy to promote her memoir \u201cHard Choices.\u201d But on Sunday, she jumped aggressively back into domestic politics with a populist message that praised the president, but also acknowledged that much work needed to be done to stem the tide of rising inequality.\u201cWe can build a growing economy of shared prosperity,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.Her speech also touched on women\u2019s economic and reproductive rights \u2014 hot-button issues in midterm elections that could be determined by female voters. The Harkins sought to make it clear that, while the Clintons were co-headliners, it was Mrs. Clinton who was to be the focal point. Mr. Harkin made sure to note that \u201cthere are many more chapters to be written in the amazing life of Hillary Clinton.\u201d Yet for all the effort to shine a rhetorical light on Mrs. Clinton, it was Mr. Clinton who seemed most happy to be back on the grand stage of presidential politics. As the Clintons and Mr. Harkin stood a few feet away from the sizzling beef, Mr. Clinton initially sought to deflect attention.Asked how he was feeling, Mr. Clinton, his arm around Mrs. Clinton, replied, \u201cAs long as I\u2019m still married to her, I\u2019m good.\u201dAfter indulging a few questions, Mrs. Clinton drifted away, and the grill-side session soon became the Tom and Bill Show. Mostly it was the latter.It was a vintage bit of Clinton garrulousness, and the former president had little appetite to cut it short, despite the increasingly urgent pleas from aides behind him and Mr. Harkin. Mr. Clinton showered praise on Mr. Harkin, who is retiring after 40 years in Congress and a failed presidential run (cut short by an up-and-coming Arkansas governor by the name of Clinton). But as has been the case throughout his political career, once Mr. Clinton got going, there was no stopping him. Mrs. Clinton was long gone by the time her husband was dishing out some of his favorite lines (the Founding Fathers were pragmatists, and the Constitution could be called \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d), praising the Ready for Hillary crew (he compared them to the Energizer Bunny) and assessing midterm campaigns from Iowa to Arkansas. About the only topic Mr. Clinton did not broach was the one that drew many attendees and nearly all of the 200-plus credentialed reporters. \u201cI will not be baited,\u201d he said with a knowing grin when he was asked whether Mrs. Clinton would or would not disappoint all those activists working for Ready for Hillary. The event planners originally wanted Mrs. Clinton to follow her husband, but protocol dictated that he speak last. The former president recounted at some length his relationship and brief rivalry with Mr. Harkin. Additionally, Mr. Clinton used his remarks to decry dysfunction in Washington, and Republicans\u2019 inability to strike compromise.

{"Headline": "Chinese Tourists Find a Movable Feast Best Left Behind ", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Before arriving in the French capital, Wu Shuyun, a 56-year-old Chinese housewife, imagined Paris to be like a pristine film set for a romantic love story, picturing herself as a glamorous princess surrounded by elegant Parisians, decked out, perhaps, in Chanel.A growing number of Chinese tourists in Paris \u2014 armed with wads of cash, typically unable to speak French and still somewhat na\u00efve about the ways of the West after decades of China\u2019s relative isolation \u2014 are falling victim to their unrealistic expectations of the city, while also being victimized by brazen thieves who target them because they are easily identifiable as Asian, Chinese tourism industry officials here say.According to the Paris-based European Federation of Chinese Tourism, which represents 30 travel agencies catering to Chinese tourists, the number of group tours coming to the French capital has fallen 20 percent so far this year compared with 2013. The Paris Tourism Office said that a 21 percent jump in the number of Chinese tourists last year had nearly halved in 2014.After six Chinese students studying winemaking were mugged in Bordeaux three months later, Beijing demanded that the French government take action.Pierre Shi, secretary general of the European Federation of Chinese Tourism, said Chinese visitors were being preyed upon because they were known to carry large amounts of cash to avoid paying multiple currency exchange fees. Bargain-seeking Chinese tour operators were also booking hotels in Paris\u2019s northern suburbs.\u201cChinese tourists are attracted to Paris by the glamour, by the desire to buy designer brands, by an image of France as a country of philosophers and revolution,\u201d said Mr. Shi, who runs his own travel agency, ID Travel Pro. \u201cBut now, they are afraid to come. Before, they wouldn\u2019t think twice.\u201dThe expression was first coined 30 years ago by a Paris-based Japanese psychiatrist, Hiroaki Ota, after several Japanese visitors to Paris fell ill when their culture of politeness and reserve rubbed up against Gallic haughtiness.Dr. Ota said in an interview in his office that because China had been closed off to the West for so long, some Chinese travelers could be at risk for culture shock and depression when faced with the harsher realities of a city they had over-idealized. But he noted that the Chinese were less susceptible to Paris Syndrome than the Japanese, since they were fortified by a directness and an outsize sense of self that was similar to the French.\u201cWhereas Japanese are reserved, polite and formal, the Chinese have a strong sense of national pride like the French, and they are not shy,\u201d he said.Thomas Deschamps, the head of research at the Paris Tourism Office, said culture shock was particularly prevalent among travelers from Asia, who sometimes wrongly perceived the French capital as a museum.To help protect and reassure Chinese tourists, Mr. Deschamps said, the city has beefed up security at popular sites like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, while instituting warnings in Mandarin to be vigilant against pickpockets on the Paris Metro. The Paris police have also introduced complaint forms in Chinese. While thieves and Gallic aloofness could be a hazard, some Chinese in Paris said they deserved some of the blame for the French reactions they sometimes provoked.\u201cThe Chinese are used to spitting. We are used to snapping our fingers to get attention, or even yelling,\u201d said Mr. Shi, the Chinese travel agency federation chief. \u201cBut if you do that with a French waiter, they will ignore you even more.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about unrealistic expectations of some Chinese visitors to Paris and the disappointments that they experience misidentified the bridge in that city on which tourists were standing.

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Antitrust Campaign Seen as Possible Breach of W.T.O. Rules", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlthough foreign companies including Microsoft, Qualcomm and Daimler have in recent months been subjected to surprise raids, lengthy investigations and increasing fines by China\u2019s government antitrust enforcers, they have had little recourse against such actions. In the meantime, the responses from foreign business groups have largely been measured, calling for China to ensure a level playing field as it enforces its antimonopoly law, which took effect in 2008.\u201cTo the extent that China\u2019s enforcement of the A.M.L. is discriminatory, it arguably violates commitments that China undertook when it acceded to the World Trade Organization,\u201d said the report, referring to the antimonopoly law. \u201cIf China applies the A.M.L. in a manner inconsistent with its W.T.O. obligations, this would arguably constitute a violation of W.T.O. law despite being imposed under the guise of competition law.\u201dPursuing such a case at the W.T.O. would be unconventional, and experts noted it would be difficult to gather the extensive documentation required. The United States Chamber report noted that the antimonopoly law could be used as a tool to allow the market to play a primary role in China\u2019s economy, a stated goal of the proposals announced in November 2013 by President Xi Jinping after a major plenary meeting of the Communist Party leadership.\u201cHowever, China\u2019s enforcement of the A.M.L. is not yet living up to this ideal,\u201d it said.Fines and other antimonopoly directives \u201coften appear designed to advance industrial policy and boost national champions,\u201d the report said. Regulators \u201crely insufficiently on sound economic analysis, intellectual property rights have been curtailed in the name of competition law, and A.M.L. enforcement suffers from procedural and due process shortcomings.\u201dChina would no doubt be staunchly opposed to any attempt by foreign governments to raise the issue of its antitrust enforcement at the W.T.O. level. Senior Chinese officials have repeatedly said they are not focusing specifically on foreign companies and that equal treatment is being extended to all.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Bond-Buying Ends, Yellen Now Will Chart Course for Federal Reserve", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve\u2019s chairwoman, the easy part is over. The first phase of the Fed\u2019s retreat from its economic stimulus campaign, plotted by her predecessor, is nearly complete. Now, as Ms. Yellen nears the end of her first year in office, it is her turn to chart the way forward. Ms. Yellen and her colleagues on the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, who will convene here on Tuesday and Wednesday, are broadly agreed that the Fed\u2019s ability to improve economic conditions is nearing the end of the line, and they are inclined to start raising short-term interest rates around the midpoint of next year.But the group of 17 officials continues to grapple with a pair of questions, one economic and one strategic, that will determine the details of the retreat: How much better can the job market get? And given that uncertainty, does it make more sense to pull back sooner, even if that means leaving unemployment too high, or to keep rates anchored longer, pressing ahead until it is clear the economy no longer needs the Fed\u2019s help, even if the result is an abrupt retreat?The Fed is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will add just $15 billion to its bond holdings in October. Then it plans to end the purchases, concluding a series of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d campaigns that have expanded its portfolio to $4.2 trillion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities from less than $1 trillion before the 2008 crisis.That will let officials focus on the Fed\u2019s central policy tool, the level of short-term interest rates, which have been fixed near zero since December 2008.The Fed has indicated it plans to hold interest rates near zero well into next year, to encourage businesses and consumers to borrow money and investors to take larger risks. But the internal debate has shifted in recent months as job growth has increased to a monthly average of 215,000 jobs so far this year, a level that some of the Fed\u2019s economic research has suggested is about as strong as it is likely to get. Fed officials who support the campaign have stopped pushing to extend its duration, while moderates are warning that the Fed may need to beat an earlier retreat.\u201cFed rhetoric has turned marginally more hawkish in recent months,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in an analysis last week. He said he now expected the Fed to start raising rates in June 2015 rather than the third quarter. Economists at Bank of America made a similar shift. \u201cThere has been a gradual change in rhetoric from Janet Yellen and her allies,\u201d their report said, though it added that the projection was \u201cmore of a guess than a forecast.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d they said that she told them.But the next day, when Ms. Yellen delivered a professorial survey of the many unanswered questions about labor markets, some analysts saw evidence that she, too, had growing doubts about how much more the Fed could do.Ms. Yellen is also a low-key leader who speaks regularly with her colleagues in a constant search for common ground. Like Ben. S. Bernanke, her predecessor \u2014 but unlike some previous, more autocratic Fed chairmen \u2014 she lets other officials speak first at policy meetings, preferring to summarize the discussion rather than speaking at the outset to set the frame of the debate. But Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, noted that Mr. Bernanke, despite his preference for consensus, proved willing to act forcefully, as in September 2011 when the Fed expanded its stimulus campaign despite three dissenting votes.\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very collegial, and what we\u2019ve seen so far is consistent with that, but nevertheless there are things she\u2019s going to feel more strongly about,\u201d Mr. Hatzius said. Many investors also are skeptical that the Fed intends to move faster. Asset prices that incorporate expectations about interest rates generally reflect an expectation that rates will rise more slowly than the predictions Fed officials made in June. This may reflect greater pessimism about the economic outlook. It also reflects a view that the projections are misleading. An average of the predictions obscures the reality that the Fed\u2019s leadership, including Ms. Yellen, is more supportive of stimulus.\u201cSome dots are more equal than other dots, and it so happens that the more powerful dots skew dovish,\u201d Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott, wrote recently to clients.In addition to the economic argument for moving sooner, some Fed officials see a strategic argument. John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has argued in research papers that central banks should deal with uncertainty by doing less \u2014 which in this case means an earlier retreat.\u201cI think a gradual approach and learning as you go in terms of seeing how the economy responds is appropriate, given this uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Williams said in a recent interview. \u201cMaybe backing away from this rather than running away.\u201dSome officials argue that the Fed should begin to open up its options by adjusting the language of its July policy statement, which said that the central bank did not intend to raise interest rates for a \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after ending bond purchases, a phrase widely understood to mean at least six months. While the Fed is expected to stick with that language at least for this week\u2019s meeting, there is growing discomfort with the phrase because officials do not want to exclude the possibility they will move sooner.\u201cAny reference to calendar dates has the potential to be inaccurate,\u201d Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said in a speech this month. Mr. Rosengren remains among the strongest proponents of the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign, so it was particularly striking that he said the Fed was now close enough to achieving its goals that a time commitment no longer made sense. Better to emphasize that the timing will depend on inherently unpredictable economic conditions, he said. And as the Fed makes that shift, either now or in the coming months, a period of unusual clarity about Fed policy will come to an end. It\u2019s time to pay attention again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Acts to Curb Firms\u2019 Moves Overseas to Avoid Taxes", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWhile there\u2019s no substitute for congressional action, my administration will act wherever we can to protect the progress the American people have worked so hard to bring about,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a statement after the regulations on the so-called corporate inversions were announced.\u201cFor some companies considering deals, today\u2019s actions will mean that inversions no longer make economic sense,\u201d Mr. Lew said. \u201cThese transactions may be legal, but they\u2019re wrong.\u201dStill, some Democrats, including those who have been the harshest critics of corporate inversions, said the actions were far too limited to substantially reduce the practice. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said the Obama administration had been hemmed in by the limits to its legal authority, yielding a set of rules that most likely will hold up in court but have little substantive effect.\u201cCertainly they made a good effort, but what this administrative action shows is that the only real way to stop inversions is legislative,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview. In particular, he said Congress must pass legislation that stops a practice known as \u201cearnings stripping.\u201d That is when a parent company loads up a United States subsidiary with debt, the interest on which is deductible, to avoid paying taxes on income. Mr. Schumer also said Congress should define an inversion more tightly..\u201cThe administration wanted to go as far as they legally could, but they\u2019re very careful,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, adding that he hopes a bipartisan deal for legislation on the issue can be reached in November.While Mr. Lew said his preference was for Congress to act on a broad business tax overhaul that would include anti-inversion provisions, it had become clear that would not happen before the November postelection session. In the meantime, he said Treasury was exploring additional administrative steps to attack inversions, something the president said he supported.\u201cWe\u2019ve recently seen a few large corporations announce plans to exploit this loophole, undercutting businesses that act responsibly and leaving the middle class to pay the bill, and I\u2019m glad that Secretary Lew is exploring additional actions to help reverse this trend,\u201d Mr. Obama said.An increasing number of United States companies are reaching deals to reorganize overseas, which has created a new opening in the run-up to the midterm congressional elections for Mr. Obama to make his signature argument about economic fairness. The president has said that companies that invert for tax purposes lack \u201ceconomic patriotism.\u201dThe guidelines use existing Treasury regulations to crack down on complicated transactions like internal loans, stock purchases and sales that such inverted companies use to substantially reduce the tax they owe in the United States. They would short-circuit so-called hopscotch loans \u2014 when an American parent company uses its foreign subsidiary\u2019s earnings without paying United States taxes \u2014 making the loans count as American property.The rules also prevent inverted companies from taking advantage of a strategy known as decontrolling, when an inverted company essentially has its foreign entity buy enough stock from the American parent that it has access to earnings from the overseas branch without ever paying United States taxes on them. They could still make the stock purchases, but the tax benefit would vanish. And inverted companies could no longer transfer cash or property from an overseas entity to the new foreign parent company without paying taxes in the United States.In addition, Treasury plans to tighten an existing requirement that an inversion can take place only if the former owners of the American company own less than 80 percent of the resulting firm, and if the foreign entity is valued at more than 20 percent. Democratic lawmakers, including Mr. Schumer, have proposed adjusting that threshold to 50-50.Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who is the chairman of the Finance Committee, said Treasury\u2019s move \u201creinforces the urgency for action before this growing wave of inversions erodes our nation\u2019s tax base, but only Congress has the full range of tools to address both the immediate problem and ensure U.S. businesses continue to be competitive in the global economy.\u201dHe said doing so would require \u201ca series of stopgap reforms\u201d that should be part of a comprehensive tax overhaul. \u201cCongress should move a bipartisan bill in the lame-duck session as an immediate action to address inversions, to create incentives so businesses will remain in or move to the U.S., and to use that legislation as a springboard to comprehensive tax reform,\u201d Mr. Wyden said.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the finance panel, said he would work with Mr. Wyden on a stopgap measure to tackle the issue.\u201cIn the end, any solution that permanently addresses inversions must be legislated by Congress,\u201d Mr. Hatch said.An article on Tuesday about new Treasury rules intended to make it more difficult for companies to lower their tax bills by relocating overseas misstated a tax advantage of \u201cearnings stripping,\u201d in which a company loads up a United States subsidiary with debt to avoid paying taxes on income. The interest on the debt is deductible, not the debt itself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Gary Hart\u2019s Downfall Forever Changed American Politics", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a scalding July day five years ago, I found myself hiking in Red Rocks Park, just outside Denver, with Gary Hart. The copper cliffs were brilliantly lit in the midday sun, which burned our uncovered heads as we trudged up a steep incline toward the amphitheater that Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s Works Progress Administration ingeniously carved into the boulders.We had come because Hart wanted to show me something, and as we made our way uphill, I was soon breathing heavily in the mile-high air. But I was more aware of Hart, who, at 72, labored audibly despite his legendary ruggedness. (The most famous picture from Hart\u2019s first presidential campaign, where he came from nowhere in 1984 to stalemate Walter Mondale and overturn the aging Democratic establishment in the process, was one from New Hampshire, in which the flannel-clad Hart had just managed to bury an ax in a tree from a distance, legend had it, of 40 feet.) He had developed a paunch and was slightly stooped, his arms swinging crookedly at his sides. He wore black pants and a black Nike polo shirt, from which tufts of chest hair sprouted near the unbuttoned collar. His famous mane, still intact but now white and unruly, framed a sunburned, square-jawed face.\u201cWhen I announced for president in 1987, we did it right up there,\u201d Hart said, pointing toward a rock formation at the top of the hill.I tried to imagine the lectern set against the red rocks and blue sky, the crush of cameras and the palpable sense of history. Hart\u2019s aides had wanted him to do something more conventional, with a ballroom and streamers and all of that, but he insisted on standing against the mountainous backdrop, near the amphitheater he called \u201ca symbol of what a benevolent government can do.\u201dBack then, Hart was as close to a lock for the nomination \u2014 and likely the presidency \u2014 as any challenger of the modern era. According to Gallup, Hart had a double-digit lead over the rest of the potential Democratic field among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. In a preview of the general election against the presumed Republican nominee, Vice President George H. W. Bush, Hart was polling over 50 percent among registered voters and beating Bush by 13 points, with only 11 percent saying they were undecided. He would have been very hard to stop.\u201cMust have been a hell of a backdrop,\u201d I said. Hart didn\u2019t respond, and after an awkward moment, I let it drop.As anyone alive during the 1980s knows, Hart, the first serious presidential contender of the 1960s generation, was taken down and eternally humiliated by a scandal, a suspected affair with a beautiful blonde whose name, Donna Rice, had entered the cultural lexicon, along with the yacht \u2014 Monkey Business \u2014 near which she had been photographed on his lap. When they talked about him now in Washington, Hart was invariably described as a brilliant and serious man, perhaps the most visionary political mind of his generation, an old-school statesman of the kind Washington had lost its capacity to produce. He warned of the rise of stateless terrorism and spoke of the need to convert the industrial economy into an information-and-technology-based one, at a time when few politicians in either party had given much thought to anything beyond communism and steel. But such recollections were generally punctuated by a smirk or a sad shake of the head. Hardly a modern scandal passed, whether it involved a politician or an athlete or an entertainer, that didn\u2019t evoke inevitable comparisons to Hart among reflective commentators. In popular culture, Gary Hart would forever be that archetypal antihero of presidential politics: the iconic adulterer.The rest of the world was finished with Gary Hart, but I couldn\u2019t get his story out of my mind, which was why I ended up standing alongside him at Red Rocks on that summer day, like an archaeologist searching for shards of a lost political age. I had come to believe that we couldn\u2019t really understand the dispiriting state of our politics \u2014 and of our political journalism \u2014 without first understanding what transpired during that surreal and frenetic week in April nearly 30 years ago.Of course, you could reasonably have asked that same question of the three most important political figures of Hart\u2019s lifetime, all Democratic presidents thought of as towering successes. Franklin Roosevelt, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were adulterers, before and during their presidencies, and we can safely assume they had plenty of company. In his 1978 memoir, Theodore White, the most prolific and influential chronicler of presidential politics in the last half of the 20th century, wrote that he was \u201creasonably sure\u201d that of all the candidates he had covered, only three \u2014 Harry Truman, George Romney and Jimmy Carter \u2014 hadn\u2019t enjoyed the pleasure of \u201ccasual partners.\u201d He and his colleagues considered those affairs irrelevant.By the late 1980s, however, a series of powerful, external forces in the society were colliding, creating a dangerous vortex on the edge of our politics. Hart didn\u2019t create that vortex. He was, rather, the first to wander into its path.The nation was still feeling the residual effects of Watergate, which 13 years earlier led to the first resignation of a sitting president. Richard Nixon\u2019s fall was shocking, not least because it was more personal than political, a result of instability and pettiness rather than pure ideology. And for this reason Watergate, along with the deception over what was really happening in Vietnam, had injected into presidential politics a new focus on private morality.Social mores were changing, too. For most of the 20th century, adultery as a practice \u2014 at least for men \u2014 was rarely discussed but widely accepted. Kennedy and Johnson governed during the era that \u201cMad Men\u201d would later portray, when the powerful man\u2019s meaningless tryst with a secretary was no less common than the three-martini lunch. Twenty years later, however, social forces unleashed by the tumult of the 1960s were rising up to contest this view. Feminism and the \u201cwomen\u2019s lib\u201d movement had transformed expectations for a woman\u2019s role in marriage, just as the civil rights movement had changed prevailing attitudes toward African-Americans.As America continued to debate the Equal Rights Amendment for women into the 1980s, younger liberals \u2014 the same permissive generation that ushered in the sexual revolution and free love \u2014 were suddenly apt to see adultery as a kind of political betrayal, and one that needed to be exposed. \u201cThis is the last time a candidate will be able to treat women as bimbos,\u201d is how the feminist Betty Friedan put it after Hart\u2019s withdrawal. (If only she\u2019d known.)Perhaps most salient, though, the nation\u2019s news media were changing in profound ways. When giants like White came up through the news business in the postwar years, the surest path to success was to gain the trust of politicians and infiltrate their world. Proximity to power and the information and insight derived from having it was the currency of the trade. By the 1980s, however, Watergate and television had combined to awaken an entirely new kind of career ambition. If you were an aspiring journalist born in the 1950s, when the baby boom was in full swing, then you entered the business at almost exactly the moment when Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of The Washington Post \u2014 portrayed by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman in the cinematic version of their first book, \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d \u2014 were becoming not just the most celebrated reporters of their day but very likely the wealthiest and most famous journalists in American history (with the possible exception of Walter Cronkite). And what made Woodward and Bernstein so iconic wasn\u2019t proximity, but scandal. They had actually managed to take down a mendacious American president, and in doing so they came to symbolize the hope and heroism of a new generation.It would be hard to overstate the impact this had, especially on younger reporters. If you were one of the new breed of middle-class, Ivy League-educated baby boomers who had decided to change the world through journalism, then there was simply no one you could want to become more than Woodward or Bernstein, which is to say, there was no greater calling than to expose the lies of a politician, no matter how inconsequential those lies might turn out to be or in how dark a place they might be lurking.\u201cYou know, you said in the paper that there were rumors that Gary Hart is a womanizer,\u201d she told him. \u201cThose aren\u2019t rumors.\u201d And then a question: \u201cHow much do you guys pay for pictures?\u201dIn a subsequent conversation, the anonymous caller told Fiedler that a friend of hers had seen Hart aboard a chartered yacht at Turnberry Isle near Miami, and the two had started an affair on an overnight pleasure cruise to Bimini. Her friend had pictures of her and Hart on the boat that she had shown the caller. The caller never used the name Donna Rice, the 29-year-old commercial actress and pharmaceutical rep who would soon become the first woman dragged through the humiliation of a sex scandal during a presidential campaign.The caller said there were phone calls between Hart and Rice. Somehow, she knew they had been placed from phones in Georgia, Alabama and Kansas, and precisely when. She claimed that Hart had invited her friend to visit him in Washington, and her friend was going to stay with him that Friday night. \u201cMaybe you could fly to Washington and get the seat next to her,\u201d the anonymous caller suggested.For decades after that call, just about everyone close to the events of that week, and everyone who wrote about them later, assumed that the caller was Lynn Armandt, the friend Rice brought along on the Monkey Business during the cruise to Bimini. This was a logical deduction, because Armandt would later profit from selling photos she took on that trip. When I asked Fiedler about it last year, though, he told me that although he would continue to protect the identity of his source as he had for 26 years, he was willing to say flatly that it was not Armandt. Fiedler volunteered that he thought Rice knew who the tipster really was.When I spoke to Rice a few months later, during the first of two long conversations, she told me that she had never figured out with any certainty who set all of this in motion in 1987. But she had come to believe that Armandt was in cahoots with another friend of theirs in Miami \u2014 a woman named Dana Weems \u2014 who was on the boat for a party but didn\u2019t join them on the cruise to Bimini and thus escaped notice in contemporary accounts of the scandal. Rice had talked to Weems about her dalliance with Hart and showed her the photos from the cruise.Dana Weems wasn\u2019t especially hard to find, it turned out. A clothing designer who did some costume work on movies in the early 1990s, she sold funky raincoats and gowns on a website called Raincoatsetc.com, based in Hollywood, Fla. When she answered the phone after a couple of rings, I told her I was writing about Gary Hart and the events of 1987.\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said. There followed a long pause.\u201cDid you make that call to The Herald?\u201d I asked her.\u201cYeah,\u201d Weems said with a sigh. \u201cThat was me.\u201dWeems recalled going aboard Monkey Business on the last weekend of March for the same impromptu party at which Hart and his pal Billy Broadhurst, a Louisiana lawyer and lobbyist, met up with Rice, but in her version of events, Hart was hitting on her, not on Rice, and he was soused and pathetic, and she wanted nothing to do with him, but still he followed her around the boat, hopelessly enthralled. . . .But Donna \u2014 she had no standards, Weems told me. Weems figured Donna wanted to be the next Marilyn Monroe, sleeping her way into the inner sanctum of the White House, and that\u2019s why she agreed to go on the cruise to Bimini. After that weekend, Donna wouldn\u2019t shut up about Hart or give the pictures a rest. It all made Weems sick to her stomach, especially this idea of Hart\u2019s getting away with it and becoming president. \u201cWhat an idiot you are!\u201d Weems said, as if talking to Hart through the years. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna want to run the country? You moron!\u201dAnd so when Weems read Fiedler\u2019s story in The Herald, she decided to call him, while Armandt stood by, listening to every word. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was going to turn into this whole firecracker thing,\u201d she told me. It was Armandt\u2019s idea, Weems said, to try to get cash by selling the photos, and that\u2019s why she asked Fiedler if he might pay for them (though she couldn\u2019t actually remember much about that part of the conversation). Weems said she hadn\u2019t talked to either woman \u2014 Rice or Armandt \u2014 since shortly after the scandal. She lived alone and used a wheelchair because of multiple sclerosis. She was surprised her secret had lasted until now.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to ruin his life,\u201d she told me, offhandedly, near the end of our conversation. \u201cI was young. I didn\u2019t know it would be that way.\u201dOn Friday, the day when Hart was supposed to meet with Rice at his Capitol Hill townhouse, The Herald dispatched Jim McGee, its top investigative reporter, to Washington. McGee, who at 34 could fairly be called one of the finest investigative reporters in all of American journalism, spent the flight to Washington stalking his fellow passengers, walking up and down the aisle in search of women who looked as if they could plausibly be on their way to sleep with a presidential candidate. \u201cHe wondered how he would decide which woman to follow,\u201d The Herald\u2019s reporters later wrote, without a hint of realizing how creepy that sounded.On the ground in Washington, McGee caught a taxi to Hart\u2019s home and took up a position on a park bench that afforded a clear view of the front door. It was 9:30 p.m. when he saw Hart leave the townhouse with a \u201cstunning\u201d blonde he recognized from the ticket counter in Miami. Hart and the young woman promptly drove off, and McGee rushed to a pay phone across the street. He called his editors and Fiedler to ask for backup; the story was unfolding rapidly, and he needed more bodies to help with surveillance. McGee was still stationed on the street when, about two hours later, Hart and Rice returned from dinner and re-entered the townhouse. He never saw her leave and assumed she spent the night, although Hart\u2019s aides later said that Rice left through the rear door.Fiedler awoke Saturday morning and hopped the first flight to Washington. He brought with him McGee\u2019s editor, James Savage, and a photographer, Brian Smith. When you added in Doug Clifton, a reporter helping out the Washington bureau who had joined McGee for part of the stakeout Friday night, The Herald\u2019s undercover team now numbered five, along with at least two rental cars, on a block where maybe one or two residents could be spotted on the sidewalk at any given time in the afternoon. The odds of this kind of surveillance going undetected were not especially high.About 8:40 p.m. Saturday, Hart and Rice left the house and emerged into the adjacent alleyway, heading for the senator\u2019s car. The idea, apparently, had been to meet Broadhurst and Armandt for dinner. It was then that Hart noticed things were amiss. The first reporter he spotted in the side alley was McGee, a 200-pound man who for some reason had decided to make himself inconspicuous by donning sunglasses and a hooded parka. At night. In May.McGee, sensing he had been made, turned on his heels and ran, bumping into Fiedler, who, being the only reporter on the scene whom Hart actually knew from the campaign plane, had disguised himself in a tracksuit and was pretending to jog around every so often. \u201cHe\u2019s right behind me,\u201d McGee whispered urgently. Fiedler immediately changed direction and jogged across the street, like a disoriented sprinter.Hart decided, at first anyway, to hunker down and wait. He called Broadhurst, at whose nearby townhouse Rice and Armandt were supposed to be staying that weekend, and Broadhurst came over with Armandt and some barbecued chicken. After dinner, Hart instructed Broadhurst to gather up the women and leave via the back door. He would never see Donna Rice again.Like a character in one of the spy novels he loved to read and write, Hart decided to outwit his surveillants and flush them into the open. It\u2019s not clear how he thought this was going to end, other than badly, but a cornered man does not think clearly. Hart put on a white sweatshirt and pulled the hood up over his thick hair. At first, he got into his car and merged into Capitol Hill traffic. He expected to be followed, and he was \u2014 Smith, the photographer, was tailing close behind. Satisfied with this maneuver, Hart pulled over after a few blocks, emerged from the car and started walking back in the general direction of the townhouse. He detoured down a side street and walked twice around the block. Next Hart walked past the rental car in the front where McGee and Savage thought they were safely incognito.According to the writer Richard Ben Cramer, who chronicled these events in his classic campaign book, \u201cWhat It Takes,\u201d Hart made a show of writing down the license-plate number in full view of the two reporters; The Herald didn\u2019t mention this detail, but it did report that Hart seemed \u201cagitated\u201d and appeared to yell over his shoulder at someone on the other side of the street as he walked away. Probably both accounts are true. In any event, McGee and Savage deduced from Hart\u2019s behavior that their undercover stakeout had been compromised. They could not write an article without at least trying to get his response. So after quickly conferring, they exited the car, followed Hart\u2019s path back up the alley alongside his row of townhouses and turned a corner. McGee, according to The Herald account, \u201cflinched in surprise.\u201d There was Gary Hart, the presumed nominee of the Democratic Party, leaning against a brick wall in his hoodie. He was waiting for them.There were no press aides or handlers, no security agents or protocols to be followed. There was no precedent for any reporter accosting a presidential candidate outside his home, demanding the details of what he was doing inside it. It was just Hart and his accusers, or at least two of them for the moment, facing off in an oil-stained alley, all of them trying to find their footing on the suddenly shifting ground of American politics.The other fascinating thing about The Herald\u2019s reconstruction is that it captures, in agonizing detail, the very moment when the walls between the public and private lives of candidates, between politics and celebrity, came tumbling down forever. Even in the dispassionate tone of The Herald\u2019s narrative, you can hear how chaotic and combative it was, how charged with emotion and pounding hearts.\u201cGood evening, senator,\u201d McGee began, recovering from his shock at seeing Hart standing in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m a reporter from The Miami Herald. We\u2019d like to talk to you.\u201d As The Herald relayed it: \u201cHart said nothing. He held his arms around his midsection and leaned forward slightly with his back against the brick wall.\u201d McGee said they wanted to ask him about the young woman staying in his house.\u201cNo one is staying in my house,\u201d Hart replied.Hart may have surprised the reporters by choosing the time and place for their confrontation, but it\u2019s not as if they weren\u2019t ready. They had conferred on a list of questions intended to back Hart up against a wall \u2014 which was now literally the situation. McGee reminded Hart that he and the woman had walked right past McGee earlier that evening on the way to his car. \u201cYou passed me on the street,\u201d McGee said.\u201cI may or may not have,\u201d Hart replied.McGee asked him what his relationship was with the woman.\u201cI\u2019m not involved in any relationship,\u201d Hart said carefully.So why had they just seen Hart and the woman enter the townhouse together a few minutes earlier?\u201cThe obvious reason is I\u2019m being set up,\u201d Hart said, his voice quivering.McGee wanted to know if the woman was in Hart\u2019s house at that very moment. \u201cShe may or may not be,\u201d is how Hart answered, evading again. Savage then asked to meet her, and Hart said no.McGee offered to explain the situation, as if Hart had just woken up in a hospital or an asylum and might not have any idea what was happening. He said that the house had been under surveillance and that he had observed Hart with the woman the night before, in Hart\u2019s car. Where were they going?\u201cI was on my way to take her to a place where she was staying,\u201d Hart said, referring to Broadhurst\u2019s townhouse nearby.Savage cut in and asked how long Hart had known the woman \u2014 \u201cseveral months\u201d was the response \u2014 and what her name was.\u201cI would suppose you would find that out,\u201d Hart said.His voice was steadier now, and the reporters noticed that his composure had returned. As would happen several times throughout the ordeal of the next week, and for long afterward, Hart was lurching between conflicting instincts. There were moments when he thought that if he said just enough, if he issued enough of a denial to explain himself, then his tormentors would see the absurdity in what they were doing. But then he would grow defiant. The hell with them, he would think. They were not entitled to know.Fiedler made his way into the alley and joined his colleagues, making it three on one (or actually four on one, since Smith, the photographer, was there, too). Looking back years later, Fiedler would recall Hart\u2019s besieged posture, the way he leaned back defensively, as if expecting to be punched.As Fiedler watched, McGee hit Hart with questions about the phone calls he had made to Rice, which they knew about from the tipster (even though they still hadn\u2019t figured out her identity). Hart, whose suspicions about being set up must have now seemed well founded, didn\u2019t dare deny the calls, but he characterized them as \u201ccasual\u201d and \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201cgeneral conversation.\u201d Then Fiedler jumped in. He asked Hart if he had taken this woman on a yachting trip in Florida.\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d Hart said, dubiously. You can imagine the vertigo he must have been experiencing as the details of his private life, things he had not disclosed even to his closest aides, just kept coming, one after the other. It probably dawned on him, right about then, that he should never have been in the alley, any more than he should have been on the yacht.Fiedler reminded Hart that he had been at Red Rocks and had personally heard the speech. He quoted Hart\u2019s own words back to him, where Hart, alluding to the Iran-contra scandal rocking the Reagan administration, talked about running a campaign based on integrity and ethics and a higher standard. If that were so, Fiedler wanted to know, then why was Fiedler having to stand in this alley, at this moment, doing something so beneath him? He pleaded with Hart to be more forthcoming.\u201cI\u2019ve been very forthcoming,\u201d Hart said.When McGee pressed him again about the yacht and whether he was denying having met Rice there, Hart grew visibly irritated. \u201cI\u2019m not denying anything,\u201d he said. They were missing the point. He wasn\u2019t going to confirm or deny knowing Rice or having been on a chartered boat. Hart\u2019s stance was that none of it was anybody\u2019s business but his. When the reporters asked Hart to \u201cproduce\u201d the woman or this friend who was supposedly hosting her, Hart said other people had a right to privacy, too.\u201cI don\u2019t have to produce anyone,\u201d he told them.McGee pulled out his last question, the one you save for the moment when there is nothing to be lost by asking it. He put the question point-blank to Hart: Had the senator had sex with the woman in the townhouse?\u201cThe answer is no,\u201d Hart said, more definitively than he had answered other questions. As Hart walked away, shaken and alone, and started back up the alley, Smith, the photographer, started clicking away. Hart whirled around. This yielded the shots of him rumpled and recoiling, hiding in a hoodie like some perp who was about to have his head forcibly lowered into the back seat of a cruiser.\u201cWe don\u2019t need any of that,\u201d were Hart\u2019s parting words.Hart said this in an annoyed and sarcastic sort of way, in an obvious attempt to make a point. He was \u201cserious\u201d about the sentiment, all right, but only to the extent that a man who had been twice separated from his wife and dated other women over the years \u2014 with the full knowledge of his friends in the press corps and without having seen a single word written about it at the time \u2014 could have been serious about such a thing. Hart might as well have been suggesting that Martians beam down and run his campaign, for all the chance he thought there was that any reporter would actually resort to stalking him. Dionne certainly didn\u2019t take the comment literally, though he suspected others might. \u201cHe did not think of it as a challenge,\u201d Dionne would recall many years later. \u201cAnd at the time, I did not think of it as a challenge.\u201dAs it happened, Dionne\u2019s cover story was set to appear Sunday, May 3, the same day the Herald published its front-page expos\u00e9. No one at The Herald had a clue that Hart had issued any \u201cchallenge\u201d on the previous Monday when Fiedler heard from his anonymous tipster or when he continued to chase the story during the week. All of this they did on their own, without any prodding from Hart.In those days before the Internet, however, The Times circulated printed copies of its magazine to other news media a few days early, so editors and producers could pick out anything that might be newsworthy and publicize it in their own weekend editions or Sunday shows. When Fiedler boarded his flight to Washington Saturday morning, eager to join the stakeout, he brought with him the advance copy of Dionne\u2019s story, which had been sent to The Herald. Somewhere above the Atlantic seaboard, anyone sitting next to Fiedler would probably have seen him jolt upward in his seat as if suddenly receiving an electric shock. There it was, staring up at him from the page \u2014 Hart explicitly inviting him and his colleagues to do exactly the kind of surveillance they had undertaken the night before.The discovery of Hart\u2019s supposed challenge, which the Herald reporters took from the advance copy of The Times Magazine on Saturday night and inserted at the end of their Sunday blockbuster \u2014 so that the two articles, referring to the same quote, appeared on newsstands simultaneously \u2014 probably eased any reservations the editors in Miami might have had about pushing the story into print before they had a chance to identify Rice and try to talk to her. Soon enough, as The Herald would put it in their longer reconstruction a week later, Gary Hart would be seen as \u201cthe gifted hero who had taunted the press to \u2018follow me around.\u2019 \u201d Everyone would know that Hart had goaded the press into hiding outside his townhouse and tracking his movements. Hart\u2019s quote appeared to justify The Herald\u2019s extraordinary investigation, and that\u2019s all that mattered.The difference here is far more than a technicality. Even when insiders and historians recall the Hart episode now, they recall it the same way: Hart issued his infamous challenge to reporters, telling them to follow him around if they didn\u2019t believe him, and then The Herald took him up on it. Inexplicably, people believe, Hart set his own trap and then allowed himself to become ensnared in it. (When I spoke to Dana Weems, she repeatedly insisted to me that she had only called The Herald after reading Hart\u2019s \u201cfollow me around\u201d quote, which was obviously impossible.)And this version of events conveniently enabled The Herald\u2019s reporters and editors to completely sidestep some important and uncomfortable questions. As long as it was Hart, and not The Herald, who set the whole thing in motion, then it was he and not they who suddenly moved the boundaries between private and political lives. They never had to grapple with the complex issues of why Hart was subject to a kind of invasive, personal scrutiny no major candidate before him had endured, or to consider where that shift in the political culture had led us. Hart had, after all, given the media no choice in the matter.I had a chance to talk to Fiedler about this over lunch one day in the spring of 2013. We ate at a French restaurant near the campus of Boston University, where Fiedler, who went on to run The Herald before his retirement, was now installed as dean of the College of Communication.Fiedler explained to me that while he knew no political reporter had ever undertaken this kind of surveillance on a presidential candidate or written an article about a possible extramarital affair, he had never doubted that Hart\u2019s liaison with Rice, if it could be proved, was a legitimate story. Fielder\u2019s view \u2014 a view shared by a lot of his younger colleagues and informed, no doubt, by the lingering ghosts of Nixon \u2014 was that it wasn\u2019t a reporter\u2019s job to decide which aspects of a candidate\u2019s character were germane to the campaign and which weren\u2019t. It was the job of reporters to vet potential presidents by offering up as detailed a dossier about that person as they could assemble, and it was the voters\u2019 job to rule on relevance, one way or the other.Fiedler readily acknowledged that the order of events pertaining to the \u201cfollow me around\u201d quote had since become jumbled in the public mind, and his expression was genuinely regretful. He mostly blamed the way the TV news programs that weekend juxtaposed The Herald\u2019s reporting with the quote from The Times Magazine, as if one had led to the other. That had really been the beginning of the myth, he said, and from that time on, people were confused about which came first \u2014 \u201cfollow me around\u201d or The Herald investigation. When I asked why he had never tried to correct the record, Fiedler shrugged sadly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would need to do,\u201d he said.Then I mentioned to Fiedler that I had done a web search on his name recently and been sent to his biographical page on the B.U. website. And this is what it said: \u201cIn 1987, after presidential hopeful Gary Hart told journalists asking about marital infidelity to follow him around, Fiedler and other Herald reporters took him up on the challenge and exposed Hart\u2019s campaign-killing affair with a Miami model.\u201d Why did his own web page explicitly repeat something he knew to be untrue?Fiedler recoiled in his seat and winced. He looked mortified. \u201cYou know what?\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that. Honestly. I\u2019m serious.\u201d He stared at me for another beat, stunned. \u201cWow.\u201d I knew he meant it. I was surprised to find that for more than a year afterward \u2014 until just last month \u2014 Fiedler hadn\u2019t changed a word.Hart stumbled to answer and ultimately said he shouldn\u2019t have to. What he didn\u2019t know then was that Taylor\u2019s colleagues at The Post \u2014 acting at the direction of the paper\u2019s legendary editor and Watergate hero, Ben Bradlee \u2014 were already unearthing evidence of a relationship with another woman. By Thursday, Hart was back in Colorado, news helicopters buzzing over his house like something out of Vietnam, and his campaign was through.The most enduring image of that time, of course, is the infamous photo of Rice sitting on Hart\u2019s lap, which Armandt snapped on a crowded dock in Bimini during that overnight cruise and later sold to The National Enquirer. In it, Rice is wearing a short white dress; Hart is wearing a \u201cMonkey Business crew\u201d T-shirt, along with a startled, crooked grin. Most people who lived through the event, and some who covered it, will tell you that the photo is what provided irrefutable evidence of the affair and drove Hart from the race. But the photo didn\u2019t surface until nearly three weeks after Hart suspended his candidacy. It was a final indignity, to be sure, but it had nothing to do with his decision to quit.If Nixon\u2019s resignation created the character culture in American politics, then Hart\u2019s undoing marked the moment when political reporters ceased to care about almost anything else. By the 1990s, the cardinal objective of all political journalism had shifted from a focus on agendas to a focus on narrow notions of character, from illuminating worldviews to exposing falsehoods. If post-Hart political journalism had a motto, it would be: \u201cWe know you\u2019re a fraud somehow. Our job is to prove it.\u201dAs an industry, we aspired chiefly to show politicians for the impossibly flawed human beings they are: a single-minded pursuit that reduced complex careers to isolated transgressions. As the former senator Bob Kerrey, who has acknowledged participating in an atrocity as a Navy Seal in Vietnam, told me once, \u201cWe\u2019re not the worst thing we\u2019ve ever done in our lives, and there\u2019s a tendency to think that we are.\u201d That quote, I thought, should have been posted on the wall of every newsroom in the country, just to remind us that it was true.Predictably, politicians responded to all this with a determination to give us nothing that might aid in the hunt to expose them, even if it meant obscuring the convictions and contradictions that made them actual human beings. Each side retreated to its respective camp, where they strategized about how to outwit and outflank the other, occasionally to their own benefit but rarely to the voters\u2019. Maybe this made our media a sharper guardian of the public interest against liars and hypocrites. But it also made it hard for any thoughtful politician to offer arguments that might be considered nuanced or controversial. It drove a lot of potential candidates with complex ideas away from the process, and it made it easier for a lot of candidates who knew nothing about policy to breeze into national office, because there was no expectation that a candidate was going to say anything of substance anyway.A few years ago, during one of our many conversations in the upstairs, book-lined study in Hart\u2019s Colorado home, I asked him whether he ever felt a sense of relief at having not actually become president. This was what people said still \u2014 that he allowed himself to be caught because he was ambivalent about the job.\u201cIt was a huge disappointment,\u201d Hart said, shaking his head. \u201cA huge disappointment.\u201dLee Hart, to whom he has now been married for more than a half century, had entered the study and was refilling our water glasses, and she overheard him.\u201cThat\u2019s why he accepts every invitation where someone wants him to speak,\u201d she told me. \u201cEvery time he can make any kind of a contribution, he does it, because he thinks he\u2019s salving his conscience. Or salving his place after death or something.\u201d She appeared to try to stop herself from continuing, but couldn\u2019t quite do it. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very difficult.\u201d\u201cIs that why I give speeches?\u201d Hart said defensively.\u201cNo, no,\u201d Lee answered quickly. \u201cBut you do things when you\u2019re tired to the bone that you shouldn\u2019t be doing.\u201dI asked Hart what it was he might have to feel guilty about. It seemed we were veering close to the boundary beyond which he had always refused to travel.\u201cI don\u2019t feel guilty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with salving my conscience.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean your conscience,\u201d Lee said.I asked Lee what she had meant to say.\u201cGary feels guilty,\u201d Lee said finally. \u201cBecause he feels like he could have been a very good president.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it guilt,\u201d Hart said.\u201cNo. Well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not guilt, babe,\u201d he protested. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of obligation.\u201d\u201cYeah, O.K.,\u201d Lee said, sounding relieved. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Perfect.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be president to care about what you care about,\u201d Hart said.\u201cIt\u2019s what he could have done for this country that I think bothers him to this very day,\u201d Lee said.\u201cWell, at the very least, George W. Bush wouldn\u2019t have been president,\u201d Hart said ruefully. This sounded a little narcissistic, but it was, in fact, a hard premise to refute. Had Hart bested George H. W. Bush in 1988, as he was well on his way to doing, it\u2019s difficult to imagine that Bush\u2019s aimless eldest son would have somehow ascended from nowhere to become governor of Texas and then president within 12 years\u2019 time.\u201cAnd we wouldn\u2019t have invaded Iraq,\u201d Hart went on. \u201cAnd a lot of people would be alive who are dead.\u201d A brief silence surrounded us. Hart sighed loudly, as if literally deflating. \u201cYou have to live with that, you know?\u201dAn article on Sept. 21 about Gary Hart and the scandal that derailed his run for the presidency in 1987 misidentifed the military branch in which the former senator Bob Kerrey \u2014 another public figure touched by scandal \u2014 served when, in 1969, he participated in an operation in Vietnam that resulted in the deaths of civilians. He was a member of the Navy SEALs, not a soldier in the Army.An article on Sept. 21 about Gary Hart misidentified the location of the Capitol Hill townhouse where he lived in 1987. It is on Sixth Street SE, not Fifth Street. The article also misquoted Bill Clinton\u2019s response after he was accused of having an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky. He said, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d not \u201cI did not have sex with that woman.\u201dA cover article on Sept. 21 examined the effects of the Gary Hart-Donna Rice scandal on American politics. After the article was published, former journalists for The Miami Herald disputed one aspect of the chronology of the week they pursued the Gary Hart story: when Herald journalists first saw a New York Times article quoting Hart as saying, \u2018'Follow me around.'\u2019 In interviews before publication, the reporter Tom Fiedler confirmed seeing that article for the first time on Saturday, May 2, as he flew to Washington to join a stakeout of Hart\u2019s townhouse. But after publication, Fiedler recalled that he may actually have seen the Times article on Thursday or Friday. Jim McGee and James Savage, Fiedler\u2019s former colleagues at The Herald, recall that McGee became aware of the article on Friday, before McGee flew to Washington. Fiedler then showed the article to Savage on the plane on Saturday. Therefore, it is very likely that the original version of this article, based in large part on Fiedler\u2019s account, referred incorrectly to the point at which any of the Herald journalists first saw the Times article quoting Hart as saying, \u2018'Follow me around.'\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Not Genghis Khan\u2019s Mongolia", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNature in the BalanceULAN BATOR, Mongolia \u2014 For all of his victories and skills, Genghis Khan always insisted that the god Tengri \u2014 the Eternal Blue Sky \u2014 deserved the credit for his triumphant success in uniting the vast Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. Back-to-back years of plentiful rain and favorable temperatures \u2014 known as pluvials, the opposite of droughts \u2014 promoted vegetation growth, the researchers believe, and that in turn supported the livestock needed to power an army. \u201cThe Mongol Empire pluvial was quite exceptional in its duration,\u201d said Neil Pederson, an ecologist at Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts. \u201cIt was the only one in the past 1,000 years that lasted more than 10 years, so it\u2019s really a singular event.\u201d These days, Mongolia\u2019s climatic tides have been shifting toward another extreme. A 10-year drought and heat wave from 2000 to 2010, according to the tree ring data, was the most severe the country had had in a millennium. \u201cI\u2019m more and more convinced that the only way we can understand this 21st-century event is within the context of climate change,\u201d said Amy Hessl, a geographer at West Virginia University. \u201cAnd the human side of that \u2014 combined with a constellation of other factors \u2014 is going to be incredible.\u201dToday, Mongolia is largely herders, not warriors. Sandwiched between Russia and China, it has almost three million people in a vast tract of desert and rolling steppe grassland, punctuated by mountains and forests. Climate continues to significantly shape the lives of Genghis Khan\u2019s descendants, around one-third of whom still practice the seminomadic herding of their ancestors, moving their house \u2014 traditionally, a dome-shaped tent called a ger \u2014 with the seasons. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the weather has become unusual, but I\u2019m very worried about it,\u201d said Urgamaltsetsg Suvita, 47, a herder in the Gobi Desert. Summer is hotter and drier and plagued by sandstorms, she said, and winter brings too much snow or too little. In 2010, an extreme snowstorm killed her flock of livestock \u2014 nearly 1,000 animals, including horses, sheep and goats. \u201cWinter is no longer winter,\u201d she said. \u201cThe steppe ecosystem is burning and burning and burning,\u201d said Oyunsanaa Byambasuren, a lecturer in forestry at the National University of Mongolia. \u201cBut we really don\u2019t have enough specialists or professionals dealing with those issues.\u201d \u201cWealth in much of Mongolia is measured in animals,\u201d said Nicole Davi, a research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and at William Paterson University. \u201cIf you lose all of your animals, you lose everything.\u201d Ayush Ish, 69, has lived in the Gobi Desert all her life. She and her husband lost their flock of goats and sheep in the 2002 dzud and drought, then slowly rebuilt it with the help of 50 animals allocated by the government. But when the 2010 dzud struck, all but 20 died. Around the same time, her husband died as well. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it will happen again,\u201d she said, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cI can only hope that we\u2019re entering a good period now.\u201d Animal and plant species around the world may be threatened by warmer global temperatures.Like many rural Mongolians who follow a shamanistic belief system, Ms. Ish says that mining \u2014 which has recently become widespread around the country \u2014 is to blame for the changing weather patterns. Troy Sternberg, a geographer at the University of Oxford, said that \u201cunder the Mongolian belief system, the earth and sky are connected, so if you take gold out of the ground, you\u2019re disrupting the natural rhythms of weather and climate.\u201d Those who reach the capital usually settle in the ger district, a sprawling, makeshift neighborhood that encircles the city and creeps into the surrounding valleys. Although the skyscrapers of downtown are in eyesight, basic services are luxuries. Families must trek up to a mile to collect water from communal wells, and in winter, they burn coal and garbage to keep warm, helping to make Ulan Bator one of the world\u2019s most polluted cities. Khishigee Shuurai, 36, moved from western Mongolia to the capital around 15 years ago. In 2002, after losing their flock, her parents joined her in the city. Then her father died of a heart attack. Before that, she said, he frequently expressed a longing to return to the countryside. For many, however, life here is preferable to the uncertainty and harshness of nomadic herding. Ms. Shuurai, a school custodian and mother of four, does not share her father\u2019s regrets.She and her husband, a construction worker, have jobs, and they recently got electricity in their ger. Her 7-year-old daughter was honored as the top student in her class, and her 12-year-old son wants to become an engineer. \u201cThere\u2019s many reasons to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goodbye, Organization Man", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byImagine two cities. In City A, town leaders notice that every few weeks a house catches on fire. So they create a fire department \u2014 a group of professionals with prepositioned firefighting equipment and special expertise. In City B, town leaders don\u2019t create a fire department. When there\u2019s a fire, they hurriedly cobble together some people and equipment to fight it.We are City B. We are particularly slow to build institutions to combat long-running problems.The most obvious example is the fight against jihadism. We\u2019ve been facing Islamist terror for several decades, now, but every time it erupts \u2014 in Lebanon, Nigeria, Sudan, Syria and beyond \u2014 leaders start from scratch and build some new ad hoc coalition to fight it.The most egregious example is global health emergencies. Every few years, some significant epidemic strikes, and somebody suggests that we form a Medical Expeditionary Corps, a specialized organization that would help coordinate and execute the global response. Several years ago, then-Senator Bill Frist went so far as to prepare a bill proposing such a force. But, as always, nothing came of it.The result, right now, is unnecessary deaths from the Ebola virus in Africa. Ebola is a recurring problem, yet the world seems unprepared. The response has been slow and uncoordinated.The virus\u2019s spread, once linear, is now exponential. As Michael Gerson pointed out in The Washington Post, the normal countermeasures \u2014 isolation, contact tracing \u2014 are rendered increasingly irrelevant by the rate of increase. Treatment centers open and are immediately filled to twice capacity as people die on the streets outside. An Oxford University forecast warns as many as 15 more countries are vulnerable to outbreaks. The president of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, warned: \u201cAt this rate, we will never break the transmission chain, and the virus will overwhelm us.\u201dThe catastrophe extends beyond the disease. Economies are rocked as flights are canceled and outsiders flee. Ray Chambers, a philanthropist and U.N. special envoy focused on global health, points out the impact on health more broadly. For example, people in the early stages of malaria show similar symptoms to Ebola and other diseases. Many hesitate to seek treatment fearing they\u2019ll get sent to an Ebola isolation center. So death rates from malaria, pneumonia and other common diseases could rise, as further Ebola cases fail to be diagnosed.The World Health Organization has recently come out with an action plan but lacks logistical capabilities. President Obama asked for a strategy, but that was two months ago and the government is only now coming up with a strong comprehensive plan. Up until now, aid has been scattershot. The Pentagon opened a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia. The U.S. donated five ambulances to Sierra Leone. Coordination has just not been there.At root, this is a governance failure. The disease spreads fastest in places where the health care infrastructure is lacking or nonexistent. Liberia, for example, is being overrun while Ivory Coast has put in a series of policies to prevent an outbreak. The few doctors and nurses in the affected places have trouble acquiring the safety basics: gloves and body bags. More than 100, so far, have died fighting the outbreak.But it\u2019s not just a failure of governance in Africa. It\u2019s a failure of governance around the world. I wonder if we are looking at the results of a cultural shift.A few generations ago, people grew up in and were comfortable with big organizations \u2014 the army, corporations and agencies. They organized huge construction projects in the 1930s, gigantic industrial mobilization during World War II, highway construction and corporate growth during the 1950s. Institutional stewardship, the care and reform of big organizations, was more prestigious.Now nobody wants to be an Organization Man. We like start-ups, disrupters and rebels. Creativity is honored more than the administrative execution. Post-Internet, many people assume that big problems can be solved by swarms of small, loosely networked nonprofits and social entrepreneurs. Big hierarchical organizations are dinosaurs.The Ebola crisis is another example that shows that this is misguided. The big, stolid agencies \u2014 the health ministries, the infrastructure builders, the procurement agencies \u2014 are the bulwarks of the civil and global order. Public and nonprofit management, the stuff that gets derided as \u201coverhead,\u201d really matters. It\u2019s as important to attract talent to health ministries as it is to spend money on specific medicines.As recent books by Francis Fukuyama and Philip Howard have detailed, this is an era of general institutional decay. New, mobile institutions languish on the drawing board, while old ones are not reformed and tended. Executives at public agencies are robbed of discretionary power. Their hands are bound by court judgments and regulations.When the boring tasks of governance are not performed, infrastructures don\u2019t get built. Then, when epidemics strike, people die.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 Indonesia is saddled with endemic corruption, poverty and shoddy infrastructure. Yet its consumers are among the world\u2019s most optimistic, hopeful that a new government will lift the fortunes of the fourth-most-populous nation and put the economy on a par with emerging powerhouses like China and Brazil.Emblematic of Indonesians\u2019 optimism and the resulting urge to splurge are people like Johannes Komp, a 30-year-old entrepreneur who just started a family. Mr. Komp recently sat behind the wheel of a black Toyota S.U.V. in a showroom atop one of the luxury malls in Jakarta, preparing for a test drive.Business keeps rolling in for Mr. Komp\u2019s office building maintenance company, despite a general economic slowdown. The recent election to the presidency of Joko Widodo, the populist governor of Jakarta and a former businessman, is making Mr. Komp even more confident in the future and more willing to spend, he said. \u201cHe\u2019s creating excitement, just like Obama.\u201d Mr. Komp is more worried about driving on Jakarta\u2019s gridlocked roads than he is about dropping $35,000 or more on a new car.That kind of confidence is on display across the country. According to a global measure of consumer confidence by Nielsen, Indonesia is second in confidence only to India, which also has a new leader. About 84 percent of Indonesians surveyed said that they were confident about their personal finances, 76 percent said that they were confident about their job prospects and 57 percent said that they felt now was the time to buy expensive items. National data released this month by the central bank showed that consumer confidence rose in August, compared with July, when the presidential election was held.Indonesia is a country of 250 million people and, by one estimate, its numbers of middle class and wealthy consumers will nearly double to 135 million by 2020. When the departing Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, first took office in 2004, per capita annual income was about $1,100; by the time he leaves office in October, it could reach $4,500.Above and beyond election results, analysts say that rising income levels have given consumers more power to spend, in particular on trendy international brands that flood the market. Culturally, Indonesians are more likely to spend than save. In addition, the country\u2019s transition to democracy from authoritarian rule, beginning in 1999, has most Indonesians thinking their nation is on the right track.\u201cWhen they have more money, Indonesians buy luxury items whether they need them or not,\u201d said Miranda Natasya, 26, a marketing strategy adviser who recently purchased an iPhone even though she knew she would never use most of its apps. \u201cEveryone else bought it, so I did.\u201dWhether Mr. Joko succeeds in creating policies that translate into tangible economic change depends in large part upon his battle with corruption, the price of commodities and the whims of currency markets.After he takes office on Oct. 20, Mr. Joko faces a number of crucial medium-term challenges, including poverty, inadequate infrastructure and energy subsidies that cost the country tens of billions of dollars annually. Indonesia will also need to address issues in its labor and financial markets. And it will need to learn how to better ride the turbulence in the global economy, according to economists.Mr. Joko, whose rise from boyhood in an urban slum in Central Java Province to victory in Indonesia\u2019s presidential election on July 9 has made him a political phenomenon, has said that the widening gap between the country\u2019s rich and poor is one of its most pressing problems. Indonesia has about 100 million people living on $2 a day or less, and income levels for poor Indonesians are rising at a slower pace than for middle-class and affluent Indonesians.Mr. Joko has promised more \u201cpeople-centric\u201d government programs, including expansion of free public health care and increased funding for the education of Indonesia\u2019s poor. Those issues resonated with voters during the presidential campaign.He also promised to provide low-income families a monthly stipend of one million rupiah, or about $85, to establish a special bank to support farmers and to open up nearly 2.5 million acres of land for the agricultural sector, the country\u2019s biggest employer.Indonesian government spending on social assistance programs for poor and vulnerable households was only 0.7 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, compared with an average of 1.5 percent of G.D.P. among Latin American countries. Also last year, Indonesia spent only 0.9 percent of G.D.P. on health programs.\u201cTruly important challenges have arrived to this country,\u201d said Rodrigo Chaves, the Indonesia country director for the World Bank. \u201cWhether Indonesia can become rich before it becomes old should be on the minds of the new government and the public.\u201dDespite a decade-long official fight against corruption, Indonesia remains among the most corrupt countries in Asia, according to Transparency International. Graft is thought to reduce Indonesia\u2019s underlying or potential economic growth rate by two percentage points, the World Bank has estimated.On the economic front, commodities account for about 60 percent of Indonesian exports, but global prices have fallen, and the rupiah remains weak. The country also has a current-account deficit, meaning the value of imports outweighs that of exports, and inflation worries.Gita Wirjawan, who until recently served as Indonesia\u2019s trade minister, said that the country\u2019s economic growth during the last five years had been driven by strong commodities cycles and low interest rates. He said this would not recur anytime soon after Mr. Joko took office.He also said that as high as Indonesia\u2019s consumer confidence has been, it has nowhere to go but down.\u201cYou need to put some realism into the story of Jokowi,\u201d Mr. Gita said, referring to Mr. Joko by his popular nickname.Any problems that may lie ahead have failed to dent Indonesians\u2019 optimism and willingness to spend. Indonesians' love affair with consumerism was clearly on display recently at a luxury shopping mall in South Jakarta. The mall\u2019s management had erected billboards for shoppers to post personal visions for the future on brightly colored cards that had been available since before the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in July.\u201cThe target is to buy a house!\u201d one person wrote on a blue card. Another card, colored hot pink, read: \u201cI will make more money from home than I would from an office \u2013 hail entrepreneurialism!\u201dOn another billboard, a purple card screamed out: \u201cI\u2019m getting a BMW!\u201d\u201cOur economy is driven by consumers,\u201d said Muhammad Ikhwan Muslimin, the manager of a local securities firm, as he window-shopped at a car dealership. \u201cPeople buy, buy, buy.\u201dMuhammad Irfan, an executive with Bentley Indonesia, said that his company had sold 15 of the luxury vehicles in 2013 and was set to break that mark this year with the new Flying Spur, which sells at its showroom in Jakarta for 8.9 billion rupiah \u2014 or about $742,000.\u201cI\u2019ve very optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because the results of the presidential election will bring even more investors into Indonesia\u201dIn the end, Mr. Komp walked away from the Toyota S.U.V. in the Jakarta showroom. The reason: He wants the cash to hire more employees and expand his business.\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s there not to be optimistic about?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Gives Up Gains as Oil Slumps", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA slump in oil prices weighed on the stock market on Thursday, pushing the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to its third consecutive loss.Stocks started the day higher after the European Central Bank surprised investors by announcing that it had cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low and planned to buy asset-backed securities in an effort to stimulate Europe\u2019s ailing economy. Investors were also cheered by some encouraging reports on the American economy.The gains did not hold and the market fell back in afternoon trading as the falling price of oil pushed energy stocks lower. Traders may also have been reluctant to place big bets before the government\u2019s closely watched employment report on Friday.Stocks have started sluggishly in September \u2014 historically the worst month for the market \u2014 after surging in August. The S.&P. 500 gained 3.8 percent last month, climbing to a record high, without adjustment for inflation, as it logged its best performance since February.\u201cThe market did respond to the E.C.B. news this morning, and certainly to the good economic news, but there are definite signs that this market is stretched,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital.The S.&P. 500 index fell 3.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,997.65. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 8.70 points, to 17,069.58 points. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 10.28 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,562.29. Wall Street initially followed the eurozone stock markets in rallying after the European Central Bank\u2019s surprise announcement of a new stimulus program.In addition to lifting stocks, the announcement caused the euro to drop against the dollar to its lowest level in more than a year. Europe\u2019s single currency, which has been in retreat over the last few weeks on expectations of central bank stimulus measures, fell 1.5 percent, to $1.29 per euro.There was also encouraging news for stock investors on the American economy.American services firms expanded in August at the fastest pace on record, the Institute for Supply Management reported. Hiring is also picking up and American businesses added jobs at a healthy pace in August, according to a private survey. It was the fifth consecutive month of solid gains. On Friday, the government will report on August employment. Economists were projecting that employers added at least 220,000 jobs and that the unemployment rate dipped to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent.\u201cThe backdrop is looking pretty rosy for the U.S. economy, and we think that this could translate into corporate profits through stronger revenue,\u201d said David M. Lebovitz, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.Despite the encouraging signs, the stock market started giving up its gains in afternoon trading on Thursday, before ending the day with a small loss.Energy stocks were the biggest drag on the market, sagging to their biggest one-day loss in a month as the price of oil slumped. The S.&P. 500\u2019s energy sector dropped 1.3 percent, while crude oil for October delivery dropped $1.09, or 1.1 percent, to $94.45 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil prices fell after government data showed that American supplies declined less than expected last week. Among the stocks on the moves, PVH was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500. The company, which owns the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, surged $11.25, or 9.6 percent, to $128.30, after reporting earnings that exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations.In the bond market, interest rates increased.

At the end, I asked whether there were any questions or comments. No hands went up, so I went to sit down. My colleague whispered to me: \u201cI think there actually were some comments, Erin. Do you mind if I try?\u201d He asked the group again: \u201cAny comments or questions?\u201dStill, no one raised a hand, but this time he looked very carefully at each person in the silent audience. Gesturing to one of them, he said, \u201cDo you have something to add?\u201d To my amazement, she responded, \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d and asked me a very interesting question. My colleague repeated this several times, looking directly at the audience members and asking for more questions or comments. After the session, I asked my colleague: \u201cHow did you know that those people had questions?\u201d He hesitated, not sure how to explain it, and then said, \u201cIt has to do with how bright their eyes are.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn Japan, we don\u2019t make as much direct eye contact as you do in the West. So when you asked if there were any comments, most people were not looking directly at you. But a few people in the group were looking right at you, and their eyes were bright. That indicates that they would be happy to have you call on them.\u201dI thought to myself, \u201cNow that\u2019s not something I would ever have learned from my upbringing in Minnesota.\u201dThe next day, after a similar presentation, I again asked for questions and comments, and again no one raised a hand. So I decided to follow my colleague\u2019s lead. I looked carefully at all the faces, and I saw that a few people were indeed looking directly at me and that, yes, if I paused to notice, their eyes were bright. I stepped gently toward one of them and gestured toward her, to which she responded by giving a slight nod of the head. \u201cWould you like to share a comment or ask a question?\u201d I asked. She said, \u201cYes, thank you,\u201d and asked an insightful question.After the trip I returned to Insead, where the students in my executive courses are managers from all over the world. As I scanned the classroom, I felt both embarrassed and unsettled to see that I had been missing a lot of bright eyes in my classroom.In Japan, there is an expression popular with young people: \u201ckuuki yomenai.\u201d Often shortened to \u201cK.Y.,\u201d it refers to someone who is unable to read the atmosphere. On my trip to Japan, I learned just how K.Y. I was. But I also was reminded that, with a little curiosity and some helpful coaching, even I could improve my ability to read the Japanese atmosphere.In today\u2019s global economy, you might be an American giving a presentation in Japan, an Italian negotiating a deal in Nigeria or a German managing a team of Brazilians. You can do your business by email or over the telephone, or you can get on a plane. That\u2019s the easy part; the hard part is figuring out how to conduct yourself in another culture. And a particular challenge arises when you are managing a multicultural team.As an American working in France, I was initially surprised to hear Americans complain that their French teammates were chaotic, disorganized and always late. Some Indian colleagues, on the other hand were frustrated about those very same people being rigid and unadaptable. And while Americans are continually tripped up by what they see as a hierarchical French system, one Chinese manager told me recently, \u201cWorking with the French is amazing because they really believe everyone is equal, from the secretary to the chairman.\u201dIf you interact with other cultures, it\u2019s possible to tease out these differences. I map cultures on eight behavioral dimensions: communicating, evaluating, persuading, leading, deciding, trusting, disagreeing and scheduling. For example, the French culture falls between the American and Indian culture on the scheduling dimension \u2014 hence the opposite impressions about chaos versus rigidity.If you find yourself leading a multicultural team, you need to find the flexibility to work up and down these dimensions. This means watching what makes local managers successful. It means explaining your own style often. It may even mean learning to laugh at yourself. Ultimately, it means learning to lead in different ways.I try to remember that my own cultural biases continually affect my perceptions. That way, I can focus on understanding behavior in other cultures I encounter, and keep finding the bright eyes in the room. Advertisement"}

Less than a year into his presidency, he joined an elite group: Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama. And for what? As near as anybody could tell, it was the only Nobel ever given for future good intentions.Now the president with the world\u2019s most prestigious badge of nonviolence is forced to become the warrior again, killing religious extremists as he bombs his seventh Muslim country \u2014 one more, as Stephen Colbert noted with a rewards punch card, and he\u2019s earned a free falafel.But look ahead, with optimism, and you can see a design for long-term peace behind the president\u2019s plan to simultaneously kill fanatics and force a religion to confront the sources of that fanaticism. With his blunt speech at the United Nations on Wednesday, Obama put on notice the Sunni Muslim nations that have allowed Sunni barbarians to spread.He made it clear that it is a warped religious ideology \u2014 \u201cthe cancer of violent extremism\u201d \u2014 that is behind the slaughtering of innocents, raping of young girls, beheading of aid workers and tourists. Yes, it was a lecture, with finger-pointing. It\u2019s time for the duplicitous Saudis, the look-the-other-way Qataris, \u201cthose who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down,\u201d to stop trying to have it both ways. He called out their \u201chypocrisy,\u201d without naming names, because everyone knows who they are.Sure, it\u2019s just a speech. Words, following and preceding airstrikes. But as a speech, it was a stunning departure from the usual platitudes without a plan. The leader who didn\u2019t have a strategy for dealing with Islamic State nihilists a few weeks ago just dropped an idea bomb on the rest of the world. The \u201cMuslim\u201d president \u2014 a falsehood still held by nearly 25 percent of Republican voters \u2014 gave the Muslim world a blueprint for saving itself.Until this week, most Western leaders have been afraid to say what Obama said at the United Nations. Sunnis dominate Islam, a religion of 1.6 billion people. The worst terror in the world today is being waged on behalf of a small, violent cult of death that is nominally Sunni. By enlisting at least five Sunni-majority nations in his campaign against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, Obama has taken the first step to get Islam to do what it must do. (It would help to have Turkey, the only Muslim nation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and a Sunni-majority country, fully aboard with the 50 countries in the campaign to quash ISIS.)\u201cNo god condones this terror,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNo grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning \u2014 no negotiation \u2014 with this brand of evil.\u201d There again, his language was unvarnished, without filter or diplomatic dither.Many in Obama\u2019s own party heard only the echoes of George W. Bush. \u201cEvil-doers,\u201d coming from Bush, was a punch line. Cue up Will Ferrell and Jon Stewart. O.K., parallels granted. But Bush\u2019s war in Iraq was nation-toppling born of hubris, followed by nation-building born of ignorance. Obama\u2019s direct action against ISIS is designed to keep entire communities of \u201cinfidels\u201d from being slaughtered by a cult under a black flag. His actions will save Muslims, the primary victims of Middle East terrorism, from other Muslims. It\u2019s also in America\u2019s interest, for those isolationists who think we should never try to stop overseas massacres on our watch.Obama, the peace prize winner, is the only person who could rally the civilized world against a caliphate of violence. Who else would do it? The pathetic, hapless and corrupt Iraqi Army, built with American tax dollars? The United Nations? The Kurds? They will fight, but only for their interests and their territory.The military campaign, as always, is the easy part, and fraught with careful-what-you-wish-for peril. War crimes trials, the sooner the better, for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and any name that can be clearly linked to a face behind the mask of an ISIS executioner should proceed with the support of the coalition Obama has put together.But to earn his Nobel, Obama has to follow through till the end of his presidency, to pressure the Sunnis to police their own. This is their cancer, now spreading to the rest of the world. No need to make it bigger than it is. The absurdly alarmist voices in our country \u2014 Lindsey Graham, with his fear that we\u2019re going to \u201call get killed back here at home,\u201d and the senate candidate Scott Brown, who said \u201cradical Islamic terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country\u201d \u2014 are myopics, staring out at the world from holes in the blankets over their heads.More succinctly, as Obama stated, this fight is about what happens when religion goes bad. \u201cThere should be no tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because they\u2019re Jewish, or because they\u2019re Christian, or because they\u2019re Muslim,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source, and that is the corruption of young minds by violent ideology.\u201dOf course it\u2019s a long shot. Of course it\u2019s a pipe dream. Of course it goes against all the backward trends in the Islamic world. But in one of the best speeches of his presidency, Obama has shown the world a path to a peace that may outlast him.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described Turkey\u2019s religious makeup. A majority of its people are Sunnis, not Shiites.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Defying Unions, Democrat Gina M. Raimondo Vies to Become Rhode Island\u2019s First Female Governor", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 As a high school senior in the late 1980s, Gina M. Raimondo was thrilled to learn she had been accepted at Harvard, but she was also daunted.\u201cHarvard was scary,\u201d Ms. Raimondo, 43, the state treasurer of Rhode Island, recalled thinking. Her father had lost his job at the Bulova watch factory here after 26 years, but her mother told her that if she wanted to attend, the family would scrape together the money. It meant working extra jobs and forgoing vacations, but she and her family made the sacrifices to give her that opportunity. And she graduated as the top economics student in her class.\u201cThat was a big deal for me, to realize that I was as good and as smart as anybody else, and it didn\u2019t matter if I didn\u2019t have everything they had,\u201d she said. It was an important realization for Ms. Raimondo, who won a primary on Tuesday to be the Democratic nominee for governor of Rhode Island. That belief, that everyone should have a chance, helped define her, she said, and would shape her priorities if she becomes governor. \u201cIf you have the talent, you should have the opportunity,\u201d she said.In interviews over the last week, Ms. Raimondo reflected on her career, her plans if elected governor and the challenges women face in running to be chief executive. As she talked outside an ice-cream parlor, her daughter, Ceci, 10, and son, Tommy, 7, raced around and played games with their father nearby. After graduation from Harvard in 1993, Ms. Raimondo won a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Oxford, where she met her future husband, Andy Moffit. She earned a law degree at Yale, then started Rhode Island\u2019s first venture capital firm.A newspaper article in 2009 sparked her interest in politics. It said the state\u2019s growing fiscal crisis could mean cuts for libraries. Her paternal grandfather, who had arrived from Italy at the age of 14, had learned English by studying in the Providence Public Library. Outraged, Ms. Raimondo decided to run for state treasurer.Growing up in a Democratic household, she believed in activist government. (Her father had gone to college on the G.I. Bill.) She also thought pension benefits needed to be curbed to save other government services, not to mention the pension system itself.She won in a landslide. The next year, she drew national attention for stepping out ahead of other states and leading Rhode Island through a painful pension restructuring. She orchestrated enough support among the public and the Democratic-controlled legislature to push through drastic changes, like raising the retirement age to 67 from 62 and suspending cost-of-living increases until the system improved. This triggered a ferocious backlash from the state\u2019s public employee unions, which campaigned hard against her in Tuesday\u2019s primary. \u201cIf I did a litmus test with her, I\u2019m not sure she\u2019d pass the test so that I could say, \u2018Yup, she\u2019s a Democrat,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Philip Keefe, president of Service Employees International Union Local 580. \u201cSome of her projects, especially what she did with the pension, were more business-friendly and less middle-class-friendly than is my cup of tea.\u201dBut the public unions were split between two other primary candidates. And Ms. Raimondo, who was backed by the building trades, spent $5 million on television ads and get-out-the-vote efforts, much more than her opponents. She won 42 percent of the vote, about 10 points higher than had been forecast. In November, she will face Allan W. Fung, the mayor of Cranston, who won the Republican nomination.\u201cThis is one of the most convincing examples where taking on the unions did not prove fatal to a Democrat,\u201d said Darrell M. West, a former professor at Brown University here and now an analyst at the Brookings Institution. But there remains tremendous animosity toward Ms. Raimondo from the public unions. How \u2014 and whether \u2014 she comes to terms with them will likely prove a recurring theme in a Raimondo administration. If she is elected, her first months in office will be dominated by labor\u2019s sweeping legal challenge to her pension plan.As central as the pension issue is to her candidacy, she said she believed she had won the primary because she focused on her plan for creating jobs and revitalizing the lagging Rhode Island economy. She said she would keep that same focus through the fall. But she said she might need to make the link more concrete between the sacrifices she asked for in cutting pensions and what those sacrifices can yield.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I ever effectively communicated that in pension reform,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have well-funded and flourishing public schools and public buses and an underfunded pension system. It\u2019s just not possible. So by asking people to go without a cost-of-living increase in retirement, then you can have better bus service, good streets, safe parks, Head Start and universal pre-K.\u201dOne of her goals is to reinvent Rhode Island as a center for industrial design. She wants to invest in other state assets, like the marine technology, food science and tourism industries.Along the way, she wants to rid the state of what she calls its \u201cI know a guy\u201d culture, in which insiders get special deals for their friends. \u201cHistorically, we haven\u2019t been kind to outsiders or change agents,\u201d she said.That includes women. Rhode Island has never had a female governor. Gov. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, the nation\u2019s only female Democratic governor, said in an interview that Ms. Raimondo was already serving in an executive capacity as state treasurer. That, she said, was the best antidote to any fears about female executives.\u201cThe more women serve in executive office, the more confidence they gain in themselves, and that voters gain in them,\u201d Ms. Hassan said.Polls showed Ms. Raimondo initially lagged among women voters, but their support increased after she ran ads that included her family.She said the family ads had shown a more complete picture of her. \u201cI am a mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWith kids in the public schools. People should know that. I\u2019m not just some policy maker who\u2019s totally detached from the rest of the community.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paralysis Isn\u2019t Inevitable ", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the hardest things for us to do is to envision a future that is different from the present. For instance, we live in an age of paralyzed politics, so it is hard, in the here and now, to imagine what could change that. A second example: It is difficult to think of a scenario where federal gun legislation could be passed over the objections of the National Rifle Association. And a third: Income inequality has been the trend for some three decades; doesn\u2019t it look as if it will always be that way?What prompts these thoughts are two papers that landed on my desk recently. Although they tackle very different issues, they have one thing in common: They imagine a future that breaks from the present path. Webster\u2019s speech lays out an agenda that he predicts will reduce the murder rate by 30 to 50 percent within 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t think that our current level of gun violence is here to stay,\u201d he declares in the draft of the speech. Martin\u2019s article is about how the rise of the \u201ctalent economy,\u201d as he calls it, has helped further income inequality. But he doesn\u2019t believe a high level of income inequality is an inevitable part of our future. Let\u2019s tackle Webster first. Politically, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s a loser to call for a gun ban.\u201d Instead, his reforms would make it more difficult for criminals to get their hands on guns. Using background checks, he would keep guns away from people who have a history of violence. He would raise the age of gun ownership to 21. (Webster notes that homicides peak between the ages of 18 and 20.) He would pass laws that make gun dealers more accountable, including \u201crequiring business practices that prevent guns being diverted to criminals.\u201d And he would mandate something called microstamping, \u201cwhich would make it possible to trace a gun used in a crime to its first purchaser.\u201dWhen I asked him why he thought these changes would eventually take place, given the inability of the Senate to pass a background check bill after Newtown, he pointed to polls that show the vast majority of gun owners favor such changes. \u201cThe N.R.A. has been very successful in controlling the conversation and making it about a cultural war,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut I believe that narrative won\u2019t persist.\u201d The key, he says, is to change the conversation so that it is about pro- and anti-crime instead of pro- and anti-gun. Once that happens, \u201cgun owners will start to demand changes.\u201d He added, \u201cI think that ultimately that idea will prevail, and it will be a pretty mainstream idea.\u201dNow to Roger Martin. His essay traces the way \u201ctalent\u201d came to replace labor and capital as the most important factor in the economy, so much so that those who were part of the talent economy could become billionaires even as the median income stalled and then slipped back. Chief executives, who have gorged on stock options, are part of the talent economy, and so are hedge fund managers, who charge the infamous \u201c2 and 20\u201d (meaning a 2 percent management fee and 20 percent of the profits), which ensures their wealth no matter how poorly their investors do. The interests of such talent, in his view, simply don\u2019t align with the interests of the rest of us.Like Webster, Martin also proposed a series of changes to \u201ccorrect the imbalance,\u201d as he puts it. He suggests that pension funds should see that they are best served when they do not hand capital to hedge funds, for instance. And he wants talent to show \u201cself-restraint.\u201dWhen I told him that seemed unlikely, he told me he thought we were approaching a moment like 1935, when, after years of letting labor fend for itself, the government passed laws that protected labor and helped bring about the rise of the labor movement. If talent doesn\u2019t start taking the rest of the country into account, he said, he feared that the government would once again take significant action to level the playing field. Given the current political paralysis, I asked, what might bring that about? \u201cAnother boom and crash,\u201d he said.Martin clearly sees his article as a warning to corporate executives and others who are part of the 1 percent. And maybe, just maybe, it will take hold. After all, not long after his article was published, Calpers, the huge California pension fund, announced that it was going to eliminate hedge funds from its portfolio. There\u2019s hope yet.

{"Headline": "Where Prices Don\u2019t Want to Rise", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsEUROPE has an inflation problem. Prices are not rising fast enough.In announcing new efforts to stimulate economies in the eurozone, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, spoke this week of \u201cthe worsening of the medium-term inflation outlook,\u201d adding that numerous indicators indicated falling prices.As can be seen in the accompanying charts, consumer prices in Germany rose only 0.8 percent over the most recent 12 months, well below the central bank\u2019s target rate of 2 percent. But that tiny increase was nonetheless the largest of any in the four largest countries in the eurozone. French prices rose 0.6 percent, while Italian prices were unchanged and Spanish prices declined 0.4 percent.Two years ago, Germany\u2019s inflation rate was 1.9 percent, lower than any of the other three nations\u2019.A major cause of the economic malaise in many eurozone countries is that labor costs rose much more rapidly than they did in Germany during the years after the euro was created in 1999. That hurt the ability of those countries to compete for export business, while helping German business.From 2000 through early 2008, unit labor costs in France rose 17.4 percent, and by more in Italy and Spain. But in Germany, those costs fell.Since then, unit wage costs have been rising in Germany, but those in France and Italy have risen nearly as much. Only in Spain have unit labor costs declined since early 2008 \u2014 and it took a severe recession to accomplish that.The adult unemployment rate in Spain has been over 20 percent for nearly three years, and the rate for younger workers \u2014 those who are 24 or younger \u2014 has been above 50 percent for two years. In Italy, unemployment has not been quite that high \u2014 the latest figures are 10.4 percent for adults and 42.9 percent for younger workers \u2014 but Italy\u2019s economy is still shrinking, while Spain\u2019s has been growing for a year. The Italian economy, adjusted for inflation, is now smaller than it was in 2003.Had Germany had its own currency for the last 14 years, it would now no doubt have risen against other European currencies, and it would be significantly stronger relative to the United States dollar than the euro is now. That has done wonders for the German economy, where unemployment rates have been falling for years, even as those in its neighbors rose.\u201cBecause Germany through 2000 to 2007 had an inflation rate below that in France and Italy, it now has to have an inflation rate above these countries,\u201d said Simon Wren-Lewis, an economist at Oxford University in Britain. \u201cIf E.C.B. monetary policy was working, Germany would get no choice in this, because it is part of what they signed up to when joining the euro.\u201dNow, even the German economy is beginning to show some strain. Its gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, according to official estimates. The French economy also declined. Mr. Draghi, the president of the central bank, said this week that declining growth prospects for the eurozone were a major reason that more aggressive actions by the bank were needed. Earlier efforts by the central bank to stimulate bank lending do not appear to have worked, so the European Central Bank will now buy securities backed by bank loans in the hope that will get money out to companies that will spend and invest.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Veiled Criticism for France as Ministers Stress Eurozone Stability", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 The rule book for the stability of the euro came under strain Friday at a meeting of finance ministers after France warned this past week that it would miss its deficit target again.Hanging over the meeting here was the prospect of a heavy fine for France, which made its announcement on Wednesday.There was thinly veiled criticism of France as senior European Union finance officials stressed the importance of abiding by the rules, created to underpin, and highlighted sacrifices that other countries had made to get their finances in order.The disciplinary rules were recently reinforced as part of efforts to prevent a recurrence of the European sovereign debt crisis.While there was no direct censure of France at the meeting, that may only underscore the delicacy of conditions in the country, the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy after Germany. France\u2019s president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is highly unpopular, giving him little latitude to implement fiscal reforms.Referring to the eurozone\u2019s Stability and Growth Pact, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told a news conference, that the rules \u201cshould not be unraveled, and we should remember that the S.G.P. has acted as an anchor of confidence.\u201dThe statement amounted to an implicit warning that France could face higher debt-funding costs unless it tamed its finances.\u201cWe didn\u2019t specifically discuss the French budget, which we don\u2019t yet have,\u201d Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the so-called Eurogroup of finance ministers of countries that use the euro, said at the news conference, referring to the French budget for 2015.But Mr. Dijsselbloem, who is also the Dutch finance minister, added, \u201cA lot of work has been done, particularly by those countries who were hit hardest by the crisis.\u201dJyrki Katainen, a former Finnish prime minister who serves as the European Union\u2019s commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said that countries seeking to win more leeway to meet the pact\u2019s targets could not simply claim to be victims of a broader economic downturn. There must be \u201cimplementation of effective action to correct excessive deficits,\u201d Mr. Katainen told the news conference.The Stability and Growth Pact requires European Union members to keep their deficits under 3 percent of gross domestic product and public debt at no more than 60 percent of G.D.P. Even before the euro was introduced, fiscal rules were adopted, including fines to punish countries that overspent or otherwise jeopardized the ability of disparate economies to run on a single currency.But soon even larger countries like Germany, which was among those demanding the rules in the first place, flouted the pact when it suited them. The strongest sanction called for in the pact \u2014 a fine of up to 0.2 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 has never been imposed because of a lack of political will.Since then, the pact has been reinforced by making it harder for national governments to block any recommendation by the European Commission to impose fines.The commission granted France a one-year extension on its deficit target in 2009 and a two-year extension in 2013.The next stage is for the commission to assess the French budget for 2015, which the government in Paris must submit for scrutiny by Oct. 15. But France still would have plenty of scope to avoid a fine.Even if the commission concludes by the end of October that the French remain out of compliance, it would give Paris time to submit a revised budget, and could even grant further extensions before ultimately recommending a fine.The finance officials\u2019 meeting in Milan was hosted by the government of Italy, the country now managing European ministerial gatherings under a system that hands that responsibility to each of the 28 member states for six-month periods. But that did not stop Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, from bluntly pushing back against any idea of crimping his spending plans.The meeting continues on Saturday, when finance ministers from all 28 member states of the European Union are to discuss proposals to salvage the region\u2019s economic recovery, including a plan, backed by the incoming president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, to harness 300 billion euros, or $388 billion, in investment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Lays Out Proposal to End Ukraine Conflict", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 On the eve of a NATO summit meeting focused on Russian aggression, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia unveiled on Wednesday a seven-point peace plan for Ukraine while President Obama and other Western leaders tried to keep the spotlight on the Kremlin\u2019s role in stoking the conflict there and the penalties it should suffer for doing so.Never at a loss for theatrical flair, Mr. Putin announced the plan soon after arriving on a state visit to Mongolia, brandishing a notebook page on which the first point was that both sides \u201cend active offensive operations.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s peace plan, jotted out during a plane ride over Siberia, muddied the diplomatic waters, leaving the West an excuse for delaying punitive sanctions that would also hurt European economies on the verge of a new recession. And it was expected to have some appeal to war-weary Ukrainians.The ultimate effect, coming after Russian troops intervened in Ukraine last week to beat back a successful government offensive, may be to leave the country as a loose coalition that Moscow could still dominate, which critics of the Russian president say is his real aim.NATO leaders, including Mr. Obama, are to meet in Newport, Wales, on Thursday to discuss bolstering the alliance, including a new rapid deployment force intended to respond to future Russian military threats and a reaffirmation of its commitment to its smaller members. In addition, European leaders are contemplating a fourth, harsher round of sanctions against Russia.Mr. Putin\u2019s plan seemed to raise more questions than it answered. First, there was no mechanism for implementation. Second, just hours earlier, his own spokesman had repeated the Russian position, widely criticized as implausible, that Moscow could not negotiate a cease-fire because it was not a direct party to the conflict.Analysts suggested that Mr. Putin\u2019s strategy is to convince Kiev that it must negotiate, not fight, and to reinforce the idea that the overall outcome depended on Moscow.\u201cRussia wants to show that it is in command of what is happening,\u201d said Fyodor Lukyanov, editor of a prominent Russian foreign policy journal. \u201cFor Russia, it is important first to prevent the Ukrainians from thinking that they could win militarily, and to accept the separatist leaders as partners in negotiations.\u201dThe details of the peace deal were sketchy at best, entangled in complicated diplomacy and domestic politics. But it was clear from various, somewhat confused and contradictory statements that Mr. Putin and the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, had held an extensive discussion on the issue by telephone early Wednesday.At first, Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office issued a vague announcement that the two leaders had agreed to a \u201clasting cease-fire.\u201d The statement was diluted later to say only that both leaders had endorsed the need for a cease-fire and that Mr. Poroshenko hoped negotiations would begin in earnest on Friday. Mr. Putin said his notes had emerged from the telephone conversation.In announcing the plan, Mr. Putin said he expected Ukraine and the separatists to wrap up an agreement after a new round of negotiations in Minsk, Belarus, on Friday. Ukraine, Russia and Europe are all party to the talks there, and they include representatives of the separatists. The two-day NATO summit meeting is also scheduled to end Friday.Aside from the cease-fire, the plan laid out by Mr. Putin called for Ukrainian artillery to pull back and out of range of the eastern separatists\u2019 strongholds; an end to airstrikes; an exchange of all detainees; opening up humanitarian corridors for residents of the separatist areas; repairing damaged infrastructure; and deploying international observers to monitor the cease-fire.It made no mention of autonomy for the separatist eastern regions, the central political demand that Russia has emphasized since March. That is widely seen as critical to the Kremlin\u2019s long-term goal of maintaining influence over Ukraine\u2019s domestic affairs and blocking any future attempt to join NATO.A previous cease-fire collapsed after 10 days in June, and a long line of critics starting with Mr. Obama gave little hope that this plan might succeed.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a lot of follow-up on so-called announced cease-fires,\u201d Mr. Obama told a news conference in Estonia. \u201cHaving said that, if in fact Russia is prepared to stop financing, arming, training \u2014 in many cases joining with Russian troops \u2014 activities in Ukraine and is serious about a political settlement, that is something we all hope for.\u201dMr. Obama devoted his main speech in Estonia to a scathing attack on Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine. \u201cIt is a brazen assault on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, a sovereign and independent European nation,\u201d he said in the speech to more than 1,800 students, young professionals, and civic and political leaders at a concert hall. \u201cIt challenges that most basic of principles of our international system: that borders cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun, that nations have the right to determine their own future.\u201dPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France, in a statement about the delayed delivery of the warship to Russia, said he had decided that, despite the prospects of a possible cease-fire in Ukraine, \u201cthe conditions for France to deliver the first warship are not to date in place.\u201d The decision was one of the most concrete indications yet of the willingness of Western governments to become more assertive in confronting Russia, despite concerns that the European economy could be further hurt.France had agreed in 2011 to a $1.6 billion deal to build two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships for the Russian Navy and to train the Russians in operating them. The warships are designed to carry up to 30 helicopters, 60 armored vehicles, 13 tanks and 700 soldiers.In June, more than 400 Russian sailors arrived in Saint-Nazaire, a shipbuilding city on the Atlantic coast southwest of Paris, to begin training on the first of the two ships.Russia sought to play down the significance of the delay. \u201cThe Defense Ministry doesn\u2019t see any tragedy in this, though, of course, it is unpleasant and lays certain tension on our cooperation with the French partners,\u201d the deputy defense minister, Yuri Borisov, was quoted as saying by Russia\u2019s state-run news agency, Itar-Tass. In Kiev, the idea of a cease-fire was received with mixed emotions.There is open hostility to the idea that Russia will be able to dictate terms to its weaker neighbor after already wrenching away the Crimean peninsula in March. Any compromise after months of condemning the separatists as \u201cterrorists\u201d risks weakening Mr. Poroshenko in central and western Ukraine.Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk called Mr. Putin\u2019s proposal \u201can attempt to confuse the international community\u201d before the NATO summit meeting and the expected announcement of new sanctions from the European Union.\u201cPutin\u2019s real plan is the destruction of Ukraine and the resumption of the U.S.S.R.,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said, according to a statement posted on a government website. Peace will come only once Russia withdraws its troops and proxy force, it said.But many Ukrainians, horrified by the mounting toll of more than 2,600 dead and uneasy about the economic costs for a country already on the edge of bankruptcy, want an end to the violence. Winter is approaching, and the other confrontation with Russia, over gas sales, seems unlikely to be resolved while fighting rages in the east.\u201cWe are in a situation where any kind of cease-fire would be progress,\u201d said Olexander Scherba, an ambassador at large in the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. \u201cLast week was devastating after Russia started this open invasion of Ukraine.\u201dRussia has repeatedly denied sending troops or arms to Ukraine, but last week, separatist forces opened a new front along the coast and broke the Ukrainian forces\u2019 siege of the separatist centers of Donetsk and Luhansk.There is a long road ahead before any real settlement can be reached, analysts noted. Moscow does not fully control the separatists; nor is it clear that Kiev can automatically rein in the armed militias it has unleashed alongside its military in the east.Vladislav Brig, a senior official in the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, said by telephone that the rebels expected Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the entire region as a condition for peace. \u201cThe negotiating side here is not Russia; it is the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will stop the offensive when Ukrainian troops leave our territory.\u201dUkraine has said repeatedly that it will not contemplate a full withdrawal from the Donbass region. \u201cIt depends on Russia,\u201d Mr. Scherba said. \u201cRussia is the one that started this and can bring it to an end.\u201dBecause of editing errors, an earlier version of this article misstated the day that several events occurred.

{"Headline": "Boom in Energy Spurs Industry in the Rust Belt", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by10 PhotosYOUNGSTOWN, Ohio \u2014 Waist-high weeds and a crumbling old Chevy mark the entrance to a rust-colored factory complex on the edge of town here, seemingly another monument to the passing of the golden age of American industry.But deep inside the 14-acre site, the thwack-thwack-thwack sound of metal on metal tells a different story.\u201cWe\u2019re holding our own,\u201d said Greg Hess, who is looking to hire draftsmen and machine operators at the company he runs, Youngstown Bending and Rolling. \u201cI feel good that we saved this place from the wrecking ball.\u201dThe turnaround is part of a transformation spreading across the heartland of the nation, driven by a surge in domestic oil and gas production that is changing the economic calculus for old industries and downtrodden cities alike.Here in Ohio, in an arc stretching south from Youngstown past Canton and into the rural parts of the state where much of the natural gas is being drawn from shale deep underground, entire sectors like manufacturing, hotels, real estate and even law are being reshaped. A series of recent economic indicators, including factory hiring, shows momentum building nationally in the manufacturing sector.New energy production is \u201ca real game-changer in terms of the U.S. economy,\u201d said Katy George, who leads the global manufacturing practice at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm. \u201cIt also creates an opportunity for regions of the country to renew themselves.\u201dThe environmental consequences of the American energy boom and the unconventional drilling techniques that have made it possible are being fiercely debated nationwide. New York officials have imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, because of concerns that the fluids injected into the shale to free oil and natural gas deposits might contaminate the local drinking water.Although that danger worries environmentalists here as well, there has been much less opposition because residents are so desperate for the kind of economic growth that fracking can bring, whatever the risks.Vallourec, a French industrial giant, recently completed a million-square-foot plant in Youngstown to make steel pipes for the energy industry, the first mill of its kind to open here in 50 years. The facility, which cost $1.1 billion to build, will be joined next year by a smaller $80 million Vallourec plant making pipe connectors.The change is evident in the once-moribund downtowns of northeastern Ohio cities as well as in the economic data for the state as a whole.Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate in July was 5.7 percent, well below the national average of 6.1 percent. That\u2019s a sharp reversal of the situation four years ago, when unemployment in Ohio hit 10.6 percent, significantly above the country\u2019s overall jobless rate at the time, as manufacturers here and elsewhere hemorrhaged jobs. In the Youngstown area, the jobless rate in July was 6.7 percent, compared with 13.3 percent in early 2010.\u201cBoth Youngstown and Canton are places which experienced nothing but disinvestment for 40 years,\u201d said Ned Hill, a professor of economic development at Cleveland State University. Now, \u201cthey\u2019re not ghost towns anymore. You actually have to go into reverse to find a parking spot downtown.\u201dYoungstown and surrounding Mahoning County is hardly Silicon Valley or even Pittsburgh, which long ago bade farewell to its industrial past and sought out growth in new sectors like health care and education. Broad swaths of Youngstown look almost rural, the result of a decade-long campaign to tear down abandoned homes and factories, letting sites that were once eyesores return to nature.And the new factories that have gone up \u2014 like Vallourec\u2019s new complex, or a $13.2 million plant that Exterran opened in May 2013 to make oil and gas production equipment for local customers \u2014 employ only a fraction of the workers who once labored at Youngstown\u2019s mills. Vallourec\u2019s state-of-the-art pipe mill has about 350 workers; the old Youngstown Sheet & Tube plant that once stood on the site had a work force of 1,400 when it shut down in 1979.But the improvement is undeniable, especially to those who grew up here. \u201cIt\u2019s a night-and-day difference,\u201d said Robert E. Roland, a Youngstown native who moved away when he was 18, and is now managing partner at one of Canton\u2019s biggest law firms, Day Ketterer. \u201cIt was extremely depressed, and nobody was downtown except for people who were down and out.\u201dA 2013 McKinsey study co-written by Ms. George estimated that production of shale gas and so-called tight oil from shale could help create up to 1.7 million jobs nationally. Many of those jobs are expected to end up in places like this, in part because they are close to newly developed fields like the nearby Utica shale formation.The United States still imports hundreds of billions of dollars more in manufactured products than it exports. But industrial production has rebounded strongly in the wake of the Great Recession, up roughly 20 percent since the end of 2009. Employment in the factory sector, after a steep fall during the downturn, has also recovered. Since hitting bottom in early 2010, manufacturers have added nearly 700,000 jobs, bringing total factory employment in the United States to 12.2 million.At the same time, cities like Youngstown and Canton are also beginning to emulate the advances of places like Cleveland, which went through an earlier revival as more white-collar jobs arrived.Mr. Roland, for example, is planning to hire lawyers in Youngstown and open a branch there. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d consider being in business in Youngstown,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we think this is a market for us and we need a foothold.\u201dDowntown Youngstown\u2019s new federally financed center for advanced manufacturing is drawing notice as well, including a mention in President Obama\u2019s last two State of the Union addresses.Consumer-oriented businesses that survived the lean years are also enjoying a resurgence. Kravitz Delicatessen in the nearby suburb of Liberty has a Vallourec sandwich on the menu (corned beef and pastrami with Swiss cheese and coleslaw), a testament to how much business the 75-year-old Jewish-style deli draws from green-vested Vallourec workers, and from catering corporate events.During the construction of the Vallourec plant, \u201cyou\u2019d come in at lunch and half the people were wearing green,\u201d said the deli owner, Jack Kravitz. \u201cThe Utica shale brought in Vallourec, which brought in more workers and helped me hire more people.\u201dIn the energy surge, Canton has emerged as the center for white-collar jobs associated with the energy industry, like engineers, surveyors and other specialists. About an hour\u2019s drive from both Cleveland and Youngstown, Canton borders the rural region farther south in Ohio where increasingly large quantities of natural gas are being pumped out of the Utica shale.Rettew, a nationwide engineering services firm based in Lancaster, Pa., first opened a field office in Canton in August 2011, with a handful of employees driving in from Pennsylvania and staying in local hotels from Sunday to Thursday.Today, Rettew has 35 employees in Canton. Most of these jobs pay $50,000 to $100,000, which goes far in the area, especially considering the relatively cheap housing, said Jake Wilburn, Rettew\u2019s regional manager in Ohio.The economic impact in rural areas of Ohio is less visible but equally significant. Mostly hidden from view behind trees off a two-lane road in rural Harrison County is an Erector-setlike maze of tanks and distillation towers, one of three huge plants in the area built by Access Midstream, an energy firm based in Oklahoma City.Over the last two years, the company has spent $1.8 billion on new infrastructure to help refine and separate the raw hydrocarbons that come out of the Utica shale.\u201cThis is a 50-year asset,\u201d said Scott Hallam, who oversees Access\u2019s efforts in the Utica shale. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be spending billions here if we didn\u2019t believe that.\u201dWhile the energy industry is looking forward half a century, in Youngstown, a real estate developer, Dominic Marchionda, is trying to bring back something the city hasn\u2019t had in nearly that long: a place to stay downtown.The son of a steelworker, Mr. Marchionda, 54, witnessed Youngstown\u2019s precipitous decline, but has become a believer in its nascent renaissance. \u201cI wanted to leave so badly when I graduated high school and the steel mills were closing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be a part of bringing the city back.\u201dA picture caption on Tuesday with an article about a rebound in manufacturing in the Rust Belt as a result of a resurgence in energy production misstated the year when the straight-side press shown with Greg Hess, plant manager at Youngstown Bending and Rolling in Youngstown, Ohio, was built. It was in 1897, not 1819.Advertisement"}

Thoughtful and innocent, \u201cfaithful as Lassie,\u201d Fintan has been feeling uneasy. The year is 2006, and the booming Irish economy is about to deflate, but that\u2019s not the source of Fintan\u2019s free-floating guilt and anxiety. Watching a clock\u2019s second hand sweep round and round, he can feel \u201ctime racing on, racing like a palpitating heart, so that he feels his life will be over before he has had a chance to live it, certainly before he has had a chance to understand it. Sometimes he feels he can almost hear time rushing past him; it is like a kind of unholy wind.\u201dGobsmacked by hints of the future and echoes of the past, Fintan begins to experience strange lapses of consciousness.

On the surface, this is an astutely observed domestic novel, but underneath deeper themes cut to the heart of what it means to be alive.\u201cWhen did the world become colored?\u201d Fintan\u2019s young daughter, Lucy, asked him once, as they were looking through some old black-and-white family photographs. Examining a book of early color snapshots from the 1900s with his teenage son, Niall, Fintan is struck by \u201chow alarmingly familiar all these things look, exactly like eggs and biscuits, fish and flowers which he might come across on any day of his life.\u201d Can a photograph \u2014 or a novel, for that matter \u2014 bring the past nearer? Can it stop time?Seated at the dinner table one evening with his wife and children around him, Fintan suddenly asks everyone to freeze. \u201cBemused, they look at each other, but do as requested. For a short time they sit in silence, like worshiping Quakers waiting for the Spirit to move through the room. The kitchen clock ticks. Fintan looks at them all earnestly. Then he simply says, \u2018Thank you,\u2019 and stands up.\u201d Madden\u2019s thoughtful, beautifully written novel is a reminder that we\u2019d do best to acknowledge the fact that everything is always changing, and to savor what we can of those passing moments Eliot called the \u201cstill point of the turning world.\u201d TIME PRESENT AND TIME PASTBy Deirdre Madden161 pp. Europa Editions.

{"Headline": "Leader Vows French Role in Airstrikes on ISIS in Iraq", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said Thursday that France was willing to join the United States-led campaign against the Islamic State, including airstrikes against militants in Iraq, saying the world was confronting unremitting brutality.Observing that the militants had conquered territory in Iraq and Syria, Mr. Hollande said the group had been able to grow partly because of international inertia. But he emphasized that France\u2019s intervention would be limited to providing air support, including strikes.The Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, \u201cmassacres anyone who resists it; hunts minorities, notably Christians; commits atrocities against civilians; decapitates journalists; crucifies opponents; kidnaps women,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the movement we are up against.\u201dMr. Hollande traveled to Baghdad last week to help mobilize support for military strikes against Islamic militants. On Thursday, he said he had met with his top military advisers and had agreed to Iraq\u2019s request for air support to reinforce Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish fighters. He said French fighter jets would strike once targets had been identified. \u201cThat means in a short time frame,\u201d he said.While the United States has sought to mobilize allies in the Middle East and Europe as a prelude to possible airstrikes against the militant group in Syria, Mr. Hollande stressed that French airstrikes would be limited to Iraq. Stressing that boots on the ground were not an option, he repeated the warnings of his foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, who has cautioned against the perils of extending intervention into Syria and seeming to support the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad.Mr. Hollande also said that France planned to set up a military hospital in the forest area of Guinea to help in the fight against the Ebola epidemic that has ravaged West Africa.Mr. Hollande made his remarks during his fourth news conference since becoming president in 2012, and he used the occasion to try to reassert his authority amid a flat economy and an approval rating of 13 percent.He spoke just days after his beleaguered Socialist government survived a parliamentary vote of confidence on Tuesday aimed at securing support for his economic policies at a time of growing divisions in Europe and in his own party over how to address a struggling European economy, including France\u2019s 10 percent unemployment.Alluding to the simmering battle in Europe between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who advocates austerity measures to revive Europe\u2019s economic fortunes, and leaders of other countries like France who say such policies are stifling growth, he said France was committed to the necessary changes. But he said it needed more time.He indicated that he was determined to follow through on his plans for spending cuts totaling 50 billion euros (about $65 billion) through 2017, and for a package of tax incentives for companies in an effort to spur hiring. \u201cWe can\u2019t build anything without competitive industries,\u201d he said.When he became president, Mr. Hollande sought to distinguish himself from his charismatic and mercurial predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose private life and what was called his \u201cbling bling\u201d lifestyle alienated many French. But last January, Mr. Hollande generated global headlines when a French tabloid exposed his affair with a French actress, Julie Gayet.Asked about the book on Thursday, Mr. Hollande said he had already addressed the issue. \u201cI invoked the respect due to the office of the president, and I won\u2019t give any other answer,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pension Fund Draws Deep Divisions in R.I. Governor\u2019s Race", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Gina M. Raimondo, one of four Democrats running for governor, gave a pep talk to her volunteers before they went out to canvass voters ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary.\u201cI\u2019ve made some tough choices as treasurer, and every time you take on the status quo, people push back hard,\u201d she told them on Saturday. \u201cThis is our chance,\u201d she added, \u201cto change Rhode Island forever.\u201d The \u201ctough choice\u201d was her overhaul of the state\u2019s pension system in 2011. She marshaled the state\u2019s Democratic political establishment to increase the retirement age, cut benefits and suspend annual cost-of-living adjustments for state employees until the finances of the underfunded system improved. The move was meant to save $4 billion over two decades and slow state property tax increases. The public approved. But her former allies \u2014 the state\u2019s public employee unions \u2014 were infuriated, and the matter is being contested in court. The pension overhaul is now at the center of a primary race for governor that has become one of the most divisive in the country. It has fractured organized labor and raised the stakes in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary, driving up the cost to $11 million, a big sum in tiny Rhode Island. But the unions are split.The public employee unions are supporting Angel Taveras, the mayor of Providence and a Dominican, who, as he likes to say, was raised by a single mother and went from Head Start to Harvard. He is trying to leverage his support in the state\u2019s growing Latino community and its urban centers, but he trails in fund-raising and has slipped in the polls.And the teachers\u2019 unions are still seething at Mr. Taveras, 44, for having fired (then rehired) nearly all of Providence\u2019s teachers in 2011 in an effort to patch a gaping budget deficit.As a result, the teachers are backing a third candidate, H. Claiborne Pell, 32, scion of an old Yankee family, who goes by Clay. The grandson of a six-term Rhode Island senator of the same name and the husband of Michelle Kwan, the figure skater, he has served in the Coast Guard and spent six months in the Obama administration as a deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Education. Mr. Pell has poured $3 million of his money into the race.A fourth Democrat, Todd Giroux, is not perceived as a serious candidate.The Democrats have few ideological differences and generally share the view that creating jobs is essential for this state, which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Apart from the pension issue, the race may turn on matters of experience and personal style.Ms. Raimondo, 43, a former venture capitalist, is the only woman in the race and could become the state\u2019s first female governor. Until recently, women had not rallied around her, partly because many are teachers or support them.\u201cHer failure to break through with women is one of the most striking things about this campaign,\u201d Ms. Schiller said. \u201cWomen can\u2019t identify with her, even though she\u2019s a homegrown Italian girl from Rhode Island.\u201d Her father was a metallurgist at the Bulova watch factory here. She went on to Harvard, Yale Law School and Oxford as a Rhodes scholar. Her opponents have cast her as a tool of Wall Street, and say she trumped up the pension problem to enrich her Wall Street friends, in part through increased state payments in hedge fund fees. Her support among women increased after she ran an ad that softened her image and showed her with her husband and their two children riding their bikes together. Ms. Raimondo attributed the uptick to her intense focus on creating jobs and her plan for improving the economy.Ms. Raimondo also made some early inroads among Latinas. Some were disaffected from Mr. Taveras, Ms. Schiller said, because he had a child with his girlfriend, to whom he was not married; Rhode Island, which is heavily Catholic, tends to take a traditional view of such matters.Mr. Taveras, outspent by 2 to 1 on advertising by both opponents, led Ms. Raimondo in polls over the summer but has slipped as Mr. Pell has gained.\u201cThe most challenging thing for me is that Mr. Pell is in the race,\u201d Mr. Taveras said as he campaigned at a Colombian restaurant in Pawtucket. He said that Mr. Pell was obviously drawing support that might otherwise go to him, which has forced him to alter his strategy to focus on both rivals.He has been especially pointed in questioning Mr. Pell\u2019s qualifications. As he put it in one debate: \u201cI ask people at home: Would you hire someone who has had nine jobs in eight years?\u201dAnd he recently released a sharp online video aimed at Ms. Raimondo, showing a 70-year-old retiree complaining that the pension deal had \u201cbetrayed\u201d state workers. The retiree said she was voting for Mr. Taveras because \u201che knows what it is like to struggle,\u201d and \u201cworking people can count on him.\u201dMany voters at a Greek festival in Cranston, where Mr. Pell was campaigning, said they liked his young blood but were still undecided.\u201cWe\u2019ve known the Pell family for years, and he was a fantastic senator,\u201d said Don Corey, 74, a retired City of Providence worker. But he said he still had to \u201cread the fine print\u201d on the grandson. He said he thought Ms. Raimondo had done the right thing on pensions.One oddity of Rhode Island is that although it is heavily Democratic, its voters have elected only Republican governors over the last two decades. Theories abound as to why: that voters want a check on the Democratic legislature, perhaps, or that the Democratic candidates have been too liberal.This year, the two Republican candidates vying for their party\u2019s nomination \u2014 Ken Block, a businessman, and Allan Fung, the mayor of Cranston \u2014 seem to be running fairly even, and Mr. Block, at least, predicted another good year for Republicans. \u201cThe Democratic Party is really not cohesive on this race,\u201d he said, campaigning at the Greek festival. \u201cAnd I seriously doubt that the winner of the Democratic primary can pull all those constituencies together. A lot of what are normally Democratic votes will be coming my way, so we like the way the race is shaping up.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Stress Test for E.U. Energy Supplies", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyEurope is conducting two stress tests. One is on its energy suppliers, to see how badly they would fare if flows of Russian natural gas were disrupted. The other is on eurozone banks to ensure they are strong enough to finance economic recovery.It is hard to know which of the two stress tests is more important. But it is clear that an effective system of energy security requires many of the same elements as financial stability.One is the need for credible stress tests. Europe flunked its original bank tests by modeling conditions that were not sufficiently stressful. The new test being conducted by the European Central Bank looks more credible.The European Union is only now conducting its first gas test. Member states submitted their results last month to the European Commission, which is now reviewing them before coming up with recommendations next month. It should not pull its punches.Part of the gas test involves checking whether countries have done what they are already supposed to have done to improve security. After gas via the Ukraine was disrupted in 2009, companies were told they needed to ensure supplies in the event of a 30-day disruption.But a 30-day buffer is not enough. Although Ukraine has agreed to a cease-fire with rebels, peace on the bloc\u2019s eastern frontier is far from guaranteed. And the Union\u2019s ability to confront Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s revanchism will be compromised as long as it is worried about running out of gas. Policy makers bolstered capital buffers after the financial crisis; they should now increase minimum gas buffers after the Ukrainian crisis.Banks do not just undergo stress tests. They also have to produce \u201crecovery plans\u201d to make sure they can continue operating if they suffer a shock. Similarly, the gas tests are supposed to be accompanied by contingency plans. Bank recovery plans involve things like raising more capital and shrinking balance sheets. Gas contingency plans need to include increasing storage facilities, switching to alternative fuels and rationing supplies. They need to be robust.One way of trying to stop banks from getting into trouble is to forbid them to put all their eggs in one basket. There are \u201clarge exposure limits,\u201d which prevent their lending more than a quarter of their capital to a single party.What makes the European Union vulnerable in the gas arena is that 27 percent of its consumption comes from Russia. Six member states get all their gas imports from Russia. It will take time to diversify supply to other fuels (like nuclear energy and renewables) or other sources of gas (like shale and liquefied natural gas). But eventually there should be an equivalent of \u201clarge exposure limits\u201d to ensure energy security.Another way of preventing a financial crisis is to engage in \u201cmacroprudential\u201d policy. The basic idea is that it is not enough to look at individual banks, because of the cat\u2019s cradle of linkages between lenders. Regulators need to examine the system as a whole.There is the same imperative in the gas world. The European Union already has a body called the Gas Coordination Group, which exchanges information and coordinates action. Meanwhile, member states are required to inform the commission before signing any intergovernmental agreements in the energy field so it can check that what may be a good deal for one country does not undermine another\u2019s security.Donald Tusk, the Polish prime minister, who has just been chosen as the next president of the European Council, has advocated going one step further: involving the commission in all energy negotiations in the bloc. Although this would clearly increase its bargaining power vis-\u00e0-vis Russia, it would also contravene trade and antitrust policy.A more modest idea, though, is worth considering: Get the commission to co-sign all gas deals but give it the power to object only if it believes energy security is being compromised. The Euratom Supply Agency already does this with uranium supplies.There is, though, one big difference between gas and banking. You cannot print gas in the same way that you can print money, so there cannot be a lender of last resort in quite the same way. But two things can be done that would have a somewhat similar effect.The most important is to complete the single market in gas. This means ensuring there are enough gas pipelines connecting different national markets. If one country lost access to gas, it could then import it from another. Although the European Union as a whole might still face a shortage, the hit would be shared among all 28 countries, rather than absorbed by a few vulnerable states.In the past few years, a lot of interconnectors have been built. But the Commission estimates that 17 billion euros, or about $22 billion, still needs to be spent. This is a top priority for the next few years.Another way of protecting vulnerable countries would be for the bloc to set up a fund to help them pay for liquefied natural gas in the event that Russian gas was cut off, as suggested by Matthew Bryza, director of the International Center for Defense Studies in Estonia. Given that L.N.G. is more expensive than piped gas, the fund could finance the extra cost.The analogy between gas and finance is not exact. But, as Europe takes action to improve its energy security, it can learn the lessons from banking \u2014 from its failures as well as its successes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Q. and A.: What Would an Independent Scotland Entail?", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScotland has been England\u2019s junior partner in the United Kingdom since 1707. But three centuries is no time at all in the view of many Scots, who regularly re-enact 14th century sword battles they had with the English and have insisted on self-determination, on and off, ever since. That prospect is now nearer than ever. Scottish voters will decide on Thursday whether to become independent once again.Here\u2019s a look at the referendum and the issues.What will voters consider exactly?The question on the ballot is simple: \u201cShould Scotland be an independent country?\u201dHow did a seemingly fruitful union reach the breaking point?Who\u2019s who?A breakdown of the issues voters will consider Thursday in Scotland\u2019s referendum on independence.If Scotland votes to separate, it will take 18 months of negotiations before independence is declared. And judging from the tone of the campaign, it will be a messy and acrimonious divorce.Scotland already administers many of its own affairs. After a referendum in 1997, it set up its own parliament and controls health, education, housing, justice and a portion of taxation. But some economists say an independent Scotland would be too poor to keep up its welfare state, let alone expand it.And as if to give a taste of the economic uncertainty that would come after a yes vote, the pound has slumped in recent weeks and several banks and businesses have threatened to flee south of the border should voters choose independence.Britain also has a lot on the line: If Scotland and its more pro-European voters leave, Britain might leave the European Union.Who can vote?Which side is winning?Until recently, the anti-independence campaign maintained a comfortable lead in opinion polls. But as the referendum approaches, the two sides are neck and neck.Will the queen have to go?Mr. Salmond, the Scottish National Party leader, thinks Queen of the Scots is a \u201cfantastic title\u201d and has promised fellow Scots that they get to keep Elizabeth II as their head of state, Canadian-style (although future Scottish voters could always change that).This seems to work for Scottish voters, who remain in favor of the monarchy albeit by a much smaller margin than their English counterparts. The queen herself, meanwhile, who has reigned over the disintegration of the British Empire, seems less impressed. After news reports suggesting that she was horrified by the prospect of her kingdom being further dismembered, she urged voters, somewhat cryptically, to \u201cthink very carefully about the future.\u201dScotland and England have been united under a single monarchy since the Scottish king, James VI, inherited the English throne from Queen Elizabeth in 1603. The queen, whose own mother was Scottish, spends a week every year at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh, the official royal residence in Scotland, and her summers at Balmoral Castle.What would Britain look like without Scotland?But days before the independence referendum, Mr. Bragg\u2019s lyrics sound less preposterous:\u201cBritain isn\u2019t cool, you know, it\u2019s really not that great. It\u2019s not a proper country, it doesn\u2019t even have a patron saint.\u201dCertainly, if Scots vote to secede on Thursday, Britain will be less great: it will lose 5.3 million residents, more than 8 percent of its population.As for the Union Jack \u2014 which combines the colors of England, Scotland and Ireland \u2014 will it come down at last as demanded by Mr. Bragg?Some proposed redesigns sent to the Flag Institute, a charity, suggested that a red Welsh dragon be superimposed. Welsh people think this is a great idea. But there are only three million of them and their 53 million English counterparts might object.A more subtle approach would be to combine the black-and-yellow flag of the Welsh patron saint, David, with those of England\u2019s St. George and Ireland\u2019s St. Patrick. But if the white-on-blue saltire of Scotland\u2019s St. Andrew is excluded, should the red-on-white saltire of St. Patrick remain nearly a century after Irish Independence \u2014 particularly given the resentment it inspires among Ulster unionists?The most straightforward idea, replacing the flag\u2019s current blue background with a black one, has a catch, too: \u201cThat used to be a fascist flag in the U.K.,\u201d said Graham Bartram, of the Flag Institute. \u201cIt would be like all those sci-fi movies coming true. I can just see all the soldiers marching in their black uniforms saluting a black flag.\u201dWhat would the United Kingdom be called without Scotland as a member?Whatever the official name \u2014 like the flag, most people bet that it will remain the same \u2014 there is a danger that in the world\u2019s perception, at least, Great Britain would become Little Britain.What about Scotland? Who knows. The Scots have a reputation in the rest of Britain for being different. Scotland\u2019s official animal is the unicorn, and its national flower is the thistle. The national dish is haggis, closely followed by deep-fried Mars candy bars.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gaza Demilitarization Myths", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersRe \u201cGaza, victim of history\u201d (Opinion, Aug. 27): Jean-Pierre Filiu suggests that removing the Gaza Strip\u2019s border restrictions would lead to its demilitarization. There is no evidence to back this up; the reverse is true. Hamas\u2019s import and use of weapons has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with its murderous Islamist ideology. It levies huge taxes on luxury goods smuggled through tunnels. The tunnels used to attack Israelis are a different matter and must also be destroyed for security purposes. The border restrictions exist because Iranian and other weapons are regularly smuggled into Gaza for the purpose of attacking Israeli civilians. If Gaza was successfully and permanently demilitarized, there would be no need for such restrictions. Logic dictates that until then, if the Palestinian leadership cannot ensure weapons are not imported to Gaza, Israel must do so. Effective demilitarization of Gaza will lead to the lifting of border restrictions, not the other way round.Re \u201cHow surfing on Web tells who we are\u201d (Page Two, Aug. 20): David Leonhardt says that the analysis of who searches the Web for what provides the \u201csobering\u201d lesson that there are now \u201ctwo very different Americas.\u201d Come on! There have always been different Americas: not two, not 50 (one for each state) but over 19,000 (one for each city). And even that number is too low, as cultures, taste, income levels, education opportunities and much more often differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Are the Bronx and the Upper East side part of the same America? Is the blueblood Rittenhouse Square neighborhood of Philadelphia part of the same America as where the fictional Rocky grew up? This is not a new phenomenon. When representatives of 12 colonies were trying to write the American Constitution (Rhode Island did not send a representative to the Constitutional Convention), their individual interests were so diverse that the document almost wound up being scuttled. Re \u201cIsraelis at center of trade in organs\u201d (News, Aug. 18): Your article points to a serious legal and medically imprudent problem in many places of the world. The award for worst offender of unethical organ procurement, however, goes to China. Both Israel and China face the situation of traditionally rooted reluctance to donate organs. Yet unlike Israel, that has a sophisticated program to engage volunteers, China has \u201csolved\u201d the lack of organs through coercive organ harvesting, not only from executed prisoners but also from living prisoners of conscience, especially from Falun Gong practitioners. This takes the issue of organ brokerage to a completely different level. If Israeli or American citizens travel to China for a \u201cgood\u201d transplant deal, they are most likely not only getting an organ but trigger the death of the matching prisoner of conscience. This exceeds by far the gravity of the organ brokering reported in your article. The writer is the executive director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting.  The writer is a psychologist and adviser to Dafoh. Re \u201cA flawed immigration strategy\u201d (Editorial, Aug. 14): Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s proposed curbs on immigration are less a policy to prevent the influx of foreign workers into Britain and more a tactic to stymie the flow of Conservative Party voters to the right-wing U.K. Independence Party. Mr. Cameron is not blind to the hard evidence that both skilled and unskilled immigrants are a net benefit to Britain and its economy. That said, the prime minister\u2019s opinion on the need to curb immigration doesn\u2019t reflect that of the nation as a whole. We are a country with a long history of immigration, and the majority of people welcome with open arms those wishing to make a positive contribution to the country. Without immigrants we would be waiting a lot longer to see a doctor, paying a lot more for anything that has to be picked, packed or delivered, and having to put up with surly British-born service staff \u2014 not to mention having to start hand-washing our own cars.

{"Headline": "Sweden Takes a Left Turn After 8 Years of Rightist Rule", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOTHENBURG, Sweden \u2014 After eight years of a tax-cutting, free-market government, Sweden was poised on Sunday night to turn toward the center left, as a loose coalition of left-leaning parties won a slim but clear lead in parliamentary elections.In a violent shock to Sweden\u2019s liberal establishment, however, the far-right Sweden Democrats became the country\u2019s third force in politics, more than doubling their share of the vote to 13 percent and setting the stage to hold the balance of power in a Parliament where the center left will struggle to build a stable majority.As the voters\u2019 rejection of the current government became clear, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt announced that he was stepping down.\u201cThe Swedish people have spoken,\u201d he said, adding that he would also quit his party\u2019s leadership in the spring.On the eve of the poll, Stefan Lofven, 57, the left-leaning Social Democratic leader and likely new prime minister in the new administration, pledged to \u201cstretch out his hand\u201d to the smaller center-right parties to create a \u201cstrong majority\u201d in Parliament that would deny the far right its desired role as kingmaker.\u201cWe have had eight years of this government, and it is now time for a new direction,\u201d he declared.Mr. Lofven, a soft-spoken but pugnacious trade union leader with no parliamentary experience, offered Swedes an end to policies of tight money and tax cuts, promising instead to tax the banks and the better-off to fund more spending on schools, welfare and infrastructure, and to create jobs.Preliminary results showed 43.7 percent of the votes going to a coalition dominated by the Social Democrats, partnered with the Green Party and the Left Party of former communists. The center-right bloc, meanwhile, got 39.3 percent of the vote. That was a slimmer gap than any predicted by opinion polls during the campaign, and one that points to a period of protracted uncertainty as the parties jostle for position in the government while distancing themselves from the far right.Feminist Initiative, a party that campaigned on a platform of equality and antiracism, had appeared poised to surpass the 4 percent threshold necessary to enter Parliament, potentially strengthening a center-left coalition. However, provisional results showed the party with only 3.1 percent.Despite steering the country to a rapid and sustained recovery from the global economic slump of 2008, the Moderate Party of Mr. Reinfeldt, 49, saw its support fall away to 23.2 percent, as Swedes grew anxious about the consequences for Sweden\u2019s cherished welfare system with the government decreasing spending and expanding the role of the private sector.\u201cThe gold rush is over,\u201d Mr. Lofven repeated during the campaign, tapping into a widespread feeling that excessive profits reaped by \u201crogue companies\u201d were taking precedence over the quality of services in schools and elderly care. He has said that as prime minister, within 100 days he would launch a \u201creform package\u201d for schools and set up a commission of inquiry into financing the welfare system.This high-profile move to link public spending cuts with immigration was seized upon by the far-right Sweden Democrats, who made a 90 percent cut in refugee numbers a central plank of their campaign.Their persistent message has tempted Swedes uneasy with the pace of immigration and worried about the strains on schools and housing as the country copes with numbers of refugees not seen since the Balkan wars two decades ago. Almost a third of voters for the Sweden Democrats on Sunday said they had backed the Moderate Party in the last election four years ago, according to exit polls by Sweden\u2019s public sector broadcaster.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Labor Today", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialIn the months before Labor Day last year, job growth was so slow that economists said it would take until 2021 to replace the jobs that were lost or never created in the recession and its aftermath. In 2013, after-tax corporate profits as a share of the economy tied with their highest level on record (in 1965), while labor compensation as a share of the economy hit its lowest point since 1948. Wage growth since 1979 has not kept pace with productivity growth, resulting in falling or flat wages for most workers and big gains for corporate coffers, shareholders, executives and others at the top of the income ladder. Worse, the recent upturn in growth, even if sustained, will not necessarily lead to markedly improved living standards for most workers. That\u2019s because the economy\u2019s lopsidedness is not mainly the result of market forces, but of the lack of policies to ensure broader prosperity. The imbalance will not change without labor and economic reforms. That\u2019s clear evidence that raising the federal minimum wage, while only a first step toward better pay, would have a powerful effect. A lift from the current $7.25 an hour to the modest $10.10 called for by President Obama and Democrats in Congress would put an estimated additional $35 billion in the pockets of affected workers over a three-year phase-in period. Unionization is also associated with higher wages and benefits, especially for low-wage workers, which argues for greater legal enforcement of the right to organize without retaliation. What is still lacking, however, is a full-employment agenda that regards labor, not corporations, as the center of the economy \u2014 a change that would be a reversal of the priorities of the last 35 years.

Voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with their own representatives has hit a high as nearly two-thirds say they are ready to throw their own representatives out of office.Voters rate the party more likely to do a better job\u2026Republican candidates are further buoyed by the fact that voters trust their party over the Democrats to better handle some issues voters consider to be the most important. The economy ranks at the top of that list followed by health care, terrorism and immigration. The Republican Party easily tops the Democratic Party in handling the economy, terrorism and foreign policy while voters are about evenly divided between the two parties on immigration.

The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for all adults and registered voters and 4 points for likely voters.\n  With Americans\u2019 fears about a terrorist attack on the rise, a New York Times/CBS News poll finds the public is questioning President Obama\u2019s strategy for combating the militant organization calling itself the Islamic State.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Central Bank Appears to Inject $81 Billion Into Top Lenders", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 With industrial production growing at the slowest pace since the worst of the global financial crisis and foreign direct investment in a tailspin, China appears to have taken the unusual step of using monetary stimulus in an attempt to forestall further economic weakness.China\u2019s central bank has lent 100 billion renminbi, or $16.2 billion, to each of the country\u2019s five main, state-controlled banks, bankers and economists said Wednesday, although the central bank and the five banks involved stayed silent. The seemingly stealthy decision to inject a total of $81 billion into the banking system this week came as the Chinese economy, like many economies in Europe, has slowed over the summer, although still expanding at a pace that would be the envy of most countries around the world.The move by the central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, to transfer the money directly to state-controlled banks drew immediate criticism from economists at international banks. The central bank had been seeking in recent months to reduce the role of bureaucratic guidance in China\u2019s financial sector, relying instead on pushing interest rates up and down and then letting market forces allocate money among borrowers and lenders.The loans this week represented a much more targeted approach, with the money going entirely to five heavily regulated big banks. Those five, which account for at least three-fifths of the market by various measures, are the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China and Bank of Communications.The banks are likely to lend the money to politically connected industries and individuals, notably those in favored sectors like advanced electronics or the construction of mass-market housing.The central bank does occasionally make loans to the country\u2019s biggest banks under a program known as the standing loan facility, which has been used again this week. The standing loan facility is intended to provide extra cash before holidays, like the weeklong national holiday at the start of next month to celebrate the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China by Mao in 1949.But the standing loan facility is usually used to inject much smaller sums of money into the banking system, nothing like the scale of what was introduced this week, which amounts to monetary stimulus. Even before the Lunar New Year, which gives a much bigger jolt to the banking system than the coming holiday week because of extensive gift-giving, the central bank this year injected only 190 billion renminbi, or $31 billion, at the end of January.Many economists had expected the central bank this month to allow commercial banks to hold a smaller share of their assets as reserves, which would free up more money for lending. Some economists had expected the central bank to engage in money market transactions to increase the availability of funds for banks to lend. But few had expected the central bank to lend the money directly to big banks, an older tactic that the Chinese government had seemed to be steering away from.\u201cWe believe the tool, which is akin to printing money, is a misuse\u201d of the central bank\u2019s position as the lender of last resort, Shen Jianguang, the Hong Kong-based chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia, wrote in a research note.Louis Kuijs, a China economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, was similarly skeptical.\u201cIt seems to run counter to the reform orientation, in the sense that this is another measure that is intended to channel liquidity to specific institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cMonetary policy reform is supposed to go in the direction of more indirect, market-oriented policy.\u201dAdding to the unusual nature of the loans was the secrecy that surrounded them. The People\u2019s Bank of China declined to comment about the loans, and the five major banks also remained silent, leaving financial markets to guess about the interest rate the banks were being charged and other details.The loans were first reported in the wee hours of Wednesday morning by Sina, a Chinese website. The report cited two bank analysts as sources.The Chinese action comes as the European Central Bank begins its own targeted lending program on Thursday. The E.C.B. will provide banks with extremely low-rate loans, provided that the banks promptly relend the money in the private sector. The European plan also prohibits banks from lending the money to households for home purchases.The People\u2019s Bank of China is providing three-month loans to the major banks, Sina reported. Because the central bank gets to decide in December whether to roll over the loans or call them in, the measure is more limited than reducing the percentage of assets that banks must keep as reserves. The $81 billion injection of money to the banking system has roughly the same initial effect as a reduction by a half percent in the required reserve ratio, economists at J.P. Morgan calculated.Industrial production grew 6.9 percent in China last month compared with a year ago. Only two months in the past decade have been weaker: November 2008, when industrial production grew 5.4, and December of 2008, when it grew 5.7 percent.Foreign direct investment dropped 14 percent in August from a year earlier, after declining 17 percent in July.Shen Danyang, the Commerce Ministry spokesman, said on Tuesday that the decline should not be attributed to his country\u2019s antimonopoly raids on the Chinese offices of numerous multinationals in recent months; he pointed out instead that costs in China were rising, especially for labor-intensive manufacturing.Advertisement"}

Sales of new homes jumped 18 percent in August, reaching an annual rate of 504,000, according to the Commerce Department, far better than the 430,000 rate economists had expected. Newly constructed homes sold at the fastest clip since May 2008. The report eased fears of a housing slowdown that arose two days earlier when the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes fell unexpectedly in August. Despite Wednesday\u2019s gains, there is a lot of caution in the market, traders said. Investors continue to focus on tensions in the Middle East and on Europe\u2019s economic malaise. Health care stocks rebounded after taking a beating on Tuesday when the Treasury Department moved to tighten rules on a corporate tax-saving maneuver called an inversion. AbbVie, which is buying the European drug maker Shire, rose $1.49, or 2.6 percent, $59.05. In the bond market, interest rates were up. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.57 percent, from 2.53 percent; its price fell 11/32, to 98 11/32. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Premier\u2019s Push Toward Center Opens Rift on the Left", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMemo From FranceHe admonished the left wing of the French Socialist Party to stop posturing against capitalism, then launched into a lengthy pro-business discourse that drew a standing ovation. \u201cFrance needs you,\u201d he told the bosses at the annual summer conference of the Medef, France\u2019s employers\u2019 union. \u201cAnd I love business!\u201dHis speech could have been taken from the playbook of Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, who persuaded his Labour Party to pivot to the center in the 1990s. But in France, that brand of talk is opening a fractious rift within the Socialist Party, between leftists who fear their leaders are abandoning the party\u2019s ideological core and others who believe that a centrist makeover is needed to save not just modern-day Socialism, but also France itself.Mr. Valls has called a rare confidence vote in the National Assembly for Tuesday, as he tries to corral his party toward reforms and away from what he calls \u201cold Socialism.\u201d While his government seems likely to succeed, several leftist lawmakers have threatened a rebellion, and, if the vote fails, it could precipitate new elections.Not just in France, but across Europe, the enduring economic malaise has convulsed governments and sent the political left into a existential crisis.Even as momentum builds against the austerity policies that Germany has pushed on the eurozone, the question remains whether Europe can afford the welfare systems that have defined the left for generations and that critics blame for ushering in the debt crisis in the first place. But if the left now backs away from its ideological touchstones, then what does it stand for?Mr. Valls is trying to answer that challenge by calling on his party to embrace policies that emphasize growth over social protections as Europe\u2019s leaders look for ways to stimulate their economies. He has forged a new solidarity axis with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy, who has embraced freer markets and labor reforms but, like Mr. Valls, is also seeking to push back against deeper cuts in public spending.At a social-democratic rally in Bologna, Italy, this month, both men appeared tieless and in matching white shirts, hugging each other and promising to \u201cunblock Europe.\u201d\u201cRenzi and Valls have broken with the old European Socialism the way Blair did,\u201d said G\u00e9rard Grunberg, a political scientist who studies the left in France. \u201cValls is trying to embody a real modernization of the Socialist Party, by challenging the state and putting more confidence in the markets.\u201dSo far, it has not been easy. In the cabinet reshuffle last month, Mr. Hollande ousted Arnaud Montebourg, a populist economy minister, and replaced him with Emmanuel Macron, a wealthy former banker at Rothschild who is seen as more friendly to business.The moves left the traditional base of the Socialist Party feeling angry and betrayed. Yet to critics elsewhere, the changes still felt like an unsatisfying attempt to split the difference between setting a new direction for the party and remaining true to old Socialist ideals.\u201cThe problem is that Hollande and Valls don\u2019t embody anything at all,\u201d said the French economist Thomas Piketty, whose book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d explores social inequality in France and elsewhere. \u201cThey are trying to make people believe that Germany is the only country responsible for the catastrophic austerity policy which has plunged the eurozone into stagnation.\u201d\u201cBut in truth,\u201d he added, \u201cthe problem is that they are scared of any progress in terms of policy and budgetary union at the eurozone level, which would yet be the only solution to get out of the crisis,\u201d but was likely to require future trimming of the state to meet the European Union\u2019s requirements.\u201cFrance is rotting from the top,\u201d Nicolas Baverez, a conservative economist, observed in a recent editorial in the magazine Le Point. \u201cIt is the victim of a political system that is pretending to manage everything, while in reality, it stumbles.\u201dMr. Hollande\u2019s weakness has elevated Mr. Valls as the de facto strongman of the French government, with a mission to rebrand France as a country that is open for business and willing to temper traditional French protectionism with a warmer embrace of the free market.Known for his outspokenness and frenetic energy, Mr. Valls is seen as a freethinker in French politics, and has at times been called the \u201cSocialist Sarkozy\u201d \u2014 a reference to Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president, whose conservative Union for a Popular Movement party was also tough on issues like immigration and security.In the French news media, Mr. Valls is presented as a partisan of \u201cthe uninhibited left,\u201d Socialists who challenge traditional reforms established by the left. In his 2010 book, \u201cPower,\u201d Mr. Valls emphasized the \u201cexhaustion\u201d of the social-democratic model, which he described as a confusing mix of left and right policies. \u201cEven worse,\u201d he wrote, \u201cit is the left that is now incapable of rejuvenating the welfare state by adapting it to the realities of our time.\u201dJean-Jacques Urvoas, a Socialist legislator and a close friend of Mr. Valls\u2019s, called him a \u201cprickly\u201d man with a \u201cmodernist\u201d approach. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t kowtow to the great figures of the left; he is an iconoclast,\u201d Mr. Urvoas said.Mr. Valls fashions himself as a torchbearer for the center, seeking peace with the business community and revisiting bedrock Socialist tenets like France\u2019s 35-hour workweek. If Mr. Hollande\u2019s mandate grows weaker, there is little doubt that Mr. Valls will try to pick up the mantle for the Socialist Party heading into France\u2019s 2017 presidential race.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that soft image that Hollande does; in that sense he\u2019s viewed as more presidential,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \u201cFor now, he must follow Hollande\u2019s policies. But if the captain of the ship has to bow out because he is too weak, he would fancy himself taking a crack at it.\u201dBut the latest polls show Mr. Valls losing popularity, too, and if the government\u2019s tilt toward the center does not produce better economic results, he will be deeply discredited.To shore up his Socialist credentials, Mr. Valls has taken pains to address \u201cthe French who are suffering.\u201d But Mr. Valls is also limited in how much he can go beyond the policies already outlined by Mr. Hollande. For now, the two men are, perhaps uncomfortably, joined at the hip.While Mr. Hollande has made clear he will not impose new austerity measures, Mr. Valls must still persuade left-leaning members of their Socialist Party to sign off on cuts of 50 billion euros, or about $65 billion, already pledged through 2017 \u2014 something that will remain a hurdle even if the confidence vote passes on Tuesday.\u201cIt\u2019s politically tough to do when you have a left wing of the Socialist Party that want no cuts of any kind in the social welfare state,\u201d Mr. Kirkegaard said. \u201cThat\u2019s where Valls\u2019s main political fight will be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Sweden Nears Vote, Center-Right Is Trailing", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOTHENBURG, Sweden \u2014 The Swedish government ought to be riding high.The country has bounced back from the recession faster and farther than any other in Western Europe. Tax cuts have increased the average Swede\u2019s annual disposable income by almost a month\u2019s wages since 2006.Swedish leaders are playing prominent roles in global diplomacy. Sweden\u2019s banks are strong. Real estate is booming. Consumers around the world hang their H&M clothes in Ikea cabinets, download pop music from Spotify, read Swedish thrillers and watch Swedish television dramas.Yet for all that, the center-right government of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, 49, is in serious political trouble.With less than a week to go before a general election on Sunday, Mr. Reinfeldt\u2019s Alliance bloc of four parties is trailing the\u00a0left-leaning coalition of the Social Democrat, Green and Left\u00a0Parties\u00a0by five to ten percentage points in recent polls. Sweden is now sharply divided over big, emotive issues like immigration and the future of the welfare state. And after two terms of center-right government and market-oriented policies, the electorate\u2019s center of gravity appears to be shifting back toward the center-left and the Social Democrats, who dominated the country for 80 years before 2006.Each side warns about the fringe bedfellows that the other might have to depend on to form a government after a close result on Sunday. The left suggests that Mr. Reinfeldt might try to cling to power by allying with the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, who are polling around 10 percent, a reflection of growing dissatisfaction over the country\u2019s long-held posture of welcoming refugees.The right, in turn, warns that a government led by the Social Democrats, who have promised to raise taxes to provide more money for schools and welfare programs, would be dependent on support from the former communists of the Left Party, who make no secret of their opposition to private profit in the public sector.\u201cBusiness has much to fear from a red-green administration,\u201d said Anna Kinberg Batra, parliamentary leader of Mr. Reinfeldt\u2019s party, the Moderates, in arguing that a left-leaning coalition could unravel the country\u2019s economic progress.Fredrik Olovsson, economics spokesman for the Social Democrats, said his party was not advocating radical change. \u201cWe have strong support in industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Social Democrats have worked with the business community for decades.\u201dOn the contrary, he said, the party promises to support industry by spending more on infrastructure and addressing a shortage of skilled workers. Its latest budget proposals would inject more than $6 billion into the economy over the next decade.Welfare benefits for the sick and unemployed would rise, Mr. Olovsson said, and with more investment in education, teacher numbers and salaries would increase while class sizes went down. This would be funded with a modest rise in taxes on the better off, a doubling of the value added tax on restaurants and a new levy on Sweden\u2019s banks, which largely avoided the agonies of the European financial sector. Otherwise, he said, there would be no new taxes on business.Sweden\u2019s forecast economic growth of 1.9 percent this year masks underlying weaknesses. Unemployment has remained stuck around 8 percent, and much higher among the young. The central bank made a surprise cut to interest rates last month in response to signs of deflation.There is cross-party consensus that schools are in a mess after a report last year from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showing a sharp drop in the global rankings of Sweden\u2019s educational system. In health and elderly care, high-profile scandals have fueled anxiety that the experiment with private sector providers has gone too far. There is a chronic shortage of housing in the big cities, which has driven up rents and personal debt.Swedish politics are like a thermostat, he said \u2014 the dial on tax cuts has been turned up, but now the temperature is uncomfortable, there are problems in the welfare system and people want the dial adjusted.At the same time, tax cutting is not the ideological litmus test it is for conservatives in the United States or Britain. Part of the center-right\u2019s success has been its acceptance of Sweden\u2019s model for the welfare state.In power, the current government has lowered taxes more than any other country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. But the total tax take is still high, around 44 percent of economic output.If Sweden\u2019s welfare model has shaped the center-right, the center-left has also had a major change of heart since the financial crisis that hit Sweden in 1991.\u201cWe had our 2008 in 1991,\u201d said Klas Eklund, a senior economist at the Swedish bank SEB in Stockholm and an adviser to several governments.Subsequent governments of left and right deregulated the public sector, overhauled the pensions system so that it became based on individual contributions, took the country into the European Union and shook up the tax system. As a result, a new Swedish model emerged, ensuring that the country met the recession that followed the financial crisis of 2008 with a budget surplus and a high level of resilience.Stefan Lofven, the Social Democrat leader and potential new prime minister, has inherited a very different party from the one he joined in the 1970s. Although he has no experience in Parliament, he points to his years at the top of the engineering union IF Metall as valuable preparation for running the country. He has healed the party\u2019s internal rifts after its election defeats.But Mr. Lofven, 57, must find a workable coalition among the other parties of the left. Even a slight recovery by the center-right could see no group of parties with a clear majority in Parliament, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats potentially holding the balance of power.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cubs\u2019 Owners Are Rebuilding While Root, Root, Rooting", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is a typical Sunday at Wrigley Field, that old Eden of a ballpark, with the sun beaming bright, a breeze blowing in from the lake, a good crowd on hand and the last-place Chicago Cubs already losing, 7-0. As is his custom, Tom Ricketts strolls through the aisles of the upper deck, greeting the fans.The owners of most ball clubs would not mingle like this, especially if their team were so ridiculously bad year after year. But there goes Ricketts, unescorted by security, a familiar figure now in a long-sleeve white shirt and khaki trousers. People rush over to shake his hand and pose for selfies. Ricketts is blessed with a genial face that wards off hostility like a plate of armor. Not once does anyone tell him to get rid of those bums on the field and win some doggone games. To the contrary, a shirtless man, Andrew Kolb, scurries over to say, \u201cThanks for taking over the team, brother.\u201dAnother fan is staring at Ricketts but cannot quite place him. Is he an actor? A politician? He asks a stranger, \u201cSorry for being so stupid, but who is this guy?\u201dCubs fans were used to a media corporation, Tribune Company, owning their team. By contrast, these Rickettses were refreshingly human. Holy cow! Bleacher Bums were now running the show.\u201cThere is no curse,\u201d Tom Ricketts scoffed about a popular myth, sounding like a businessman rather than an exorcist. \u201cIf anybody on our team thinks he\u2019s cursed, we\u2019ll move him to a less accursed team.\u201dHe promised to win the World Series, a sunburst of optimism that seemed as improbable to some as a pledge to reverse the rotation of the earth. The Cubs had not won the National League pennant since 1945, at the dawn of the nuclear age; they had not won the World Series since Henry Ford produced the first Model T, in 1908.\u201cI\u2019ll be honest: I think we have a team that can do it next year,\u201d he said earnestly.Of course, that is not what happened, not the next year or the next after that or the next or the next or this dismal season about to mercifully end. Instead the Cubs have lost baseball games at a pace remarkable even for a team notorious for the longevity of its futility.While nothing supernatural may afflict the Cubs, the Ricketts family has encountered all sorts of earthly bedevilments both on the field and off: aging, overpaid players; a 100-year-old ballpark with a beauty only skin deep; hardball Windy City politics; critics who say plans to install a mammoth outfield video board will change Wrigley Field forever, despoiling the understated charm of baseball\u2019s loveliest oasis.And then there are the neighbors across the street. They claim they are legally entitled to unobstructed views of the games from their rooftops and oppose revenue-generating signs the Cubs want to erect above the outfield walls. The Rickettses blame them for delaying a $575 million project, a top-to-bottom renovation of the ballpark and the construction of an adjacent commercial plaza and hotel.\u201cI\u2019ll grant you, it has been a learning curve,\u201d Tom Ricketts said.The Ricketts siblings grew up on Hickory Street in Omaha, and one by one they went off to college in Chicago, where they would come under the spell of the ballpark affectionately known as the friendly confines and its endearing, if woebegone, team, the Cubs.This was not a casual embrace. The four of them bled Cubbie blue like the most devoted of die-hards, each year exchanging their optimism for fatalism, muttering with a shrug: Wait till next year.After graduation, in the late 1980s and very early 1990s, they thought of the center-field bleachers as the hub of their summertime social life. They went to most every weekend game with a roundup of friends. Pete, the oldest, once camped out all night on a three-fold lawn chair to make sure they got tickets.The bleachers \u2014 beyond the ivy-covered outfield walls \u2014 did not offer the best view of a game, and yet something exhilarating went on there. No matter the score, the crowd was boisterous and carefree, a community of revelers invigorated by hot dogs, peanuts and plenty of beer. They threw opponents\u2019 home run balls back onto the field. The bleachers were a mellow state of mind, an ointment for the soul.Tom, the next oldest, particularly recalls one Sunday afternoon. He was conveniently seated so he could pass people\u2019s money to the beer vendor below and haul up cup after cup like a bucket from a well. He bought 16 at one time, he said. He also met a medical student named Cecelia. And she became his wife.Wrigley Field, built in 1914, is set in one of Chicago\u2019s great old residential neighborhoods, with three-story apartment buildings immediately beyond the bleacher walls. For a while, Pete and Tom shared a flat above Sports Corner, a tavern just across the street from right field. The urgent hawking of scalpers and peanut vendors awakened them if they tried to sleep late.Back then, in 1990, Tom was making a living as an options trader. He also oversaw two fantasy league baseball teams, a suitable hobby for a man who scrutinized all of the Bill James baseball abstracts.Tom wanted to attend the University of Chicago business school at night. The seven-page essay accompanying his application confided, \u201cI fantasize about owning a major league baseball team,\u201d while at the same time admitting how unlikely that was. Where would he ever get the required boatload of cash? He was a son of the middle class. His family never owned a new car and did not take vacations. As a teenager, to get spending money Tom worked at Burger King or bused tables at a country club.But within a decade, life would bloom with extravagant possibilities. As Tom and his siblings were starting out as young adults in Chicago, their father, Joe Ricketts, was on his way to becoming phenomenally wealthy in Omaha, building the discount brokerage now known as TD Ameritrade. In 2009, at Tom\u2019s instigation, the Rickettses purchased the Cubs for $845 million, using assets from a family education trust he offhandedly described as \u201cmoney we weren\u2019t paying much attention to.\u201dSince then, Chicagoans have grown familiar with the Ricketts siblings and their many enthusiasms. Tom, 49, is the baseball guy, the hands-on chairman of the Cubs. His brothers and sister \u2014 though not their parents \u2014 sit on the team\u2019s five-person board. Pete, 50, a far-to-the-right political conservative, is the Republican nominee for governor of Nebraska. Laura, 47, a lesbian activist, is one of the Democratic Party\u2019s top fund-raisers. Todd, 44, heads Ending Spending, which supports political candidates who promise to balance the federal budget by shrinking the size of government.\u201cNo doubt, we have our differences, but we are an incredibly close family,\u201d said Tom, who calls himself a moderate Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s not a rare thing for me to speak with each of my siblings every day.\u201d\u2022 \u2022 \u2022As Tom Ricketts roams the grandstands, he is often approached by someone elderly who asks a question with genuine urgency: Will the Cubs win the World Series before I die?He is so accustomed to this query he responds with a comic\u2019s sense of timing: \u201cAre you taking good care of yourself? Do you eat right? Are you getting your exercise?\u201dThe house on Hickory Street in Omaha was big and white and had a leaky roof. Laura said her parents \u201cworked all the time.\u201d For a while, Joe did business out of the basement. Then he rented a small office, and his wife, Marlene, gave up her teaching career to join him as a stockbroker. The four children were expected to help on weekends. Tom recalled, \u201cSometimes my dad just sat us in a room and said, \u2018If you\u2019ll put all these things in envelopes, you can have all the sugar cubes you want from the coffee station.\u2019 \u201dJoe\u2019s opportunity at stunning wealth came after the government deregulated commissions on stock trades, allowing brokerages to handle transactions at lower fees. Technology would be the handmaiden of his success. Most customers preferred to make trades without even talking to a broker. Joe provided that freedom, first with touch-tone phones and later with computer keystrokes. He was among the pioneers of these shortcuts and highly adept at advertising them. He became a dot.com billionaire.Pete joined his father at Ameritrade, but Tom had a pioneering idea of his own. In 1999, he started Incapital, an investment banking firm that made it easier for small investors to buy fixed-income securities. \u201cI was doing O.K.,\u201d he said of those days, defining the term \u201cO.K.\u201d as personal earnings in the \u201cmillions but not tens of millions.\u201d He was run-of-the-mill wealthy, not buy-a-baseball-team wealthy.The Cubs were not for sale anyway, though by 2006 Tom expected they soon would be. Tribune Company, anchored in the newspaper business, was in financial trouble. Tom figured the corporation would want to divest itself of the Cubs. He intended to be ready when the team went on the market.For that, he would need his father\u2019s assistance, which was a problem. Joe had an abundance of interests but did not share his children\u2019s love for baseball. The family patriarch rarely gives interviews, but in a speech he recalled asking Tom: \u201cWhy would I want to buy a baseball team \u2014 or any sports team? I\u2019m not a fan. I\u2019m not a spectator. I\u2019ve got A.D.D. I can\u2019t watch a whole game of anything for very long.\u201dIn Tom\u2019s telling, his father warmed to the notion only when the family held a big party, renting some of the rooftop clubs that overlook Wrigley. The ballpark was jammed to capacity. \u201cThey sell out every game,\u201d Tom recalled pointing out slyly. \u201cAnd my father said: \u2018I see what you mean now. This is a business.\u2019 \u201dTom pitched the idea another way as well. By then, TD Ameritrade was big and corporate, no longer a family enterprise. The Cubs could become something purely Ricketts, a \u201csuper fun thing\u201d handed down through the generations. Laura agreed: \u201cHere was a chance to again have a family business.\u201dLaura was in her 30s and a practicing lawyer before she came out as lesbian. She told her family in stages, one or two at a time, first Pete\u2019s wife, then Tom and Cecelia and finally her parents.\u201cEveryone was immediately supportive,\u201d she said. \u201cDad actually encouraged me to help other people come out. He wanted me to be active in the lesbian community. My mom told me: \u2018You\u2019re the same person to me whether you are gay or straight. I love you either way.\u2019 \u201dIt may have been harder for her to reveal herself as a Democrat. \u201cI think all along my family suspected,\u201d Laura said. \u201cThere was kind of like grumbling, people biting their lips and a little bit of teasing.\u201dTom\u2019s baseball fantasy was easy for his siblings to rally around, in part because the idea seemed so far-fetched. Go ahead, knock yourself out, it\u2019ll never happen, they told him. At the time, Pete was busy running for the United States Senate, spending $12 million of his own money in a race he lost by 28 points.The deal required a tortuous two and a half years to complete. In that time, the stock market crashed and Tribune Company went bankrupt. Zell, who can squeeze a dollar like a wet sponge, imposed an intricate set of conditions on prospective buyers. To reduce the taxes he would owe on capital gains, he demanded to retain 5 percent of the team and required that the deal be financed with a huge amount of debt.\u201cIt was the most complicated transaction I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Joe Ricketts said.But Tom doggedly pushed it along. And finally, he was able to walk across his own field of dreams. The ballpark itself was a national treasure, a place of elegant simplicity with an iconic, hand-operated scoreboard. The contour of the ivy-covered outfield walls, in the words of the Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamin, curved \u201cgracefully like the undulating green hills of a Grant Wood painting.\u201d The view beyond was an uninterrupted look into the brick-and-stone landscape of the city.On the other hand, Wrigley Field also was pretty much a dump, an edifice with a crumbling concrete shell and grimy, narrow interior concourses. Players complained of the worst clubhouses in baseball. Fans often waited to get into a bathroom as if they were in the immigration line at a border crossing.When Tom moved into his new office, an aide advised him how to strategically place the mousetraps.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Tom Ricketts\u2019s clothes look remarkably well pressed among all the tank tops and cutoffs in the grandstands. He tells a fan from South Carolina, \u201cWelcome to the greatest place on earth.\u201dThen he begins a short lecture on the high price of preserving greatness: \u201cThis upper deck was built in 1927 and it cost only $250,000. It\u2019ll cost us more than $250 million just to fix this place up.\u201dTribune Company\u2019s corporate heart had too gone aflutter at the thought of a historic World Series. It pursued the quest by becoming one of baseball\u2019s biggest spenders. The Cubs came five outs from the N.L. pennant in 2003, unforgettably unraveling after a loyal fan \u2014 Steve Bartman \u2014 reached out to catch a foul fly ball that might otherwise have been caught by a Cubs outfielder. The team\u2019s fortunes then went up and down like the lines on an EKG. In one upswing the Cubs won their division in 2007 and 2008, the latter a season in which attendance rose to a record 3.3 million. Wrigley Field cannot get much more stuffed than that.But Tom Ricketts was wrong to think he still had the core of a championship team. In 2010, his first season as owner, the Cubs did possess a star-packed roster that included Derrek Lee, Aramis Ramirez, Alfonso Soriano and Carlos Zambrano; eight players were earning more than $12 million apiece. But the team was largely notable for its lethargy, finishing third in major league payroll but only fifth in the N.L. Central. Its record was 75-87. The next year was more miserable yet. The Cubs ended up 71-91.Ricketts would come to think of these initial seasons as \u201ca lot like buying a house the day after there was a big party inside, walked in, food on the floor, beer cans all over the place, a guy that nobody knows sleeping on the couch.\u201d He concluded: \u201cWe didn\u2019t buy the party; we bought the hangover.\u201d\u201cWe needed to take a real deep breath and start fresh,\u201d Ricketts recalled.He said he wanted to find a way to \u201cclimb out of the lobster pot\u201d once and for all, to be a consistent playoff contender like the Boston Red Sox, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Tampa Bay Rays. He sought advice from about 20 baseball people he regarded highly: general managers, other owners, former players, agents. He wanted to win while at the same time excelling by the sensible businesslike metric \u201cwins per dollars spent.\u201dHis final question during these talks was always: Who should I hire to run the baseball side of things?He remembered, \u201cAll but one said Theo Epstein, but you can\u2019t get him.\u201dFrom the start, he said, he and Ricketts agreed the Cubs required a gut rehab, with a reallocation of resources to scouting, the draft and the development of younger players. Older players would be dealt for high-upside prospects, sacrificing wins in the present for wins in the future. This was a strategy of delayed gratification, with the length of the delay vexingly uncertain.Epstein said: \u201cAt our first meeting, I asked Tom in several ways, some indirect, about his stomach for living through the tough period ahead and whether he\u2019d have the patience and the broad shoulders and thick skin necessary. My sense after intense probing is that this guy was extraordinarily patient.\u201d\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Ricketts finds one of his favorite fans, 12-year-old Natalie Adorno of suburban Bensenville, Ill. A Wrigley Field regular, she has skipped school so many times to attend games that some of her classmates have taken to calling her Ferris Bueller. \u201cWere you out here early for batting practice?\u201d Tom asks, and of course she was.Politely, as if embarrassed, Natalie mentions, \u201cWe need a few runs.\u201dAgainst all discernible evidence, Ricketts replies, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll get them.\u201dThe Chicago City Council designated Wrigley Field a landmark in 2004, a distinction that also meant any changes to the ballpark\u2019s historic features now required approval by a politically appointed mayoral commission. The team\u2019s management had preferred not to be hamstrung this way, but Richard M. Daley, a White Sox fan, was then the mayor and he liked neither Tribune Company nor the Cubs.From the start, Tom Ricketts, Bleacher Bum, said reverential things about Wrigley Field, calling it a place with a unique vibe. \u201cWe can\u2019t mess with that special feeling,\u201d he said of the ballpark.But Ricketts, the entrepreneur, also used phrases like \u201cgrowing the business\u201d and \u201cmonetizing the brand,\u201d and he said to preserve the ballpark and develop a winning team every possible revenue opportunity had to be explored. This seemed reasonable enough, and yet some wondered what a more commercialized Wrigley Field would look like: Did he really say he was considering a Jumbotron?\u201cTom had sounded like such a down-to-earth guy, fulfilling his dream to own a baseball team,\u201d said Jim Spencer, president of the East Lake View Neighbors Association and a man who lives a block from the ballpark. Like many in the community, he had begun to slowly sour on Ricketts. \u201cI think his dream was actually to go into the advertising and real estate business.\u201dThe Cubs\u2019 finances were rather opaque. Forbes magazine usually ranked them among baseball\u2019s most profitable franchises. But expensive long-term contracts with aging veterans were still on the books. The team was saddled with huge debt payments from the arduous terms of its acquisition. A likely bonanza in TV revenue lay ahead; other teams in major markets would soon be reaping billion-dollar deals. But the Cubs could not count on that yet. They were not fully free to negotiate a new TV deal until 2019.\u201cWhen you look at the Wrigley Field equation from a distance, we\u2019ve got a pretty leaky bucket here,\u201d said Crane Kenney, a top Cubs executive under Tribune Company. Ricketts had kept him on as his chief of business operations, and Kenney was superb at poor-mouthing, calling the franchise a victim of circumstance. He said, \u201cNo other major league team operates with the same restrictions we do.\u201dIt may be nice to have Wrigley Field situated in a thriving neighborhood, within blocks of homes valued at $1 million and more. But city ordinances reflected the concerns of that residential community, Kenney said. The number of night games was limited. The same was true for concerts. Little space was available for the Cubs to operate lucrative parking lots. The team was constrained from selling the kind of brightly lit ad space that dominated the view above outfield walls in most other ballparks.\u201cI gave Tom a long list of things we ought to do, and my expectation was he\u2019d say something like, O.K., do one, three, five, seven and eight but the rest either cost too much or will take too much time,\u201d Kenney recalled. \u201cHe told me, O.K., go ahead. I asked, go ahead with which ones? He said, all, let\u2019s do them all.\u201dWithin months of taking over, Ricketts asked the city\u2019s permission to place a 360-square-foot illuminated display of the Toyota logo above the left-field bleachers, something that would net the team $2 million. The backlash was immediate, with some likening the sign to a zit on the nose of baseball\u2019s prettiest face.Ricketts was dismayed: such a fuss over one sign! He wrote a letter to the public, arguing \u201cthe landmark designation was never intended to put Wrigley Field in a time capsule.\u201d Ernie Banks, Mr. Cub himself, was enlisted to lobby the city landmarks commission, which in the end approved a less luminous version of the towering Toyota display. To win the support of Alderman Tom Tunney, whose ward includes Wrigley Field, the Cubs had to agree to a four-year moratorium on additional signs.Ricketts was getting an introduction to local politics. Tunney, who can be abrasive, kept reminding him the friendly confines were exactly that: confined. \u201cThe Cubs campus is about three and a quarter acres, which is very small,\u201d the alderman said. \u201cIt was built for a different time and era, really before cars were much of a mode of transportation. Most new stadiums are built around 30 acres of planned development.\u201dTunney added, \u201cNo one begrudges a man trying to maximize his investment, but government has a role in protecting the residents who have concerns about what those investments will mean to them.\u201dIn fact, the Ricketts family wanted to undertake an extensive renovation of Wrigley Field, a gargantuan project with plans that eventually came to include new concrete and steel throughout, a substantial expansion of concession areas, a new roof above the upper deck, the restoration of historic aspects of the building\u2019s facade, new light standards for one of baseball\u2019s most dimly lit outfields, a relocation of the bullpens to a space beneath the bleachers, new dugouts and clubhouses, an underground batting tunnel and even an auditorium. The cost would inflate to a whopping $375 million.Other Chicago teams had received public money to build new stadiums, a common practice throughout the country, and the Rickettses believed they were similarly entitled. They wanted to substantially fund the makeover using a city amusement tax already tacked on to ticket prices. \u201cThis money was to come out of receipts generated right here at Wrigley Field,\u201d Laura said. \u201cIt was a win-win for everybody.\u201dBut this was the wrong time to wag a tin cup. Chicago faced a staggering debt in its pension system, and Rahm Emanuel, the city\u2019s new mayor, never seriously considered the Cubs\u2019 request for public funds.Joe Ricketts had stepped down from any role in TD Ameritrade, focusing instead on new business ventures, charitable causes and a personal crusade against government waste. After the article appeared, he said the provocative anti-Obama campaign was merely one of many proposals submitted to Ending Spending by various political consultants and nothing he would have seriously considered.But the aftertaste lingered in Chicago. Emanuel had been Obama\u2019s White House chief of staff. He called the proposal an insult to the president and the nation.The Cubs were on an early-season 13-game losing streak, and this off-the-field rhubarb only added to the distress. Tom Ricketts issued a statement repudiating racially divisive politics, insisting his father felt the same way. Laura responded by generously praising both the president and her father.Theo Epstein reacted in his own fashion. He agreed to headline an Obama fund-raiser, $1,000 a guest.\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Tom has seen a line of frustrated fans waiting to get into an overcrowded Cubs gift shop. A line! A line thwarting the eager from parting with their money!He says: \u201cWhat kind of business model is that? What would any business school say?\u201dTwenty-four years ago, when Tom and Pete were living across the street from Wrigley Field, their landlord was George Loukas, the son of an immigrant steelworker. \u201cI graduated from high school with a D-minus average,\u201d he said, and that information is meant as a boast because he is clearly nobody\u2019s fool.Loukas, a substitute gym teacher, was careful with his money, and in 1974 he and his brother put down a $5,000 deposit on a 16-unit, $135,000 building at the corner of Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, just beyond the Wrigley Field scoreboard. The neighborhood was somewhat seedy back then. Heroin was for sale on many of the streets that led into the friendly confines. So were women of a certain sort.Loukas painted his apartments and raised the rent to $75 a month. The roof of the building was made of tar, and every now and then he and a few friends slathered on suntan lotion and climbed up there to watch a game on garden chairs. One of those pals said he knew others who would pay $5 apiece to join them and speculated they would add a few bucks more to get a hamburger. Loukas brought up a Weber grill.Much the same was happening up and down Waveland and Sheffield. Jim Lourgos, a young lawyer, was a partner in a rundown building. Someone offered $300 to rent the rooftop for an afternoon.\u201cWe held their beers as they climbed the ladder,\u201d Lourgos recalled, \"and passed them along as they got to the top.\u201dIn 1984, a Cubs team with Ryne Sandberg, that season\u2019s N.L. most valuable player, and Rick Sutcliffe, who captured the Cy Young Award, nearly won the pennant, losing a best-of-five playoff series to San Diego after going up, two games to none. Tickets were hard to come by late that season and the rooftops were bursting with the overflow, people pushing right up to the edge.TV cameras adored the image of these teeming rooftops, as did the Cubs announcer Harry Caray. Indeed, everyone seemed to love these informal appendages to the ballpark except the Cubs\u2019 front office. In 2002, a windscreen was erected to block the view from Waveland Avenue.Chicagoans immediately took sides. To some, the rooftop owners were plucky entrepreneurs who had merely answered when opportunity knocked. To others, they were leeches. Some of these entrepreneurs were not average Joes but real estate heavyweights who had thrived as the neighborhood gentrified. Loukas owned three apartment buildings and three taverns, including the hugely popular Cubby Bear lounge, which was cater-corner to Wrigley\u2019s main entrance.The Cubs eventually shifted tactics, removing the windscreen and instead going to court, suing the rooftop owners in 2003. A legal battle over intellectual property rights seemed in the offing until a federal magistrate strongly encouraged both sides to settle. A hastily written contract satisfied the aggrieved Cubs with 17 percent of each rooftop owner\u2019s gross revenues for the next 20 years.This would cost the rooftop owners a combined $3 million to $4 million annually, but for them it was a liberating expense. The way they understood the deal, they were now guaranteed a view into the ballpark through 2023. Some owners of the 15 rooftop businesses kept their operations modest, little more than gradually rising rows of metal bleachers. But most borrowed millions of dollars to upgrade their buildings into vessels of luxury, with elevators leading to different levels of air-conditioned indoor suites. Guests on the roof could linger at an outdoor bar or watch the game from cushioned seats.Lourgos, a lawyer, gutted his building of all but its facade. Then he borrowed nearly $5 million to construct a three-story club that attracted corporate clients, he said.An excursion to a Wrigley rooftop was intended to replace a company\u2019s golf outing or its cruise on the Chicago River. There was ample space for up to 200 guests to hobnob; they were served food and drinks at a price of up to $200 a head. That\u2019s $40,000 a game.For an avid Cubs fan, eyes riveted on the action, a rooftop was a satisfactory observation post only when compared with a knothole. Not only was the view distant, but large parts of the field were also impossible to see, especially the outfield\u2019s deepest terrain. One of Loukas\u2019s rooftops was situated so far into foul territory that the pitcher\u2019s mound and the batter\u2019s box were blocked by the overhang of Wrigley Field\u2019s upper deck.On the other hand, anyone turning his back to the game was rewarded with a panoramic view of the cityscape \u2014 glimpses of Lake Michigan and the Loop and the elevated trains snaking north and south.Rooftop owners enjoyed profitable times. And when the Ricketts family bought the Cubs, Tom invited them and their families for a friendly breakfast at the ballpark. Loukas, now 65, remembered his former tenants Pete and Tom. \u201cI told myself, hey, this is great,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are nice people from Nebraska.\u201cReally, everything at this breakfast was kumbaya.\u201d\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Tom always carries a black sack with a dozen baseballs, each stamped with the day\u2019s date. But by the time he reaches Section 530 these gifts are gone. Karen Patterson, a 25-year-old fan in a Cubs shirt, hurries down from Row 5 so she can meet him. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased you guys are fixing up Wrigley,\u201d she says.Tom nods appreciatively. He says, \u201cUnfortunately, it has been a lot harder than it should have been.\u201dTheo Epstein\u2019s plan for a gut rehab of the roster was going well, especially the gutting. The team lost 101 games in 2012, a sorry enough performance to \u201cearn\u201d the Cubs the second pick in the 2013 draft as a measure of solace. This became third baseman Kris Bryant, a presumed cornerstone of the rehab who was recently named minor league player of the year by Baseball America. With the Cubs performing so poorly, they were happy to redirect fans\u2019 attention toward players apprenticing in their farm system in places like Des Moines; Kodak, Tenn.; Daytona Beach, Fla.; and Boise, Idaho.The team\u2019s major league payroll had dropped from an opening day total of $147 million to $88 million. But the team was spending more money on young international talent, a new baseball academy in the Dominican Republic and, with the help of public funds, new spring training facilities in Arizona.\u201cThere is a plan in place and we are sticking to it,\u201d said Ricketts, who sometimes talked of lost games as if they were actually wins prudently stashed in a savings account, like contributions to a 401(k) plan.As for the ballpark itself, in early 2013 he announced that the family itself would finance the expensive renovations. Additionally, the Rickettses planned to invest $200 million for a plaza with office and retail space next to the ballpark as well as a nearby 175-room hotel. These projects would provide a $500 million to $600 million booster shot to Chicago\u2019s economy, which was heartily welcomed by the mayor.From that point, the Cubs were no longer beggars but choosers. In lieu of public money, Ricketts asked for concessions from the city, including permission to hold more night games and concerts, something many people in the neighborhood opposed. The Cubs also wanted approval to erect numerous signs in and around the ballpark that would generate a continuing stream of advertising revenue. Additional signage had helped finance renovations at baseball\u2019s other great heirloom, Fenway Park in Boston.Ricketts got most of what he wanted. Alderman Tunney was again involved in the negotiations and he said the mayor\u2019s office essentially decided that \u201cone of the most generous sign packages ever\u201d was a reasonable trade-off for the Rickettses\u2019 willingness to spend their own money. He added ruefully: \u201cThere will be advertisements coming out of everywhere. We will have our own little Times Square right here at the corner of Clark and Addison.\u201dPlans called for most of the ads to glow within the open-air plaza, which would also include a farmers\u2019 market and ice rink. But the city landmarks commission also approved two signs deemed essential to what Ricketts called \u201cthe battle to control our own outfield.\u201d One would rise above the right-field wall, covering 650 square feet. The other was a 5,700-square-foot video board, one of the biggest in baseball, dominating the area above the left-field wall with a brightly lit rectangle three times the size of the familiar center-field scoreboard.The prospect of this video board delighted those who thought it would bring the ballpark into the 21st century with a continuing flow of visual entertainment. Others were appalled. Cheryl Kent, an architecture writer and critic, called it \u201can animated monster\u201d that would ruin \u201cthe essential intimacy\u201d of Wrigley Field.By then, Ricketts was reminding people the ballpark was \u201cnot a museum.\u201d Besides, he said, surveys showed the Cubs faithful wanted a video board: \u201cWhen you ask fans, would you like to see signs in the outfield, they say no, not really. But when you tell them those signs will help the team win, they say yes, of course.\u201dThis was the new hard sell: Anything impeding revenue was postponing the Cubs\u2019 resurrection. The Oakland Athletics may have played great baseball in a dilapidated ballpark; the Rays may have fielded a winner despite low attendance. But to escape the quicksand of failure, the Cubs, Ricketts said, required additional revenue from a renovated ballpark and huge outfield signs. The video board alone would earn the team $5 million to $7 million a year, he said.The rooftop owners, of course, had objections beyond aesthetics. Views from some of their buildings would be obstructed by the two signs, and they believed they had a contract prohibiting that.Ricketts said his lawyers had concluded otherwise, and yet he still feared what the rooftop owners might do to gum up the works. What if they won an injunction to stop construction after it began, he asked. Ricketts said no renovations would start unless the rooftop owners promised not to sue.This was an unusual ultimatum, a demand for adversaries to renounce their legal rights. The mayor asked Alderman Patrick O\u2019Connor, a veteran pol, to mediate negotiations between the Cubs and the rooftops\u2019 owners. No deal was reached, and the alderman found the talks frustrating. The 15 rooftops were hardly united as one voice. \u201cThe right-field guys don\u2019t necessarily agree with the left-field guys,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. Some of the businesses were owned by consortiums.But the Cubs were also attempting a real estate squeeze play; by interfering with the view into the ballpark the signs were likely to drive down the value of the rooftop businesses. Kenney, the head of the Cubs\u2019 business operations, said the team made firm offers to buy each of the buildings, which some owners deny. Other rooftop owners said the Cubs were lowballing them, pricing the properties as if they still housed apartments rather than luxury spaces for corporate parties.\u201cThey can have my buildings, but I need to get fair value,\u201d said Loukas, who sarcastically suggested if the Cubs truly wanted to increase profitability, they ought to field a better team.Indeed, while the Cubs were known as lovable losers, the absence of winning had not made the heart grow fonder. Paid attendance has fallen by about 100,000 a year since the Ricketts family took over, and while the Cubs still outdraw two of every three major league clubs, lower gate receipts now annually reduce revenue by about $30 million a year, Ricketts admitted. Other estimates go higher.Business on the rooftops has similarly declined as corporate outings to a Cubs game have lost cachet. Small groups and even individuals can now buy rooftop tickets on the Internet. Admission is sometimes sold as a Groupon deal, making the rooftops direct rivals with the Cubs for ordinary fans.In January, at the annual Cubs convention, both Ricketts and Kenney once again singled out the rooftop problem as the final obstacle before any renovations could begin. Ricketts poked fun at the owners of the buildings, likening them not only to neighbors who peek through your window to watch Showtime on your TV but also to profiteers who charge others to do the same.Beth Murphy, 59, owns a small rooftop business beside her tavern, Murphy\u2019s Bleachers. She said she found it dumbfounding to be portrayed as a villain. Murphy has been a Bleacher Bum since she was a teenager; she used to have a schoolgirl crush on third baseman Ron Santo.She said, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be considered the reason the Cubs can\u2019t win the World Series.\u201d\u2022 \u2022 \u2022Tom has signed about an hour\u2019s worth of hats, shirts and scorecards, and his hands are flecked with black ink from his Sharpie. He is heading down a ramp from the upper deck when he sees another of those things that drive him nuts. There\u2019s an ugly wall of decaying wood behind rusty iron mesh.\u201cHow do you let a jewel like Wrigley Field deteriorate so much?\u201d he says, shaking his head.On May 21, with the current baseball season seven weeks old, Tom Ricketts issued a video message to the fans that made the Cubs seem even more pitiable than their record at the time, which was 16-28. He stood in the team\u2019s clubhouse, demonstrating how batters were forced to warm up by hitting a ball off a tee like the tiniest of Little Leaguers. Baseball\u2019s other 29 teams had the benefit of indoor batting cages, he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s time to invest in Wrigley Field and to do the things our competitors do.\u201dHe then started in again on his archnemeses. \u201cUnfortunately, it seems like my family\u2019s plans for Wrigley Field have gotten lost in a dispute with the rooftops,\u201d he said, this time adding a twist: The Cubs were going ahead with the ballpark renovations even if that meant they\u2019d be sued. \u201cWe cannot delay any longer,\u201d Ricketts said with a touch of melodrama. \u201cThe time to build a winner is now.\u201dNegotiations with the rooftops may have been fruitless, but the year delay in breaking ground now allowed the Cubs to go back to the city landmarks commission with an expanded wish list for the renovations: extended bleacher seating, a new patio atop the right-field wall, more luxury suites. Instead of two signs above the outfield, the team now wanted seven.\u201cThe Rickettses are very smart,\u201d said Lourgos, one of the rooftop owners. He thought the Cubs had played their hand masterfully. \u201cThey kept their money in their pockets until they got what they wanted. Their asks keep changing; they always want more.\u201dIn July, the commission unanimously approved the expanded renovation plans, which finally set off a lawsuit by some of the rooftop owners. They sued the commission rather than the team, saying the landmarks ordinance for Wrigley Field had been improperly interpreted.Ricketts said the renovations would begin anyway. Outfield signs will be erected before next season, he said, and the renovations should be completed before opening day in 2018. He said the video board \u2014 eye-catching as an enormous TV set \u2014 will make the ballpark a better place. \u201cWrigley will still be Wrigley,\u201d he promised. \u201cIt will still be beautiful and it will be a lot more functional.\u201dWhatever happens, the Cubs have not entirely eschewed public money. The bleacher expansion requires an extension of Wrigley Field\u2019s exterior walls, and the city is giving the Cubs the necessary sidewalk space and a parking lane. The ballpark is likely to be placed on the National Register of Historic Places, making the team eligible for federal tax credits that may amount to $50 million or more.The landmarks commission\u2019s action occurred exactly a week after the Cubs traded Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel, two pitchers who were having excellent seasons. The key player received in return from the Oakland Athletics was Addison Russell, 20, playing in the minor leagues at the Class AA level.Epstein said he foresaw the Cubs becoming a contender in the next year or two, with the team\u2019s best young players blossoming just as increased ballpark revenue provides him a fattened budget to add free agents. \u201cThe two great currencies in baseball these days are money and impactful young players,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a chance to have as much of these currencies as anybody.\u201cThat\u2019s like going to Vegas with a sound mind and thick wallet. There are no guarantees. I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019ll win a championship in 2017, just like I can\u2019t tell you we\u2019ll hit blackjack. But we are positioned to make a nice long run if we continue on this path.\u201dHe again emphasized there were no guarantees; young players can fizzle or get hurt. But then he grew excited, going off the record to name the Cubs\u2019 starting lineup of the future, speculating who will someday get M.V.P. votes and who will merely be All-Stars. He named some of the free agents he thought he would be able to sign, a 70 percent chance on this player, a 40 percent chance on another.Ricketts is equally optimistic. Five years of terrible baseball, like compost, is nourishing the future. \u201cThe brand lovable losers is dead to us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon be lovable winners.\u201dHe paused, adding, \u201cI really mean it.\u201dThe Cubs are 69-86 heading into the final week of the season.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scottish Referendum Will Reverberate", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 Astonishing as it was to contemplate the breakup of Europe\u2019s most stable nation-state, we now have to consider an even more extraordinary possibility. In the days since Scottish voters rejected secession, a new threat has appeared out of nowhere to blight Britain\u2019s political and economic prospects for years ahead. It now looks as though the United Kingdom may be dissolved not by a referendum, but by one rogue opinion poll. The poll in question was the YouGov survey published shortly before last week\u2019s referendum, which found nationalists overtaking unionists for the first time (and, as it turned out, the last time). This triggered hysteria among Britain\u2019s establishment politicians \u2014 and a promise of unprecedented fiscal devolution to Scotland, combined with the indefinite continuation of public spending subsidies worth 1,700 pounds, or $2,800, per head. The danger, not yet fully appreciated by international investors and political analysts, lies in the unintended consequences of these panic-stricken promises. The upshot is that the referendum, far from restoring Britain\u2019s political stability, marks the start of a new era of constitutional turmoil that will damage the government\u2019s re-election chances and could well revive fears of Britain breaking up. This is because the promises made to Scotland have propelled to the top of the political agenda a constitutional demand that was previously disregarded by all but a fringe of extreme English populists: the idea of creating an English government, with powers similar to Scotland\u2019s, either by electing a new, separate English parliament or by denying votes on English issues to members of the British Parliament from seats outside England.At first sight, this reform would offer Prime Minister David Cameron a huge political advantage. His Conservatives hold only nine of 117 parliamentary seats in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but 296 of the 533 English seats. Until recently, this partisan benefit was so obvious that few Conservatives dared to openly campaign for a separate English government. But a powerful backlash against the inducements offered last week to Scottish voters has suddenly made demands for conferred respectability on the slogan \u201cEnglish votes for English laws.\u201dBetter still for the Conservatives, this slogan appears to have undercut the Labour Party, which is over-represented in Scotland and Wales. If Labour backs \u201cEnglish votes for English laws,\u201d it condemns itself to permanent minority status in England. But if Labour resists this seemingly fair principle, it appears undemocratic and venal. Hence the widespread assumption among political analysts that Mr. Cameron has plucked victory from the jaws of defeat. But this assumption is probably wrong. Espousal of English independence may initially look to the Conservatives like a no-lose proposition, but like many cunning wheezes intended as time-bombs for political opponents, this one is likely to blow up in its designer\u2019s face. For Mr. Cameron, the campaign for Scottish-style devolution in England poses three existential problems. The gravest, though least probable, risk is that Mr. Cameron actually tries to deliver English autonomy after winning the election next May. A breakup of the United Kingdom would then be back on the agenda, driven by English instead of Scottish voters. This is because a Scottish-style separation of English from United Kingdom issues would be impossible. England is simply too large to be governed separately on major issues. With 84 percent of Britain\u2019s population and a slightly higher share of total gross domestic product, decisions made by English parliamentarians on major fiscal or social issues would dominate conditions in Britain as a whole. If, for example, England were granted the same autonomy as Scotland to vote separately on income taxes and health and welfare funding, the Parliament in Westminster would be rendered powerless. If, on the other hand, such crucial votes were reserved to the British government, then the devolution of power to England would be rendered meaningless, since the central government would retain control over all key decisions on English taxes and public spending. This fiscal conundrum provides just one example of how destabilizing the debate about English devolution could become. Creating English institutions with powers analogous to the Scottish government\u2019s may seem reasonable, but it would do to the United Kingdom what Boris N. Yeltsin\u2019s Russian government did to Mikhail S. Gorbachev\u2019s Soviet Union. Once Mr. Yeltsin asserted the primacy of his Russian government on issues like taxes and social spending in 1990, Mr. Gorbachev was left with an empty shell and the Soviet Union ceased to exist 18 months later. England\u2019s dominance in Britain is even greater than was Russia\u2019s in the Soviet Union. This gross imbalance rules out any symmetry between Scotland and England in a German-style federal structure.This leads to the second problem for Mr. Cameron: Voters will soon realize the momentous implications of English devolution and will probably turn against the Conservatives for advocating something so radical and dangerous on a timetable absurdly truncated for partisan reasons. If Britain really wants to transform its constitution, it should make this decision after years of debate, perhaps backed up by a referendum, not in the heat of an eight-month general election campaign. The final problem for the Conservatives is simply that Mr. Cameron will recognize the two dangers outlined above and will sensibly back away from radical English devolution. Unfortunately, such prudence will be denounced as cowardice by Conservative radicals, damaging Mr. Cameron\u2019s credibility and deepening the splits between the party leadership and the majority of its members of Parliament and activists, especially on the explosive issue of membership in the European Union.Whether all this turmoil will fatally damage the British government\u2019s re-election chances is impossible to say, especially if the economy keeps improving. But here are two firm predictions: An election that Mr. Cameron planned to fight on economic issues will now be dominated by debate about a huge constitutional upheaval. And whoever ends up winning next May, Britain in the next eight months will feel like one of the least stable countries in Europe. That, in turn, will mean many more market panics driven by rogue opinion polls. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Draghi Praises Lithuania as Economic Example to Europe", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDuring a visit to the capital of Vilnius on Thursday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, cited Lithuania as a model for other eurozone countries because of the way it overcame a brutal economic downturn in 2009 to become one of the fastest-growing members of the European Union.\u201cCertainly it is a powerful message to everybody else,\u201d Mr. Draghi said during a news conference.Mr. Draghi\u2019s visit, to mark Lithuania\u2019s impending membership in the eurozone, happened to come on the same day that the euro currency hit a nearly two-year low against the United States dollar. While the weak euro is good news for export countries including Lithuania, because it makes their products cheaper in foreign markets, it was also a sign of how warily investors view growth prospects in Europe compared with the United States.The strong dollar and weak euro translated into a bad day Thursday for European stocks, which were down broadly in a late sell-off partly in sympathy with a big dip in United States stocks.Lithuania, which will adopt the euro in January, provided an example of what Mr. Draghi clearly would like to see more of in the eurozone, which is in danger of slipping back into recession. The country, Mr. Draghi said, was an example of \u201cgrowth-friendly consolidation.\u201d In other words, Lithuania showed it was possible to corral government spending and debt in the midst of a steep downturn, and ultimately return to growth.Economic output in Lithuania plunged 15 percent in 2009 after the financial crisis. But the country of 3 million people, which pegged its currency, the litas, to the euro in 2002, stayed the course. Instead of allowing the litas to devalue, the government embarked on a harsh austerity program, cutting the government deficit to 2.1 percent of gross domestic product last year, from 9.4 percent in 2009.Lithuania\u2019s Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Estonia, underwent similar transformations, making them paragons of a kind of virtue that some Europeans would like big eurozone countries like France and Italy to exhibit.\u201cThe Baltic countries have demonstrated that adjustment is possible \u2014 even without currency devaluation,\u201d Mr. Draghi said at an event organized by the Bank of Lithuania, the country\u2019s central bank.Last year, the Lithuanian economy grew 3.3 percent. This year growth will slow to 2.9 percent, according to an estimate by the Bank of Lithuania, crimped in part by the retaliatory Russian sanctions. But Lithuania will nonetheless remain among the most dynamic economies in the European Union.Not everyone agrees that the Baltic countries are an example for others. During the Draghi news conference, a Lithuanian reporter pointed out that the economic downturn had prompted huge numbers of Lithuanians to leave the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere.Mr. Draghi agreed that the mass exodus was unfortunate, but predicted that many people would return now that the economy was improving. \u201cWhen countries go back to growth, you have the opposite flows of immigration,\u201d he said.In any case, the euro currency union may not be the economic draw it once was. Recent data has raised concerns that the eurozone economy is slowing, which is damaging the currency\u2019s global value. At 1.27 to the dollar on Thursday, the euro was at its lowest point since November 2012. It has fallen 9 percent since May.A weaker euro is good for exporters inside the currency zone \u2014 or, like Lithuania, anchored to it \u2014 because it makes German cars or Italian shoes less expensive abroad. But it is also a verdict on the eurozone economy, a sign that investors believe they can earn a better return on dollars than euros.In another sign of the eurozone\u2019s questionable health, the European Central Bank published data on Thursday indicating that lending to private corporations, excluding banks, continued to decline, although the falloff was occurring at a slightly slower rate.The central bank has already cut its benchmark interest rate to a record 0.05 percent in an effort to end the credit crisis. And Mr. Draghi repeated Thursday that the bank remained ready to go further than it already has to stimulate the eurozone economy.But his praise of Lithuania was a variation on a theme he has repeated in recent statements and speeches \u2014 namely that the European Central Bank can do only so much, and that the onus is on eurozone governments to remove obstacles to entrepreneurship so their economies can grow more quickly.\u201cWe can draw an important lesson from the Baltic experience,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cGovernments not only acted boldly, but also immediately. They used the momentum of the crisis to implement the necessary consolidation and thus managed to convince the public of the need for these measures.\u201d\u201cThe Baltic case,\u201d he added, \u201cshows that \u2014 while consolidation might weigh temporarily on economic growth in the short term \u2014 it is the basis for sustainable growth in the longer run.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S.D.A. to Start Program to Support Local and Organic Farming ", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States Department of Agriculture plans to announce Monday that it will spend $52 million to support local and regional food systems like farmers\u2019 markets and food hubs and to spur research on organic farming. The local food movement has been one of the fastest growing segments of the business, as consumers seek to know more about where, how and by whom their food is grown. But local farmers still struggle to market their food. Distribution systems are intended to accommodate the needs of large-scale commercial farms and growers. Grocery stores and restaurants largely rely on big distribution centers and are only beginning to figure out how to incorporate small batches of produce into their overall merchandise mixes.\u201cThese types of local food systems are the cornerstones of our plans to revitalize the rural economy,\u201d Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf you can connect local produce with markets that are local, money gets rolled around in the local community more directly compared to commercial agriculture where products get shipped in large quantities somewhere else, helping the economy there.\u201dStill, Mr. Kastel said that given the growth in the organic business, with about $35 billion in sales in the United States last year, he wished there was more money to study organic practices.The department will also be putting $30 million a year into marketing programs for farmers markets and promotion of locally grown foods, and has an additional $70 million available as a block grant to support more research on so-called specialty crops, or fruits and vegetables.\u201cThese are significant increases over what it was before I became secretary and certainly over the 2008 bill,\u201d Mr. Vilsack said, referring to the previous omnibus farm bill.He said local food systems were good investments for government. \u201cSmall and medium-sized operations end up helping to generate more employment than commercial operations because of their different distribution systems and their local natures,\u201d Mr. Vilsack said. \u201cAnd food hubs hire about 20 people on average.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Presses Chinese on Global Warming", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Obama, emboldened by his use of executive powers to fight climate change at home, challenged China on Tuesday to make the same effort to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions and join a worldwide campaign to curb global warming.Declaring that the United States and China \u2014 the world\u2019s two largest economies and largest polluters \u2014 bear a \u201cspecial responsibility to lead,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cThat\u2019s what big nations have to do.\u201dThe president\u2019s remarks at the United Nations Climate Summit, delivered in a packed chamber of the General Assembly, were broadly aimed at marshaling more than 100 world leaders to confront climate change. But his words were directly focused on putting the onus on China, an essential partner of the United States if a global climate treaty is to be negotiated by 2015. Unless Beijing and Washington can resolve their differences, climate experts said, few other countries will agree to the treaty and it will most likely founder.Mr. Obama made it clear that after taking the political risks in June of proposing a far-reaching Environmental Protection Agency regulation to force American power plants to curb their carbon emissions, he now expected the Chinese to do likewise. There were indications that China might be ready with its own plan, although many experts say they will be skeptical until Chinese officials reveal the details. The decision of President Xi Jinping of China to skip the summit meeting also sent a less-than-enthusiastic message.But a senior Chinese official sent in Mr. Xi\u2019s place said his country would try to reach a peak level of carbon emissions \u201cas early as possible.\u201d That suggested that the Chinese government, struggling with air pollution so extreme that it has threatened economic growth, regularly kept millions of children indoors and ignited street protests, was determined to show faster progress in curbing emissions. \u201cAs a responsible major developing country, China will make an even greater effort to address climate change and take on international responsibilities that are commensurate with our national conditions,\u201d said the official, Vice Prime Minister Zhang Gaoli, who addressed the chamber after Mr. Obama.The president and Mr. Zhang met briefly at the summit meeting on Tuesday, before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech. In his remarks, Mr. Obama said he had pressed Mr. Zhang on the urgency for both countries to take the lead, and noted that he and the Chinese president had already reached an accord to cut the use of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent category of greenhouse gases.The United States, he said, would meet a pledge to reduce its carbon emissions by 17 percent, from 2005 levels, by 2020 \u2014 a goal that is in large part expected to be met through the proposed E.P.A. regulation. Now, Mr. Obama said, the United States is preparing ambitious new targets to cut emissions further by 2050, with specifics to be made public ahead of a climate summit meeting in Paris in 2015. Other nations are expected to submit their own plans. With its surging use of coal, China has overtaken the United States as the world\u2019s largest greenhouse gas polluter. But in the past year, as thousands of Chinese have protested the reliance on coal and its contribution to some of the world\u2019s dirtiest air, Chinese authorities have signaled that they intend to adopt policies to reduce the use of coal.\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard on this plan, looking at what kind of changes we will make to industry,\u201d Li Junfeng, director general of China\u2019s National Center for Climate Change Strategy, said in an interview.Mr. Li said that his center had prepared \u201cmultiple choice\u201d options for a proposed climate plan, and that Beijing would choose one to put forth based on the perceived stringency of the American plan for emissions cuts by 2050.In recent years, the Chinese government has sent other signals about addressing carbon pollution, some of them encouraging to environmental experts. It has created seven regional cap-and-trade plans aimed at cutting carbon pollution from coal plants, and in August, a Chinese government official suggested that China was exploring the possibility of a national cap-and-trade plan. \u201cFive years ago, it was almost unimaginable to discuss China putting a cap on carbon, but now that is happening,\u201d said Lo Sze Ping, chief executive officer of the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s office in Beijing. \u201cChinese leaders have seen that it is imperative to move toward a low-carbon economy.\u201dThe modest Chinese steps are ahead of some other major polluters who are unlikely to submit emission-cuts plans ahead of 2015. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia remains an outspoken skeptic of climate-change science, and voters in Australia recently repealed a national carbon tax. India, the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter, has so far resisted outside pressure to cut its coal use, although under its new prime minister, Narendra Modi, it has begun researching a plan. Without new climate policies, India is projected to surge ahead of the United States and China in carbon emissions in coming years. For Mr. Obama, the climate summit was the first time he had spoken to such a gathering, having enacted a significant carbon cutting plan. In urging other countries to take steps, Mr. Obama pointed to his E.P.A. regulation to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, the No. 1 source of greenhouse gases.\u201cThere should be no question that the United States of America is stepping up to the plate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognize our role in creating this problem; we embrace our responsibility to combat it.\u201dMr. Obama, who sought to erase years of skepticism abroad about American resolve to tackle climate change, reminded his audience that his action carried a political cost: At home, Republicans and the coal industry deride the new rules as a \u201cwar on coal\u201d and an energy tax. Reciting a litany of record-setting temperatures and natural disasters, Mr. Obama warned that the climate was changing faster than the world\u2019s response to it. Recent efforts to curb the problem, he said, would fail without more cooperation from countries around the world.\u201cWe can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every nation, developed and developing alike,\u201d the president said. \u201cNobody gets a pass.\u201dIf strong carbon-cutting policies are not enacted quickly, scientists warn, the current trajectory of fossil fuel emissions will raise the temperature of the global atmosphere by two degrees Celsius, a tipping point that is projected to lead to a future of rising sea levels, extreme droughts and food shortages, floods and more powerful storms. To reach a deal by the end of 2015, United Nations officials said, countries must unveil concrete plans by April 1 that are to specify how they will cut their energy-related fossil fuel pollution after 2020. To be taken seriously, the plans must show how the governments will enforce disruptive shifts to their economies, transitioning away from the fossil fuels that have powered their homes and vehicles for a century.Scientists said they were encouraged by the prospect of new climate policies, but warned that for now, the efforts under discussion would not be enough to prevent the first ravages of climate change.\u201cIn the world that we live in, this is probably the best we can do right now,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton University. \u201cIt\u2019s worth the effort. But it\u2019s not going to solve the problem. It\u2019s not going to get us to two degrees. It\u2018s not even enough to stave off three degrees.\u201dAn article last Wednesday about a speech by President Obama at the United Nations in which he challenged China to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions and join a worldwide campaign to curb global warming misidentified the government position held by Narendra Modi of India, which is the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter and has so far resisted outside pressure to cut its coal use. He is India\u2019s prime minister, not its president.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jean-Claude Juncker Names European Commissioners", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Union\u2019s executive branch, nominated his team on Wednesday, which will face challenges including reviving the flagging euro-area economy, curbing reliance on Russian energy and controlling migration into the bloc.The nominations come as part of the changes in European Union governance that occur every five years, and follow the election in May of a new European Parliament. Mr. Juncker\u2019s nominees are subject to approval by the Parliament, which is expected to hold hearings on each appointee \u2014 but can only accept or reject the entire slate, rather than approve some nominations while blocking others.Among the most coveted posts doled out by Mr. Juncker were those that oversee the European economy.One of the most powerful positions is that of enforcer of the bloc\u2019s far-reaching antitrust laws, a job that would go to Margrethe Vestager, a former economy minister of Denmark. She would take over from Joaqu\u00edn Almunia of Spain in deciding whether giant American technology companies like Google and energy titans like Gazprom of Russia should be fined for abusing dominant market positions in Europe.A closely watched nomination was for the oversight of economic and financial affairs, with authority to review budget plans for countries in the euro currency union. That post went to Pierre Moscovici, a Socialist and former French minister of finance, who would succeed Olli Rehn of Finland.Mr. Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, is scheduled to take over as the president of the European Commission in November. He succeeds Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, who has been widely criticized in countries like Britain for failing to curb bureaucratic overreach.In other important economics jobs, the nominee for the trade portfolio is Cecilia Malmstrom of Sweden, who would replace Karel De Gucht of Belgium in leading talks on a far-reaching trade agreement with the United States. The discussions face widespread opposition among Europeans, who say any deal would threaten environmental and health standards.In an apparent victory for the British, the oversight of other aspects of financial services and capital markets would be given to Jonathan Hill, a member of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party. He would take over from Michel Barnier of France in a sensitive role that includes deciding how banks in financial centers like the City of London should be regulated. Putting a Briton in that job might help win support in the City for keeping Britain in the European Union.The nominee for overseeing digital policy is G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger of Germany, who would oversee the telecommunications sector and sensitive copyright issues of concern to online publishers. European Union officials said that a push by the European Union to rein in the way American technology giants like Facebook and Google use and share citizens\u2019 personal data probably would fall within the responsibilities of Vera Jourova, the nominee for the post of commissioner for justice.A Greek nominee, Dimitris Avramopoulos, who has served as his country\u2019s defense minister, was selected to oversee migration and home affairs.European commissioners wield huge influence by proposing and enforcing laws on matters as wide-ranging as online privacy, how much carbon dioxide cars can emit and even the way cellphone calls are priced. They can also take countries to court for breaking European Union laws.But the composition of the commission has been made vastly more complex by the addition this time of vice presidents who would have enhanced powers and would be tasked with overseeing colleagues\u2019 agendas and with vetting their legislative proposals. That could turn out to be unwieldy and divisive.Nominees for the vice-presidential positions include: the former prime minister of Estonia, Andrus Ansip, for digital issues; the former prime minister of Latvia, Valdis Dombrovskis, for policies concerning the single currency; the former prime minister of Slovenia, Alenka Bratusek, for energy; the Dutch foreign minister, Frans Timmermans, as a \u201cfirst vice-president\u201d in charge of streamlining regulation; and the current commissioner for international cooperation, Kristalina Georgieva of Bulgaria, to oversee budgetary issues.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Juncker highlighted the central role assigned to Mr. Timmermans, whose speech at the United Nations in July is credited with uniting fractious European Union countries in a way that led to the imposition of sanctions on Russia after the shooting down of a Malaysian jetliner over Ukraine.Mr. Timmermans \u201cwill be my right-hand man,\u201d Mr. Juncker said.Jyrki Katainen, a former Finnish prime minister who is currently in charge of the economic portfolio, will also help oversee the main economic portfolios in the new commission and will marshal investment to jump-start growth.Mr. Juncker stressed the importance of teamwork for his new roster of appointees. \u201cIn the new commission,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are no first or second-class commissioners \u2014 there are team leaders and team players.\u201dThe jostling among member states for the top jobs \u2014 each country can nominate only one commissioner \u2014 was ferocious. Those national demands had to be balanced against those of the European Parliament, which also called for a sufficient number of women in the top posts.The rise of Mr. Moscovici is seen as a victory for France, whose government has pushed for more flexibility in the rule book for the euro, even as it struggles to meet those rules, much to Germany\u2019s consternation. As it happened, on Wednesday, the French government said it would not be able to bring its budget deficit down to the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product until 2017, two years later than it had originally forecast.The process of selecting the commissioners for highly specific portfolios is a painstaking task and can seem somewhat arbitrary, with each member state pushing for its candidate to take a top jobs.Late last month the Italian foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, who had been in that position for just a few months, was named as the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief despite concerns that she was too inexperienced. Her selection came after a strong push by Matteo Renzi, the prime minister of Italy, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.Ms. Mogherini will be a member of the European Commission, but her nomination was made by European Union heads of state, who have a direct say in the selection for the foreign policy post.Mr. Juncker, for that matter, was selected by European Union leaders in June over the objections of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain.Mr. Juncker has said that he plans major initiatives in his five-year term, including better integrating the bloc\u2019s capital markets to lower borrowing costs and to free up lending, and mobilizing 300 billion euros, or $387 billion, of public and private investment in the next three years to bolster growth.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bring Back the Party of Lincoln", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCHESTNUT HILL, Mass. \u2014 FOR all the differences between establishment Republicans and Tea Party insurgents, their various efforts to rebrand the Grand Old Party tend to start from a common premise: the belief that Ronald Reagan was the quintessential Republican, and that his principle of defending wealth and the wealthy should remain the party\u2019s guiding vision.In doing so, they misunderstand the party\u2019s longer history. They would do better to look to earlier presidents, and model their new brand on the eras when the Republican Party opposed the control of government by an elite in favor of broader economic opportunity.The history of the Republican Party is marked by vacillation between its founding principle of opportunity and its domination by the wealthy elite. The party came together in the 1850s in opposition to the wealthy slaveholders who controlled the federal government. Democrats acting on their behalf insisted that America\u2019s primary principle was the Constitution\u2019s protection of property, and they pushed legislation to let planters monopolize the country\u2019s resources at the expense of the working class. Abraham Lincoln and others recoiled from the idea of government as a prop for the rich. In organizing the Republican Party, they highlighted the equality of opportunity promised in the Declaration of Independence and warned that a healthy economy depended on widespread prosperity. Northerners and hardscrabble Westerners flocked to that vision, and elected Lincoln to the White House in 1860.Even as the Civil War raged, Republicans made good on their promise: They gave farmers their own land, created public colleges, funded a transcontinental railroad, took control of the national currency away from rich bankers, and ended slavery. To pay for their initiatives, they invented national taxes, including the income tax. The middle class grew, and the North and West, regions covered by the new programs, boomed.But as soon as the war ended, wealthy Americans joined with those who hated African-Americans and immigrants to insist that slaveholders had been right: Permitting poor men to have a say in government had produced policies that redistributed wealth. Only a few years after building a federal system that cleared the way for equal opportunity, Republicans faced a racist and xenophobic backlash against an active government \u2014 and they folded. By the 1880s, the party\u2019s leaders had abandoned their message of opportunity and tied themselves to big business. Like the slaveholders before them, they argued that the rich were the country\u2019s true producers, directing the work of lesser men. The party strengthened laws that protected business and crushed laborers, then jiggered the electoral map to stay in power.Republicans controlled the federal government for decades after the Civil War, and their policies funneled wealth upward \u2014 with dire consequences. In 1893, the economy crashed, and too few Americans had enough purchasing power to revive it. Lincoln had been right: Government that served the wealthy would ruin the country.The party responded, and a new Republican Party emerged from the Panic of 1893, rededicated to Lincoln\u2019s vision. Led by Theodore Roosevelt, the progressive Republicans recognized that government had to address the systemic inequalities of industrialization or no man could rise. They cleaned up the cities, promoted public education, protected workers and regulated business. Their policies fed a strong and growing middle class; their vision resurrected the Republican Party.But, as before, wealthy Americans pushed back. During the \u201cRed Summer\u201d of 1919, they whipped up riots against African-Americans, immigrants and workers, accusing them of sucking tax dollars from hard-working white people. And again, the party folded: During the ensuing backlash against government activism, Republican leaders handed policy making to businessmen. In the 1920s, they slashed taxes and government programs and refused to address growing economic inequalities. Then, on Oct. 29, 1929, the bottom fell out of the stock market, and Republican policies had once again concentrated wealth and destroyed purchasing power that might have put the economy back together. The Republicans looked finished.It took a new leader who would embrace Lincoln\u2019s principles to return the party to health. Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s experiences in World War II convinced him that the only way to prevent the rise of dictators was to promote economic equality around the world. He used the government to desegregate American schools, promote higher education and start the largest public works program in American history, the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act.Eisenhower\u2019s policies were enormously popular, but they inspired the wrath of businessmen, who claimed that taxes funding public programs were an unconstitutional redistribution of wealth. They demonized minorities, young people, women and Democrats, and with the help of social conservatives, tied the Republican Party once more to big business. The consequences were predictable: After Reagan\u2019s 1980 election, economic stability turned into the Great Divergence, in which wealth moved steadily upward. In 2008, the economy crashed.Twice in its history, the Republican Party regained its direction and popularity after similar disasters by returning to its original defense of widespread individual economic success. The same rebranding is possible today, if Republicans demote Reagan from hero to history and rally to a leader like Lincoln, Roosevelt or Eisenhower \u2014 someone who believes that the government should promote economic opportunity rather than protect the rich.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Moscow\u2019s Landfills Near Limits, Recyclers Do Whatever It Takes ", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 It was five years ago, Andrey Protasov recalls, that he and his wife, Elena, decided to begin doing a very un-Russian sort of thing: recycling their garbage.\u201cWe started thinking, why should we waste?\u201d said Mr. Protasov. \u201cWe can save forests and other natural resources. It\u2019s a message that goes to your soul.\u201dThe two accountants began with paper, which they stashed on the balcony of their Soviet-era high-rise apartment in a middle-class suburb of Moscow. But they quickly ran into problems. Not surprisingly, since the city of Moscow has no recycling program (despite an impending garbage crisis), they had trouble finding a recycling center that would take their paper.Internet searches were fruitless, and the commercial collection companies they found in the phone book were unwilling to accept small amounts of paper.Four years went by, and the paper piled up waist-deep on the balcony, which led to a new problem \u2014 grandfather would wait until they left home and then throw the paper in the trash surreptitiously. \u201cHe was always trying to get rid of all the garbage from our balcony,\u201d Mr. Protasov said, grinning. \u201cHe thought we were quite crazy guys.\u201dSurprising though it may be, the Protasovs, who eventually took a car-full of old paper to a private company an hour\u2019s drive away and sold it for virtually nothing, are not alone.In Russia, where most household trash goes straight to landfills, a small but growing cadre of people not only want to recycle, but are willing to go to great lengths to do so. They entertain modest dreams that they will someday inspire the government to institute wide-ranging regulations for garbage separation.\u201cAwareness is kind of rising,\u201d said Alexander Tsygankov, a project coordinator at Greenpeace Russia, whose girlfriend initially objected to the idea of collecting old milk cartons, cans and plastic bottles in their one-room apartment. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a change in the last two or three years.\u201dThere is little doubt Moscow could use a robust recycling effort. The majority of the city\u2019s landfills date to the Soviet period and fail to meet modern environmental standards. Furthermore, Greenpeace Russia has estimated that all of Moscow\u2019s landfills will be full within the next two to four years.In the absence of a broad municipal effort, die-hard recyclers have to rely on a hodgepodge of private, for-profit companies that are not always willing to accept small batches of recyclables, usually take only one kind of material, and are both far away and hard to find.\u201cThe system is not user-friendly,\u201d said Mr. Tsygankov. \u201cYou have to be really, really aware and sensitive to this issue to care.\u201dTatiana Kargina, who began recycling paper when she moved to Moscow from Irkutsk five years ago for a job in education, falls into this category. Four years ago, when she discovered a brand-new, environmentally minded collection point that took not just paper or glass, but a range of recyclables, she started collecting all kinds of household waste \u2014 even batteries, which were not recyclable in Russia at the time. (When friends flew to Europe, they took the batteries with them.)Every two months, she gladly made the 40-minute trip from her apartment to the recycling center. \u201cThe taxis were shocked when I put all this sorted garbage in the car,\u201d she said. \u201cThey thought I was crazy.\u201dMoscow\u2019s Department of Natural Resources said it is developing plans for separate waste collection as part of its environmental strategy for the city through 2030. But the consensus in the recycling community is that, despite the landfill crisis Moscow is facing, the city government is far from enthusiastic about instituting household recycling.During the Soviet era, Moscow was a world leader in recycling, though not out of any concern for the environment. Back then, when shortages of basic goods were a fact of life, families returned empty milk bottles to the supermarket, youth groups competed to see who could collect the most paper and scrap metal, and some households collected food waste to be reused in agriculture. Plastic bags were scarce, and reused many times; there was little packaging, and most of it was paper.\u201cI didn\u2019t like much about living in a totalitarian society,\u201d said Oleg Izyumenko, an environmentalist who emigrated from Moscow to Sweden, where he now works for the Swedish environmental protection agency. \u201cBut as far as reuse and recycling, this was really a brilliant model.\u201dThe demise of Soviet Communism put an end to all that. \u201cThe system cracked,\u201d said Anton Kuznetsov, who in 2010 founded Sphere of Ecology, a private company that makes its money recycling waste for the Moscow offices of international corporations, as well as the Finnish, British, Dutch and Canadian Embassies. \u201cUnfortunately.\u201dToday, individuals in Russia produce three times more trash than they did in Soviet times. The market economy has changed the composition of household waste, as well. Now, according to Greenpeace estimates, what Russians throw out contains 15 to 20 times more plastics than it used to, as well as more hazardous waste, like batteries and laptop computers.Concerned about the situation, Sphere of Ecology set up two collection points for residents in Moscow. \u201cWe think it is needed,\u201d said Mr. Kuznetsov. \"We couldn\u2019t turn people away.\u201dA handful of other initiatives have recently made recycling in the Russian capital a little more accessible. One of these is Greenpeace Russia\u2019s online recycling map. Using addresses sent in by recyclers, the map lists some 350 collection points. \u201cThese are hidden, even creepy places,\u201d said Anna Kopytova, who coordinates the map. \u201cYou might live two blocks away and never know.\u201dSome nonprofit collection points with environmental agendas have begun to appear on the map. Since June, for example, the Protasov family has been able to take all their recycling to the local park once a month.There, \u201cSeparate Collection,\u201d a volunteer-run group, has set up one of 30 outposts around the city. For a few hours, they put out temporary bins and collect a wide range of recyclables, from plastics to glass, paper, metal and batteries. But their main goal is educational, said the program\u2019s 25-year-old founder, Valery Korosteleva. \u201cWe want to create demand for government to do something.\u201dAfter learning that many readers lacked the easy access to a collection point that she enjoys \u2014 Ms. Barysheva lives only three subway stops from one \u2014 this summer she and her boyfriend started their own mobile collection service, renting a truck and driving to collection points around the city on weekends. \u201cSometimes I think, \u2018I\u2019m interested in contemporary art \u2014 what am I doing carrying garbage?\u2019\u00a0\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s because I want to make a difference.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Chile, an Animal Whose Numbers Please No One", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCerro Sombrero JournalCERRO SOMBRERO, Chile \u2014 The guidebooks for Tierra del Fuego somehow fail to mention the gunfire.From the mist-shrouded Patagonian steppe to the dense beech forests, shots pierce the air here for months on end each year. Hunters armed with telescopic rifles roam this archipelago at the southern tip of South America in pickup trucks as they pick off their prey: the guanaco.\u201cWe\u2019re witnessing a grotesque subordination to businessmen who view a creature of remarkable beauty and resilience as little more than a nuisance,\u201d said Valeria Mu\u00f1oz, a prominent animal rights activist in Punta Arenas, the regional capital. \u201cIt\u2019s a return to a 19th-century mentality, where logging and sheepherding triumph over everything else.\u201dGuanaco hunting is prohibited along the main roads cutting through Tierra del Fuego \u2014 a land divided between Chile and Argentina that juts out from South America\u2019s mainland like a spike \u2014 but along the back roads during the hunting season in the Chilean winter, the signs of the killing are clear.Gunshots from the hunters\u2019 rifles echo through the forests of lenga trees. Blood from recently hunted guanacos blemishes the snow. Communicating with the hunters by walkie-talkie, work crews fan out on private lands in search of the carcasses, hoisting them into pickup trucks for transport to slaughterhouses.Ranchers who are allowed to carry out the hunts argue that they are victims of policies that have expanded Tierra del Fuego\u2019s guanaco herds in recent decades. As recently as the 1970s, only a few thousand guanacos were thought to remain on Tierra del Fuego\u2019s main island, an area larger than Belgium, after widespread poaching.A crackdown by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship on firearms ownership (and by extension hunting) opened the way for guanaco conservation efforts; the number of guanacos in Chile\u2019s portion of Tierra del Fuego has climbed to about 150,000, according to Chile\u2019s Agricultural and Livestock Service. The authorities allowed as many as 4,125 guanacos to be killed this year.\u201cAside from competing for food with our sheep, there are now so many guanacos in Tierra del Fuego that they represent a risk for motorists trying to avoid them when the animals cross our roads,\u201d said Eduardo Tafra, a rancher who butchers guanaco meat at his slaughterhouse in Cerro Sombrero, a windswept outpost on the plains.\u201cWe do not want to exterminate the guanaco,\u201d Mr. Tafra explained, \u201cbut we cannot idly sit by and watch it threaten our livelihood.\u201dTierra del Fuego\u2019s ranching culture has roots in the sheepherding operations established near the end of the 19th century, largely by British settlers who displaced nomadic hunters of guanacos. By the early 20th century, the Selk\u2019nam, the indigenous people who had lived in Tierra del Fuego for thousands of years, had been almost completely wiped out in a brutal extermination campaign.Throughout it all, the guanacos, one of the main sources of food for the Selk\u2019nam, persisted in Tierra del Fuego and other parts of Patagonia. The animals are thought to have first been glimpsed by Europeans in 1520 when Ferdinand Magellan, the explorer who sailed through the strait that now bears his name, described seeing a \u201ccamel without humps.\u201dAs herds of nonnative sheep expanded in Patagonia, the number of guanacos plummeted, reaching a current level of only about 500,000, said Crist\u00f3bal Brice\u00f1o, an expert on guanacos at the University of Chile. Guanaco herds have dwindled significantly in other parts of Chile where they were once plentiful, he said.The Chilean authorities have quietly allowed hunting for guanacos in Tierra del Fuego over the last decade, arguing that the culling is needed to maintain a \u201csustainable\u201d population that does not adversely affect other underpinnings of the regional economy.Residents here generally abhor eating guanaco, so most of the butchered guanaco meat is exported to Europe. (An exception can be found at La Cuisine, a restaurant in Punta Arenas that offers Guanaco Grand Veneur, a stew of the camelid in a red wine sauce accompanied by mashed potatoes and pumpkin.)\u201cWe closely monitor every aspect of the hunting to ensure it is carried out in a proper way,\u201d said Nicol\u00e1s Soto Volkart, an official with the Agricultural and Livestock Service in Punta Arenas. \u201cWe\u2019re convinced this is good policy after guanacos recovered in numbers since the 1970s.\u201dAdvocates of \u201crewilding\u201d forests \u2014 essentially restoring ecosystems to something resembling how they once functioned \u2014 say that guanacos could help areas where they are reintroduced by dispersing seeds for certain types of trees.\u201cGuanacos seem to be an important missing species that used to play an important ecological role,\u201d said Meredith Root-Bernstein, a conservation scientist at Aarhus University in Denmark.Pointing to a growing resistance in Chile to hunting of various types, officials at the Agricultural and Livestock Service remain on edge after protesters attacked their building in Punta Arenas this year with firebombs in response to a separate proposal to allow the hunting of feral dogs accused of attacking sheep.Even during the hunting season, the silhouettes of guanacos can still be glimpsed on stretches along the Strait of Magellan. The guanacos often gaze at approaching vehicles before sprinting away across the steppe.\u201cHunting these animals is an aberration that reflects our skewed priorities,\u201d said Enrique Couve, the president of Tierra del Fuego\u2019s chamber of tourism.\u201cThe guanaco is a treasure of Patagonia that brings a sense of wonder to people who are fortunate enough to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd here we are, watching it be killed as if it were some sort of pest.\u201dPascale Bonnefoy contributed reporting from Santiago, Chile, and Tom\u00e1s Munita from Cameron, Chile.Advertisement"}

The new committee, conceived by Mr. Fischer and the Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, will oversee the work of a department devoted to financial stability that was created in 2010.Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, said the new committee could help the Fed determine the pace of its retreat.\u201cThe Fed has been forced into a trade-off between immediate economic stimulus and greater risk of financial instability down the road,\u201d Mr. El-Erian said. \u201cSuch a committee would help assess where the trade-off stands.\u201dThe new committee is also intended to prepare the Fed for future crises.But central bankers continue to wrestle with the best way to address threats to stability, including asset-price bubbles. The main tool of monetary policy, raising interest rates, is seen as a blunt instrument that might discourage speculation, but only at the cost of curtailing other economic activity. Regulations can be tightly focused, but that approach is seen as relatively weak and untested.Mr. Fischer, who joined the Fed in May after serving as the head of the Bank of Israel, called for research on these questions in his July speech, and he will now oversee the work of the Fed\u2019s Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research.Governors Daniel K. Tarullo and Lael Brainard will join Mr. Fischer on the new committee.

The Dow Jones industrial average finished with its second triple-digit loss in a row.Investors have been dealing with meager economic growth in Europe for months.

{"Headline": "O.E.C.D. Calls for Coordinated Fight Against Corporate Tax Avoidance", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDozens of countries with the most advanced economies have agreed on principles for concrete action to prevent corporations from gaming the international tax system, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report on Tuesday.\u201cOur recommendations constitute the building blocks for an internationally agreed and coordinated response to corporate tax planning strategies that exploit the gaps and loopholes of the current system to artificially shift profits to locations where they are subject to more favorable tax treatment,\u201d Angel Gurr\u00eda, the O.E.C.D. secretary general, said in a statement.To lower their tax bills, multinational corporations move profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions through subsidiaries and offshore companies using complex transactions including internal payments for interest, royalties, patents and fees.Such strategies are usually legal, but since the beginning of the current financial crisis there has been a clear recognition in Washington and in other capitals that corporate tax planning is distorting the world economy. Furthermore, the rules governing global tax affairs, created in the 1920s, can seem out of touch when a Google, Apple or Microsoft can move millions or billions of dollars of profit from one country to another at the click of a button.In developing countries \u2014 which are typically more dependent on corporations for tax revenues than wealthy economies, and which lack the cadre of skilled experts to untangle corporate profit-shifting structures \u2014 there is even greater concern.The O.E.C.D. acknowledged that the rise of Internet commerce had greatly changed the global playing field, but stopped short of calling for rules specific to e-commerce.\u201cBecause the digital economy is increasingly becoming the economy itself, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to ring-fence the digital economy from the rest of the economy for tax purposes,\u201d it said.The organization, which is based in Paris and serves as a forum for discussion and research, was given a mandate in September 2013 by Group of 20 leaders to ensure that \u201cprofits are taxed where economic activities occur and value is created.\u201dThe O.E.C.D. initiative, formally known as the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, or BEPS, is being negotiated by the 34 members of the organization plus associated nations, including China, Russia and Brazil. It said all of the organization\u2019s members, which include the United States, Japan and most of the European Union nations, had agreed to adopt the new, technical measures.The nations endorsed the creation of a detailed template under which companies would be required to report their revenue, profit and taxes paid in each jurisdiction in which they operate, giving national tax authorities a detailed picture of their operations.The organization said countries should, for example, harmonize aspects of their national laws or amend bilateral treaties to neutralize so-called hybrid mismatch arrangements, where corporations set up entities or transfers in two or more countries, in some cases for no productive purpose, but rather to create deductions or to generate foreign tax credits.It also said nations should ensure that their laws or treaties fully address the transparency of such transfer pricing on a country-by-country basis, and should adopt rules on how intangible assets like trademarks, brands, trade secrets and copyrights \u2014 all of which offer rich opportunities for exploiting tax loopholes \u2014 are accounted for in transfer pricing.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019ve reached consensus in such detail on two areas \u2014 hybrid mismatches and country-by-country reporting \u2014 suggests that we will see a pretty rapid adoption\u201d by some countries, said Manal Corwin, head of the international tax practice at KPMG and a former deputy assistant secretary for tax policy at the United States Treasury Department.Ms. Corwin said that Australia, Britain and France were all likely to be early adopters, and that future reporting needs for those jurisdictions would translate to \u201can immediate impact for multinational corporations.\u201dWith conditions in Washington as polarized as they are, Congress is unlikely to officially adopt the rules anytime soon. But Ms. Corwin said the United States already has access to much of the information that the companies will be required to divulge, and that it could put into effect a significant portion of the package without changes to law or treaties.For the recommendations to actually become binding, however, countries would have to encode them in their domestic laws or amend their bilateral tax treaties. The organization said on Tuesday that it planned to hold an international conference on amending the network of existing tax treaties.Sol Picciotto, an emeritus professor at Lancaster University in Britain, said the recommendations were at least five to 10 years from becoming law, and that the jury was out on whether they would accomplish their stated goals.\u201cThese are just tweaks,\u201d said Mr. Picciotto, who is also a senior adviser to Tax Justice Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates an overhaul of international tax policy. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to repair an old motorcar, but what they need is a new engine.\u201dThe problem, he said, is that \u201ccompanies are very wary of any shift to a new system.\u201d But, he added: \u201cTax professionals are aware that the system is broken. It has to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transcript of Obama\u2019s Remarks on the Fight Against ISIS", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMy fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak to you about what the United States will do with our friends and allies to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group known as ISIL.As commander in chief, my highest priority is the security of the American people. Over the last several years, we have consistently taken the fight to terrorists who threaten our country. We took out Osama bin Laden and much of Al Qaeda\u2019s leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We\u2019ve targeted Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Yemen and recently eliminated the top commander of its affiliate in Somalia. We\u2019ve done so while bringing more than 140,000 American troops home from Iraq and drawing down our forces in Afghanistan, where our combat mission will end later this year. Thanks to our military and counterterrorism professionals, America is safer.Still, we continue to face a terrorist threat. We can\u2019t erase every trace of evil from the world and small groups of killers have the capacity to do great harm. That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today. And that\u2019s why we must remain vigilant as threats emerge. At this moment the greatest threats come from the Middle East and North Africa, where radical groups exploit grievances for their own gain. And one of those groups is ISIL \u2014 which calls itself the Islamic State.Now let\u2019s make two things clear: ISIL is not Islamic. No religion condones the killing of innocents, and the vast majority of ISIL\u2019s victims have been Muslim. And ISIL is certainly not a state. It was formerly Al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Iraq and has taken advantage of sectarian strife and Syria\u2019s civil war to gain territory on both sides of the Iraq-Syrian border. It is recognized by no government nor by the people it subjugates. ISIL is a terrorist organization, pure and simple. And it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way.In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality. They execute captured prisoners. They kill children. They enslave, rape and force women into marriage. They threatened a religious minority with genocide. And in acts of barbarism, they took the lives of two American journalists \u2014 Jim Foley and Steven Sotloff.So ISIL poses a threat to the people of Iraq and Syria and the broader Middle East, including American citizens, personnel and facilities. If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond that region, including to the United States. While we have not yet detected specific plotting against our homeland, ISIL leaders have threatened America and our allies. Our intelligence community believes that thousands of foreigners, including Europeans and some Americans, have joined them in Syria and Iraq. Trained and battle-hardened, these fighters could try to return to their home countries and carry out deadly attacks.I know many Americans are concerned about these threats. Tonight I want you to know that the United States of America is meeting them with strength and resolve. Last month I ordered our military to take targeted action against ISIL to stop its advances. Since then we\u2019ve conducted more than 150 successful airstrikes in Iraq. These strikes have protected American personnel and facilities, killed ISIL fighters, destroyed weapons and given space for Iraqi and Kurdish forces to reclaim key territory. These strikes have also helped save the lives of thousands of innocent men, women and children.But this is not our fight alone. American power can make a decisive difference, but we cannot do for Iraqis what they must do for themselves. Nor can we take the place of Arab partners in securing their region. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve insisted that additional U.S. action depended upon Iraqis forming an inclusive government, which they have now done in recent days.So tonight, with a new Iraqi government in place, and following consultations with allies abroad and Congress at home, I can announce that America will lead a broad coalition to roll back this terrorist threat. Our objective is clear: We will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy.First, we will conduct a systematic campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists. Working with the Iraqi government, we will expand our efforts beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions so that we\u2019re hitting ISIL targets as Iraqi forces go on offense. Moreover, I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are. That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven.Second, we will increase our support to forces fighting these terrorists on the ground. In June, I deployed several hundred American service members to Iraq to assess how we can best support Iraqi security forces. Now that those teams have completed their work and Iraq has formed a government, we will send an additional 475 service members to Iraq. As I have said before, these American forces will not have a combat mission. We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq. But they are needed to support Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence and equipment. We\u2019ll also support Iraq\u2019s efforts to stand up national guard units to help Sunni communities secure their own freedom from ISIL control.Across the border in Syria, we have ramped up our military assistance to the Syrian opposition. Tonight, I again call on Congress, again, to give us additional authorities and resources to train and equip these fighters. In the fight against ISIL, we cannot rely on an Assad regime that terrorizes its own people \u2014 a regime that will never regain the legitimacy it has lost. Instead, we must strengthen the opposition as the best counterweight to extremists like ISIL, while pursuing the political solution necessary to solve Syria\u2019s crisis once and for all.Third, we will continue to draw on our substantial counterterrorism capabilities to prevent ISIL attacks. Working with our partners, we will redouble our efforts to cut off its funding, improve our intelligence, strengthen our defenses, counter its warped ideology, and stem the flow of foreign fighters into and out of the Middle East. And in two weeks, I will chair a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to further mobilize the international community around this effort.Fourth, we will continue to provide humanitarian assistance to innocent civilians who\u2019ve been displaced by this terrorist organization. This includes Sunni and Shia Muslims who are at grave risk, as well as tens of thousands of Christians and other religious minorities. We cannot allow these communities to be driven from their ancient homelands.So this is our strategy. And in each of these four parts of our strategy, America will be joined by a broad coalition of partners. Already, allies are flying planes with us over Iraq, sending arms and assistance to Iraqi security forces and the Syrian opposition, sharing intelligence and providing billions of dollars in humanitarian aid. Secretary Kerry was in Iraq today meeting with the new government and supporting their efforts to promote unity, and in the coming days he will travel across the Middle East and Europe to enlist more partners in this fight, especially Arab nations who can help mobilize Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria to drive these terrorists from their lands. This is American leadership at its best: We stand with people who fight for their own freedom, and we rally other nations on behalf of our common security and common humanity.My administration has also secured bipartisan support for this approach here at home. I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL. But I believe we are strongest as a nation when the president and Congress work together. So I welcome congressional support for this effort in order to show the world that Americans are united in confronting this danger.Now, it will take time to eradicate a cancer like ISIL. And any time we take military action, there are risks involved, especially to the servicemen and women who carry out these missions. But I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partners\u2019 forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us while supporting partners on the front lines is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years, and it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year: to use force against anyone who threatens America\u2019s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.My fellow Americans, we live in a time of great change. Tomorrow marks 13 years since our country was attacked. Next week marks six years since our economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. Yet despite these shocks, through the pain we felt and the grueling work required to bounce back, America is better positioned today to seize the future than any other nation on Earth.Our technology companies and universities are unmatched. Our manufacturing and auto industries are thriving. Energy independence is closer than it\u2019s been in decades. For all the work that remains, our businesses are in the longest uninterrupted stretch of job creation in our history. Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day, and that makes me more confident than ever about our country\u2019s future.Abroad, American leadership is the one constant in an uncertain world. It is America that has the capacity and the will to mobilize the world against terrorists. It is America that has rallied the world against Russian aggression and in support of the Ukrainian people\u2019s right to determine their own destiny. It is America \u2014 our scientists, our doctors, our know-how \u2014 that can help contain and cure the outbreak of Ebola. It is America that helped remove and destroy Syria\u2019s declared chemical weapons so that they can\u2019t pose a threat to the Syrian people or the world again. And it is America that is helping Muslim communities around the world not just in the fight against terrorism, but in the fight for opportunity and tolerance and a more hopeful future.America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead. From Europe to Asia, from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East, we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our nation since its founding. Tonight, I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward. I do so as a commander in chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform \u2014 pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East and service members who support our partners on the ground.When we helped prevent the massacre of civilians trapped on a distant mountain, here\u2019s what one of them said: \u201cWe owe our American friends our lives. Our children will always remember that there was someone who felt our struggle and made a long journey to protect innocent people.\u201dThat is the difference we make in the world. And our own safety, our own security depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation and uphold the values that we stand for \u2014 timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth.May God bless our troops and may God bless the United States of America.Advertisement"}

The eurozone economy stagnated in the second quarter, as Germany and Italy contracted and France did not grow.By contrast, the United States economy grew an annualized 4.2 percent in the second quarter after a poor start to 2014, and is expected to grow more than 2 percent in the third quarter.The eurozone\u2019s inability to attain escape velocity has become a matter of increasing concern for policy makers at a time when some 18 million people across the bloc are unable to find work and households are reluctant to spend.Alarmed at the potential for Europe to pull down its global trading partners at a time of uncertainty about geopolitical risks in Russia and Ukraine, and worried that the eurozone\u2019s low inflation might tip into deflation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last week urged the European Central Bank to undertake large-scale bond-buying to provide more monetary stimulus.Speaking on Monday at the European Parliament, Mr. Draghi said the central bank was \u201cready to use additional unconventional instruments within our mandate,\u201d an indication that quantitative easing remains an option.The Markit survey of purchasing managers gives economists and policy makers a nearly real-time view of trends.

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Once and Future Mansions", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the architect/designer Ogden Codman Jr. built himself a splendidly self-indulgent 40-foot-wide limestone mansion on East 96th Street in 1913, he built it to last, and it did. It outlasted him \u2014 Codman, the celebrated co-author, with Edith Wharton, of \u201cThe Decoration of Houses,\u201d a turn-of-the-last-century home d\u00e9cor bible, relocated to Paris in the 1920s \u2014 and several subsequent owners, eventually becoming the Manhattan Country School. Something similar happened at 39 East 67th Street, where the architect Ernest Flagg took a nondescript 1877 brownstone and in 1904 transformed it into a Beaux-Arts limestone palace and literary salon of sorts for Helen and Arthur Scribner, of the publishing dynasty. It was a sophisticated destination, with leaded glass windows and marble fireplaces, but after its owners\u2019 deaths, the house was sold in 1951 and chopped into apartments with a suite of medical offices as the anchor tenant. The 1905 mansion at 57 East 64th Street, a 14,000-square-foot limestone chateau designed by C.P.H. Gilbert for the oft-married heiress Arlene Tew to display her high-end Francophile taste, more recently served as the New York headquarters of an Italian clothing company.But all four of those historic buildings, and several others of their ilk and vintage, are sharing a potential turn-back-the-clock moment: Besides being for sale to the highest (preferably cash) bidder, they will likely undergo the exacting transformation necessary for a return to their original use as privately owned residences. \u201cIt\u2019s like a return to the Gilded Age,\u201d said Sharon Baum of the Corcoran Group, who, along with her Corcoran partner, David H. Enloe, and Timothy Sheehan of CBRE Group, listed the Codman mansion.The catalyst that has put these mansions and townhouses back in play is the steady escalation of incredibly wealthy buyers, many of them foreign, intent on acquiring one-of-a-kind homes that offer a level of privacy impossible to find at the city\u2019s most exclusive co-ops and condos. Several of the sellers are foreign as well: France, Senegal, China and Burkina Faso. \u201cAs the superluxury market has gained strength, at the same time, debt-burdened foreign governments in the aftermath of the financial crisis are looking for ways to cut costs or generate cash,\u201d said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. \u201cSo we see the trend toward consulates maybe receding and the conversion of mansions to single-family homes returning.\u201dThe former Scribner residence on 67th Street is among the candidates for reclamation. It was just listed for sale at $22.5 million by James and Anna Hall of Stribling & Associates.\u201cThis change is reflective of what\u2019s happening in the micro-economy of New York,\u201d Ms. Hall said, \u201cwhere we\u2019re seeing a new breed of affluent, and often younger, buyers who have zero interest in being subjected to the rules and limitations presented by a co-op board. There\u2019s an autonomy that comes with owning a free-standing property. A townhouse or mansion is almost like a piece of art and there are buyers who appreciate that history and want to be part of it.\u201dThe Scribner property will require a substantial renovation, but boasts customized newer features like a top-floor glass conservatory. The seller inherited the property and has \u201cno interest in being a landlord,\u201d Ms. Hall said. \u201cWe envision two possible end users, an investor/developer or a buyer interested in turning it into their own residence, which we feel represents its best and highest use.\u201d A circa 1870s townhouse at 52 East 64th Street is on the market for the first time since 1970, listed at $17.75 million by Deanna Kory and Ileana Lopez-Balboa of the Corcoran Group. As a brownstone it was Miss Edward\u2019s School in 1878, but after a serious limestone upgrade by the architect Frederick Sterner in 1916, it became a rental with high-profile tenants like Ethel Barrymore. The lower floors were for many years the site of a well-known veterinary facility, the Park East Animal Hospital.The veterinarian, Dr. Lewis H. Berman, whose celebrity canine clients included Andy Warhol\u2019s dachshund, Truman\u2019s Capote\u2019s bulldog and Lauren Bacall\u2019s\u00a0papillon, was renting the first floor for his business and a third-floor apartment for his family when the townhouse was put on the market \u201cwith me in it\u201d in 1970. A graceful 1902 limestone townhouse at 9 East 89th Street that since 1981 has served as the headquarters of the New York Road Runners Club is listed at $24.75 million by Massey Knakal Realty Services, which anticipates a residential buyer. \u201cSelling the building is a natural next step for our organization,\u201d said Mary Wittenberg, the president of the Road Runners, which is moving its offices to Midtown.After spending decades doing duty as schools, embassies, consulates, nonprofit headquarters, apartment houses and the like, these and a few other important and irreplaceable buildings, most already designated as landmarks, have returned to the market virtually simultaneously, with virtually identical marketing plans. The various brokerages entrusted with the listings are advertising them as ripe for conversion to what they were in the beginning: beauteous, commodious and expensive single-family residences. \u201cFor 10 or so of these important properties to come on the market at the same time, that matters a lot,\u201d said Gregory J. Heym, an executive vice president and the chief economist for Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens. \u201cIt\u2019s a seller\u2019s market like we haven\u2019t seen in a while.\u201d Trophy townhouses are back in favor again with home buyers, according to Paul J. Massey Jr., a founding partner of Massey-Knakal, for a number of reasons: \u201cThe value of townhouses designated for some type of commercial or nonprofit role and the value of purely residential townhouses used to be more in line, \u201c he said. \u201cBut in the past few years there\u2019s been a growing schism between what they might sell for, with residential use commanding the higher premium. Some of the organizations that own these homes are shifting their mission, or downsizing.\u201d Residential customers, he said, are doing the opposite: They want large homes with grand interior space, \u201cgreat old details,\u201d and expansion potential. Ms. Baum and her co-brokers marketed the former Codman mansion at 7 East 96th on behalf of the board of the Manhattan Country School. The original price was $23 million, cash only, but the mansion, which possesses that rarest of Manhattan amenities, a curb cut and interior courtyard with a garage, set off a bidding war and ultimately went to contract for considerably more than the asking price, according to Ms. Baum.She said the mansion\u2019s next owner is what is known as an angel buyer: a woman who plans to fully restore it, a megamillion-dollar undertaking, and eventually move in, yet has agreed to let the school remain in place for two years while it finalizes its relocation and expansion plans.\u201cThe demand for these homes is much higher than the supply,\u201d Ms. Baum said. \u201cVery few prewar mansions are still left; what we have are all there\u2019s ever going to be.\u201cFrom a buyer\u2019s viewpoint, it\u2019s very much like an art auction,\u201d she added. \u201cThis particular Matisse may not come up for sale again during your lifetime. The same sentiment applies to many of these mansions. They are one-of-a-kind and not replaceable.\u201dTo find the same square footage in a condo or co-op would, real estate agents say, approach the prohibitively expensive if not the impossible. \u201cOne surprising thing in general is just how few single-family homes there are in Manhattan, less than 2,000,\u201d said Mr. Heym, the economist. \u201cInherently there is a very limited supply to begin with, so when the opportunity to acquire one arises, especially one of decent size, their scarcity can be a motivating factor. Their locations tend to be in the most coveted neighborhoods. They also receive a more favored tax treatment than co-ops and condos. \u201cAnd when an institution or nonprofit decides the time is right to downsize or cash in their equity and the next user is a homeowner, well, it means we\u2019re creating one more unit of housing in a borough that badly needs it, right?\u201d (Mr. Heym was only partly joking.)The phenomenon might be described as a nouveau form of recycling, albeit on a grand and exclusionist scale. With prices ranging from $13 million (the Tracy Mansion in Brooklyn, listed by Marc Wisotsky and Jackie Lew of Halstead Property following the retirement of Anil and Hannah Sinha, career Montessori educators who had owned it for four decades) to more than $50 million, these rarefied mansions and townhouses are not destined for inhabitation by aspirational DIYers. Their asking prices don\u2019t mention renovation and restoration, expensive and time-consuming undertakings that can rival the actual sales price. The current crop of qualified buyers has one quality in common with most of the original owners of these mansions, said Ms. Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens. \u201cThere is definitely an \u2018I will be the king of my own castle\u2019 attitude out there. And there are folks willing to spend $50 million or more to be the kings of their castles, where they feel like they can control everything and not have to answer to a co-op or condo board. At most, they answer to the Landmarks Commission and buildings department.\u201dSeekers of instant gratification within this stratospheric niche of homeownership, though, are advised to look elsewhere. Very few of these behemoths are in turnkey residential shape. One exception is 46 East 66th Street, the longtime home to the Republic of Senegal\u2019s ambassador and the site of the nation\u2019s formal functions. The building, a circa 1890 landmark, has undergone a three-year restoration by HJ Development and will come to market later this year as a six-bedroom, seven-bath luxury townhouse priced at $28 million. \u201cTo take a century-old building and totally reimagine and restore the interior and return it to the single-family residence it once was is a little like a surgeon going into someone\u2019s body and performing major surgery,\u201d said Ian Fishkin, the in-house counsel and acquisitions adviser at HJ Development. \u201cWe\u2019re catering to the 1 percent at East 66th and Madison, but there is definitely something charming about owning your own home with your own front door and backyard at a significant address.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Give Diplomacy With Russia a Chance", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsThe crisis over Ukraine has all but frozen official communication between the United States and Russia. The Russian reaction to the political upheaval in Kiev \u2014 the absorption of Crimea, and the armed intervention in eastern Ukraine \u2014 and the American responses to those actions have brought about a near-complete breakdown in normal and regular dialogue between Washington and Moscow. Relations between the two capitals have descended into attempts by each side to pressure the other, tit-for-tat actions, shrill propaganda statements, and the steady diminution of engagement between the two governments and societies.Reports from the NATO summit meeting that ended in Newport, Wales, on Friday indicate that the United States and its allies will respond to Russia\u2019s intervention and violence in Ukraine with an escalation of their own \u2014 including further sanctions, enhanced military presence in front-line states, and possibly greater support for Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. This amounts to more of the same, with little if any assurance of better outcomes.What the Western strategy lacks is an equally vigorous diplomatic approach to ending this conflict. Diplomatic efforts should aim to provide Ukraine and its neighbors with a future that can sustain peace and security for all countries in the area; re-establish respect for the core principles of Europe\u2019s political order; and open the way for more productive American-Russian relations.As three former United States ambassadors who served in Moscow, we believe that the time is right for American leadership in a serious diplomatic effort to achieve these ends. Each of us has seen the high price paid when relations and dialogue between Washington and Moscow break down, as in the effort to prevent Baltic independence at the end of the Soviet era, the Kosovo crisis and the insurgency in Chechnya.Each time relations broke down, there was a high cost to the cause of peace and security for both the United States and Russia, as well as their allies. Our experience convinces us that creative, disciplined, serious active diplomacy \u2014 through both official and unofficial channels \u2014 provides the one path out of destructive crises and a reliance on violence and confrontation. So-called Track 2 dialogue between nonstate actors \u2014 experts and groups of individuals on both sides \u2014 can also play a useful role.For now, fortunately, a cease-fire agreement announced on Friday by President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia appears to be holding. It is also encouraging that the parties have begun discussion about how to maintain the halt in fighting and address the political issues that will have to be tackled to bring about a lasting settlement.There is ample reason to treat this opening with caution. But this potential opportunity should not be allowed to slip away. This is a moment when American leadership will be essential. The terms of any durable cease-fire must, of course, provide for adequate numbers of international observers, most appropriately from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, to ensure that no side exploits the halt in fighting.Any lasting agreement must also build on the fragile political process begun over the weekend. That process must involve the search for agreement on fair and equal treatment, and adequate political representation, of all Ukrainians; on respect for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty over its territory; and on international cooperation to rebuild Ukraine\u2019s economy.Firm and unwavering support by the United States for these principles will be critical to the success of any negotiated outcome. The resumption of regular dialogue between Moscow and Washington will be central to the restoration of relations.Fortunately, the arrival in Moscow of America\u2019s new ambassador, John F. Tefft, provides an opening to enhance communication and dialogue. A seasoned career diplomat with previous service in Lithuania, Georgia and Ukraine, as well as Russia, Mr. Tefft brings to Moscow a capacity to express American views and positions clearly and to listen to and explain Russian thinking to Washington. His arrival gives both governments an opportunity to rebuild relations and to move away from the present path of confrontation.Reinvigorating American-Russian diplomacy will be challenging. The negative effects of the Ukraine crisis are part of a broader downturn in relations over the last few years. The escalation of violence in Ukraine, and rising calls among Europeans and Americans for more forceful action and tougher sanctions to confront Russian military activity, have increased the prospect for further escalation and a further downturn in bilateral relations.Although spokesmen and leaders in Washington have suggested that Russia has an \u201coff ramp\u201d to extricate itself from the present situation and the United States is ready to cooperate in that effort, this uphill path is strewn with rocks and largely uncharted. Additional sanctions, increased military pressure and battlefield escalation will not, by themselves, help define a way forward.Only the use of diplomacy can help Mr. Poroshenko take advantage of new openings to define his country\u2019s relations with its neighbors, restore Ukrainian sovereignty and effect a permanent end to the bloodshed. Sanctions and further efforts to escalate political and military pressure, and reliance on unilateral action without accompanying diplomacy, would all but assure continued suffering for the people of Ukraine.It is time for the United States to use its diplomatic assets, including our new ambassador in Moscow, to take active leadership of diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis over Ukraine and set American relations with Russia on a new, more productive course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Finally, the Truth About the A.I.G. Bailout", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorWASHINGTON \u2014 TODAY is the start of the trial in Starr International Co. Inc. v. United States, the case alleging that the government\u2019s 2008 bailout of A.I.G. amounted to an unconstitutional plunder of the company\u2019s shareholders. Starr, a firm run by the former A.I.G. chief executive Maurice R. Greenberg, was the insurer\u2019s largest single shareholder at the time. It saw the government grab almost 80 percent of its common stock amid the bailout (a proportion that eventually rose to 92 percent), and is asking for a cool $40 billion to make it whole.As a legal matter, most experts believe the case is far-fetched \u2014 that the government has no obligation to live up to some abstract notion of fairness when it seizes assets to prevent a global crisis. Morally, the claim is even weaker. A.I.G.\u2019s stock would have been worthless absent a bailout; it is now worth about $80 billion. Or, as the government\u2019s lawyers have put it, the shareholders\u2019 stake after Washington took most of the company was \u201cworth more than their 100 percent equity stake before the rescue.\u201d Arguing that the shareholders deserved even more is like a formerly starving man\u2019s insisting he deserved filet mignon rather than a rib-eye. And yet, as asinine as the Starr suit may be in legal terms, it may end up serving a constructive purpose. Among Starr\u2019s key claims is that a chunk of the roughly $180 billion the government eventually poured into A.I.G. was unnecessary, at least if the point was to save the insurance giant. In practice, tens of billions went out the door to other financial institutions, like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, whose risky mortgage securities A.I.G. had foolishly insured in the run-up to the crisis.Starr contends that the government could have spent less money on A.I.G. \u2014 and therefore imposed less onerous terms on the company \u2014 had the bailout\u2019s architects directed some of their tough love at the Goldmans and Deutsche Banks of the world. And Starr is hardly alone in making these claims. Ever since the details of the A.I.G. rescue entered the popular consciousness, everyone from members of Congress to financial commentators to Occupy Wall Street protesters and Tea Party activists have fulminated against the \u201cbackdoor bailout\u201d of Goldman et al. By fully litigating the issue, the Starr trial may finally help heal this festering wound. At the heart of the controversy is the fact that the government has never provided a plausible explanation for why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which had enormous leverage over banks like Goldman thanks to its role as their regulator, didn\u2019t lean on them to accept less than 100 cents on the dollar in their payouts from A.I.G.Former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who orchestrated the bailout from his previous perch as New York Fed president, insists that extracting these \u201chaircuts\u201d would have shattered the market\u2019s confidence and undermined the A.I.G. bailout.But this explanation is both counterintuitive \u2014 the haircuts would have helped save A.I.G. and stabilize the financial system \u2014 and ahistoric. The Fed has long used its leverage over banks in similar situations, to great effect. During the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, an episode Mr. Geithner observed up close as a senior Treasury official, the New York Fed president, William J. McDonough, leaned on Korea\u2019s creditors to roll over and lengthen their loans and prevent that country\u2019s financial collapse. Which leaves only two possible explanations for the overly solicitous treatment of Goldman and the others. The first is that their own financial position was so precarious that accepting anything less than the billions they expected from A.I.G. would have destabilized them, too. Which is to say, it really was a backdoor bailout of the banks \u2014 many of which, like Goldman, claimed they didn\u2019t need one. Alternatively, maybe Mr. Geithner simply felt that Goldman and the like had a more legitimate claim to billions of dollars in funds than the taxpayers who were footing the bill.Either way, forcing an honest admission out of Mr. Geithner, who is scheduled to testify in the trial, would be a helpful, even cathartic, development. Traumatic historical episodes often require a high-profile public reckoning before the country can move on. During the Great Depression, that reckoning came in the form of the Pecora investigation, in which a congressional panel summoned the titans of Wall Street to answer for their shady dealings in the run-up to the crash.The aftermath of our recent crisis has brought a variety of attempts to recreate that level of drama \u2014 from the Congressional Oversight Panel hearings chaired by Elizabeth Warren to the congressionally chartered Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. But none fully exposed the weakness of Mr. Geithner\u2019s logic about the A.I.G. payouts, at least not in a prominent public forum.The Starr trial could change that. Starr\u2019s lead lawyer, David Boies, is arguably the best litigator of his generation. And the dizzyingly high stakes \u2014 $40 billion is real money, even for the government \u2014 ensure that the press attention will be smothering.Legally, Starr is unlikely to prevail. Even if Mr. Boies comes away with a win at the trial court, which has been a favorable venue for Wall Street, appeals courts are unlikely to accept a decision that effectively requires sweetheart deals for any bailout recipient.Politically, however, the case could be a coup. It\u2019s hard to begrudge Mr. Geithner and the Fed for doing what they believed was necessary to save the economy. But what they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do is insult our intelligence in the process. The Starr case, its chutzpah notwithstanding, may be our last hope for ending the charade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York City\u2019s Unemployment Rate Drops to Lowest Level Since 2009", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City\u2019s unemployment rate fell faster in August than in any month on record, to 7.3 percent from 7.8 percent in July, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday.The decline took the city\u2019s unemployment rate to its lowest level since January 2009, when the effects of the financial crisis were still rippling through the economy, said Elena Volovelsky, an economist at the department.The tally of unemployed city residents also plunged, to just over 300,000, another post-recession low. It is down from a high of nearly 400,000 five years ago, when the city\u2019s jobless rate reached 10 percent.The official figures on unemployment in the city had remained high through several months of steady increases in hiring, an inconsistency that had troubled elected officials. The unemployment rate is based on a survey of residents, while the monthly reports on jobs derive from separate surveys of employers.\u201cThese numbers are much better than I personally would have expected,\u201d Ms. Volovelsky said, noting that the city\u2019s unemployment rate had never dropped by half a percentage point in a single month in the 38 years it has been tracked.But she added that \u201cthere have been good improvements in jobs,\u201d particularly in the fields of retailing and manufacturing. The city\u2019s private sector has added about 105,000 jobs in the past year, for a growth rate of 3.1 percent. That was a significantly faster pace than the 2.1 percent gain the rest of the nation posted in the year.Statewide, the private sector added 3,900 jobs in August, lifting the total to a record high of more than 7.6 million, the Labor Department said. New York City and Long Island have accounted for nearly nine of every 10 private-sector jobs the state has gained in the past year.The state added jobs for 21 consecutive months, the longest streak in nearly 25 years, said Bohdan M. Wynnyk, deputy director of the department\u2019s division of research and statistics.The state\u2019s unemployment rate dropped to 6.4 percent, from 6.6 percent in July. That was still higher than the national unemployment rate, which declined to 6.1 percent last month.More than 600,000 New York State residents were counted as unemployed \u2014 meaning that they were actively trying to find jobs. But fewer than one-fourth of them were collecting unemployment insurance benefits last month, the Labor Department reported.New Jersey\u2019s job market looked weaker in August. The state lost about 900 jobs as its unemployment rate edged up to 6.6 percent, from 6.5 percent in July, the State Department of Labor and Workforce Development reported on Thursday.That loss followed a gain of about 5,500 jobs in New Jersey in July, the department said. The state still has not gained back all of the jobs it lost in the recession. Its total in August of about 4.2 million jobs was about 60,000 shy of the state\u2019s pre-recession peak in employment.Advertisement"}

He had seen clips of the Sunni fighters driving along the desert plains of Iraq and Syria, like outlaws in the wild West. \u201cThey are performing the American dream in a faraway land,\u201d Mr. Faramazian said. \u201cTheir goal is to make us weak, like they did with the Indians.\u201dIran also has a long history of victimhood, whether to Mongol invaders or Western intelligence agencies and oil companies. Iranians, with their language and faith, often feel lonely and isolated in the world arena.\u201cWhere most other states in the region were formed by colonial powers, Iran is an ancient empire,\u201d said Housang Tale, a historian and self-described nationalist. The West, he said, and especially the United States as a superpower, is well aware of Iran\u2019s great potential and therefore has committed itself to stopping the country from progressing in any way.\u201cWithout groups like ISIS we can revive our empire,\u201d Mr. Tale predicted, \u201cand become the biggest power in the region.\u201dVictimization plays an important role in the Islamic republic\u2019s official ideology. When the shah was ousted in 1979, the same revolutionaries who ended his rule said his downfall illustrated the plots committed by the United States, dropping the king after he had lost his usefulness.Iranian textbooks now say that when Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in 1979, taking diplomats and other personnel hostage for 444 days, they did so to forestall a coup d'\u00e9tat like the one organized by the C.I.A. in 1953, which led to the toppling of a democratically elected prime minister, Mohammad Mossadegh.The list of perceived wrongdoings is so long that every major current event involving the United States is explained by the state\u2019s ideologists as a plot to undermine Iranian interests.Ayatollah Khamenei labeled the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, a \u201csuspicious event.\u201d Former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called them a \u201cplot.\u201d The invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan that came after were clearly meant to create a ring of military bases around the country, officials have often said. The sanctions imposed over the Islamic republic\u2019s nuclear program are \u201cshackles.\u201d\u201cOur country and our revolution are oppressed, but we are powerful,\u201d Ayatollah Khamenei said on Thursday.On the streets, where many are openly critical of the clerical government \u2014its economic mismanagement, widespread corruption and a lack of freedoms \u2014 threats to the nation still hit a very raw nerve, even among the educated classes.Iran\u2019s support for Syria\u2019s president, Mr. Assad, never gained much traction among ordinary people here, who care more about the economy than about propping up the leader of a distant land.But why would the United States now declare ISIS a threat to its national security and say it is ready to bomb the group inside Syria, thereby bolstering Mr. Assad by attacking his most formidable opponent?\u201cThe United States created a monster, even beyond their own control,\u201d said Mr. Mohammadi. \u201cIf they don\u2019t stop ISIS now, nobody can predict what will happen in the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobs Stall and So Does the Economy", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe latest data also underscore how incremental improvements in labor conditions have failed to undo the damage from the recession and the prolonged slow recovery. For example, the share of adults in the labor force is no longer declining, as it did in 2013, but it remains at levels last seen in 1978. The recent unemployment rate, 6.1 percent, is down from the recession-era high of 10 percent in 2009, but it is still higher than at similar points in recoveries from other downturns going back to 1982. Worse, the unemployment rate today would be 9.6 percent if it included the estimated 5.9 million jobless people who would be working or looking for work if the job market were stronger. Wealth was also skewed. Overall it barely grew from 2010 to 2013. But it fell by 21 percent for the bottom 20 percent of families, to a mere $65,000 of net worth, and rose by 2 percent, to $3.3 million, for the top 10 percent. It is increasingly obvious that inequality of income and wealth are weighing on economic growth \u2014 especially on job creation and pay raises \u2014 by concentrating income and assets in the hands of a few who already have more than they can spend. The situation is not self-correcting. In fact, in the absence of government policies to foster balance, it is self-reinforcing. The Fed should continue to try to stimulate the economy with loose monetary policy. But only Congress can put in place the broad new policies on taxes, labor standards and immigration that will give all Americans a shot at a rising standard of living. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Germany, Business Indicator Falls, Raising Specter of Recession", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A closely watched indicator of German business sentiment fell more than expected on Wednesday to its lowest level since 2012, intensifying worries that the eurozone\u2019s largest economy is at risk of slipping into recession.The stalwart German economy has anchored the rest of the eurozone during four years of intermittent crisis and uneven growth. Any pause in German growth spells trouble for countries like France and Italy, which depend heavily on trade with Germany, and are in much worse shape economically.The German economy already suffered a decline in the second quarter, when output fell 0.2 percent compared with the previous quarter. Another consecutive quarterly decline would put the country into recession, according to a popular definition of the term.\u201cThe eurozone\u2019s biggest economy has reached a dangerous stage between soft spell and longer-lasting almost-stagnation,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING Bank, said in a note to clients.Within the survey, expectations for business in the next six months hit their lowest reading since December 2012, falling to 99.3, from 101.7 in August. The survey of about 7,000 managers measures sentiment compared with 2005, when the index was set at 100.\u201cThe German economy is no longer running smoothly,\u201d Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, said in a statement.The Ifo survey is the latest warning of flagging economic output in the eurozone, which has yet to recover to levels seen before the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. On Tuesday, a survey of purchasing managers in the eurozone by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, also signaled slowing growth.On Monday, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told members of the European Parliament in Brussels that \u201cthe economic recovery in the euro area is losing momentum.\u201dThere has been talk in Berlin of stepping up spending on infrastructure such as autobahns or university campuses, but the government led by Angela Merkel has shown little appetite for immense fiscal stimulus. On the contrary, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the finance minister, has expressed pride that the government will not need to borrow money next year.Each new sign of flagging growth raises expectations that the European Central Bank will soon resort to large-scale purchases of government bonds, the same so-called quantitative easing used by the Federal Reserve to spur growth in the United States. Economists at Barclays and Commerzbank, among others, expect the central bank to begin quantitative easing early next year.However, other economists doubt that the central bank is ready to risk alienating Germany, where many people regard government bond purchases by the central bank as a de facto transfer of wealth from richer European countries to poorer ones.\u201cThe E.C.B. is ready to do everything but buy government bonds,\u201d Joachim Fels, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley, told reporters here on Wednesday.Most economists do not expect the central bank to announce plans to buy government bonds at its next meeting, on Oct. 2. The central bank has already said it would buy private sector debt, beginning next month, and was expected to provide details next week.Some economists consider fears of another eurozone recession overblown. James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Fargo Asset Management, noted that the United States economy also sputtered several times before regaining momentum.\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon during a recovery to have temporary pauses,\u201d Mr. Paulsen said in an interview last week. Referring to the eurozone economy, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s been happening in recent months looks very familiar to me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Clamps Down on Web, Pinching Companies Like Google", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Google\u2019s problems in China just got worse.As part of a broad campaign to tighten internal security, the Chinese government has draped a darker shroud over Internet communications in recent weeks, a situation that has made it more difficult for Google and its customers to do business.Chinese exporters have struggled to place Google ads that appeal to overseas buyers. Biotechnology researchers in Beijing had trouble recalibrating a costly microscope this summer because they could not locate the online instructions to do so. And international companies have had difficulty exchanging Gmail messages among far-flung offices and setting up meetings on applications like Google Calendar.\u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating and annoying drain on productivity,\u201d said Jeffrey Phillips, an American energy executive who has lived in China for 14 years. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people spending their time figuring out how to send a file instead of getting their work done.\u201dEven as Google and other big technology companies have lobbied heavily for an easing of the restrictions, Beijing\u2019s broader scrutiny of multinationals has intensified. In late July, antimonopoly investigators raided Microsoft offices in four Chinese cities to interrogate managers and copy large amounts of data from hard drives. Qualcomm, a big maker of computer chips and a holder of wireless technology patents, faces a separate antimonopoly investigation.\u201cCompanies overlooked Internet problems when the economy was booming,\u201d said Shaun Rein, managing director of the China Market Research Group, a Shanghai consulting firm. \u201cBut now a lot of companies are asking whether they really need to be in China.\u201dThe chief technology officer of a start-up in China said it had been especially difficult to use Google Drive this summer, making it a challenge for employees to share files and documents.\u201cWe were hooked on collaborative editing,\u201d said the chief technology officer, who insisted on anonymity for fear of reprisal from the Chinese authorities. \u201cYou can edit a Word document or spreadsheet together and everything is kept in sync \u2014 that way our management could track the status of the products we were working on.\u201dJin Hetian, an archaeologist in Beijing, said it was difficult to do research using Baidu, a local search engine that has limitations for searches in English and other non-Chinese languages and that provides fewer specialized functions. \u201cI know some foreign scientists are studying the rings of ancient trees to learn about the climate, for example, but I can\u2019t find their work using Baidu,\u201d Ms. Jin said. \u201cWhen in China, I\u2019m almost never able to access Google Scholar, so I\u2019m left badly informed of the latest findings.\u201dKaiser Kuo, a spokesman for Baidu, said the company focused on indexing websites written in Chinese, since most of its customers are Chinese speakers.Access to some overseas academic sites has also been blocked. A Peking University professor was recently unable to file a letter of recommendation for a student applying to study at an American university because China had blocked the school\u2019s website, said a physics researcher at Peking University who insisted on anonymity for fear of retaliation by the Chinese authorities.Google\u2019s troubles in China have been building up for years.Google began encrypting users\u2019 searches and results all over the world early this year, partly in response to the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures about United States government surveillance. That shift by Google \u2014 using Internet addresses that start with \u201chttps\u201d \u2014 made it harder for Chinese censors to determine who was pursuing the types of inquiries that they discourage.\u201cInternet security is being raised to a much higher degree,\u201d said Xiao Qiang, a specialist in Chinese Internet censorship at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Information. \u201cIt overrides the other priorities, including commerce or scientific research.\u201dThe Chinese authorities typically allow a tiny fraction of searches and other Google activities to go through normally each day, with a slightly higher percentage being completed from mobile devices than from other devices. The government even unblocks Google for several hours roughly once a month, before reblocking it.Because censors permit a trickle of traffic to reach Google\u2019s servers in Hong Kong, many Chinese users keep reloading their Google pages again and again in the hope of getting through. This is creating an impression among many Chinese users, which state-controlled media have done little to dispel, that the problem must lie in shoddy Google service and not in the government\u2019s blocking of most Google activity.\u201cWe\u2019ve checked extensively, and there\u2019s nothing technically wrong on our end,\u201d said Taj Meadows, a spokesman at the company\u2019s Asia headquarters, in one of Singapore\u2019s most expensive harbor-front office buildings.Mr. Meadows declined to provide any comment on the blocking, except to say that Google was still focused on selling mobile and display ads in China and on providing ads and other services to Chinese businesses seeking to attract global consumers.China\u2019s crackdown on foreign Internet services coincides with two trends. One lies in the country\u2019s growing worries about domestic terrorism, particularly after a series of deadly attacks at train stations this year. The other is ever-rising nationalism, directed primarily at Japan but also at Japan\u2019s allies, notably the United States.President Xi Jinping of China, who is also the Communist Party chief, has made clear that he wants to maintain the party\u2019s primacy. He has signaled the importance he places on controlling the Internet by personally taking the top position in the party\u2018s leading group on cybersecurity.Internet users have tried any number of workarounds in China, with varying degrees of success.Mr. Phillips, the energy executive, said some of his friends in China used Outlook email instead of Gmail because Outlook email tended not to be blocked. But he voiced reluctance to switch his own email account after seeing media reports of the government raids on Microsoft\u2019s offices. \u201cWhat if they get blocked next? You can\u2019t keep switching services all the time.\u201dFrustrated users have often resorted to \u201cvirtual private network,\u201d or V.P.N., services to evade China\u2019s Internet filters. But those services, too, have come under concerted attack from the authorities, who have interrupted service to them with increasing frequency. Many ordinary citizens cannot afford or obtain access to V.P.N.s to begin with.In the meantime, Google\u2019s business continues to erode. Its share of the Chinese search engine market fell to 10.9 percent in the second quarter of this year, as the stepped-up blocking began to take effect \u2014 compared with one-third in 2009, when it still had servers there.Google\u2019s problems extend far beyond search. Its application store, called Google Play, is only partly accessible in China.That has led to the rise of a number of locally run application stores, which analysts say will sometimes market pirated copies of software or charge extra to promote a new application. Companies are often forced to create versions of their apps for China that are slightly different from the versions distributed to the rest of the world on Google\u2019s app store.\u201cBecause Google Play has low market share\u201d in the Chinese market, \u201capp publishers who have applications worldwide on Google Play don\u2019t receive the proportionate share of users in China without publishing to local Android stores, even if they have localized Chinese versions,\u201d said Bertrand Schmitt, chief executive of App Annie, a company that tracks global app distribution.Google also hosts publicly available libraries of coding scripts and fonts on its servers, but China now blocks these libraries. The chief technology officer at the start-up said his company had resorted to creating its own libraries and hosting them on its own servers, wasting costly computing power and space.\u201cWe have our own closed server in the office and host things there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to the cloud; it\u2019s like going back to the early 2000s.\u201dChoe Sang-Hun contributed reporting from Seoul, South Korea, and Austin Ramzy from Taipei, Taiwan.

{"Headline": "Seeing Women as Key to Economy, Japan\u2019s Leader Names 5 to Cabinet", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan unveiled a reshuffled cabinet on Wednesday that included five women, an apparent nod toward his promises to raise the status of women in the workplace. The appointments tie the record for the number of women in top political positions in Japan.Since taking office in December 2012, Mr. Abe has spoken of the need to revive Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, by more fully unleashing the potential of its huge pool of highly educated women, who have long been relegated to relatively low-ranking positions in the work force.He has even adopted the name \u201cwomenomics\u201d to describe his goal, a play on the term Abenomics, which is used for his plans to bring Japan back from years of economic malaise. But the prime minister has been criticized for having accomplished little of substance so far to help women beyond raising the issue of equal opportunity in a country where traditional gender roles remain deeply entrenched.According to GovernanceMetrics International, a research company based in New York that monitors corporate behavior, women make up less than 1 percent of the board members in Japanese corporations, ranking the country at the bottom of advanced economies. By comparison, women make up 11.4 percent of corporate boards in the United States and 9 percent in Germany.It is a similar story in politics. The United Nations says 8.1 percent of Japan\u2019s national lawmakers are women, less than half of the 18.3 percent in the United States.Women have made slow progress in Japan\u2019s work force since the country passed its first gender equal-opportunity law in 1986, when many women were stuck in clerical jobs as so-called blossoms of the workplace, serving tea and greeting visitors.While more women are now given bigger chances early in their careers, they still report facing a host of barriers to advancement, including the expectation by companies that career-minded employees demonstrate loyalty by spending most of their waking hours at the office. That often forces women to face stark choices between pursuing careers and having children. As part of his vows to empower women, Mr. Abe has promised to create more day care centers.In making the new cabinet appointments, the prime minister may have seen a political need to make a new gesture to female voters at a time when his popularity has been sliding. Polls show that public approval of his performance has fallen after a contentious decision to ease constitutional restrictions on the Japanese military, though his ratings still hover near a respectable 50 percent largely because of support for his economic policies.Cabinet reshuffles are common in Japan, with prime ministers using them to hand out posts to backers as a way of maintaining support. The new cabinet retained a conservative cast, and it includes people loyal to his assertive agenda of making Japan a more prominent player in regional security.The new cabinet is the first since 2001, when Junichiro Koizumi, Mr. Abe\u2019s political mentor, was prime minister, to have five of its 18 minister-level posts filled by women. Mr. Abe\u2019s previous cabinet, which was dissolved earlier on Wednesday, had two women.Mr. Abe on Wednesday repeated his pledges to increase the number of women in leadership positions, saying he wanted the women in his new cabinet to \u201cconjure a fresh wind of change by bringing women\u2019s perspectives.\u201d The official group photograph of the new cabinet, taken at the prime minister\u2019s residence, showed Mr. Abe standing in the center in a black tailcoat, surrounded by the five women in colorful dresses and kimonos.Of the five female members, the most prominent is Yuko Obuchi, the 40-year-old daughter of a former prime minister who has been seen as a rising star in Japanese politics. She will become trade minister, a powerful post. The four other women are lesser known political figures, though one, a former journalist, Midori Matsushima, 58, was named as justice minister, another important post.Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, 57, and Finance Minister Taro Aso, 73, held on to their spots. Shigeru Ishiba, 57, a popular rival of Mr. Abe\u2019s who had talked about distancing himself from the prime minister, was instead enticed into joining the cabinet as the minister in charge of reviving regional economies. He is seen by many as a possible next prime minister.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Franco-German Decoupling", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 There is something misleading about the current political excitement on both sides of the Seine. The ouster of three rebel ministers by a surprisingly firm president, a government reshuffle, a standing ovation delivered at Medef, the employers\u2019 union, for the Socialist prime minister who dared to proclaim, \u201cI love business!\u201d: All the action was set in Paris. Yet one could fantasize that, some 900 kilometers away, Berlin\u2019s invisible hand was quietly at play.Germany determines so much of France\u2019s economic life these days that it seems like the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in our political process. Last week\u2019s crisis erupted when the economy minister, the leftist Arnaud Montebourg, called for an alternative economic policy, in an interview with Le Monde. Nothing really new there, but he went one step too far when he launched an attack on Germany. \u201cWe need to raise our voice,\u201d Mr. Montebourg said. \u201cGermany is caught in a trap of austerity that it has imposed across Europe.\u201dPrime Minister Manuel Valls didn\u2019t wait long to let it be known that Mr. Montebourg had crossed a \u201cyellow line,\u201d when his office declared: \u201cAn economy minister cannot use such words ... to talk about a European partner.\u201d Unlike President Obama\u2019s red lines, yellow lines in France are usually enforced. Two days later, Mr. Montebourg was out.To France, Germany is not just any \u201cEuropean partner\u201d \u2014 it is the most important partner. Together, these two founding members of the European Union are supposed to form \u201can engine,\u201d \u201ca tandem,\u201d \u201ca couple.\u201d They are the pillars of Europe.But the Franco-German engine has stalled. Battered by the euro crisis, the famous couple is decoupling. The imbalance between the German economy, strengthened by reforms launched by Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der well before the crisis struck, and the French economy, unable to recover its competitiveness, is so deep that it is ruining the whole European dynamic. On Aug. 22 the German newspaper Handelsblatt dedicated a cover story to \u201cThe French Patient\u201d and \u201cthe economic decline of what used to be a proud nation.\u201d In \u201cA Tour of France: Examining the New Sick Man of Europe,\u201d Der Spiegel this summer poked fun at those French people dreaming of having \u201cla mannschaft\u201d instead of \u201cle malaise.\u201d Fifteen years ago, Germany was \u201cthe sick man of Europe.\u201d Today it is France\u2019s turn. One difference, though, is that 15 years ago the common currency, the euro, was just being launched. Today both economies are much more integrated and must enforce a common budgetary policy. Thanks to the strength of the German economy, Berlin has the upper hand. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has gone through phases about this. Early in his term, he antagonized Chancellor Angela Merkel by trying to head a group of Southern European countries favoring pro-growth policies. It was a disastrous mistake. A master of compromise, he then tried to recover using his left wing, allowing Mr. Montebourg and his friends to vent their anger at home against Bismarck and Ms. Merkel\u2019s \u201cintransigence,\u201d while ostensibly trying himself to play the perfect partner in the Franco-German couple. That didn\u2019t work either. Desperate to get the French economy back on track, Mr. Hollande is trying something new: a government unanimously committed to his vision of structural reforms and a team that won\u2019t utter a word against the German economic line.That doesn\u2019t mean that Mr. Hollande has given up hope of extracting more flexibility from Ms. Merkel on the pace of deficit reduction. The great debate on austerity versus growth is closing in on the chancellor, as Nobel Prize laureates, newspaper editorials and now, more importantly, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, advocate demand-side policies to complement structural reforms in order to fight unemployment. Those who wonder why France doesn\u2019t just do what Germany did under Mr. Schr\u00f6der over a decade ago forget one crucial factor: Back then, the economy was growing; cutting the budget deficit in a zero-growth environment is a different challenge. Even the German economy is slowing down. The French president is betting that, having provided Ms. Merkel with all the evidence that this time he finally means business, Berlin and therefore Brussels will give him some breathing space. Halfway into his term, Mr. Hollande has come to acknowledge the power of Germany. Today the real economic leader of the eurozone is Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, who has held the job for five years. It is Mr. Sch\u00e4uble who opposed the candidacy of Pierre Moscovici for the top economic job at the European Commission because of Paris\u2019s record on deficit reduction. (After much wrangling, Ms. Merkel finally compromised: Mr. Moscovici should get the post, but a more fiscally orthodox Finn, Jyrki Katainen, will be placed above him as vice president of the commission.) It is Mr. Sch\u00e4uble with whom Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, confers at every important political juncture, as he did again last week after the government reshuffle.Yet it would be too simplistic to see this process, as the French left tends to do, as merely humiliating subservience. Political intertwining between France and Germany cuts both ways: Germany needs France as much as France needs Germany. When German diplomats, businessmen, politicians or even journalists express their deep concern to French colleagues about the Gallic crisis, they are actually sincere. A weak France is not in Germany\u2019s interest, not only because France is its first customer, but also because the last thing Germany wants is to be leading alone. The way Ms. Merkel carefully includes Mr. Hollande in her dealings with President Vladimir Putin of Russia is revealing: Even though she is in the driver\u2019s seat on the issue of Ukraine, generally on foreign and security policy she wants to be seen as working with France. The Germans would love to freely enjoy their successes, unhindered by the burden of history. The eurozone would be much better off powered once again by a dual engine. For France and Germany, recoupling is the only option \u2014 if only their leaders could help.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Dutch Are Back in Town", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe DetailsStudio Job assembled 100 objects, many by Dutch designers, for the inaugural collection of Chamber, a new gallery in Chelsea founded by Juan Garcia Mosqueda. This Spectacle lamp ($6,100, edition of 25) was its own contribution.Chamber will sell objects like a wall lamp mounted with a pair of nerdy black spectacles and a sound-diffusing cabinet that looks like a chaotic pile of raw wood. (The piece has functional drawers, but how many and where they are takes some guessing.) There will even be a limited-edition perfume distilled exclusively for the gallery, its scent \u201cbased on the experience of a Louis Kahn structure.\u201d (That\u2019s the news release talking.)Chamber\u2019s contents may seem offbeat, but they will not be random. They have been selected by Studio Job, an atelier based in Belgium and the Netherlands that is itself sprinkled with the dust of the Wunderkammer. Founded in 2000 by Job Smeets and Nynke Tynagel, a married couple, Studio Job has produced furniture dense with Bavarian-folk-themed marquetry, a lamp shaped like a construction crane and bronze cat sculptures with eyes that literally glow. For Chamber, it acquired, designed or collaborated with other artists in the production of 100 objects. These will be sold at the gallery over the next two years. After that, a new curator will step in with a different collection.Not unexpectedly, given Studio Job\u2019s Low Countries provenance, many of the designers contributing to Chamber are Dutch. Some, like Mr. Smeets, were members of Droog, the influential Dutch collaborative known for high-concept objects. Gijs Bakker, for instance, a jewelry designer who founded Droog in 1993 with Renny Ramakers, a writer, has produced a stippled titanium brooch for the gallery that represents the moon as it was first photographed in 1968 from outer space.Others whose work will be on display are graduates of the Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands, which remains a training ground for designers in the Droog mold. (Mr. Smeets and Ms. Tynagel met there as students.) Maarten Baas, for example, made a sensation with his 2002 Eindhoven thesis project: traditional furniture pieces blackened with a blowtorch. He has returned to his Smoke series many times since. For Chamber, he crisped a workbench produced by Manufactum, a German company that is a favorite of the gallery\u2019s 26-year-old Argentine founder, Juan Garcia Mosqueda. It has been a while since so many thought-provoking Netherlandish designs congregated in a single New York venue. In the mid-1990s, at the SoHo gallery Moss, you could catch your first glimpse of work by Hella Jongerius, Marcel Wanders and Jurgen Bey, Droog designers who grew into superstars. In 1995, the curator Paola Antonelli installed pieces by Tejo Remy, Joep van Lieshout and other contemporary Dutch artists in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s cafe. (Mr. Garcia Mosqueda later did internships at Moss and with Ms. Antonelli.) In 2009, Droog itself created a SoHo shop. It lasted less than two years, a casualty of an awkward duplex space and a global economic crisis. Mr. Bakker and Ms. Ramakers ended their partnership soon after it opened.But Chamber is only one token of a new Dutch design invasion here. Three hundred and fifty years after the Dutch surrendered New Amsterdam to the British, several of their more creative descendants are reclaiming this turf. In March, the first American branch of the Dutch hotel chain CitizenM opened in Times Square. Like its European siblings, it has tiny guest rooms, streamlined services and vibrant public spaces exploding with color. The design template is by Concrete, an architecture and branding company based in Amsterdam that is now working on a three-tower residential project on the New Jersey waterfront as well as affordable housing on Staten Island.This month, finishing touches are being put on Huys, an office building at Park Avenue and 28th Street that has been converted into a 58-unit luxury condo. Huys (which is pronounced, and means, \u201chouse\u201d) is an all-Dutch affair: The developer is Kroonenberg Groep, based in Amsterdam, and the designer is Piet Boon, who practices a lush, restrained international style. Karin Meyn, Mr. Boon\u2019s wife, styled the cream-colored d\u00e9cor and selected the art, much of it by her compatriots. Piet Oudolf, the landscape designer probably best known to New Yorkers for planting feathery perennials on the High Line, is in charge of the rooftop garden. And at press time, workers were preparing to hoist Frederik Molenschot\u2019s biomorphic cast-bronze chandelier in the lobby. (Mr. Molenschot, an Amsterdam artist, also supplied all of the room numbers, which are solid brass.)With Huys getting ready to open in October, Mr. Boon has moved on \u2014 to Brooklyn. He designed Oosten (Dutch for \u201ceast\u201d), a condominium to be built on the two-acre site of a former brewery at 429 Kent Avenue in South Williamsburg. Scheduled for completion in 2016, the complex, the first ground-up American project of the Chinese XIN Development Group International, will have 216 units, including 15 townhouses, and a 55-foot-long swimming pool.And then there\u2019s Moooi (\u201cbeautiful\u201d in Dutch, with an extra \u201co\u201d for emphasis). The design company, founded 14 years ago by Marcel Wanders, is known for selling eccentricities like Studio Job\u2019s massive, stripped-down furniture made of paper. Early next year, it will open its first American showroom on East 31st Street and Madison Avenue.Why New York? Why now? Like a chorus of old vaudevillians, the people who were asked to explain the recent influx of Dutch design all used the same word: timing. The American economy has bounced back faster than Europe\u2019s, they said, and New York remains a cultural capital, with an international assortment of big spenders. Lesley Bamberger, chief executive of Kroonenberg Groep, Huys\u2019s developer, said he bought the building at 404 Park Avenue South 14 years ago as an investment. Then the New York real estate market heated up, and there is no one like the Dutch to seize a commercial opportunity. \u201cThe Dutch have always been tradesmen,\u201d he said, adding that Huys is 90 percent sold. All that remains available (and only because they haven\u2019t been listed) are five of the six penthouses, priced from $6.75 million.\u201cThere are lots of business reasons and lots of emotional reasons\u201d for the decision to open in New York, said Casper Vissers, Moooi\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. Over the last four years, the company\u2019s American sales have doubled every year and now represent 25 percent of its business. On top of that, he added, New York is filled with architects and designers who are Moooi\u2019s primary customers, although they may not realize that the company produces furniture. (Eighty percent of what Americans buy from Moooi is lighting, Mr. Vissers said, including a wiry LED-studded sphere called Raimond that is currently the company\u2019s biggest seller in the States.) Moooi is also looking to expand to the West Coast and Chicago.Robert Kloos, director for visual arts, architecture and design at the Netherlands Consulate General in New York, said that the recession did some Dutch designers a backhanded favor by causing the generous government subsidies awarded to the Dutch cultural sector to be cut by 20 percent.As a result, designers diversified their practices and sought markets abroad. Compared with 2008, Mr. Kloos said, \u201cI\u2019m pleasantly surprised that these days not only are there 40 to 50 percent more projects by Dutch artists and designers in the U.S., but the quality has also accelerated.\u201dYet it was precisely those subsidies that allowed Dutch designers to braise in the juices of their creativity without worrying about paying the rent. Piet Boon\u2019s sleek, creamy neutrality makes him an easy sell. But how will the quirky creations associated with the phrase \u201cDutch design\u201d fare today in the land of Ethan Allen? Ghislaine Van Loosbroek Vi\u00f1as, a New York interior designer born in the Netherlands and raised in South Africa, likes to sprinkle Moooi designs into her projects. One of her litmus tests with clients is a table the company developed in 2006 with the Swedish design collective Front, a life-size black pig balancing a tray on its head. \u201cI love, love, love that table,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many people I showed it to before I found one who liked it.\u201dMs. Vi\u00f1as first balked at making generalizations about Dutch design, but soon identified some hallmarks. There is the abundant and adroit use of color, she said, and a playfulness that Americans might consider childish but is merely contemporary. \u201cI think that what the American audience may not be ready for,\u201d she added, \u201cand what they don\u2019t get automatically, is the irony and wit that so much Dutch design has.\u201dWill Moooi\u2019s witty offerings be culled for an American market? Mr. Vissers said that what you see in Amsterdam you will get in New York, in an environment whose mise-en-sc\u00e8ne resembles that of the flagship showroom. But over all, the company has been toning things down. \u201cFor sure, in the past our collection was not fit to complete a house with,\u201d said Mr. Wanders, the company\u2019s creative director. \u201cIt was more you\u2019d add a few Moooi pieces to give a place some extra character.\u201d That is changing, he said, with the addition of quieter pieces that are not intended to start conversations, but simply furnish a room. \u201cMore and more, you see the collection of Moooi as a collection you can build interiors with.\u201dSpeaking of the early years of Droog and the work that set so many tongues wagging, the avant-garde design purveyor Murray Moss made a distinction: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t clever, it was smart,\u201d he said. Mr. Moss believes that the \u201cwow factor\u201d of curios like Mr. Wanders\u2019s porcelain bud vase created from a burned-away sponge or Peter van der Jagt\u2019s doorbell that rang a pair of wineglasses overwhelmed their ingenuity and depth. \u201cThere was humor, and there was hubris, and it resulted in a redefinition of what beauty was,\u201d he said.The passage of time has allowed such pieces to be viewed without the stigma of novelty, he said. They can be appreciated alongside the designs of other influential movements. And with Studio Job\u2019s assemblage for Chamber, which brings new artists into the mix, one can also see how the Dutch design DNA is being passed down. \u201cI love that work,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cI was the first to look at it. Now it\u2019s going on to a new generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Israel Silences Dissent", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorJAFFA, Israel \u2014 On July 12, four days after the latest war in Gaza began, hundreds of Israelis gathered in central Tel Aviv to protest the killing of civilians on both sides and call for an end to the siege of Gaza and the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. They chanted, \u201cJews and Arabs refuse to be enemies.\u201dHamas had warned that it would fire a barrage of rockets at central Israel after 9 p.m., and it did.The same thing happened at another antiwar protest in Haifa a week later; this time, the victims included the city\u2019s deputy mayor, Suhail Assad, and his son. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no statement condemning the violence, even though he had previously stated his primary concern was the safety of Israeli citizens.The vilification of the few Israelis who don\u2019t subscribe to right-wing doctrine is not new. Similar acts of incitement occurred before the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. But now they have multiplied, escalated and spread.In July, the veteran Israeli actress Gila Almagor performed at Tel Aviv\u2019s Habima Theater even though she had received threats that she would be murdered on stage. In an interview in the Israeli daily Yediot Aharonot a few days earlier, she had expressed feeling ashamed after a 16-year old Palestinian, Muhammad Abu Khdeir, was kidnapped and burned alive by Jewish extremists.In an interview during the Gaza war, the popular comedian Orna Banai said she felt terrible that Palestinian women and children were being killed \u2014 she was subsequently fired from her position as spokeswoman for an Israeli cruise ship operator. And Haaretz hired bodyguards for its columnist Gideon Levy after he wrote an article criticizing Israeli Air Force pilots.The aggressive silencing of anyone who voices disapproval of Israeli policies or expresses empathy with Palestinians is the latest manifestation of an us-versus-them mentality that has been simmering for decades. It is based on the narrative that Palestinians are enemies who threaten Jewish sovereignty and are solely to blame for the failure to achieve peace. The Israeli peace camp \u2014 which remains obsessively focused on stopping settlement expansion and pursuing the ever-elusive two-state solution while ignoring Israel\u2019s failure to separate religion and state and guarantee equal rights for Arab citizens \u2014 has been incapable of challenging this mentality.Israeli society has been unable and unwilling to overcome an exclusivist ethno-religious nationalism that privileges Jewish citizens and is represented politically by the religious settler movement and the increasingly conservative secular right. Israel\u2019s liberal, progressive forces remain weak in the face of a robust economy that profits from occupation while international inaction reinforces the status quo. In their attempt to juggle being both Jewish and democratic, most Israelis are choosing the former at the expense of the latter.Israel has never, for example, genuinely addressed the fact that non-Jewish Arabs who generally identify as Palestinian account for about 20 percent of the population (this excludes the approximately three million Palestinians living under Israel\u2019s control in East Jerusalem and the West Bank). Israel has also never clearly defined its borders, preferring to keep them vague and porous. Nor has it defined what it means to be \u201cIsraeli,\u201d as distinct from being \u201cJewish,\u201d leaving a vacuum that has been filled by nationalist and religious ideologues.This has allowed the us-versus-them mentality to bleed into Israeli Jewish society. \u201cUs\u201d no longer refers to any Jewish citizen, and \u201cthem\u201d to any Palestinian. Now, \u201cus\u201d means all those who defend the status quo of occupation and settlement expansion, including many Christian evangelicals and Republicans in America. And \u201cthem\u201d means anyone who tries to challenge that status quo, whether a rabbi, a dissenting Israeli soldier or the president of the United States.Perhaps this shouldn\u2019t come as a shock. For most of Israel\u2019s existence, the majority of Israelis have allowed the state, in the name of Jewish sovereignty and security, to violate Palestinians\u2019 basic human rights \u2014 including access to water and the freedom of movement and assembly. The state has killed unarmed protesters and then failed to carry out investigations; it has allowed settlers and soldiers to act with impunity; and it has systematically discriminated against non-Jewish citizens. After so many years of repressing those who stand in the way, the transition to targeting \u201cone of your own\u201d isn\u2019t so difficult. Now it is the few Jewish Israelis who speak the language of human rights who are branded as enemies. Mairav Zonszein, an Israeli-American writer, translator and editor, blogs at +972 Magazine. An opinion essay on Sept. 27 about pressure on the Israeli left incorrectly described the actress Gila Almagor\u2019s response to a death threat in July. She went through with her performance, at Tel Aviv\u2019s Habima Theater; she did not decide to cancel it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growing Imbalance Between Germany and France Strains Their Relationship", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 It was a clear illustration of the dysfunction of the French-German partnership, the axis that for decades kept Europe on a united and dynamic track.That rhetorical volley was the latest example of how far the partners have drifted apart. While their formal relationship remains close, the power balance has shifted sharply since Europe\u2019s debt crisis erupted, raising doubts about their ability to continue their traditional role of together leading Europe in new economic and political directions.The two countries are in such different places \u2014 economically, socially and politically \u2014 that the vaunted partnership teeters on the verge of a breakdown, analysts warn.But the French economy has grown stagnant, with unemployment stubbornly stuck near 11 percent and an unpopular government pledging to cut tens of billions in taxes on business, which many French fear will unravel their prized welfare state.Ms. Merkel, by default but also design, has become Europe\u2019s strongest leader. While the German economy has shown signs of slowing down, rumblings by Germans about the limitations of austerity have remained nothing more than background noise.The schism between the two nations may come to a head this week, when Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France arrives in Berlin on Monday for talks with Ms. Merkel, his first visit since taking office last spring. The trip will also include talks with German business leaders.France is not so much bucking austerity as it is playing for time. Faced with a weak economy and a growing deficit, French leaders say they have reached the limits of what they can cut to meet European Union deficit targets. Rather, they argue, France needs reform and investment to spur the economy and create rising tax revenues to bring the deficit into line.Mr. Valls has said Germany must understand that France is not likely to reach its deficit targets more quickly merely by making deeper budget cuts.In recent days, his message has grown more strident. Asked by a reporter on Friday how he would persuade France\u2019s European partners to let him extend the deficit timeline, and convince them that France was not seeking special treatment, he said the deficit was \u201cnot a special treatment,\u201d but \u201ca fact.\u201d\u201cI will not ask for indulgence,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t participate in a punitive vision of France or any other country on these issues.\u201dMs. Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble have remained unmoved. On Friday she reiterated that Germany intended to balance its budget for 2015. Her spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said, \u201cGermany has a huge interest in a strong France, an economically prosperous France.\u201dBut other officials have expressed increasing concern about France. Asked recently about the relationship, one European leader said, on the condition of anonymity: \u201cWhat Franco-German axis? There are no French.\u201dBy appearing to buck austerity, Mr. Valls may gain political support at home at a time when it is eroding quickly. He and Mr. Hollande have alienated many members of the Socialist Party by taking a more centrist approach to economic policy, stoking suspicions that the government is favoring business at the expense of the welfare state.While Mr. Valls has not outlined any new spending stimulus, setting limits on additional budget cuts in France may help appease voters and draw attention away from the far-right National Front, which has increasingly consolidated political gains.Nevertheless, Mr. Mo\u00efsi of the French Institute for International Relations said, France had been weakened by its economic and political problems.\u201cThe French can say diplomacy still makes us the equal of Germany, but this is not the way the world perceives Europe,\u201d he said. When President Obama, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia or Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China want to deal with Europe, he said, \u201cthey care for Merkel, not for Hollande.\u201dA weakened French-German alliance comes at a precarious time. Europe appears on the cusp of more upheaval. Passions and rifts stirred by the independence vote in Scotland, the crisis in Ukraine, persistently high youth unemployment, sluggish growth and rising populism challenge European leaders when many have lost the faith of their voters.It is not the first time the French-German alliance has weakened. Just over a decade ago, as Ms. Merkel is fond of noting, Germany was Europe\u2019s sick economy. It recovered partly because of changes to labor laws and social welfare. Mr. Hollande now faces a similar task in an era of low or no growth.Alfred Grosser, a leading German-French writer and sociologist, said the modern relationship has never been so dire. Still, he said, while the news media and political elites highlight the tension, ordinary French and Germans remain deeply bound to one another, the result of their shared history since 1945.What those people need is leadership, he added. With Mr. Hollande so weak, and Ms. Merkel so cautious, even enigmatic, the French and German people feel a void. \u201cWhat the chancellor thinks, almost no one knows,\u201d Mr. Grosser said. \u201cWhat does she want with Europe?\u201dThe situation has grown more complicated than may be resolved merely by France toeing the Germans\u2019 line, analysts said.Alison Smale reported from Berlin, and Liz Alderman from Paris.

{"Headline": "Scottish Vote Weighs Pride Against Risk", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEDINBURGH \u2014 The people of Scotland decide Thursday whether national pride outweighs economic risk.The vote on independence is taking place without any of the usual factors that drive the dissolution of great nations: no war, no acute economic crisis, no raging territorial dispute. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite: peace, a slowly recovering economy and a central government in London that promises to grant more powers over taxing and spending to the Scottish Parliament.The Scots cannot claim they have not been warned about the uncertain and even dire economic consequences of splitting from the United Kingdom, on issues like the currency, investment, pensions and declining energy revenues from the North Sea.Economists normally as ideologically disparate and disputatious as Alan Greenspan, Paul Krugman and Adam S. Posen, as well as the historian Niall Ferguson, who often writes about economics, all have predicted a negative economic outlook for an independent Scotland, while expressing anxiety, too, about the impact of such uncertainty on the larger European and global economies.Those warnings, echoed by many British leaders and business executives, and traditional feelings of connection and kinship on this island, may narrowly win the day.But half of Scots, give or take a few percentage points, are expected to vote for independence anyway. Some do not believe the negative forecasts, calling them \u201cfear-mongering.\u201d Some say they resent the sense that an outside elite is patronizing them or doubting their capacity. And many will vote yes for other reasons \u2014 to feel responsible for their own fate and to build, or rebuild, what they hope will be a fairer, less unequal country of their own, for better or worse.Alyn Smith, a pro-independence Scottish member of the European Parliament and a former corporate lawyer, said that the British government did what was best for the United Kingdom, not necessarily for Scotland. \u201cThe U.K. does not incentivize how to grow the Scottish economy, but the U.K. economy,\u201d he said.Those opposed to independence, called the \u201cBetter Together\u201d campaign, have focused so much on the potentially negative effects of independence that many Scots seem to have simply stopped listening, or decided that they prefer the reassurances of Alex Salmond, the leader of the independence movement. Mr. Salmond maintains that Scotland can stand on its own, that the British government is \u201cbluffing\u201d when it says it has ruled out a currency union, and that the European Union is exaggerating the difficulties Scotland would face in joining the bloc as a new member.\u201cThe no campaign has been prophesying that the sky will fall for so long that it\u2019s just all noise and not credible anymore,\u201d Mr. Smith said.There is resentment, too, among independence supporters at what is seen as dismissive attitudes of British elites. They point to an appearance in Scotland in February by the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, when he declared that it would be impossible for Britain to have a currency union with an independent Scotland \u2014 but took no questions on the topic, one of the most important of the campaign.\u201cPeople were offended that this politician from southern England, with no real standing in Scotland, should talk to us in those terms,\u201d Mr. Smith said.Iain Macwhirter, a columnist for The Sunday Herald newspaper, called Mr. Osborne\u2019s visit a turning point in the campaign. Why is \u201cProject Fear\u201d not working? he asked. \u201cWhy have so many Scots refused to heed the warnings of press, politicians and banks?\u201d His answer: \u201cWell, in a nutshell, George Osborne happened.\u201dThose who favor independence argue that Scotland is politically and culturally alienated from a government in London dominated by the Conservatives and the power of money. Many in left-leaning Scotland say a yes vote would bring them not only autonomy but also a more Scandinavian-style social democracy \u2014 nuclear free and more equitable.Some in the yes campaign seem to be making quasi-economic arguments of their own, selling Scotland as a socialist paradise of enhanced benefits fueled by endless amounts of North Sea oil and gas.Yet the warnings of British and international economists are not easily dismissed. They tend to center on questions of the currency, budget deficits, energy resources and relatively lower growth in Scotland, as well as reduced clout in global affairs for a shrunken Britain.Tight polls have many in Washington freshly alarmed, with the White House and many American heavyweights voicing strong support for keeping the United Kingdom together.The no camp warns that Scotland would lose not just the British pound but a sizable chunk of its financial sector as banks and insurers flee south, taking jobs and capital with them. With the future of oil revenues uncertain and declining, an independent Scotland could not afford its current welfare state, let alone expand it, the argument goes.He said that pro-nationalist assurances that Britain would continue to serve as Scotland\u2019s central bank after a divorce were most likely wrong, and that attempts by a newly independent Scotland to use the British pound would \u201cbreak apart very quickly.\u201dOthers see both the risks and benefits of independence as overstated. The new nation would be well-off to start with, but on course to grow poorer: Scotland has a G.D.P. per capita above most regions of Britain, lagging behind only London and the southeast of England. But Scottish productivity is 11 percent lower than in the rest of Britain, and its population is unhealthier and aging more rapidly. Mr. Salmond\u2019s plan to increase public spending by 3 percent a year means that even if the Scottish government spends all of its oil revenues, the hole in its finances will grow without higher taxes or higher-than-anticipated economic growth.If the pro-independence side wins, economists predict, Scotland would face the uncertainty that would hang over 18 months of divorce negotiations, which will tackle thorny issues like the division of oil revenues, the national debt and the currency.A breakdown of the issues voters will consider Thursday in Scotland\u2019s referendum on independence.The currency has been the biggest flash point in recent months. Even left-leaning economists warn that a currency union that lacks a fiscal union and a true \u201clender of last resort\u201d would make Scotland vulnerable to the same risks that nearly undid the eurozone. Excluding oil, Scotland ran a public sector deficit of nearly 11 percent of its national income in 2012-13 \u2014 a bigger gap than in Greece or Ireland.\u201cIn psychological terms, independence represents a form of magical thinking,\u201d said Colin McLean, a Scottish fund manager. \u201cWithout understanding the precise mechanism, this single change represents a cure-all for widely conflicting aspirations ranging from growth to redistribution.\u201dNot all business leaders are against independence. Ken Beaty, a former investment strategist and a Scot, lives in England so cannot vote, but said he saw the struggle for Scots as hope versus fear. \u201cBut some things are worth taking risks for,\u201d he said.Stephen Gethins, a former adviser to Mr. Salmond, said that economists were focused too much on the challenges of independence instead of on the opportunities presented by the Scottish resources of oil, gas and renewable energy through wind and waves; of whisky, food and tourism; of a thriving energy-services sector; and of a people that have traditionally exported their best minds to London and the world.The referendum allows those 16 and over to vote, and while younger voters are divided in their opinions, they also appear more likely to be optimistic and less likely to be swayed by economic arguments. Kate Macauley, 19, flew home to Glasgow from a summer job in Massachusetts to vote.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sure, but I want to make our own way, to improve things we want to improve,\u201d she said. And if the noes win? \u201cI\u2019d be devastated,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d just hope that somehow we\u2019d have another chance.\u201dAn article on Thursday about the rising appeal of the Scottish independence movement despite warnings about the risks of dissolution referred imprecisely to the author Niall Ferguson, who was among those predicting a negative outcome for an independent Scotland. Though Mr. Ferguson often writes about economics, he was trained as a historian; he is not an economist.Steven Erlanger reported from Edinburgh, and Katrin Bennhold from Glasgow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Air France Pilots\u2019 Strike Casts Doubt on Carrier\u2019s Future", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 More than a week into the strike by French pilots against Air France-KLM, the two sides are stuck in a holding pattern. The only certainty seems to be that the dispute is doing severe financial damage to the airline, making it increasingly likely that neither party will eventually come away as a winner in any meaningful sense.With the cost of the pilots\u2019 walkout now approaching 20 million euros, or $26 million, per day, investors and politicians can only wonder whether the opposing sides\u2019 shared commitment to the airline\u2019s survival will prove strong enough to avert disaster.\u201cNo airline is immortal,\u201d Alexandre de Juniac, the Air France-KLM chief executive, told a French television interviewer Monday night.After nearly three years of slashing operating costs, a total of about \u20ac2 billion, and squeezing wherever possible to extract more productivity from a staff thinned by 8,000 job cuts, Air France-KLM had succeeded in reducing its debt and nearly tripling the group\u2019s annual cash flow \u2014 to \u20ac1.3 billion at the end of 2013.Until this month, the prospect of restoring the group to even modest profit \u2014 after nearly a decade of losses \u2014 appeared within reach. And plans were moving forward to invest more than \u20ac1 billion in the growth of the group\u2019s modest, no-frills subsidiary, Transavia, in hopes of building it into a leading European budget carrier.\u201cThese efforts are being destroyed in just a few days,\u201d a visibly dejected Mr. de Juniac said in the TV interview. \u201cI do have to say it is really sad.\u201dThe pilots\u2019 union sees things otherwise. Its president, Jean-Louis Barber, has called for the company to abandon the Transavia plan, which the union sees as a threat to French pilot jobs, and he vowed Monday to continue the strike \u201cfor as long as management does not change its philosophy.\u201dAnalysts have long criticized Air France-KLM and its big European flagship peers like Lufthansa and Alitalia of grossly underestimating the threat, first posed decades ago, by nimble start-ups like Ryanair and easyJet, and of failing to adapt their business models in response. Today, a half-dozen low-cost carriers control close to 40 percent of the intra-European air travel market, while in purely domestic markets like France, the British company easyJet is now a close second to Air France at many of the country\u2019s busiest airports, including Paris Orly.Even analysts who applaud the strategic responses of Air France-KLM and Lufthansa to the low-cost revolution, however belated, say the obstacles to success are daunting for a host of reasons, not least of which is the size of the budget carriers\u2019 head start.Ryanair is already Europe\u2019s largest airline by number of passengers, with a fleet of 300 planes. And it expects to carry more than 81 million passengers this year, four times the number that Air France-KLM had projected a pumped-up Transavia would have by 2017. EasyJet carries more than 60 million passengers annually.\u201cFifteen years ago, a top airline executive told me the low-cost business model would not succeed and claimed that start-ups such as Ryanair would never acquire a significant market share,\u201d Pierre Sparaco, an industry watcher at Aviation Week, wrote of an Air France official. While Mr. Sparaco faulted pilots, too, for refusing to adapt to the new competitive realities, he said past managers at Air France were \u201cequally culpable.\u201d He also noted France\u2019s long tradition of government intervention to protect national champions \u2014 and jobs \u2014 when times got tough.To observers like Mr. Sparaco, the ferocity of the pilots\u2019 resistance to the new Air France-KLM strategy must be viewed in the context of the airline\u2019s prolonged state of competitive denial.After rejecting management\u2019s offer on Monday to delay implementation of its new low-cost expansion in the hope of sorting out a compromise by the end of the year, leaders of the French National Union of Airline Pilots have hardened their position by calling on Air France-KLM to withdraw the plan entirely. Convinced that the airline\u2019s ultimate aim is to shift well-paid jobs outside France, the unions have stepped up their appeal to France\u2019s leaders to intervene. On Tuesday, hundreds of pilots protested in uniform outside the National Assembly in central Paris.But the dispute is one that France\u2019s beleaguered Socialist government is loath to step into at a time when it is under intense pressure from European partners to show progress on labor-market and other reforms aimed at kick-starting the country\u2019s sagging economy.After eight days of the airline strike, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2014 with a 13 percent approval rating and battling to stem a rebellion from coalition partners on the far left \u2014 has yet to mention the pilots\u2019 walkout in public. But his prime minister, Manuel Valls, has publicly taken the airline\u2019s side.\u201cThis strike has no reason, is not understood by the French, gives France a bad image and is a real danger for the company,\u201d Mr. Valls said Tuesday.\u201cIt seems to me this question is not mature,\u201d Mr. Vidalies said on the sidelines of an industry fair in Berlin.With a 16 percent stake in the airline, the French government \u2014 and by extension, French taxpayers \u2014 have a vested interest in restoring Air France-KLM to profitability. And in an environment of anemic growth and high unemployment in the country, leaders are eager to embrace the airline\u2019s promises of many as 1,000 new French jobs.A number of Air France\u2019s smaller unions have thrown their support to the pilots. But some of the country\u2019s most prominent labor leaders have broken ranks, expressing their frustration over a category of workers that much of the public views as overly privileged.Salaries for Air France pilots start at around \u20ac75,000 a year \u2014 three and a half times France\u2019s median annual income of \u20ac20,000 \u2014 and can rise with seniority to as high as \u20ac250,000. And for their money, most of the airline\u2019s pilots fly fewer than 700 hours annually, which is substantially less than the 900-hour maximum set by European Union safety regulators.Laurent Berger, secretary general of one of the top two unions, the C.F.D.T., last week condemned the pilots\u2019 strike as \u201cindecent,\u201d and noted that thousands of ground staff and cabin crew members, who have continued to work throughout the strike, were \u201cexasperated.\u201d\u201cThis company has been restructuring for more than two years, with everyone else doing their part,\u201d Mr. Berger said, \u201cand yet the pilots don\u2019t seem to want to participate.\u201dThe French government, with limited influence as only a minority shareholder in the airline, and with its traditional labor constituency divided, has little leverage to force a compromise. Meanwhile, analysts said Air France-KLM\u2019s fate would be ultimately be decided by cultural, rather than financial, reform.\u201cThis is about transformational change,\u201d said Chris Tarry, an independent airline consultant in London. \u201cSetting the financial target is the relatively easy bit\u201d for any company, he said. \u201cBut if you haven\u2019t got the cultural change \u2014 if unions huff and puff and go on strike \u2014 all you do is damage your business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Data, Old Story ", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe economy has been on the road to recovery since mid-2009, when the Great Recession officially ended. But, for most Americans, recovery is not there yet, and, at the recent rate of progress, it won\u2019t be for a long time, if ever. The situation is even bleaker for households led by people under age 65. Unlike older households, their income is not usually cushioned by steady Social Security payments; instead, they rely largely on paychecks in an era of flat or falling wages. For them, median income from 2000 to 2013 declined 11.2 percent, from nearly $65,800 to $58,450. Similarly, poverty among children fell from 2012 to 2013, but remains above its levels in 2007 and 2000. The improvement, such as it is, appears to stem from a rise in the employment and earnings of low-income parents. That is, of course, a positive sign in any recovery: When jobs begin to grow, low-income groups hit the hardest in the bad times should show clear signs of a rebound. Progress toward economic health has been and continues to be slow and unreliable. That\u2019s because the policy response never was and probably never will be commensurate with the damage caused by the serial recessions and poor recoveries since 2000. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "America Out of Whack", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is something out of whack in America. Instead of promoting equality, public policy has left millions locked into lives of restricted opportunity while bestowing the benefits of growth on the very few.\u201cthe net worth of households and nonprofits rose by $1.4 trillion to $81.5 trillion during the second quarter of 2014. The value of directly and indirectly held corporate equities increased $1.0 trillion and the value of real estate expanded $230 billion.\u201d\u201cAmerica\u2019s companies and company owners \u2014 the small group of Americans who own and control America\u2019s corporations \u2014 are hogging a record percentage of the country\u2019s wealth for themselves.\u201dThe September 2014 Fed Bulletin provides data on income as well as wealth. Figure 2 shows that the share of income going to the bottom 90 percent has been on a downward path since 1992, while the share flowing to the top 3 percent has grown.The question is: Why don\u2019t we have redistributive mechanisms in place to deploy the trillions of dollars in new wealth our economy has created to shore up the standard of living of low- and moderate-income workers, to restore financial stability to Medicare and Social Security, to improve educational resources and to institute broader and more reliable forms of social insurance?I asked Shawn Fremstad, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a pro-Democratic think tank, to address current income and wealth disparities, and he wrote back by email:\u201ca big-picture solution involves higher marginal income tax rates for the top 1 percent and some sort of wealth tax on the top of the top, combined with stronger labor market institutions (minimum wage, unions, paid leave/sick days/vacations, etc.).\u201dBut not only are Republicans adamantly opposed to redistributive public policy, there are also strong pro-wealth forces in the upscale wing of the Democratic Party.Many center-left economists are wary of raising taxes on wealth, as opposed to income. They cite their fear of creating disincentives to innovation, the flight of wealth to low-tax havens, and the establishment of new tax avoidance schemes here in America.Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. who supports more public investment in education, infrastructure and social services, wrote to me that a wealth tax could prove \u201cvery distortionary and naturally discouraging of saving, not a good thing in the current U.S. context.\u201dHow bad has it gotten? Most recently, beginning roughly in 2000, a critical mass of adverse economic developments has gained momentum.Beaudry theorizes that it was in 2000 that advances in technology and automation, in trade, especially with China, and in the outsourcing of American jobs abroad came together to produce an inflection point.The net result, Beaudry said, is that a significantly smaller fraction of the population benefits from growth.Beaudry places the strongest emphasis on rapidly accelerating technological advances that are displacing workers so fast that new job creation can\u2019t catch up.The current apportionment of economic rewards in the United States, Beaudry notes, is similar to the pattern in America and England during the Industrial Revolution from 1780 to 1830, when workers struggled while factory owners flourished.Beaudry also raised the question of whether the putative advantages of free market capitalism are failing in the context of global competition and the information revolution. \u201cSomething has been going wrong with the competitive system,\u201d he told me.Other economists cite findings supportive of Beaudry\u2019s thesis that the United States is undergoing a fundamental transformation.\u201cThe substantial recent decline in the labor share that emerged at the turn of the 21st century appears wholly due to a slow-down in growth marked by a profound, and unprecedentedly sharp, stagnation of hourly compensation growth.\u201dThe authors argue that import competition is the driving factor:\u201cOur data yield one robust correlation: that declines in payroll shares are more severe in industries that face larger increases in competitive pressures from imports.\u201d This accounts for \u201c3.3 percentage points of the 3.9 percentage-point decline in the U.S. payroll share over the past quarter century.\u201dTheir predictions of future trends are not optimistic:\u201cIf globalization continues during the next decades, the labor share will continue to decline, especially in sectors that face the largest increases in foreign competition.\u201dThis question is even more salient now.In addition, half (51 percent) of the United States sample said \u201c\u2019strong and influential\u2019 corporations are \u2018bad,\u2019 even if they are promoting innovation and growth,\u201d according to a summary of the survey by Don Baer, chairman and C.E.O. of Burson-Marsteller.Globalization and technological innovation have diminished the power of elected officials to control national economic trends, although politicians retain substantial influence over the allocation of the costs and benefits of those trends.At the moment, Republicans have the whip hand, empowered to prevent Democratic intervention to alter what is now a decisively upward redistribution of the benefits of economic growth.It is uncertain, however, whether the Democratic Party, even if it were empowered to set the agenda, would adopt policies to restructure the distribution of wealth. Those advocating such initiatives might well face an internal veto exercised by the party\u2019s financial elite and by the party\u2019s affluent constituencies.Discontent with central elements of capitalism is not limited to liberal elites, and it extends far beyond this nation\u2019s borders.One of the most striking findings in the CNBC/Burson-Marsteller survey is that corporations and the free market are viewed far more favorably in developing countries, where capitalism is just emerging, than in advanced countries.On a basic question, \u201cHow favorable are you toward corporations?\u201d the general public in emerging economies was markedly favorable, 72-24, while those in advanced economies were far more ambivalent, 52-40.Strong majorities, ranging from 58 to 65 percent of those surveyed in emerging nations, agreed that corporations pay their fair share of taxes, help achieve equality and encourage the government to treat citizens fairly. In developed nations, less than half of poll respondents held these positive views.Asked if corporations were humbled by the financial crisis and now act more responsibly, citizens of emerging nations were split, 44 yes, 41 no. Among those living in advanced economies, a strong majority, 55 percent, said no, while only 23 percent said yes. What this suggests is that free market capitalism arguably remains a vital source of growth and opportunity in nations like China and India, where people emerging from generations of poverty through the advance of global capitalism often see the problem differently.In developed countries like the United States, however, there are legitimate and growing doubts about the beneficence of the market and the ability of the system to distribute the rewards of growth to those who make growth possible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It Takes a Mentor", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith millions of students returning to school \u2014 both K-12 and college \u2014 this is a good time to review the intriguing results of some research that Gallup did over the past year, exploring the linkages between education and long-term success in the workplace. That is: What are the things that happen at a college or technical school that, more than anything else, produce \u201cengaged\u201d employees on a fulfilling career track? According to Brandon Busteed, the executive director of Gallup\u2019s education division, two things stand out. Successful students had one or more teachers who were mentors and took a real interest in their aspirations, and they had an internship related to what they were learning in school.Graduates who told Gallup that they had a professor or professors \u201cwho cared about them as a person \u2014 or had a mentor who encouraged their goals and dreams and/or had an internship where they applied what they were learning \u2014 were twice as likely to be engaged with their work and thriving in their overall well-being,\u201d Busteed said.Alas, though, only 22 percent of college grads surveyed said they had such a mentor and 29 percent had an internship where they applied what they were learning. So less than a third were exposed to the things that mattered most.Gallup\u2019s data were compiled from polls of parents of 5th through 12th graders, business leaders and interviews with teachers, superintendents, college presidents, principals, college graduates, Americans ages 18 to 34, and students in grades 5 through 12. All told, \u201cwe collected the voices of close to one million Americans in the past year alone,\u201d said Busteed, who added that he found the results \u201calarming\u201d \u2014 not only because too few students are getting exposed to the most important drivers of workplace engagement, but because there is also a huge disconnect in perceptions of the problem.Busteed said that 96 percent of the college provosts Gallup surveyed believed their schools were successfully preparing young people for the workplace. \u201cWhen you ask recent college grads in the work force whether they felt prepared, only 14 percent say \u2018yes,\u2019 \u201d he added. And then when you ask business leaders whether they\u2019re getting enough college grads with the skills they need, \u201conly 11 percent strongly agree.\u201d Concluded Busteed: \u201cThis is not just a skills gap. It is an understanding gap.\u201dThis comes at a time when our country faces creative destruction on steroids thanks to the dynamism of technology and growing evidence that climbing the ladder of job success requires constant learning and relearning. Therefore, the need for schools to have a good grasp of what employers are looking for and for employers to be communicating with schools about those skills is greater than ever.Some help may be on the way from Washington. Last year, President Obama quietly asked Vice President Joe Biden to oversee an overhaul of the government\u2019s education-to-work programs after hearing from one too many employers across the country that, as one White House official put it, \u201cthey were having trouble hiring workers for some of their fastest-growing jobs,\u201d such as operating sophisticated machine tools or software testing and debugging.As they dove into the problem, said Byron Auguste, a White House deputy national economic adviser, they found that the success stories shared a lot of the same attributes that Gallup found to be differentiating. In successful programs, said Auguste, \u201cstudents got as much applied, hands-on experience as possible, whether in a classroom or on a job site. Schools, colleges and training centers had close partnerships with regional employers, industry groups and skilled trade unions to stay up to date on job-relevant skills. And students or working learners got a lot of coaching and guidance to understand how to trace a direct path between their training today and careers tomorrow.\u201dThe key now is to scale those insights. The Labor Department has awarded $1.5 billion in the last three years to more than 700 community colleges to develop employer-validated training programs for new careers like natural gas field work and cybersecurity. Later this month, another $500 million is set to be awarded as part of a kind of race-to-the-top for whoever can build the best community college-industry group partnership anywhere in the country where new industries are finding gaps in the kind of workers they need.Employers used to take generalists and train them into specialists for their industry. But fewer employers want to do that today or can afford to in a globally competitive economy, especially when they fear they\u2019ll train someone who will then leave for a competitor. So everyone wants employees out of college or technical schools who are as ready to plug and play as possible. That\u2019s why government has a role in fostering more and more employer-educator partnerships \u2014 this is the new, new thing \u2014 which businesses, small and large, can benefit from, as well as all would-be employees.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sale of a Landmark Skyscraper Puts Spain on the Map of Chinese Investors", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 In June, one of China\u2019s richest men, Wang Jianlin, bought a landmark office tower in Madrid that had stood empty for years. The Franco-era building, Spain\u2019s tallest skyscraper when it opened in 1953, had become a symbol of the Spanish real estate market\u2019s collapse in 2008.The purchase of the 25-story Edificio Espa\u00f1a by Mr. Wang\u2019s conglomerate, the Dalian Wanda Group, for 265 million euros, or about $340 million, was seen here as evidence that the nation\u2019s property market was on the mend \u2014 and that Spain was figuring more prominently in the plans of Chinese investors.The deal \u201cput Spain on the map for Chinese institutional investors, who generally feel a lot more comfortable about going into a new market once they have seen at least one large transaction go ahead,\u201d said Fernando de G\u00f3ngora, a founder of Reliance Star Partners, a consulting firm based in Hong Kong that advises Spanish and Chinese investors.But Spain has work to do if it wants to build on that momentum. Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, is to begin a three-day state visit to China on Wednesday. It will be his first visit to China since he took office in late 2011. Angela Merkel, who took office in 2005 as the German chancellor, made her seventh official visit to China in July.Mr. Garc\u00eda-Legaz acknowledged that the current level of deal-making \u201camounts to still small investments, but the most important thing is that China has put its focus on Spain.\u201d He also warned that Spanish companies should pay closer attention to China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy after the United States.\u201cTo miss out on this investment opportunity is something that nobody with an international vocation can afford,\u201d Mr. Garc\u00eda-Legaz said.But when Spanish companies look at emerging markets, they traditionally focus on Latin America. China ranks 26th as a destination for Spanish investment, accounting for just 0.5 percent of Spain\u2019s total foreign direct investment, according to a recent report by Esade, the Spanish business school.More typical is the case of BBVA, a Spanish lender that now earns more from its banking operations in Mexico than in its home market. BBVA decided in October 2013 to cut its stake in Citic Bank, part of a conglomerate controlled by the Chinese government, to help meet international capital requirements.At the same time, only 60 Chinese companies have operations in Spain, said lvana Casaburi, a professor at Esade and the lead author of the business school\u2019s report on China. The Chinese are sharply increasing investment in Spain, but from a low base, according to the Esade study. Their recent focus on the Spanish real estate market comes as housing prices rose in the second quarter for the first time since 2008.Dalian Wanda\u2019s purchase of the Edificio Espa\u00f1a is representative of the bargains that investors from anywhere in the world can find in Spain\u2019s battered property market. The Chinese conglomerate is paying about a third less than the \u20ac389 million that Banco Santander paid in 2005, at the height of Spain\u2019s construction boom.Dalian Wanda plans to renovate the structure to include luxury apartments and a hotel as part of a broader overhaul of the neighborhood, including some other hotel projects. Chinese investors are particularly interested in hotel properties because \u201cthey believe Chinese tourists should feel like at home when they travel,\u201d said Ms. Casaburi of Esade.Chinese investors also recently acquired the Valpara\u00edso Palace, a hotel resort on the island of Majorca, for \u20ac48 million. And in May, HNA, another Chinese conglomerate, announced it was raising its stake in NH Hoteles to 29.9 percent \u2014 just below the 30 percent threshold that makes a full takeover bid compulsory in Spain \u2014 after acquiring an initial interest of 20 percent in 2013.The investment was welcome for NH, a Madrid-based operator of 367 hotels, mostly in Europe, that was left short of cash after the eurozone\u2019s sovereign debt crisis.Federico Gonz\u00e1lez Tejera, chief executive of NH, acknowledged that HNA\u2019s initial investment had come \u201cat a very delicate moment for us.\u201d But he said the benefits of having HNA as his company\u2019s largest shareholder went beyond cash: HNA owns Hainan Airlines as well as hotels in China, presenting a prospect of deeper cooperation in the future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Temporary Agreement Is Intended to Allow Gaza to Import Materials for Rebuilding", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Momentum for the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip advanced on Tuesday, with a senior United Nations diplomat briefing the Security Council on a temporary deal between Israeli and Palestinian officials to import cement and other building materials.The diplomat, Robert H. Serry, the special envoy for the Middle East peace process, told the Council that he hoped the deal would lead to a broader agreement on opening border crossings to Gaza and on ending severe restrictions on imports to the Palestinian territory, where the economy was stagnating before the 50-day war this summer.The Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, will have \u201ca lead role in the reconstruction effort,\u201d while United Nations monitors will ensure that reconstruction materials are not \u201cdiverted from their entirely civilian purpose,\u201d Mr. Serry said.The advance in diplomacy came as the Israeli military reported that a mortar shell fired from Gaza landed in Israel on Tuesday evening, the first since the Aug. 26 cease-fire. No damage or injuries were reported, and it appeared to be the work of a rogue militant individual or group, not Hamas, the dominant power in Gaza.Israel has long insisted that its restrictions on a range of goods, including cement, are necessary to prevent Hamas from using them to build underground tunnels into Israel. The limitations are a source of intense frustration for Gazans.\u201cArriving at this agreement has not been without its challenges,\u201d Mr. Serry said, according to a prepared statement. \u201cWe consider this temporary mechanism, which must get up and running without delay, as an important step toward the objective of lifting all remaining closures, and a signal of hope to the people of Gaza.\u201dMr. Serry spoke three weeks after a truce reached in Cairo that halted intense fighting between Israel and Hamas militants. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, including 500 children and 250 women, according to the United Nations. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one child.Donors, however, are likely to be wary of committing money without assurances of a more enduring peace deal.Two photographers captured scenes from the most recent outbreak of war.A further complication is the deteriorating relationship between Hamas and Mr. Abbas\u2019s Fatah faction, which signed a reconciliation deal in April after a seven-year schism. It is unclear whether Hamas will continue to participate in a unified Palestinian delegation for the Cairo talks, which are supposed to resume soon to address unresolved issues in the cease-fire pact.The reconstruction arrangement would give Mr. Abbas a foothold in Gaza. Hamas, buoyed in public opinion by the fighting, would have difficulty blocking any reconstruction effort, but may limit Mr. Abbas\u2019s operations.The cease-fire agreement says nothing about disarming Hamas, nor the dismantling of its underground tunnels, offering little comfort to Israel. The Palestinians are pushing for a Security Council resolution that would strengthen the Cairo truce.One point of contention in a draft text is the question of disarmament. Arab diplomats have said they could reach agreement on specific language that prohibits the smuggling of arms by militant groups into Gaza \u2014 language that is already part of a previous Council resolution \u2014 but not on broad disarmament language. It remains unclear whether the United States, a veto-wielding member of the Council and Israel\u2019s principal ally, would agree.Offering a stark inventory of Gaza damage, Mr. Serry told the Security Council that 100,000 Palestinians had lost their homes, with 18,000 houses \u201cdestroyed or severely damaged.\u201d He said 111 United Nations installations, many of them schools and hospitals, were damaged.But it was unclear exactly how the new mechanism would work, when it would begin, or how much material would be allowed through. Moshe Yaalon, Israel\u2019s defense minister, told Israeli military reporters earlier on Tuesday that the number of trucks allowed through Israel\u2019s Kerem Shalom crossing would increase to 380 a day from an average of 250, but that includes commercial goods and food.Mr. Serry\u2019s briefing came alongside the release of bleak reports by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the prognosis for the Palestinian economy after seven years of growth.Even before the summer\u2019s fighting, the World Bank report said, nearly half of the people in Gaza and one out of six in the West Bank were unemployed.\u201cThis is an unsustainable situation,\u201d Steen Lau Jorgensen, the World Bank\u2019s director for the West Bank and Gaza, said in a statement ahead of the report\u2019s presentation next week at the twice-yearly meeting of donors to the Palestinian Authority.The report said that a quarter of the Palestinian population lived in poverty, and that Palestinian businesses were \u201ccrippled\u201d by Israel\u2019s restrictions on travel and trade.Somini Sengupta reported from the United Nations, and Jodi Rudoren from Jerusalem.

{"Headline": "Lithuania Feels Squeeze in Sanctions War With Russia", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the sanctions war between Russia and the NATO allies, Lithuanian farmers like Kasia Jankun are bearing an overwhelming share of the economic pain from the Russian ban on European dairy products.ZIBENAI, Lithuania \u2014 In the sanctions war between Russia and the West, Kasia Jankun\u2019s 80 dairy cows seem to be losing.The sanctions, which are taking a toll on Russia\u2019s economy, cut both ways. And Ms. Jankun and other small farmers in this Baltic nation of three million people are bearing an overwhelming share of the pain from a Russian ban on European dairy products.Former Soviet bloc countries that, like Lithuania, are part of the European Union and the NATO military alliance might seem safe from the Russian strong-arming that made Ukraine so vulnerable. But in economic standoffs, it is often the most vulnerable that suffer most.The loss of the Russian market created an oversupply of milk, which pushed prices in Europe well below the break-even point for farmers like Ms. Jankun, whose 250-acre farm in eastern Lithuania lies at the end of a dirt road in rolling country dappled by groves of pine and alder.\u201cIf nothing changes by spring, at these prices, it\u2019s bankruptcy, \" Ms. Jankun, 50, said recently, as she served visitors thick slices of homemade cheese that she sells at outdoor markets to make up for lost income.If the sanctions battle were not underway \u2014 and if the eurozone economy were not still so listless \u2014 Lithuania might seem to be heading in a positive direction. At the beginning of next year, it is set to become the 19th member of the euro currency union, joining its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia in that inner circle of countries that the European Union ostensibly considers among the most economically worthy.Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, was scheduled to speak in Lithuania\u2019s capital, Vilnius, on Thursday, symbolically putting his imprimatur on the country\u2019s eurozone membership.And yet, a quarter-century after Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia won independence from the Soviet Union, their economies remain deeply intertwined with Russia\u2019s. Farming is a major industry in the Baltics, and Russia was the largest and most profitable market for Lithuanian products like cheese and yogurt. Unlike big industrial agricultural producers, Lithuania\u2019s small farmers \u2014 the most vulnerable segment of the country\u2019s dairy industry \u2014 cannot easily redirect their products to other markets.Nor can they hope to replicate elsewhere the premiums on Baltic dairy goods \u2014 so meager are most Russian alternatives \u2014 that merchants in cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg have been willing to pay.Without doubt, tensions stemming from the Ukrainian conflict are having a broader effect on world trade, especially in countries like Germany, where many auto and machinery companies until recently saw Russia as a promising and fast-growing market. General Motors\u2019 Opel unit said last week that it was cutting production and jobs at its car plant in St. Petersburg, mostly because of the sagging Russian economy and the sinking value of the ruble.But the economic impact of the sanctions may be most acute in Lithuania, which is also a major processing center for milk produced by the other Baltic countries and, via ports on the Baltic Sea, a transportation hub for Russia-bound goods.Food exports to Russia account for 2.7 percent of Lithuania\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a far greater share of the economy than in any other European Union country. More than a third of the companies on Lithuania\u2019s benchmark stock index are in agriculture or related industries.The economic disruption is not likely to derail plans for Lithuania to join the eurozone on Jan. 1. On the contrary, many Lithuanians see euro membership as a milestone in the country\u2019s tighter integration with Europe, and validation of its recovery from a severe downturn in 2009, when gross domestic product plunged 15 percent.But this month, the country\u2019s central bank reduced its growth forecasts because of slowing trade with Russia. This year, the Lithuanian economy will grow 2.9 percent instead of the 3.3 percent that was forecast earlier, the bank said. Next year, growth is expected to be 3.3 percent instead of 3.6 percent.That would still be among the fastest growth rates in the European Union. \u201cOur expectation is that it will influence our G.D.P. figures, but not so very significantly,\u201d said Vitas Vasiliauskas, chairman of Lithuania\u2019s central bank. He noted, though, that even before the sanctions, Lithuanian exports were squeezed by sputtering growth in Russia.For most Lithuanian farmers, there is not much room for reduction. More than 70 percent of Lithuanian farms are smaller than 25 acres, earning an annual average profit of only 5,849 litas, or $2,176, per farmworker, according to the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics.Lithuania\u2019s large agricultural conglomerates are feeling the effect of sanctions, too, but are in a better position to find new markets.\u201cWe are not in a desperate situation,\u201d said Andrius Pranckevicius, deputy managing director of Linas Agro, a Lithuanian company that trades grain and other agricultural commodities and is also a major milk and poultry producer.But he added, \u201cThe situation for smaller farmers is very serious right now. They are absolutely below break-even.\u201dRightly or not, Lithuanians say they believe that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia feels special resentment toward the Baltic countries because they were the first Soviet states to demand independence in the late 1980s. Last fall, well before Russia imposed formal sanctions, customs officials were blocking imports of Lithuanian farm products, ostensibly on health grounds.In Lithuania, dismay about the economic impact of the sanctions is amplified by the fear that Mr. Putin intends to restore the old borders of the Soviet Union, using military force if necessary. Unlike Ukraine, of course, Lithuania is a member of NATO, whose members have pledged to defend one another. Still, Lithuanians feel exposed.Vilnius, the picturesque capital, is only about 20 miles from the border of Belarus, which many Lithuanians regard as a state that Russia could use as a jumping-off point for a military incursion. Lithuania also shares a 136-mile border with Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea.As a result, despite the economic pain that sanctions have caused, many Lithuanians advocate a hard line in dealing with Russia.\u201cEveryone feels strong solidarity with Ukraine,\u201d said Linas Linkevicius, the Lithuanian foreign minister. He has pushed the NATO countries to establish a more demonstrative presence in the Baltics, for example, by staging maneuvers and stationing equipment in the region.\u201cWe need some physical presence, a tangible something,\u201d said Mr. Linkevicius, a former defense minister.Mr. Linkevicius has convened groups of business people to talk about ways to develop other markets for Lithuanian goods. But fully replacing Russian sales will be difficult. Lithuanian dairy products have a reputation for quality in cities like St. Petersburg and Moscow and command higher prices than in other markets.Despite historical resentments, Russia\u2019s size and proximity make it the most logical market for Baltic goods. Although English has become the second language of choice for younger Lithuanians, after their native tongue, many people speak Russian.\u201cA lot of people feel more comfortable working with Russians in Russian than other cultures,\u201d said Kasparas Jurgelionis, deputy chairman of Koncernas Achemos Grupe, a Lithuanian fertilizer producer that is also involved in handling cargo passing through Baltic ports. \u201cThere is a lot of sacrifice in terms of lost opportunities.\u201dMs. Jankun, the farmer, said she was uncertain what the policy toward Russia should be. \u201cI am in favor of Russian people buying my cheese,\u201d she said in her large but unfinished home next to the fields where she grows hay and potatoes and lets her cows graze. \u201cI don\u2019t care about politics.\u201dDressed in a red sweater and battered rubber clogs, Ms. Jankun said she worried that her two grown children would despair and decide to emigrate, following tens of thousands of other Lithuanians who left during the economic turmoil in 2009.Then no one will be able to take over the farm, which belonged to Ms. Jankun\u2019s family before the Soviet Union annexed Lithuania in 1940 and was returned after the collapse of communism.Given that tortured history, Ms. Jankun was uncertain how to deal with Mr. Putin. \u201cIf we have a nervous and unpredictable neighbor, we avoid him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cwhen he starts breaking your windows, you have to do something.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fixing Climate Change May Add No Costs, Report Says", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA global commission will announce its finding on Tuesday that an ambitious series of measures to limit emissions would cost $4 trillion or so over the next 15 years, an increase of roughly 5 percent over the amount that would likely be spent anyway on new power plants, transit systems and other infrastructure.\u201cWe are proposing a way to have the same or even more economic growth, and at the same time have environmental responsibility,\u201d said the chairman of the commission, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, the former president of Mexico and an economist. \u201cWe need to fix this problem of climate change, because it\u2019s affecting all of us.\u201dThe commission found that some $90 trillion is likely to be spent over the coming 15 years on new infrastructure around the world. The big challenge for governments is to adopt rules and send stronger market signals that redirect much of that investment toward low-emission options, the report found.\u201cThis is a massive amount of investment firepower that could be geared toward building better cities, and better infrastructure for energy and agriculture,\u201d said Jeremy Oppenheim, who led the research for the report.While the commission found that the requisite steps may make economic sense, that does not mean they will be politically easy, the report says. For instance, the group will recommend that countries eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels, which cost about $600 billion a year but are vigorously defended by vested interests.The claim that the side benefits, such as better air quality, could potentially offset the costs is likely to be controversial.Ottmar G. Edenhofer, a German climate economist who helped lead that earlier effort, said in an interview Monday that he was doubtful about the precise values for the side benefits cited in the new report. He served as an adviser to the global commission, but is not an author of the final document.\u201cThe assumption and the argument that this can be done for free, that\u2019s from my point of view overly optimistic,\u201d Dr. Edenhofer said. \u201cYes, you rescue some lives, but to assign monetary values to this is particularly complicated.\u201dDr. Edenhofer added, however, that the recommendations in the new report were generally sensible and, if adopted, would help to put the world on a more sustainable path. \u201cClimate policy is not a free lunch, but it is a lunch worthwhile to buy,\u201d he said.Some of the report\u2019s recommendations, such as limiting urban sprawl and traffic, may sound utopian, but it cites examples of countries and cities that are already taking such action.If a concerted worldwide push were made to scale up ideas that have already proved successful, the commission found, emissions of heat-trapping gases could be reduced by billions of tons per year, and the chances of limiting global warming to tolerable levels would be greatly improved.The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate was appointed by seven countries spanning the income spectrum: Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Norway, South Korea, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The commission enlisted some of the world\u2019s top economists and business consultants to take a fresh look at the economic questions surrounding climate change. The report, due for release Tuesday morning, was made available in advance to The New York Times.The report seeks to upend some longstanding assumptions. It points out, for instance, that the cost of renewable energy has been plunging so fast that most previous analyses of its potential role are out of date. \u201cRenewable energy sources have emerged with stunning and unexpected speed as large-scale, and increasingly economically viable, alternatives to fossil fuels,\u201d the report said.Perhaps the most important overall point of the report is that economic policies around the world are still aligned to favor fossil fuels, even though unchecked emissions from coal, oil and natural gas represent a potentially grave risk to future generations. \u201cWe have to get the prices right,\u201d said Helen Mountford, who worked on the report and is the director of economics at the World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank.Nowhere is this issue clearer, the commission said, than in the $600 billion a year spent to subsidize fossil fuels, more than six times the level of subsidies going to renewable energy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Latest Good News in Health Spending: Employer Premiums", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthWe\u2019re in the midst of a rare slowdown in the growth of health spending. That slowdown just hit the employer health insurance market.The big finding is that the growth in health insurance premiums was only 3 percent between 2013 and 2014. That\u2019s tied for the lowest rate of increase since Kaiser started measuring (this is the 16th year of the survey).Health economists disagree about the precise mix of factors underlying the slowdown, but most think it has been caused by some combination of a weak economy and shifts in medical practice away from expensive hospitalizations and drugs. Over all, medical spending since 2009 had grown at a per capita rate of about 3 percent. People with employer-provided insurance make up the largest group in the market, so it stands to reason that the slowdown would start pulling down premiums eventually.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve really seen over the last 10 years is moderation and stability in the group market,\u201d said Drew Altman, Kaiser\u2019s president. \u201cIf I was a corporate C.E.O., I\u2019d have a lot more to worry about now than my health benefits.\u201dThis year, with the pressure off, there was a smaller increase in the number of plans that included high deductibles, though the average deductible amount for plans that included the feature did continue to inch up. The number of employers offering coverage also held steady. Health insurance is still very expensive, despite the slowdown: The average family plan costs $16,834 a year, according to the survey.Like many things about the health spending slowdown, the employer benefits trend is great news wrapped up in a lot of uncertainty. Slow premium growth is good for businesses and workers, but it\u2019s still unclear how long the pattern will hold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Defying Expectations in India, Modi Begins Key Trip to U.S.", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe message was received. Mr. Modi, who is famously austere in his own habits, intends to impose discipline.The visit is a big moment for Mr. Modi, who offers himself as a metaphor for the India he wants to build \u2014 ambitious, confident and impatient with slackness of any kind.In the four months since he has taken office, Mr. Modi has disappointed those who were hoping for an Indian Margaret Thatcher, proving to be cautious and incremental in his use of economic policy. Instead, he has set about changing the architecture of the state, diluting the powers of ministries and concentrating them in his office. Mr. Modi is building a machine for governing, one he intends to operate for a long time.It is not yet clear whether he can pull it off. To succeed, Mr. Modi must bring about fundamental changes in India\u2019s economy and steer a stable course in a country prone to incendiary conflicts. Policy experts, surveying still-unfilled positions in his government, wonder whether Mr. Modi will be able to trust outsiders enough to bring in talent. And critics say his concentrated power will make it more difficult for his own officials to question him.M. J. Akbar, a spokesman for Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, dismissed those worries, saying Mr. Modi\u2019s early moves aimed at \u201csetting the rules for his own government\u201d and putting an end to a bureaucratic culture so loose that officials \u201cused to tweet and send SMS\u2019s in the middle of a cabinet meeting.\u201dThe prime minister, Mr. Akbar said, \u201cis just a tough guy. Delhi hasn\u2019t seen a tough guy in a long time.\u201dThis was a new tone for Mr. Modi. His reputation had preceded him to New Delhi: His rise through his own party proved him a ruthless political operator, capable of deftly sidelining well-established older leaders. An angry presence during the campaign, he had been championed by right-wing economists as someone prepared to slash away at the country\u2019s gargantuan subsidy programs.Since taking office, though, Mr. Modi has presented a softer face to the country, guided by a populist\u2019s unerring instinct for his audience. In his major addresses, delivered without notes and in earthy, colloquial Hindi, he has spoken as a kindly moral instructor, focusing on such humble causes as the need to build toilets. Last week, perhaps responding to calls to move more quickly on reforms, Mr. Modi said he naturally gravitated to practical matters.\u201cThere have been discussions about vision, about big vision and grand vision,\u201d he said, in comments published by The Indian Express. \u201cI only want to say that I am a small person, and I think about small people. By thinking small for small people I am trying to make them grow. Nobody was thinking about these small people.\u201dWith little time to decide, Mr. Modi took the unusual step of publicly prodding his Chinese guest over the border issue at a news conference, a moment that cast a shadow over the message of deepening trade.Speaking of India in a recent interview with CNN, Mr. Modi made it clear that his goal was a historic restoration. \u201cThis is a country that once upon a time was called the golden bird,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have fallen from where we were before. But now we have the chance to rise again.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s toughness is certainly visible in New Delhi, a city where power has long been distributed among a constellation of heavyweight ministers, editors and business tycoons.That balance has begun to change. Nearly every week during his early months in office, a new rumor began to circulate, each with the subtext that Mr. Modi and his team were keeping a close watch on officials, including members of his own cabinet. One described a minister who received a call from the prime minister\u2019s office on a Friday, was told the exact number of unapproved files sitting on his desk, and was so unnerved that he worked all weekend to clear the files, one after another.Party insiders would not confirm or deny these reports but acknowledged that officials were under scrutiny. \u201cThat officials are being monitored? Yes. Is their behavior being monitored? Yes,\u201d said Akhilesh Mishra, a Bharatiya Janata Party activist who was a strategist for the parliamentary campaign. The reports, he said, come from \u201ca vast network of people, people who give a feedback mechanism.\u201dWeek by week, Mr. Modi has built up the prime minister\u2019s office into a dominant force in government. First, cabinet officials were discouraged from speaking to the news media without permission. Ministers were barred from hiring personal staff members without approval.And unlike his predecessors, Mr. Modi is said to be making many appointments himself. Senior officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, complained to The Hindustan Times that the government had begun to circulate the agenda for cabinet meetings just hours before they were to begin, making it nearly impossible for them to fully participate in policy making.\u201cEven in Indira Gandhi\u2019s time, you had advisers who were very powerful, they were larger than life and capable of giving input,\u201d said Siddharth Varadarajan, a journalist and senior fellow at Shiv Nadar University. \u201cHere you have a prime minister whose strength is reminiscent of Indira Gandhi\u2019s, but I think it goes beyond that, because you\u2019d at least have that layer of advisers.\u201dJournalists now have virtually no opportunity to ask questions of top officials. As the Editors Guild of India complained in a letter published Tuesday, much of the bureaucracy has gone silent, and journalists have found themselves scrambling to get even basic information from the prime minister\u2019s office, which has yet to appoint a contact person for the news media.India\u2019s business titans are another group facing an unfamiliar new landscape. Long accustomed to maintaining personal, informal contacts with officials in the ministries that grant crucial approvals, they must now fall in line with a new protocol: Meetings are to be formal, held in government offices, and presumed to be under the scrutiny of the prime minister\u2019s apparatus.This is, on one hand, a way of ensuring that payoffs are not offered or received. It also gives corporate leaders the sense that they are being kept at arm\u2019s length, at least for the moment, said one executive from a large Indian company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201cIs Modi taking the demonstrative step of being wary of industry?\u201d the executive said. \u201cIf that\u2019s just messaging, it\u2019s also risky, because you are almost sending the message that industry is the cause of corruption. If he actually believes it, that\u2019s terrible. Even if it\u2019s just signaling, that\u2019s bad enough.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s supporters say his centralization of authority has begun to yield results: Ministries that previously worked as independent fiefs have fallen in line, and long-delayed projects have begun to move. India\u2019s economy is showing signs of a revival, growing at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the year, after languishing under 5 percent for nearly two years.But Mr. Modi\u2019s time to make decisions is limited, and a backlog is said to be piling up. A surprising number of senior positions remain unfilled \u2014 notably, that of defense minister, despite this government\u2019s keen focus on defense. Arun Jaitley, a lawmaker close to Mr. Modi, is temporarily serving as both finance minister and defense minister.In some cases, the difficulty may be in identifying outside experts who are fully trusted by Mr. Modi\u2019s team. But that, said an analyst who consulted with the Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s parliamentary campaign, is hardly surprising \u2014 Mr. Modi has never depended much on any one aide or adviser.\u201cHe is his own master completely,\u201d the analyst said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cHe has no problem seeking advice or talking to people. In terms of trust, I don\u2019t think 100 percent he trusts anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Less Tension, More Optimism", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParis Motor ShowThe mood should be lighter and brighter at this year\u2019s Paris Motor Show than at the last one in 2012, when environmentalists demonstrated, disgruntled autoworkers violently protested and police tear-gassed a crowd that broke through barriers outside the show.The show, one of the world\u2019s top new car exhibitions, is held every two years. Two days of press previews start Thursday at the Paris Expo convention center before the public opening. Dozens of new models will be displayed, showcasing the latest in design, technology, environmental advances and fuel economy.The outlook for the auto industry, especially in recession-ravaged Europe, is much more upbeat now than in late 2012. New management teams are in place at many automakers, more new models are in the pipeline than at any time in recent years and sales \u2014 if not employment levels \u2014 are recovering.Among the most anticipated new models are luxury offerings like the Mercedes-AMG GT, the Jaguar XE and the Land Rover Discovery Sport. Though some of these models, along with the next-generation Mazda MX-5 Miata and Volvo XC90, have been unveiled at previous invitation-only events, the show will offer the public a chance to see them in person.Audi will be unveiling at least four important new models, including the production version of its TT Roadster, a high-horsepower RS3 \u201chot hatchback,\u201d a reboot of its flagship R8 supercar and a significant refresh of its midrange S6 sport sedan.Bentley is increasing the power, while reducing emissions and improving fuel economy, of its top-of-the-line Mulsanne. The new Mulsanne Speed edition will be rated at about 525 horsepower.BMW is expected to introduce new convertible versions of its small 2 Series cars, along with an update to its X6 crossover.The French automakers \u2014 Citro\u00ebn, Peugeot and Renault \u2014 are focusing on eco-friendly designs and technologies. Citro\u00ebn is also trying to draw attention to its coming DS luxury lineup, which promises avant-garde styling as only the French can do it.Fiat is introducing the 500X, a small crossover based on the Jeep Renegade. The 500X is a key part of Fiat\u2019s strategy to lift sales to sustainable levels in markets, like North America, where it is not well established.American brands, as a whole, will be showing little of note in Paris. Ford is expanding its C-Max line of small people movers and will introduce an S-Max multipurpose vehicle. For General Motors, the show comes as the company is retrenching in Europe and phasing out the Chevrolet brand nameplate in most of the Continent.Jaguar Land Rover will offer ambitious new models meant to appeal to entry-luxury buyers. The word \u201cambitious\u201d is used advisedly here, as previous attempts to carve out market share in a lower part of the market \u2014 with vehicles like the Jaguar X-Type and the Land Rover Freelander \u2014 did not go well. But the design of the XE, intended to compete with the likes of the BMW 3 Series, has received positive reviews from those who have seen it, and the Discovery Sport seeks to impress with luxury and style more than with off-road prowess.Mercedes-Benz hopes to stop show-goers with a cocktail of performance, economy and bold style. The Mercedes-AMG GT aims to attract buyers from Porsche, while the S500 is a large plug-in hybrid luxury sedan, albeit one with an all-electric range of only 20 miles. Mazda hopes to generate a lot of buzz \u2014 or is it \u201czoom\u201d? \u2014 with its new MX-5 roadster, better known in America as the Miata.And, of course, lurking behind the curtains are bound to be some surprises and better-kept secrets. Toyota is hinting that its C-HR concept car will offer not only a design fit to fight the quirky Nissan Juke, but also a new twist on a hybrid powertrain. Honda will preview new takes on its Civic and Jazz, which is called the Fit in America.Infiniti will show its Q80 design study, a large luxury sedan with a sleek fastback roofline that could conceivably compete with the Porsche Panamera. While it isn\u2019t known how many cars will make their debuts, the total will surely exceed that of the 80 world premieres at the last Paris show.Though the show\u2019s atmosphere this year will be considerably more optimistic, not all concerns are gone. Tensions in the Middle East will bring an increased police presence at the convention center, Metro stations and tourist attractions.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "S. Truett Cathy, Chick-fil-A Founder, Dies at 93", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen he introduced himself, S. Truett Cathy often played down his job.\u201cI cook chicken for a living,\u201d he would say.And on the surface, that was true. Mr. Cathy, who died on Monday at 93, was by all appearances a humble Christian man from Georgia with little education who sold a simple sandwich: a breaded, boneless chicken breast on a soft, white, buttered bun with nothing more than a couple of pickles for garnish.But as the founder of the Chick-fil-A fast-food empire, he was also a billionaire several times over and, as a conservative Christian who ran his business according to his religious principles, he was at once a hero and a symbol of intolerance. Many admired him for closing his outlets on Sundays and speaking out against same-sex marriage. Others vilified his the chain as a symbol of hate.He died at his home in Clayton County, Ga., a Chick-fil-A spokesman said.Rising to prominence between Robert Woodruff, who took over Coca-Cola in the 1920s, and Sam Walton, who began the Walmart chain with a small store in Bentonville, Ark., in 1950, Mr. Cathy was one of a handful of Southern entrepreneurs who in one lifetime took small, hometown companies to a global level.\u201cHe was really part of that generation that was our version of the Rockefellers or Henry Ford,\u201d said William Ferris, a director of the Center for the Study of the American South at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. \u201cThey moved the South in ways that could have never been anticipated in their lifetime.\u201dMr. Cathy\u2019s company and its charitable arms have reached widely throughout the South, helping the region\u2019s economy and promoting the founder\u2019s Baptist values. The company required potential franchise operators, for example, to discuss their marital status and their civic and church involvement.Mr. Cathy said he closed his restaurants on Sundays so that his employees could spend time with their families. But the policy was also a way to honor his faith.\u201cIt\u2019s a silent witness to the Lord when people go into shopping malls, and everyone is bustling, and you see that Chick-fil-A is closed,\u201d he once told a reporter for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Mr. Cathy\u2019s beliefs underpinned the activities of the WinShape Foundation, a charitable arm of his empire that provided for scholarships, camps and foster care before branching out to support organizations that promoted traditional marriage. The foundation gave millions of dollars toward their efforts to oppose extending marriage rights to couples of the same sex.Gay and lesbian activist groups and bloggers began investigating the foundation\u2019s donations, and the issue blew up in 2012 after his son, Dan, the company president, gave a series of provocative interviews.\u201cAs it relates to society in general, I think we are inviting God\u2019s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, \u2018We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Dan Cathy said.In response, the company said it would step back from the policy debate over same-sex marriage and stop funding most of the groups that were at the center of the storm. Mr. Cathy never wavered in his beliefs, however \u2014 a point mentioned by politicians, celebrities and business leaders who commented on his death.\u201cIn every facet of his life, Truett Cathy has exemplified the finest aspects of his Christian faith,\u201d former President Jimmy Carter said in a statement. \u201cBy his example, he has been a blessing to countless people.\u201dSamuel Truett Cathy, one of seven children, was born on March 14, 1921, in Eatonton, Ga., the hometown as well of the author Alice Walker and Joel Chandler Harris, who wrote the Uncle Remus stories.By 8, Truett, as he was called, was selling bottles of Coca-Cola in his front yard. Six years later, the Depression drove his parents to move the family to a public-housing project, the nation\u2019s first, in downtown Atlanta.A poor student, Mr. Cathy never went to college, but he developed a sharp business acumen, which was supplemented by a strong work ethic he had learned from his parents. He often said the only time he ever saw his mother with her eyes closed was when she was in her coffin.After he returned from the Army in World War II, he and his brother Ben opened a diner in Hapeville, Ga., just south of Atlanta, in 1946. Many of his customers worked at a nearby Ford plant. The squat shape of the building inspired the name: the Dwarf Grill, later renamed to Dwarf House.Chicken became a focus when Mr. Cathy started acquiring chicken breasts that had been rejected by Delta Air Lines, because they were either too large or too small for the airline\u2019s food trays. Mr. Cathy began experimenting, frying breaded chicken in a cast-iron pan with a lid, the way his mother used to.He gave his sandwich its unusual name so that a nation just falling in love with fast-food hamburgers might better understand his product: Chick-fil-A was meant to suggest a chicken steak.As malls came to the South, Mr. Cathy opened a Chick-fil-A at the Greenbriar Mall in Atlanta. It was a pioneering effort to put fast food in shopping centers.By 2013, the privately held Chick-fil-A had more than 1,800 restaurants and sales of more than $5 billion.Mr. Cathy instructed his heirs, who run the company, that they may sell it but must never take it public, because such a move could curtail the immense amount of charitable giving the company engages in.Mr. Cathy is survived by his wife of 65 years, Jeannette; three children, Dan Cathy, Don Cathy and Trudy Cathy White; 18 grandchildren; and 19 great-grandchildren.In the five books he wrote, Mr. Cathy often emphasized the importance of giving over receiving and of treating others as you would like to be treated.\u201cWe live in a changing world, but we need to be reminded that the important things have not changed,\u201d he said, \u201cand the important things will not change if we keep our priorities in proper order.\u201dAn obituary on Tuesday about S. Truett Cathy, the founder of the fast-food chain Chick-fil-A, misattributed, in some editions, a quotation about same-sex marriage, which was strongly opposed by a charitable arm of Mr. Cathy\u2019s empire. It was Dan Cathy, Mr. Cathy\u2019s son and the president of Chick-fil-A \u2014 not Mr. Cathy \u2014 who said, \u201cAs it relates to society in general, I think we are inviting God\u2019s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, \u2018We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage.\u2019 \u201d The obituary also misstated the decade during which Robert Woodruff, Mr. Cathy\u2019s predecessor as a successful Southern entrepreneur, took over the Coca-Cola Company. It was in the 1920s, not the 1930s.Alan Blinder contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Inflation Cult", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s something happening here. What it is ain\u2019t exactly clear. But as regular readers know, I\u2019ve been trying to figure it out, because I think it\u2019s important to understand the persistence and power of the inflation cult. So what\u2019s going on here?And anger against \u201ctakers\u201d \u2014 anger that is very much tied up with ethnic and cultural divisions \u2014 runs deep. Many people, therefore, feel an affinity with those who rant about looming inflation; Mr. Santelli is their kind of guy. In an important sense, I\u2019d argue, the persistence of the inflation cult is an example of the \u201caffinity fraud\u201d crucial to many swindles, in which investors trust a con man because he seems to be part of their tribe. In this case, the con men may be conning themselves as well as their followers, but that hardly matters.This tribal interpretation of the inflation cult helps explain the sheer rage you encounter when pointing out that the promised hyperinflation is nowhere to be seen. It\u2019s comparable to the reaction you get when pointing out that Obamacare seems to be working, and probably has the same roots.But what about the economists who go along with the cult? They\u2019re all conservatives, but aren\u2019t they also professionals who put evidence above political convenience? Apparently not.The persistence of the inflation cult is, therefore, an indicator of just how polarized our society has become, of how everything is political, even among those who are supposed to rise above such things. And that reality, unlike the supposed risk of runaway inflation, is something that should scare you. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Win Back Older Voters, Democrats Talk Up Social Security ", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats are stepping up their appeals to older voters in the final stretch before the midterm elections, spurred by polls showing the party has regained some support lost in the Obama years. The question is whether they can narrow the gap with Republicans enough to offset their broader disadvantages given widespread dissatisfaction with President Obama. Both parties covet voters 65 and older because that group tends to make up a disproportionately large share of the midterm electorate. Democrats long had an edge, until less-supportive baby boomers aged and began replacing the Depression-era generation in the ranks of older voters. Now Democrats are reliant on young voters, as well as minorities and single women, many of whom vote only in presidential elections.\u201cDoing even a little bit better with seniors can have a substantial impact,\u201d Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said. Like some Republican pollsters, he has seen Democrats improve their standing with older voters in polls in states with hotly contested Senate races. His explanation: \u201cI think the Democratic advantage on protecting Medicare and Social Security has reasserted itself.\u201dIn the first half of September, one in five Democratic ads dealt with either a candidate\u2019s commitment to the programs or, more often, the threat from Republicans, according to Kantar Media CMAG, a nonpartisan media monitor. By comparison, one in 10 Republican ads mentioned the programs, typically to answer Democrats\u2019 assaults.Many Democratic candidates, party committees and allied groups are drawing a link between Republican plans to overhaul Medicare and Social Security and cut taxes for wealthy Americans, on the one hand, and Republicans\u2019 support from the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch.For decades Democrats hammered Republicans on Medicare and Social Security. But their push now follows two election cycles, in 2010 and 2012, when Republicans took the offensive with numerous ads suggesting, inaccurately, that Democrats cut Medicare benefits to pay for the Affordable Care Act.The intensity of Democrats\u2019 pitches reflects the scale of their recent losses among older voters. In 2006, the parties each drew 49 percent of older voters, according to national exit polls, and Democrats won control of Congress. But starting with Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 election, voters 65 and older, especially white men, have been his party\u2019s weak spot.While Mr. Obama beat Senator John McCain by seven percentage points over all, he lost older voters by eight points \u2014 the only age group that did not give him at least 50 percent of its support. In 2012, he lost them by 12 points to Mitt Romney. In between, in the midterm elections of 2010, Democrats lost voters 65 and older by a devastating 21 points \u2014 and their House majority.Pollsters in both parties say they have seen Republicans\u2019 advantage shrink among older voters, especially women. As early as last spring, Mr. Garin and another Democratic pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, presented evidence to a gathering of House Democrats. This came as congressional Democrats were assailing Republicans for budgets proposing to replace Medicare with private-insurance subsidies.Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said of his party\u2019s prospects, \u201cI agree, we\u2019re not going to win the 65-plus or 60-plus voters by the same margin\u201d as in recent elections. But he added: \u201cDo we need to, to have an incredibly good cycle? No.\u201dOlder voters \u201chave been moving in the Democratic direction all year,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who conducts the Battleground Poll with the Republican pollster Ed Goeas. Mr. Goeas said he would be concerned for Republicans only \u201cif Democrats can boost turnout of other groups that are their base,\u201d which he doubted.While Ms. Lake attributed Democrats\u2019 gains to their emphasis on Social Security and Medicare, Mr. Goeas suggested another factor. Older voters have been among the strongest opponents of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, he said, but \u201cfear has abated a little bit\u201d about its impact on Medicare and the economy.On that point, he is in bipartisan agreement of sorts with Mr. Garin. In 2010 and 2012, Mr. Garin said, \u201cRepublicans spent a fortune on \u2018Obama and Democrats are cutting $716 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare.\u2019\u00a0\u201d But that charge, he added, \u201cseems to have kind of run its course. Most seniors feel like they\u2019ve been hearing this for four years and their Medicare hasn\u2019t been cut.\u201dWhatever the elections\u2019 outcome, Democrats are unlikely to soon recover the allegiance among older voters their party once enjoyed. \u201cPeople 65 and older who grew up in the Great Depression and the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt, those people are gone,\u201d said Charlie Cook, a nonpartisan political analyst. \u201cNow people 65 and over, they\u2019re much more likely to cite four not-so-great years under Jimmy Carter and eight better years under Reagan. I mean it\u2019s just a different group of seniors.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds of Fast-Food Workers Striking for Higher Wages Are Arrested", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHundreds of fast-food workers and labor allies demanding a $15-an-hour wage were arrested in sit-ins around the country on Thursday, as the protesters used civil disobedience to call attention to their cause. Organizers said nearly 500 protesters were arrested in three dozen cities \u2014 including Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, New York and Little Rock, Ark. All told, the sit-ins took place in about 150 cities nationwide, the organizers said. In Milwaukee, United States Representative Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin, was arrested along with several fast-food workers.\u201cI\u2019m doing this for better pay,\u201d said Crystal Harris, a McDonald\u2019s worker from St. Louis, minutes before she sat down in the middle of 42nd Street in Manhattan outside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant about 7:30 a.m. on Thursday. \u201cI struggle to make ends meet on $7.50 an hour.\u201dThe protesters carried signs saying, \u201cLow Pay Is Not O.K.,\u201d \u201cOn Strike to Lift My Family Up,\u201d and \u201cWhatever It Takes: $15 and Union Rights.\u201d They also want McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food chains to agree not to fight a unionization drive.Thursday\u2019s demonstrations were the seventh in a series of one-day strikes by fast-food workers. Ever since the strikes began in New York in November 2012, strategists have focused on expanding the effort to increase pressure on fast-food chains to set a wage floor of $15 an hour.McDonald\u2019s issued a statement Thursday morning saying that its restaurants remained open for business. \u201cThese are not \u2018strikes\u2019 but are staged demonstrations in which people are being transported to fast-food restaurants,\u201d the company said.It said that it and its franchise operators \u201csupport paying our valued employees fair wages aligned with a competitive marketplace.\u201d It added: \u201cWe believe that any minimum-wage increase should be implemented over time so that the impact on owners of small and medium-sized businesses \u2014 like the ones who own and operate the majority of our restaurants \u2014 is manageable.\u201dIn some restaurants, two workers went on strike for a few hours, in others, 10. The fast-food chains say the one-day strikes have hardly affected business.LaTonya Allen, a home care aide in Atlanta who earns $9 an hour, said she was joining a fast-food workers\u2019 protest outside a Burger King on Thursday.\u201cEarning $15 would make a huge difference,\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cIt would really help me and my husband pay our bills. It would enable us to do more things together as a family. All we do now is work, work, work.\u201dHome care workers joined the fast-food protests in six cities \u2014 Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and Seattle.\u201cWe\u2019d like to see these protests by home care workers spread to other cities and states,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the service employees\u2019 union. \u201cWe\u2019d like it to get as big as the fast-food protests.\u201dMs. Henry said that the one-day strikes had already had some success, drawing attention to the prevalence of low wages and influencing decisions by Seattle to adopt a $15-an-hour minimum wage and San Francisco to consider one. In addition, Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles this week proposed a $13.25-an-hour minimum wage for workers in his city. Some economists have warned that if wages for home care workers rose to $15, the cost for families and taxpayers who finance much of the nation\u2019s home care through Medicaid and Medicare could increase.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Britain Pledges More Self-Rule for Scots if They Reject Scottish Independence", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Shaken by polls showing momentum shifting toward independence for Scotland, the British government will offer proposals for greater political and fiscal autonomy for the Scots if they vote to remain within the United Kingdom in a referendum on Sept. 18, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said on Sunday.The narrowing polls have caused considerable anxiety among politicians and business leaders, driving down the value of the pound and raising questions among investors about the stability of the economy and the fate of the current British government.The vote, which could bring an end to the 307-year union between Scotland and England, is also regarded as important to the future of the British prime minister, David Cameron. As leader of what is still formally known as the Conservative and Unionist Party, Mr. Cameron, already facing internal divisions over Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union, may not survive politically if Scotland votes to break away from the United Kingdom in a referendum that he negotiated with the Scottish National Party and its leader, Alex Salmond.On Sunday, Mr. Osborne, a close ally of Mr. Cameron\u2019s, responded to the tightening race by promising more powers to Scotland if it votes no.The plan will be revealed \u201cin the next few days\u201d after the government gets agreement from all three major parties in the British Parliament, including the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, Mr. Osborne said.\u201cThen Scotland will have the best of both worlds,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will both avoid the risks of separation but have more control over their own destiny, which is where I think many Scots want to be.\u201dThat position is sometimes known as \u201cdevo max,\u201d or maximum devolution, an alternative that Mr. Cameron did not allow Mr. Salmond to put on the ballot. Instead, Mr. Cameron insisted on a simple yes or no vote for independence. In return, he allowed Mr. Salmond, Scotland\u2019s first minister, to extend the vote to people ages 16 and over but limit it to those who are registered in Scotland, which excludes many Scots living and working elsewhere in Britain.Mr. Salmond dismissed Mr. Osborne\u2019s proposals on Sunday as \u201ca panic measure.\u201d Mr. Salmond\u2019s deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, calling the new polls a \u201cvery significant moment\u201d in the campaign, said the offer of new powers had come very late.\u201cI don\u2019t think people are going to take this seriously,\u201d she told Sky News. \u201cIf the other parties had been serious about more powers, then something concrete would have been put forward before now.\u201dAlistair Darling, the former Labour cabinet minister who leads the \u201cno\u201d campaign, known as \u201cBetter Together,\u201d said that the polls showed the referendum would \u201cgo down to the wire\u201d but that his side would win.\u201cWe relish this battle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not the Battle of Britain. It is the battle for Scotland, for Scotland\u2019s children and grandchildren and the generations to come.\u201dThe anxiety in Westminster has been building, and even Queen Elizabeth II, who is also queen of Scotland, was said by The Sunday Times of London to be worried about preserving the union of the two crowns, which dates back to 1603, a century before the political union.Mr. Salmond has said she would remain monarch of an independent Scotland, but the queen \u2014 whose public stance is one of strict neutrality \u2014 was also reported to be concerned about what independence could mean for the self-governing Church of Scotland.Business leaders are also taking the prospect of dissolution more seriously, especially given the statement by all three main British parties that an independent Scotland would not be able to use the British pound.Mr. Salmond has said Scotland could use the currency regardless of the result, much as Panama uses the American dollar, and has vowed to renege on Scotland\u2019s share of British debt if it is not allowed to share in the pound.But if the British parties follow through, Scotland will have no say in the Bank of England and in monetary policy governing the pound, undermining independence. Even Scottish banks would almost surely have to move their headquarters south, because only the Bank of England could serve as a true central bank and lender of last resort.There are also serious questions about how Scotland would finance itself, given its dependence on royalties from the flow of North Sea oil and gas, which has been declining. A vote for independence would also mean tense negotiations with London on issues like fishing rights and the future of Britain\u2019s nuclear submarine base in Scotland.Questions like these are what the \u201cno\u201d campaign is counting on \u2014 that Scots will not want to leap into such an uncertain future, especially with the promise of maximum devolution should they stay. But many Scots see the referendum as their best and perhaps last chance to reclaim independence.Scotland tends to vote more left-wing than England and favors a larger, more centralized, Scandinavian-style state, with free university education and health care.The political divide from Westminster is sharp. Only one Conservative Party member of the British Parliament is from Scotland, so Scots feel that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition led by Mr. Cameron does not really represent them.At the same time, the British Labour Party, which wins many seats in Scotland, wants to preserve the union, fearing that without Scotland, it would have a much harder time winning a majority in Westminster. So the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, was also said to be preparing a late effort to persuade Scots to stay within the kingdom, promising them that if Labour wins the next election in May, Scotland will get a better deal and a more sympathetic hearing.Polls now indicate that the vote is neck and neck, after months when the pro-union side remained ahead.A YouGov poll published in The Sunday Times showed the independence vote inching ahead for the first time. The poll was conducted last week using an opt-in online panel that is not truly a random sampling of potential respondents, but it showed a swing in momentum toward independence, especially among Labour Party voters.A YouGov poll released on Sept. 2 had those against independence ahead by six percentage points, down from 14 points in the middle of August and 22 points at the beginning of August.YouGov\u2019s polls have been considered more weighted toward \u201cno\u201d voters, adding to the anxiety.If Scotland votes to leave the United Kingdom, independence will not occur before March 2016, leaving lots of time for bitter negotiations that will further preoccupy a Britain that is questioning even its own membership in the European Union and its place in the world.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Radical Response", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Martin Wolf is as grand and important as an economic journalist can ever become. A respected economist in his own right, Wolf has had top-level access to economic policy makers for decades now, seeing generations of finance ministers and central bank governors come and go. All of them care, deeply, about what he thinks and what he writes, and they tend to spend as much time as they can trying to persuade him of their point of view. The result is a classic virtuous cycle: He\u2019s well informed because he\u2019s extremely influential, and he\u2019s influential because he\u2019s extremely well informed.In the wake of the financial crisis, Wolf has become an even rarer beast: the highly influential radical. His is the loudest and foremost voice saying that the global policy response to the crisis was far too timid; that it all but ensures we will have an even worse crisis down the road; and that unless we start implementing extreme measures today, we will be running headlong into catastrophe.Wolf splits his new book, \u201cThe Shifts and the Shocks,\u201d into three sections. The first is an economist\u2019s history of the financial crisis (\u201cthe shocks\u201d); the second is a broader view of the global economic conditions that helped cause the crisis (\u201cthe shifts\u201d); the third is a series of prescriptions for how we might prevent such a calamity from ever happening again (\u201cthe solutions\u201d). In all three sections, expect a lot of econo-\u00adwonkery and almost no narrative: You\u2019ll find precious few human protagonists here. Wolf doesn\u2019t tell a story so much as rattle off lists of economic phenomena, and the result is not easy to read. Here, for instance, is a typical sentence: \u201cWith the eurozone in internal and external balance and creditor eurozone seeking internal balance via ever-\u00adlarger external imbalances in the form of current-\u00adaccount surpluses, debtor eurozone could only attain internal balance with ever-\u00adlarger external imbalances in the form of current-account deficits.\u201dWolf is very fond of such wonkish econo-\u00adtautologies: \u201cIf domestic output is to be sufficient to generate full utilization of capacity, aggregate demand must exceed domestic output by the size of the current-\u00adaccount deficit, at full employment,\u201d he explains at one point. Given a choice between precision and ease of understanding, Wolf will always choose precision, talking about countries\u2019 \u201cnet external liability position\u201d (instead of \u201cnational debt\u201d) on one page, and their \u201creal unit labor costs\u201d (instead of \u201cwages\u201d) on the next. He\u2019s also fond of repeating himself:\u201cFriedman\u2019s view emphasized not the price of money (the interest rate), but its quantity. He was a quantity theorist in the tradition of Irving Fisher: He argued that what mattered was not the price of money, the rate of interest, but its quantity, the stock of money. Friedman believed that the rate of interest does not tell one whether monetary policy is loose or not. Only the rate of growth of the money supply does that.\u201d You need to be a very devoted Wolf fan to wade through hundreds of pages of such material. And, at least for the first two-thirds of the book, the rewards for doing so are meager. After all, if you\u2019re educated and sophisticated enough to know what \u201cnonfactor services\u201d are, you probably know already what happened to the global economy during the crisis. Still, the first two sections do present a reasonably clear worldview. Wolf paints a picture of a global economy being wrecked both by freedom of capital \u2014 trillions of dollars flowing to areas where such sums can end up causing tremendous harm \u2014 and by the imprisonment of 18 European countries in a fixed currency system that robs them of setting their own monetary policy. It\u2019s a worldview in which central bankers, rather than their commercial brethren, are the people who really determine whether the world crashes and burns: The Jamie Dimons simply end up acting in accordance with the incentives that the Alan Greenspans put in place. Indeed, while Wolf talks only in vague terms about punishing \u201cguilty\u201d bankers, without naming any names, he is happy to berate Ben Bernanke, by name, in the harshest terms. In 2007, Wolf writes, Bernanke \u201cwas almost clueless\u201d about the coming catastrophe, and one of Bernanke\u2019s speeches before the crisis was \u201ccomplacent, indeed vainglorious.\u201d (The feeling isn\u2019t mutual: Bernanke has happily provided a glowing blurb for the book.)Wolf may have a central banker\u2019s technocratic soul and deeply rooted fluency in economics, but he also has withering scorn for what central bankers have wrought. \u201cThe view that stabilizing inflation was a sufficient condition for economic stability has been proved grotesquely wrong,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe truth is the opposite.\u201d In a world in which it\u2019s largely taken for granted that the job of a central bank is to keep inflation low, Wolf persuasively argues that central banks should target a much higher rate of inflation, noting that, in the eurozone, \u201cinflation of 3 to 4 percent a year would not be a disaster\u201d and would actually be very helpful in terms of getting the European economy back on its feet.\u201cThe Shifts and the Shocks\u201d is extremely good at untangling the causes of the global financial crisis, and Wolf does have at least one eye on practical matters: He says the French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s recommendation of a global wealth tax \u201cis unquestionably too ambitious.\u201d Yet Wolf\u2019s own recommendations are more ambitious still. They include attempts to prevent corporations from accumulating cash; an end to the tax-deductibility of interest payments; a scaling back of international banks in a global \u201cfinancial disintegration\u201d; a mass refinancing of European sovereign debt into eurobonds, payable jointly and severally by all eurozone nations; a radical change in debt contracts to make them much more equitylike; and, of course, that idea about abolishing \u00adfractional-reserve banking, which would give governments the job of directly creating all the money in the economy. None of these prescriptions are really fleshed out. Wolf\u2019s chapter on the future of the eurozone is the best in the book, but even on Europe his measures can be irritatingly skeletal: \u201cSome time after the crisis is over,\u201d he writes, \u201cconsideration might be given to a partial breakup of what has proved an enormously costly arrangement.\u201d Who might do the considering, and how they might be able to consider such a thing without precipitating a continentwide panic, he doesn\u2019t say.\u2029Which is why, despite Wolf\u2019s attempts to don the garb of a revolutionary, this book is actually something more familiar, and more depressing: a wonkish eschatology of how the global economy, and Europe\u2019s in particular, is doomed. If Wolf\u2019s prescriptions aren\u2019t followed, he says, \u201cfurther crises seem certain,\u201d erupting again and again, \u201cuntil governments are no longer able to prevent some kind of fiscal or monetary collapse.\u201d And it\u2019s the collapse, not the revolution, that is Wolf\u2019s base-case scenario. His final words? \u201cOur open world economy could end in the fire.\u201d THE SHIFTS AND THE SHOCKSWhat We\u2019ve Learned \u2014 and Have Still to Learn \u2014 From the Financial CrisisBy Martin WolfIllustrated. 466 pp. Penguin Press. $35.Felix Salmon is a senior editor at Fusion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Colleges That Enroll Rich, Middle Class and Poor", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind Ivy WallsVassar has taken steps to hold down spending on faculty and staff. Amherst and the University of Florida have raised new money specifically to spend on financial aid for low-income students. American University reallocated scholarships from well-off students to needy ones. Grinnell set a floor on the share of every freshman class \u2013 15 percent \u2013 whose parents didn\u2019t go to college.Vassar, the once all-female college in the Hudson River Valley, tops our index, with Grinnell placing second. About 23 percent of Vassar\u2019s freshmen in recent years have received federal Pell grants (which mean they come from roughly the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution), up from 12 percent in 2007. After taking scholarships into account, the average annual cost of attending Vassar for lower-income students is about $6,000. Students cover much of that cost through campus jobs and loans.The biggest theme to emerge from our analysis is that otherwise similar colleges often have very different levels of commitment to economic diversity. In this area, endowment is not destiny, and prestige is not destiny.To measure top colleges\u2019 efforts on economic diversity, The Upshot calculated a College Access Index.Economic diversity at top colleges started to receive more attention about a decade ago. With traditional, race-based affirmative action under attack, university administrators began to think about other ways to enroll diverse classes. At the same time, researchers were releasing data showing that although top colleges had become diverse in many ways \u2013 race, gender, religion, geography \u2013 many of them remained decidedly affluent.\u201cWhere we\u2019ve come to is a greater recognition that maybe we weren\u2019t living up to what we thought we were doing,\u201d Ms. Hill told me. Simply announcing that the college offered scholarships wasn\u2019t enough to persuade students to apply. The college began working harder to recruit top students from all backgrounds and also increased its financial-aid budget, even when it meant saying no to other exciting ways to spend money.\u201cTalented, low-income kids are out there, and talented middle-income kids are out there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the problem for schools is when you admit one of those kids, you forgo $50,000 a year that you could use for other things.\u201dThose other things \u2013 sleek buildings, new academic programs \u2013 also happen to be the things that can help colleges woo professors and climb the rankings. So why would a college expand its financial-aid budget, I asked Ms. Hill.\u201cWe are being supported by the federal government and the state government as a nonprofit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing that because of our nation\u2019s commitment to equal opportunity and social mobility, and part of our obligation is living up to making that more of a reality in the United States.\u201dEven when low-income students are admitted to a place like Vassar, Harvard or Grinnell, they still face challenges. They find themselves away from home, in a very different environment, juggling classwork, new friends and logistical issues unknown to more affluent students.Sebastian Rivera, the son of a carpenter and a housekeeper in Chicago, was admitted to Grinnell last spring. But he couldn\u2019t fathom how his parents could afford the $11,000 out of pocket that the college asked them to pay. Only after a high-school English teacher named Rachael Wenz \u2013 whom he calls \u201cmy support network\u201d \u2013 told him that he could appeal his financial-aid award did he do so.He won the appeal. His family pays only $233 a year, while he will pay about $5,000 more, through an on-campus job and a loan. He started at Grinnell a few weeks ago and told me he wants to become an international economist.If the number of college graduates from low-income backgrounds is going to rise sharply, it\u2019s true that most of them won\u2019t come from selective colleges like Grinnell. But those colleges still have an outsize role.That is why it\u2019s worrisome that so many students are falling through the cracks \u2013 and that the student body at many elite campuses remains largely affluent. But it may not always be so. In the course of compiling this data and talking to officials at dozens at colleges, I couldn\u2019t help noticing that most of them insisted they wanted to do better.Wash. U. emphasized that its share of Pell recipients has risen to 8 percent among this fall\u2019s freshman \u2013 from 6 percent and 5 percent in the previous two years \u2013 and acknowledged it still had work to do. At Washington and Lee, in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, only 3 percent of freshmen received Pell grants in 2007. Last fall, the share reached 10 percent, partly as a result of a new financial-aid program.It\u2019s possible, of course, that some of the colleges saying they value economic diversity \u2013 and meritocracy, regardless of a student\u2019s background \u2013 won\u2019t match their words to actions. It\u2019s also possible that top colleges are in the early stages of changing.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. \nnytimes.com/upshot Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Leader Plans Stronger Presence in Ebola Zone", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said on Wednesday that he planned to establish a new on-the-ground mission in West Africa to coordinate the struggle against Ebola, a move that signaled his concern with the response so far and the limitations of the World Health Organization\u2019s abilities. In an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times, Mr. Ban said that he intended to ask the General Assembly to support his plan in order to demonstrate the unanimous global concern about Ebola, the deadly virus that is spreading at exponential rates in three Western African countries. Mr. Ban is scheduled to address a Security Council meeting devoted to Ebola on Thursday afternoon and said he was hoping to convene a special General Assembly session on Friday.\u201cWe don\u2019t need all this time-consuming, so-called consultation, or consensus building,\u201d Mr. Ban said. \u201cThere is a consensus already that this is very serious and urgent. This spreads and doubles in three weeks\u2019 time. So it\u2019s a matter of take action. We have to save the people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the main purpose, to take immediate action,\u201d he said. A draft Security Council resolution, proposed by the United States, calls on member states to provide assistance, including medical personnel and field hospitals, and urges countries in the region to lift travel restrictions and keep borders open. The resolution says the spread of Ebola in Africa \u201cconstitutes a threat to international peace and security,\u201d and follows President Obama\u2019s announcement on Tuesday that the United States was preparing to offer medicine, equipment and up to 3,000 military personnel as part of the effort to curb the virus.It was not immediately clear how an increased United Nations presence in the most afflicted countries \u2014 Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2014 would give the organization more power to contain the crisis. But Mr. Ban said it would emphatically signal that places ravaged by Ebola are not pariahs to be shunned and avoided \u2014 a message he has sought to reinforce in his conversations with other world leaders.\u201cThere is a huge psychological panic and fear that nobody wants to go in,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we have to give some sense of assurance that there is full protection and support by the international community.\u201d Asked when the new mission would start, he said. \u201cIt should not take a couple of months, it should take a couple of weeks.\u201dMr. Ban spoke as the forecast for the most afflicted countries appeared to worsen. The World Bank Group reported on Wednesday that those countries could experience a \u201cpotentially catastrophic blow\u201d to their economies.The outbreak could cut gross domestic product by nearly 12 percent in Liberia and nearly 9 percent in Sierra Leone in 2015 if it is not curbed, according to the report, which acknowledged considerable uncertainty in its estimates. The impact in Guinea would be less severe, at around 2 percent.A fear of contagion and what the bank referred to as \u201caversion behavior\u201d is driving most of the economic losses. Panic is closing places of employment, disrupting transportation and severing air and sea links with other nations, the analysis found.The pattern is consistent with infectious disease outbreaks elsewhere, including SARS and H1N1 flu, during which behavioral changes accounted for 80 percent to 90 percent of economic losses, according to bank estimates.\u201cThe fear of contagion has helped fuel an economic crisis,\u201d Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the bank\u2019s president, said in a news conference. If the virus spreads significantly to other African nations, the costs could reach, \u201cdepending on the scenario, we think potentially many billions of dollars,\u201d Dr. Kim said. \u201cThe best-case scenario is still not in sight.\u201dDecreased labor supply is a smaller factor in the losses in West Africa, stemming from illnesses, deaths and caregiving. These are related not only to Ebola, but also to other diseases left untreated because health systems have collapsed as medical workers fell ill or refused to work because of the risks and a lack of protective supplies.Hazard pay for health workers is needed to help reopen the services, but is still not provided, Amara Konneh, Liberia\u2019s finance minister, said in a telephone interview. He said the country was working with donors, including the World Bank and the United States government, to support roughly $60 million for the additional pay. \u201cWe appreciate the response to date but we need more assistance quite frankly,\u201d he said.The World Bank\u2019s prediction, Mr. Konneh said, \u201cis not new to us, but rather it confirms what we have been saying since the onset of the outbreak.\u201d The bank said that both food prices and inflation were rising as a result of \u201cshortages, panic buying and speculation.\u201d Dr. Kim said that most of the economic impact could be blunted \u201cif we get an effective response on the ground in the next few months.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "European Finance Ministers Support Investment Program", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILAN \u2014 European Union finance ministers endorsed plans over the weekend to leverage hundreds of billions of euros to finance new infrastructure projects and spur demand as part of efforts to avoid a period of Japanese-style economic stagnation across the region.Pier Carlo Padoan, the Italian minister of the economy and finance, said officials meeting here had agreed to direct the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to present initial plans for such a program within weeks.The focus should be on \u201cpractical measures\u201d for \u201cprofitable investment projects, which are justifiable,\u201d Mr. Padoan said at a news conference on Saturday.Italy is managing European Union ministerial gatherings until the end of the year under a system by which that responsibility rotates among the bloc\u2019s member states for six-month periods. The meeting Saturday was attended by finance and economy ministry officials from all 28 members of the union.European efforts to set weighty investment plans in motion are not new. The European Union authorities have frequently discussed marshaling public and private sources of financing to overcome the devastating impact the sovereign debt crisis has had on many economies.But there seems to be new momentum to use investment to combat sluggish growth and deflationary pressures, and to quell a backlash against years of austerity policies widely seen as harmful to growth and jobs. Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president of the European Commission, the union\u2019s executive body, said he has made it a priority to marshal up to 300 billion euros, or $389 billion, in additional public and private investment over three years.A regional investment program also has some backing from the European Central Bank, which has warned that efforts to prime the economy using monetary policy must be accompanied by significant demand-side measures, like new investment, to succeed.\u201cInvestment, for instance, in the euro area is now 20 percent below what it was in 2007,\u201d V\u00edtor Const\u00e2ncio, the vice president of the European Central Bank, said at the news conference. \u201cIn the stressed countries, the percentage is even, of course, much higher.\u201dHe called for \u201ca reversal in the behavior of investment,\u201d and said he broadly supported Mr. Juncker\u2019s investment plan.Last week, in a letter to Mr. Padoan, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the German finance minister, and his French counterpart, Michel Sapin, endorsed plans to step up investment to give eurozone economies a better chance at growth in the years to come. The letter, dated Sept. 9, was a sign that the two largest economies in the eurozone might be prepared to work together to expedite the initiative.\u201cThey might do it this time rather than talk about it,\u201d Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, told reporters on Saturday.\u201cI\u2019ve already told my officials that we need to ensure we have a list of investable projects in Ireland so that, if this fund does come in place, we\u2019ll be in a position to draw down\u201d the money, he said.\u201cIt would be mostly infrastructure projects, big and small, things to do with energy, things to do with roads, social infrastructure like schools and health centers and so on,\u201d Mr. Noonan said, adding that the projects were \u201cpretty well investable right away.\u201dBut Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, injected a note of caution.Mr. de Guindos said that projects that receive financing must help to break down remaining barriers among the European Union\u2019s national economies and promote reforms so member states can become more competitive.\u201cWe have to identify investments that foster also productivity and competitiveness,\u201d Mr. de Guindos told reporters on Saturday.\u201cIt\u2019s not a merely Keynesian investment program,\u201d he said, referring to John Maynard Keynes, the British economist frequently cited to justify public spending to combat economic downturns.

{"Headline": "Spanish Premier Insists Vote on Catalan Independence Will Not Happen", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADRID \u2014 Two weeks after Scotland voted against leaving Britain, another and more contentious secession fight is hurtling ahead in Europe, with Spain and its independence-minded region of Catalonia increasingly at odds and showing few signs of willingness to compromise.Responding to a decree signed on Saturday by Catalonia\u2019s leader authorizing an independence vote on Nov. 9, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain declared on Monday that the vote would not go ahead because it violates Spain\u2019s Constitution and would be rejected by the Constitutional Court.The standoff raised the prospect that Catalans might seek to go ahead with the referendum even in the face of opposition from the central government, creating a deep split within Spain, encouraging other separatists in Europe \u2014 including those in Spain\u2019s Basque region \u2014 and leaving Mr. Rajoy with a volatile political challenge.Later on Monday, Spain\u2019s Constitutional Court voted in a special session to suspend the Catalan decree pending a final ruling on its validity. Mr. Rajoy\u2019s firm stance could leave him \u201cbeing legally right but still facing a growing problem of legitimacy that won\u2019t be removed unless the question of Catalonia\u2019s future and sovereignty gets somehow addressed,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, head of the Spanish office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, a research group.Polls suggest that Catalans are split on the secession question, but that a majority are in favor of the issue being put to a vote.It is not clear what steps Mr. Rajoy would take should the Catalans press ahead with a vote in the face of a court ruling against them and opposition from the central government. But if a vote was to take place, it could well become an issue that draws in other European governments, some of whom face separatist movements of their own.If Scots had voted to break away in a referendum approved by the British government, the European Union would have \u201csomehow adjusted, even if on some issues Brussels would have had to square a legal circle,\u201d Mr. Torreblanca said. If Catalonia holds a vote without the approval of Mr. Rajoy\u2019s government, however, \u201cit would be a real earthquake for the E.U., forcing other Europeans to enter uncharted waters and take sides in a national dispute that has no precedent.\u201dThe decree signed by Artur Mas, the Catalan leader, ratcheted up a dispute that began two years ago over fiscal issues into a secessionist challenge with political risks for both leaders. Spain holds a general election next year.Mr. Rajoy accused Mr. Mas on Monday of irresponsibility in pushing Catalans toward a secession vote when, under Spain\u2019s Constitution, only a majority of Spaniards can alter Spain\u2019s \u201cindivisible sovereignty.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody who can deprive all Spaniards of the right to decide over what is their country,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said at a news conference after an emergency cabinet meeting. \u201cWhoever has got underway this whole process is responsible for its serious consequences.\u201dA vote, Mr. Rajoy said, \u201cis against the law, steps beyond democracy, divides Catalans, moves them away from Europe and hurts their well-being.\u201dMr. Mas, however, said in a television interview on Sunday that it was Mr. Rajoy who was forcing a vote by refusing to make any fiscal or other concessions to Catalonia. \u201cThere is no plan B,\u201d Mr. Mas said in the interview with La Sexta, a Spanish TV channel.Mr. Mas has trumpeted Scotland\u2019s referendum as a \u201cgreat lesson in democracy\u201d that Mr. Rajoy should heed.For Spain, the economic consequences of a secession would likely be greater than they would have been for Britain. Spain is still recovering economically from the euro debt crisis and continues to struggle with near-record unemployment, following a lengthy recession and a banking bailout.Scotland\u2019s 5.3 million people represent about 8 percent of Britain\u2019s population and account for 9 percent of its economic output. But Scotland\u2019s North Sea oil assets make it the wealthiest part of Britain per capita; this fed into secessionist arguments that Scotland\u2019s economy could thrive without support from London.Catalonia\u2019s 7.5 million people represent 16 percent of the Spanish population, but also account for a larger share of Spain\u2019s economy \u2014 19 percent. That has fueled resentment among Catalans about Spain\u2019s fiscal system, which redistributes their taxes to weaker Spanish regions.Mr. Rajoy said on Monday that he was willing to resume \u201ca fruitful dialogue\u201d with Mr. Mas about some economic concessions, \u201cbut always within the return to legality.\u201d Mr. Rajoy refused to discuss how his government would respond if Catalonia set up ballot boxes on Nov. 9.The Catalan regional government has budgeted 8.9 million euros \u2014 about $11.3 million \u2014 to finance the vote. A Catalan vote would also be a bellwether for other independence-minded regions, notably the Basque region, which has a long and violent history of separatism.Mr. Mas, on the other hand, faces the difficult choice of going ahead with an illegal vote or of delaying the vote to allow for further negotiations with Mr. Rajoy, which could lead to protests in Catalonia. He could also call early elections in Catalonia \u2014 with the risk that more hard-line secessionist politicians could win and oust him and his Convergence party from power.Mr. Mas insisted on Sunday that he acted within the law, signing a decree that was validated by Catalonia\u2019s own legal experts, as well as an overwhelming majority of regional lawmakers. Still, he noted that history also offered examples of civil disobedience leading to political and social progress.Catalonia \u201cisn\u2019t Kosovo,\u201d said Mr. Torreblanca, the political analyst, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to believe that at least a small fraction of Catalans will not get more radical, because the sense of frustration if there is no vote will be very real.\u201dOn Sept. 11, hundreds of thousands of pro-independence Catalans marched in Barcelona on Catalonia\u2019s national day to demand a vote.Catalans have a strong cultural identity and have long clashed with Madrid. The botched proclamation of a Catalan state during the 1930s was eventually followed by the Spanish Civil War and the lengthy dictatorship of its winner, Francisco Franco.Spain\u2019s return to democracy in the late 1970s, however, allowed Catalonia and other regions to reclaim some autonomy \u2014 notably over an education system in which Catalan was promoted as the main language \u2014 in return for broad cooperation with successive governments in Madrid.Under Jordi Pujol, who founded the Convergence party and led Catalonia from 1980 to 2003, Catalonia\u2019s government then \u201cfollowed a pragmatic approach of seeking concessions from Madrid, but not ones that could ever lead to a break-up,\u201d said Josep Fontana, a Catalan historian.Even with his political future in the balance, Mr. Mas will not proceed with a vote that would have \u201cno international credibility\u201d if held against a constitutional ruling, said Josep Ramoneda, a Catalan writer and political columnist.\u201cIt\u2019s a situation that is extremely difficult to unblock and that is likely to leave Catalonia stuck in muddy waters for a long time,\u201d Mr. Ramoneda said. \u201cSooner or later, there will be a referendum because even if the path chosen by Mas isn\u2019t the right one, you cannot just respond to such sovereignty demands with legal arguments.\u201dBecause of an editing error, a previous version of this article gave an incorrect equivalent, in dollars, of the 8.9 million euros that the Catalan regional government has budgeted for an independence referendum. It is $11.3 million, not $113 million.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nevada Woos Tesla Plant in Tax Deal, but Economic Benefits Prompt Debate", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Nevada lured Tesla Motors to the Reno area to build a giant battery factory, a triumphant governor, Brian Sandoval, proclaimed that every dollar his state was spending in tax incentives and other subsidies would yield $80 in economic activity.But experts in industrial development say that his estimate is not so clear-cut. The calculation, they say, relies on two big assumptions: that the factory, which is to be built on a scale never tried before for a battery plant and is to employ 6,500 people, will achieve the radical cost savings that Tesla envisions, and that all the business it spurs will go to local companies. And even then, not all of the $80 would reach governments; most of it, in fact, would go to the private sector.A crucial issue is that whenever a state offers an incentive for a company to build a factory, the economic stimulus is rarely concentrated in the surrounding area. Building and equipping the battery factory, for example, will cost about $5 billion, and while some of that money will have to be spent in Nevada, many of the equipment purchases, for example, cannot be.\u201cAre there any factories in Nevada that make the equipment to manufacture lithium-ion batteries?\u201d said Greg LeRoy, the executive director of Good Jobs First, a nonprofit watchdog group in Washington that generally opposes such state incentives. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get to count that as a Nevada impact.\u201dThe package was more than twice as large as the $500 million that Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, had said a month earlier that he was seeking. But Mr. Sandoval stressed that it would provide a lift for a state that has not recovered from the recession, and increase its gross domestic product by 4 percent.That model predicted an increase in economic output over the next 20 years of more than $100 billion, or about 80 times an incentive package of about $1.3 billion. The incentives kick in as more money is invested; the factory is supposed to employ 6,500 people, but that is not what the tax breaks are tied to.Even if the state forgoes taxes, its tax revenue could increase, the governor\u2019s analysis says; for example, its employees will spend 31 percent of their incomes on taxable goods.\u201cSuppliers do end up co-locating,\u201d said Sarah Murley, a principal of Applied Economics. And if things do not go as planned, \u201cit\u2019s a risk more for Tesla than the state of Nevada,\u201d she said. If Tesla does not expand the factory as planned, then the taxes that Nevada agreed to waive would be meaningless anyway.Nevada approved the package quickly not only because it wanted to meet Mr. Musk\u2019s requests, but also because it sought to do so before another state did. Tesla was also courting California (where the company already builds electric cars, and where most of the batteries would go), Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Battery manufacture requires dry conditions, so starting in a desert helps. Perhaps to whet Nevada\u2019s appetite, Tesla even sent in bulldozers to move some dirt around at the site near Reno.By any measure, Tesla\u2019s ambitions are enormous: It aims to build a factory that will more than double world capacity for lithium-ion batteries, and cut their cost of production, at a time when some battery factories are partly idle. With the savings, Tesla says it will be able to build mass-market electric cars, stimulating demand.Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, the vice president for business development at Tesla, said Nevada did not offer the most money, but when combined with various other factors, like logistics and costs for land and energy, had the best package. As for the idea that states and countries should not compete to lure industrial facilities, that is \u201cwell divorced form the reality of business and free enterprise,\u201d he said. Executives of a public company like Tesla have a duty to seek the best deal, he said.\u201cStudents sit on the floor, they share books, and our Legislature could not come up with any kind of deal for the schools to fund them,\u201d Laura Martin, the group\u2019s spokeswoman, said.Richard Florida, a global research professor at New York University and a frequent critic of development incentives, said the factory would probably have been built in Nevada even without the generous subsidy.\u201cThey had the site picked out; they started on it,\u201d he said in an email. Companies like Tesla \u201cexploit that information asymmetry,\u201d creating uncertainty in a potential host state, he said. \u201cThey know where they want to locate, and then essentially game the process to get incentives from states. It is wasteful and it should be banned.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ebola Presents Challenge, and an Opportunity, for U.N. Leader", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Ban Ki-moon, in his seventh year as the secretary general of the United Nations, has a full plate of unsolved problems, from a widening war in Syria to conflicts in the Central African Republic and South Sudan \u2014 to say nothing of climate change.Now comes Ebola.For Mr. Ban, it represents a crucial test of leadership \u2014 but also an opportunity. If he can be more effective in mobilizing world leaders to contain this calamity than he has in the others, it can serve as something akin to redemption. Or else it could leave a deep stain on his legacy.On Thursday, in an unusual move, the Security Council declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a threat to international peace and security, passing a resolution that calls on countries worldwide to send medical personnel and supplies urgently to contain the outbreak.Mr. Ban told the Council of his plans to set up an emergency mission to tackle the swiftly spreading disease, which has already killed more than 2,600 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The new emergency mission would enable the United Nations to coordinate the world response to the outbreak, Mr. Ban said, adding that an advance team would be on the ground by the end of the month.On Friday, Mr. Ban is scheduled to brief the 193-member General Assembly on the mission.\u00a0And he is convening a meeting of heads of state to discuss the Ebola response next Thursday, on the sidelines of the General Assembly session that begins next week.\u201cEbola matters to us all,\u201d Mr. Ban said Thursday at the Council session. \u201cThe gravity and scale of the situation now requires a level of international action unprecedented for a health emergency.\u201dJean-Marie Gu\u00e9henno, a former senior United Nations official and now president of the International Crisis Group, noted both the possibilities and the perils facing Mr. Ban.\u201cThe secretary general is ideally placed to focus sustained attention on cross-border challenges that overwhelm the capacities of any single state,\u201d he said by email. \u201cThe Ebola crisis is precisely such a challenge. And if it is neglected, the chances of state breakdown and violent upheaval could grow dramatically.\u201dMargaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, called it the \u201cgreatest peacetime challenge\u201d that the United Nations had faced.Questions and answers on the scale of the outbreak and the science of the Ebola virus.Ebola has devastated the economies of three fragile West African countries, spread panic and fear across much of the world, and taken a particularly devastating toll on health workers treating Ebola patients.\u201cIn some ways, Ebola is the perfect crisis to show why the U.N. matters: Solving it will take the whole range of U.N. tools,\u201d including its tens of thousands of peacekeepers and experts on global health, said Richard Gowan, an associate director at New York University\u2019s Center on International Cooperation. \u201cBan can talk about it as a case-study of why we need a strong U.N. and reliable global institutions, in contrast to a divisive political showdown like Ukraine.\u201dMr. Ban is hamstrung on reacting to the Ebola crisis in obvious ways. He has no money, no standing army and no arsenal of field hospitals, doctors or nurses on hand. He relies on member states, and at the Council session on Thursday, he reiterated his plea for countries to contribute. The United Nations says tackling Ebola will cost at least $1 billion.The most poignant appeal came from a Liberian aid worker with Doctors Without Borders. \u201cWe are trying to treat as many people as we can, but there are not nearly enough treatment centers and patient beds,\u201d the worker, Jackson Naimah, told the Council by videolink. \u201cWe have to turn people away. And they are dying at our front door.\u201dMr. Naimah appealed for helicopters, hospital beds and health experts. \u201cI feel that the future of my country is hanging in the balance,\u201d he said.As diplomats spoke at the Council session, a Unicef official in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, said the country\u2019s Ebola hotline and ambulance services were so overstretched that five children were left at home alone with the corpses of their Ebola-infected parents for three days. Some of the children were now hospitalized with symptoms of Ebola.The Security Council resolution reflects the attention that the United States has recently put into the effort. President Obama has pledged medicine, equipment and 3,000 military personnel to help Liberia, and the United States drafted the resolution and called the emergency session.\u201cSo to every country represented here, especially those still figuring out how they will respond, take this message back to your capitals, please,\u201d the American ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, said. \u201cThe math is simple: The sooner we act, the more of us that contribute, the more lives we save. \u201cThe United Nations was built for challenges like this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Portland Always Be a Retirement Community for the Young?", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyLike many residents of Northwest Portland, Matthew Hale doesn\u2019t own a car. Instead, he prefers to walk or ride the bus to the city\u2019s innumerable coffee shops and breweries and live-music spots. On weekends, he and his wife have no problem hitching rides to the Pacific Coast or the Cascade mountain range. Everywhere he looks, Hale told me, there are people just like him \u2014 bearded, on skateboards, brewing kombucha. \u201cIt\u2019s really chill,\u201d he says.Portland has taken hold of the cultural imagination as, to borrow the tag line from \u201cPortlandia,\u201d the place where young people go to retire. And for good reason: The city has nearly all the perks that economists suggest lead to a high quality of life \u2014 coastlines, mountains, mild winters and summers, restaurants, cultural institutions and clean air. (Fortunately, college-educated people don\u2019t value sunshine as much as they used to.) Portland also has qualities that are less tangible but still likely to attract young people these days, like a politically open culture that supports gay rights and the legalization of marijuana \u2014 in addition to the right of way for unicyclists or the ability to marry in a 24/7 doughnut shop. \u201cIt\u2019s really captured the zeitgeist of the age in a way that no other small city in America ever has,\u201d said Aaron Renn, an urban-affairs analyst who writes the Urbanophile blog. According to professors from Portland State University, the city has been able to attract and retain young college-educated people at the second-highest rate in the nation. (Louisville, Ky., is No. 1.)City dwelling is generally considered a good thing for the overall economy. Proximity and serendipity offer employers a better chance to hire the perfect person for a job as opposed to someone whose skills just sort of match, according to the work of Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. Chance encounters in dense cities, Moretti has argued, lead to innovation, which subsequently leads to income. And as the baby boomers retire, the pressure is on the young and highly educated to spur urban economies. As a result, many American cities are remaking themselves to lure human capital, offering various perks, like cheap housing and tax breaks, in the hope that smart young people can attract others like them. The Greater Houston area has added more than a million residents since 2000, in large part through generous tax breaks and the growth of the energy sector. Las Vegas is in the middle of a privately funded $350 million project to transform its derelict downtown into a tech incubator. Parts of Detroit have more or less been turned over to the online-mortgage billionaire Dan Gilbert. Other cities like Austin, Tex.; Boulder, Colo.; Raleigh, N.C.; and Nashville have tried, in some way or other, to spark their own little Silicon Valleys.Portland, meanwhile, has the opposite problem. It has more highly educated people than it knows what to do with. Portland is not a corporate town, as its neighbors Seattle and San Francisco have become. While there are employment opportunities in the outdoor-apparel business (Nike, Adidas and Columbia Sportswear are all nearby) or the semiconductor industry (Intel has a large presence in Hillsboro), most workers have far fewer opportunities. According to Renn, personal income per capita in the city grew by a mere 31 percent between 2000 and 2012, slower than 42 other cities, including Grand Rapids, Mich., and Rochester. And yet people still keep showing up. \u201cPeople move to New York to be in media or finance; they move to L.A. to be in show business,\u201d Renn said. \u201cPeople move to Portland to move to Portland.\u201d Matthew Hale may have all the kombucha he can drink, but he doesn\u2019t have a job.Hale, who is 35, told me he is actively looking for work in the field of graphic design. In the meantime, he is getting by, he said, through various freelance gigs and his wife\u2019s income as a barista. This is typical of many Portlanders. (I, too, am originally from there.) David Albouy, an economics professor at the University of Illinois, has created a metric, the sacrifice measure, which essentially charts how poor a person is willing to be in order to live in a particular city. Portland, he discovered, is near the top of the list. Even when college-educated residents get jobs there, they earn 84 cents for the average dollar earned in other cities, according to Greg Schrock and Jason Jurjevich, professors of urban studies at Portland State University. In 41 of the country\u2019s 50 largest cities, young, educated people earn more than they do in Portland. \u201cIt\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market for labor,\u201d Schrock says.Portland\u2019s residents may, as the saying goes, want to keep their city weird. But do they want to keep it broke too?Since 1950, the disparity between incomes and home prices has steadily widened to the point that many urban areas have become largely unaffordable to the middle-class workers who once inhabited them. Economists at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia have coined the term \u201csuperstar cities\u201d to refer to the likes of New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston. \u201cEven large metropolitan areas might evolve into communities that are affordable only by the rich, just [like] exclusive resort areas,\u201d wrote the economists Joseph Gyourko, Christopher Mayer and Todd Sinai in a 2013 article.As the superstar cities have become unattainable, the middle class is increasingly finding refuge in places like Philadelphia or Nashville, Denver or Charlotte, N.C. An example of \u201cthe people who are getting killed,\u201d Renn said, \u201cis the old traditional blue-collar Queens person who\u2019s now getting squeezed with taxes and with housing costs. It\u2019s clear they don\u2019t fit into the vision of the city. They\u2019re basically realizing, Hey, I can go to Charlotte and live like a king on a truck driver\u2019s salary.\u201dPortland\u2019s story is slightly different in that many of its immigrants have come in search of a different kind of wealth. Most people, after all, can\u2019t willingly up and move to a new city for \u2014 rather than a job opportunity \u2014 some ephemeral or lofty ideals about homesteading and locally grown kale. But quite a few Portlanders have done so. \u201cAs our culture and expectations grow, decadence rises,\u201d Albouy said. \u201cWe\u2019re not the hungry immigrant nation we used to be. We\u2019re more into meaning, into jobs that find fulfillment. And at least some people are willing to accept lower pay to go somewhere they care about.\u201d According to Joe Cortright, the president of Impresa, a Portland-based consulting firm on regional economies, young people are increasingly telling themselves, \u201cI\u2019m going to move somewhere and pursue my career,\u201d rather than, \u201cI\u2019m going to pursue my career and go wherever it takes me.\u201d For \u201cthe beer, bikes and Birkenstocks people,\u201d as Cortright put it, that means Portland. Hale, for instance, had planned to move to New York, where he found plenty of listings for graphic-design jobs. Then, by chance, he and his wife visited a friend in Portland and fell in love. \u201cJobs are thinner here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the intelligent urban planning makes my heart sing.\u201dHeartwarming planning, however, can only go so far. Portland\u2019s paradox is that it attracts so many of \u201cthe young and the restless,\u201d as demographers call them, that it has become a city of the overeducated and underemployed \u2014 a place where young people are, in many cases, forced into their semiretirement. A July report by the Oregon Employment Department fretted about the state\u2019s low personal income and employment-to-population ratio. The average income of Oregonians in recent years \u201cmay have been a \u2018victim\u2019 of the state\u2019s attractiveness, and a resulting population influx\u201d by new residents who don\u2019t earn much, the report said.Affordability has long been one of Portland\u2019s most attractive features. What happens when that disappears? Schrock and Jurjevich, the economists at Portland State, have coined a term, the amenity paradox, that refers to cities where the same amenities that attract people end up eroding what made a city desirable in the first place. Portland seems likely to fall into this historical cycle. Just as some New Yorkers may decamp for Charlotte to live like kings, it\u2019s likely that Portland\u2019s designers and baristas, the very people who have made the city what it is, will one day no longer be able to afford the houses they live in, either. \u201cWe could have told a similar story about retiring Midwestern farmers moving to Los Angeles at the end of the 19th century,\u201d Glaeser says.Albouy told me that he has always wondered why Portland doesn\u2019t invest more in its institutions of higher education. If you took Portland\u2019s quality of life and citizens, he said, and added Pittsburgh\u2019s universities, you would come out with a world-class city. But the answer, perhaps, is that Portland\u2019s best chance for retaining its culture is to make sure other people don\u2019t want to live there. (Unless, of course, it is those nine months of constant rain.) At some point, though, the economic forces may be beyond their control.Another solution for keeping Portland weird, at least temporarily, may come from within the city itself. In the wake of the financial crisis, many young college graduates have delayed their lives, put off worries about jobs and houses and families and instead moved to cool cities to wait out the recession, says William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. During that time, the young and educated abandoned cities like Phoenix and Atlanta in large numbers for places like Austin and Portland. But as job prospects improve, and unemployment shrinks to its lowest levels since the crash, it\u2019s likely that many of the young people who fled to Portland will soon chase their ambitions to less cool places \u2014 the ones that people move to when it\u2019s time to become an adult. Then Portland will find out who the true believers really are.\u00a0Claire Cain Miller is a reporter at The Upshot, The\nTimes\u2019s website about politics and policy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Digital Wallet Revolution", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsApple\u2019s digital wallet, if widely adopted, could usher in a new era of ease and convenience. But the really exciting part is the fast-emerging future that it points toward, in which virtual assets of all sorts \u2014 traditional currencies, but also Bitcoin, airline miles, cellphone minutes \u2014 are interchangeable, opening up enormous purchasing power for consumers and creating tough challenges for governments around the world.Moving toward a digital wallet for dollars (or yen, or euros) is only a marginal step forward; throughout history, money\u2019s value has been largely virtual anyway \u2014 think of stocks, or personal lines of credit. The real change is how the digital wallet technology facilitates the parallel emergence of virtual purchasing power, like loyalty points. We don\u2019t typically think of these as currency, because virtual money has traditionally been locked down, in the sense that its use was strictly limited: If you earned points from Amazon, only you could use them, and you could exchange them for dollars only within the Amazon marketplace. Meanwhile, up to now, the only currencies you could use everywhere in an economy were state-issued currencies, like the dollar. But that distinction is eroding: After all, the value of a currency lies in what you can buy with it, not in the fact that a government says it\u2019s worth something. So if I want to buy a widget, and the only thing I can use to buy it is Widgetcash, then I am willing to trade dollars or euros or anything else for Widgetcash. When I buy something with Widgetcash, it doesn\u2019t go through any bank.That\u2019s why a digital wallet, loaded with your dollars, credit and loyalty points, is such a revolutionary technology \u2014 it makes those transfers and transactions seamless and safe. Imagine you want to buy a shirt at Target. Your digital wallet can pay for it with dollars, your Target points or any other form of purchasing power that Target accepts. Wave your phone at the cash register, and the shirt is yours. That\u2019s the sort of thing that the current generation of digital wallets already promises; the only obstacle is adoption by retailers. But that won\u2019t be an obstacle for long. Frictionless exchange is a killer app. Some companies might lose value in their loyalty programs, but others will find enormous value in issuing their own currencies for advertising or data-tracking purposes, or even just because the creation of a successful virtual currency or digital wallet lets companies make money by making money. That\u2019s certainly Apple\u2019s bet.The revolution is what comes next: an exchange that connects and trades these different stores of value to find the most cost-efficient one to use, both within your wallet and between wallet users, worldwide. Let\u2019s say you want to buy an audiobook from Best Buy. It costs $16, or 1,000 My Best Buy points, or M.B.B.P.s. Your wallet contains several hundred dollars and 200 Best Buy points. The wallet software automatically determines that, at the current exchange rate between M.B.B.P.s and dollars, it is better to buy using the points. But then let\u2019s say you only have 50 M.B.B.P.s. The wallet system searches its clients and finds someone \u2014 call her Hannah \u2014 with enough M.B.B.P.s for the transaction. It buys the audiobook with her points and sends it to you, and sends Hannah dollars from your account. Following Bitcoin\u2019s protocol, the wallet software broadcasts these transactions to the network, and every wallet in the world updates the M.B.B.P.-to-dollar exchange rate. The idea is that you can buy anything, with anything. The wallet will find the best deal and execute it. In so doing, it will ignore the historical and cultural differences between dollars, points, coins and virtual property. It\u2019s all bits anyway. This sort of digital wallet raises difficult problems for regulators, who rely on institutional intermediaries like banks as the point for monitoring transactions. But a digital wallet can be a phone app; just like the cash in your pocket, it doesn\u2019t require accounts with any intermediary. A wallet app can be written by anyone, downloaded by anyone and secured and maintained by everyone. In this huge river of money, there is no narrow channel from which the state can divert flow into its own fields. Consider the tax implications. If you get caught cheating on your taxes and flee the country, the government could compel your bank to freeze your assets and cough up the money. But what if there\u2019s no bank? One concern that doesn\u2019t apply is transparency. Digital wallets don\u2019t hide trades or encourage criminal transactions. Using Bitcoin is much less secret than using hard cash. The government, and anybody else, can easily see the trades passing through our wallets, just as every trade in Bitcoin is visible at blockchain.info. Even if you try to hide who you are, network or traffic analysis can often de-anonymize you. The critical point is that, with a digital wallet, a government or bank can see the trades, but it will be harder to compel or block them.As exchange becomes less costly to perform, it becomes more costly to regulate. That means different things depending on your politics. You might celebrate the freedom the technology could bring to the 2.5 billion people in the world without adequate access to financial services, or you might worry about abuse by criminals. One thing that will not work is pretending that these technologies \u2014 and their revolutionary implications \u2014 don\u2019t exist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Antitrust Enforcer Will Be Margrethe Vestager", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The nominee to be the next enforcer of the European Union\u2019s far-reaching antitrust laws is Margrethe Vestager, a former Danish finance minister who would need to handle delicate investigations into powerful companies including the American technology giant Google and the Russian energy titan Gazprom.If confirmed, Ms. Vestager, 46, would wield powers that can include fining companies for breaking European antitrust rules and blocking mergers without a prior court order. She would succeed Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, a Spaniard, who has been scrambling to complete an antitrust settlement with Google before he leaves office in November.\u201cI think it is one of the fundamentals, not only of the European Union but also of free trade, that competition is fair,\u201d said Ms. Vestager, who spoke from Brussels by telephone after her nomination on Wednesday. She added, \u201cI think that fairness is important in all dealings and of course you have to listen to what people have to say \u2014 that goes for companies who feel that other people are misusing their market position and of course for the companies that are being questioned.\u201dMs. Vestager, a member of Denmark\u2019s Social Liberal party, has a reputation for endorsing market mechanisms in business, while also considering the impact of corporate power on consumers and society.\u201cIn the Danish context, she is free market, but the social dimension is important to her, too, in particular creating jobs,\u201d said Elisabet Svane, a political editor at the Danish newspaper Fyens Stiftstidende who published a book about Ms. Vestager last year.Ms. Vestager \u201cis a lady who follows the rules but who also can be sharp-tongued, and she will not be afraid to stand up to powerful companies when she thinks she\u2019s right,\u201d Ms. Svane said in a telephone interview.Those qualities will be valuable assets if, as expected, she faces calls to ease enforcement to make life easier for struggling European companies that are still contending with the weak economy and to get even tougher on non-European firms that are seen as wielding their might unfairly.\u201cThe key challenge she faces is to resist political pressure to relax competition rules given the depth of the recent crisis, and to resist similar political pressure to being overly tough on U.S. multinationals like Google,\u201d said Mario Mariniello, a competition law expert with Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cShe should try to be as scientific as possible under these difficult conditions and keep in mind what\u2019s best for consumers,\u201d Mr. Mariniello said.Ms. Vestager is already a familiar face in Brussels, where she served as chairwoman of stormy meetings of finance ministers in the first half of 2012. At the time, Denmark held the rotating presidency of the European Union during acrimonious negotiations over how strictly to regulate banks in order to prevent a recurrence of a crippling sovereign debt crisis.Mr. Almunia, whom she would succeed, has pushed during his five-year term for settlements of antitrust investigations rather than issuing formal charges.Mr. Almunia has also strongly hinted that he will open a formal inquiry into the Android operating system by Google for mobile devices. The decision on whether to take that step also could fall to Ms. Vestager.Asked how she would approach the case against Google, Ms. Vestager said that it was too soon for her to speak on that. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to start preparing concretely,\u201d she said. Comment on Google \u201cwould come at a later stage,\u201d she said.Other cases awaiting Ms. Vestager include resolving investigations into the way that tax advantages are granted to Apple in Ireland and to Starbucks in the Netherlands. She also may end up deciding whether to clear Facebook\u2019s acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp, if Mr. Almunia opens an extended investigation into that deal before his term ends.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Shearing of the Rockfall", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreetscapesIt\u2019s a perfect crime, really. There\u2019s no blood, and there are no sign of struggle, no marks at all, although plenty is missing. Certainly, the statute of limitations has long ago passed in the case of the mutilation of the intricate front of the Rockfall apartment house, at 111th Street and Broadway. But then, is facade-icide even a crime at all?But the Blums\u2019 new building took a different path: It was called the Rockfall. With our current concern for facade conditions, such a label seems peculiar, even laughable, but in 1910 it was probably meant to evoke a romantic locale \u2014 rugged Wales, or the Scotland of the novels of Sir Walter Scott.Upon completion, the Rockfall, with a $190,000 annual rent roll from six stores and 68 apartments, sold for $1.3 million. It offered tenants up to nine rooms for $200 to $300 per month, and was fully rented before completion. Sir Walter would have found the interior ignoble, a clutch of irregular, tortured apartments, seven to a floor, with internal hallways 30 feet long and a narrow public hall on each floor at least 100 feet long.But the Blums gave the Rockfall a big, brusque battlemented exterior, with formidable masonry balconies that seemed to ooze out of the walls, a facade of soft brown tapestry brick, and a complicated three floors at the top with protruding crisscross brickwork, huge panels of terra cotta and a fortresslike parapet; the Blums often experimented with omitting the traditional cornice. And at the corner of the roof, a heavy pergola, stout enough to serve as a machine gun bunker.The Rockfall is an inexplicably contradictory design, half defensive fortress and half craftlike masonry work.Early rosters indicate that nine in 10 tenants already lived on the West Side, and census returns produce bankers, lawyers and doctors, and also persons involved with the manufacture of clothing, cigars and other goods.A few butlers answered doorbells, and some residents showed up in the boldface of their day, including the kennel owner Mary Winthrop Turner, who was prominent in what The New York Times referred to as \u201cFrench bulldogdom.\u201d Mrs. Turner advertised her champion Pourquoi Pas as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Foremost Stud Dog\u201d in The Sun in 1912. Pourquoi Pas had already sired numerous champions, as well as \u201cmany promising puppies who will be heard from later.\u201d However, he was not to be seen at the end of a leash in the lobby of the Rockfall: Pourquoi Pas lived on Shelter Island.By the 1920s and 1930s, landlords turned a blind eye as tenants began to make their apartments into rooming houses. Grace Davis ran at least one such operation in an apartment at the Rockfall in 1925, with 10 roomers, including four dancers, 17 and 18 years old.The implicit prediction of the Rockfall name was fulfilled in 1935 when a 30-pound fragment of masonry fell from one of the third-floor balconies to the street, barely missing six people.By 1949 the rooming-house economy had taken over the Rockfall, and three operators controlled 44 apartments. It appears there was a dispute between the overall owner and the subletters who profited from the room rents, and someone complained about a fire hazard.The city closed down the building, cutting off the electricity and giving the roomers just days to vacate. The Rockfall had 1,200 people living in a space designed for 400, some residing in closets for $10 a month. Someone profited from the intervention \u2014 it certainly wasn\u2019t the roomers. The building was then renovated, the six apartments per floor becoming 14. Sometime between the early 1950s and 1980, the upper section\u2019s pergola, parapet and terra cotta as well as the balconies were swept away, as I recall it, a crude, even vicious mutilation.In 1991, someone undertook to repair the scorched-earth damage to the upper floors. Complete restoration was impossible, but in its place whoever it was developed a unique and economical design. The upper floors were rebuilt in a brick closely matching the original, and then the designer put in a simple crisscross pattern of bricks laid end-on, projecting from the facade, in the manner of medieval brickwork.In the real world, where preservation sometimes declines to alight, it was an inventive and thoughtful solution. The top does look a little bare, but far better than it has a right to, under the circumstances.What a pity: He really should get an award.The Streetscapes column last Sunday about the Rockfall, an apartment house at 111th street and Broadway, and the loss of much of the ornamentation on its facade misstated the number of units per floor in the original design. It was seven units, not six.Email: streetscapes@nytimes.com Advertisement"}

Instead, he said that the numbers over the summer were weaker than expected and \u201chave given no indication that the sharp decline registered in August has stopped.\u201dMr. Draghi\u2019s words could nourish speculation that the central bank is edging closer to large-scale purchases of government bonds as a way of pumping money into the eurozone economy. Such quantitative easing could be considered at the next meeting of the central bank\u2019s policy-making Governing Council on Oct. 2.Some analysts have argued that the central bank cannot meet its goal without resorting to large-scale purchases of government bonds, similar to those used by the Federal Reserve to revive the United States economy.Appearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at the European Parliament, Mr. Draghi on Monday did not give any explicit indication that quantitative easing was imminent. But he said the bank was \u201cready to use additional unconventional instruments within our mandate,\u201d an indication that quantitative easing remains an option.Mr. Draghi played down the slack demand for the cheap loans, saying that banks may be waiting for a second round of the four-year loans, which will be offered in December.Right now, commercial banks in the eurozone are under intense reviews of their health by the central bank, which Mr. Draghi acknowledged could be temporarily discouraging them from issuing credit. Analysts expect lending to pick up once banks know where they stand, when the central bank publishes the results of those reviews, expected in late October.In addition, the central bank previously said that next month it will begin buying bundles of loans from banks. The purchases of these asset-backed securities will allow banks to sell existing loans and raise money to issue new ones.Mr. Draghi expressed confidence that the combination of cheap loans, asset purchases and rock-bottom interest rates would eventually restore credit in troubled countries.Continuing a theme he has emphasized since August, Mr. Draghi sharply criticized governments for failing, in his view, to take measures to create a better climate for business. Central bank policies have helped push down interest rates on government bonds to record low rates, he said, saving huge sums on interest payments.But he complained that some governments have not used the savings wisely.\u201cWhere have these savings gone?\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cWhere they have gone?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arm Ukraine or Surrender", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMOSCOW \u2014 Russia and Ukraine are now at war. At least 2,200 people have died in the conflict; thousands more may die yet. The Western powers \u2014 America, Europe, NATO \u2014 now have no good options, but they cannot do nothing. President Vladimir V. Putin has left us with two dire choices, both fraught with risk: Either we arm Ukraine, or we force Kiev to surrender and let Mr. Putin carve whatever territories he wants into a Russian-occupied zone of \u201cfrozen conflict.\u201d It is a stark choice, and Mr. Putin is not rational. Any rational leader would have reeled from the cost of Western sanctions. Russia\u2019s economy is being hit hard by a credit crunch, capital flight, spiraling inflation and incipient recession. This will hurt Mr. Putin\u2019s surging popularity at home. But none of this has deterred the smirking enigma.Ukraine cannot win this war. Mr. Putin has made it clear that the Russian Army will annihilate Ukrainian forces if they attempt to liberate Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine\u2019s ramshackle army cannot rout the crack troops and conscript forces of an oil-fueled giant.The West needs to be honest with Ukraine. We talk as though this country were one of us \u2014 as if, one day, it will become a member of the European Union and the NATO alliance. That is Kiev\u2019s wish, but the West is not giving Ukraine the means to fight this war.Ukraine is being destroyed. The economy is in tatters. The military will not survive a Russian offensive. Ukrainians are taking refuge in romantic nationalism and preparing for partisan warfare. The costs are mounting \u2014 continuing to fight will cost thousands of lives \u2014 and the liberal dreams of the revolution are drowning in the jingoistic fury and hysteria of war.A few more months without meaningful Western help and Ukraine will have lost the fighting core of its army \u2014 and its infatuation with the West. This will be replaced by a sense of betrayal, and there will be no way for Ukraine\u2019s pro-European liberals to survive the backlash. The far-right extremists now on the fringe will ride into Kiev\u2019s parliament on the lids of the caskets being shipped back from the front. Ukraine will become a ravaged conflict zone: a European Syria, or a hideously enlarged Bosnia.We cannot let this happen. If we believe that Ukraine will one day become a member of the European Union and NATO, then we should be ready to arm it. We must face the fact that the costs of unlimited European Union and NATO expansion have meant war with Russia by proxy \u2014 and then fight the war. Having reignited the hottest moments of the Cold War, we must deal with the consequences of encouraging democratization in Eastern Europe.This logic demands that we send Western military advisers to Kiev, and give the Ukrainians full intelligence and satellite support. And we must ship them guns, tanks, drones and medical kits by the ton. We must even be ready to deploy NATO troops if Russian tanks roll toward Crimea, as many fear they will, to build a land bridge to the mainland of southern Russia.No question, this path involves enormous risks. Russia will throw its might into Ukraine. American and British special forces should be dispatched to plant the flag and protect the airports of Kiev and Odessa. But Mr. Putin may call our bluff: Russian forces might \u2014 in an echo of the 1999 Kosovo war \u2014 encircle them. But if we are not prepared to take these risks, then we must force the Ukrainians to abandon their deadly delusion. It would be up to us to prevent Russia from slaughtering Ukrainian conscripts in vain.The only way to achieve this is for the West to oblige Ukraine to surrender. Ukraine is completely dependent on the International Monetary Fund, which is Western money. We must tell Kiev to accept as a fait accompli that Russia has carved out a South Ossetia in the east \u2014 or we turn the money off. We can console them: Being another Georgia is not the worst thing in the world.We could save thousands of lives this way, but it would be a crushing defeat for the West. Russia would have restored itself as an empire \u2014 the former Soviet Union once more under the sway of the Kremlin. The West would thus concede, in effect, that Russia may invade or annex any of these territories as it pleases. And in these lands, the appeasers would flourish, and democracy wilt. Russia would have triumphed over the world order imposed by the West after the Soviet Union lost the Cold War. This would mean the destruction of American geopolitical deterrence. America\u2019s enemies, from China to Iran, would see this as an invitation to establish their own spheres of influence amid the wreckage.Russia would not stop there. Mr. Putin wants to undermine NATO, and the smell of weakness would tempt him further. It would be merely a matter of time before Moscow exploited the Russians in the Baltic States to manufacture new \u201cfrozen conflicts.\u201d Poland would feel compelled to act as though NATO did not exist, creating a defensive military alliance of its own with the Baltics; it might even establish a buffer zone in western Ukraine. There is no easy way out now. But we must not let thousands of Ukrainians die because we dithered. We must be honest with them if we are not willing to fight a new Cold War with Russia over Ukrainians\u2019 independence. But if we force Ukraine to surrender, rather than sacrifice lives in a fight for which we have no stomach, then we must accept that it is a surrender, too, for NATO, for Europe and liberal democracy, and for American global leadership. That is the choice before us. Advertisement"}

Actually, Holder\u2019s Justice Department has been notoriously laggard in prosecuting crimes that stemmed from the financial crisis, and much of what it has done amounts to an exercise in public relations.As for those big fines against Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, not only did they come very late, but their terms were such that it was impossible to know for sure the extent of their wrongdoing. And, of course, despite fines that went into the billions, no actual human was prosecuted for any wrongdoing.So the question worth asking, as Holder plans to step down, is not what his department did but why it did so little. Why was it so reluctant to pursue the financial crimes connected to the 2008 crisis? One answer is that these are hard cases to prosecute \u2014 harder than negotiating a financial settlement with a big bank. Early on, the Justice Department tried two Bear Stearns portfolio managers whose hedge fund \u2014 stuffed with mortgage-backed securities \u2014 collapsed. The two men were found innocent. That verdict seems to have sent a chill through prosecutors, making them reluctant to go after others.Jesse Eisinger, the author of that Times Magazine article, wrote that, over the years, the Justice Department saw \u201can erosion of the department\u2019s actual trial skills,\u201d as well as a drop in resources. In the Southern District of New York, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara focused \u2014 with great success \u2014 on insider-trading cases, where he had wiretaps that made prosecutions relatively easy, instead of difficult-to-try financial crisis cases.Adam Levitin, a professor at Georgetown Law School, had his own list of reasons, which he emailed me. They included fear that the Obama administration would be accused of an anti-business witch hunt if it went after Wall Street; \u201cdeep personal, cultural, financial and political ties\u201d between the administration and Wall Street; and a lack of understanding of the products and markets involved. \u201cWhat it all boils down to,\u201d Levitin concluded, \u201cis that we didn\u2019t have prosecutions because no one ever really wanted to prosecute.\u201dNo matter how he tries to spin it, Holder\u2019s inability \u2014 or unwillingness \u2014 to prosecute financial crimes is on the negative side of the ledger.

{"Headline": "Air France, After Strike, Faces New Uncertainty", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisPARIS \u2014 After a two-week pilots' strike that inconvenienced nearly a million passengers and caused Air France to lose an estimated 280 million euros, the airline was slowly returning to the skies on Monday.It was unclear what the pilots had achieved from the strike, other than to delay severely the return to profitability for the French-Dutch parent company, Air France-KLM, and to curb the company\u2019s ambitions for growth in Europe\u2019s fiercely competitive regional market.One outcome may be difficult negotiations in coming months over Air France-KLM\u2019s plans to transform its modest low-cost subsidiary, Transavia, into a credible competitor to well-established rivals like Ryanair and easyJet.Last week, Alexandre de Juniac, Air France-KLM\u2019s French chief executive, said that management\u2019s only major concession to the pilots \u2014 to limit Transavia\u2019s growth mainly to the French market \u2014 had made him \u201csick at heart.\u201dAnalysts say that the scaling back of the Transavia plan from the broader European expansion that the company had originally announced \u2014 the plan that provoked the strike \u2014 could undermine the long-term business case for the budget brand. And they predict that it could force Air France-KLM to rely more heavily on profits from its intercontinental and premium-class services, which are under siege from cash-rich Middle Eastern competitors that are eagerly expanding into Europe.\u201cThe only thing the pilots seem to have achieved is to lose the company a lot of money,\u201d said Chris Tarry, an independent airline consultant in London.While the total financial costs of the strike are likely to take some weeks to tally, analysts said the group \u2014 which had been tantalizingly close to breaking even \u2014 would for 2014 almost certainly report a sixth consecutive year of losses.By curbing the Transavia plans, the pilots may have permanently relegated Air France-KLM, one of Europe\u2019s largest airline groups, to second-tier status on its home turf.\u201cThey\u2019ve gained a commitment from management to keep Transavia flying as a subscale business,\u201d Mr. Tarry said of the pilots.By expanding its network with new bases in the Mediterranean, Air France-KLM had hoped not only to reduce its labor costs \u2014 the pilots\u2019 primary fear \u2014 but also to secure a substantial presence for Transavia in Europe\u2019s most popular leisure destinations. Giving up that broader plan will handicap Transavia \u201cin what is the growth segment of the market\u201d in Europe, Mr. Tarry said, while also making it \u201cmore difficult to have an appropriate cost base.\u201dInstead, Air France-KLM has said that the \u20ac1 billion, or about $1.3 billion, that it had earmarked for investment in dozens of new planes and 1,000 new employees \u2014 including 250 pilots \u2014 across France, the Netherlands and southern Europe, will now be funneled primarily into France. Transavia operates a fleet of only 14 Boeing 737 jets from three French airports: Paris Orly, Lyon and Nantes.The French National Union of Airline Pilots, which represents about three-quarters of Air France\u2019s 3,800 pilots, has said that it supports the growth of Transavia in France because it is intent on saving, or even expanding, the number of French pilot jobs. But analysts said that by thwarting a European expansion \u2014 and by resisting a separate contract for Transavia pilots \u2014 the unions may have ultimately placed more Air France pilot jobs at risk.\u201cThere was little, if any, threat to Air France pilot employment from the expansion of bases outside France,\u201d said Shakeel Adam, a managing partner of Aviado Partners, a consulting firm in Frankfurt that specializes in airline restructuring. \u201cSo far, Transavia is a platform used to connect markets otherwise not flown by Air France, or to fly complementary off-peak services for the price-sensitive market.\u201dTransavia France, which flies to destinations like Lisbon; Istanbul; Barcelona, Spain; and Naples, Italy, is only about half the size of Transavia\u2019s Dutch operation. But its operating costs per seat remain higher. Air France-KLM has said that it hopes to reduce those costs by as much as 15 percent through increased economies of scale and by operating more frequent flights.But if Transavia\u2019s growth is constrained to France, it is almost inevitable that the low-cost brand will start to replace Air France on certain routes that are currently unprofitable.\u201cIn an ideal world, you would migrate all of your short-haul traffic\u201d to Transavia, Mr. Tarry said. But he predicted the company would probably resist such a wholesale shift to avoid diluting the brand images of both Air France and KLM, which still rely heavily on business passengers accustomed to a certain level of comfort, even on short flights.\u201cWhen full-service airlines replace services with low-cost carriers just to get to lower cost bases, it does not always work,\u201d said Mr. Adam of Aviado. Many airlines end up adding back frills like free baggage allowances to win back passengers, he said. \u201cSo costs don\u2019t drop as much as planned and revenues fall much further than imagined.\u201dStill unknown is whether Transavia will be able to compete profitably even for the budget-conscious flier in France \u2014 particularly if pilots and other unions cannot be persuaded to accept lower salaries and longer working hours.\u201cAt the end of the day, France is an attractive market,\u201d Mr. Tarry said, noting the rapidly growing presence of easyJet, a British carrier, which has a fleet of 25 aircraft based in half a dozen French airports. Ryanair, the Irish discount airline that has more passengers than any other European airline, flies to 28 French destinations, although it no longer bases staff members in the country, for cost reasons.Transavia aims to carry 20 million passengers a year on a fleet of 100 planes by 2017, which would be only a small fraction of the number carried by Ryanair and easyJet, which have more than 140 million passengers annually between them.\u201cHow material can that be in the end?\u201d Mr. Tarry said, referring to Transavia\u2019s potential contribution to Air France-KLM\u2019s bottom line.Doubling down on Transavia in France also assumes a degree of union cooperation and labor market flexibility that the country has until now been unable to deliver. \u201cThere are a lot of questions to be answered,\u201d Mr. Tarry said. \u201cWhat we know is that management has recognized where it wants to take the business, but so far the costs associated with that are too high.\u201d\u201cAt a certain point,\u201d he added, \u201cthere has to be a rendezvous with reality.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed Says Growth Lifts the Affluent, Leaving Behind Everyone Else", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Economic growth since the Great Recession has improved the fortunes of the most affluent Americans even as the incomes and wealth of most American families continue to decline, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.For the most affluent 10 percent of American families, average incomes rose by 10 percent from 2010 to 2013. For the rest of the population, average incomes were flat or falling.The new report, broadly consistent with other data on the aftermath of the Great Recession, underscores why so many Americans think the economy remains in poor health. While the pie has grown, most people are getting smaller slices.The result is that wealth also is increasingly concentrated. While overall wealth barely changed during the survey period, the money sloshed from the bottom toward the top. For the top 10 percent of families, ranked by income, estimated average wealth increased by 2 percent to $3.3 million. For the bottom 20 percent of families, average wealth sharply declined by 21 percent to $65,000.There is growing evidence that inequality may be weighing on economic growth by keeping money disproportionately in the hands of those who already have so much they are less inclined to spend it.But the trend so far has provoked little more than public outrage and political debate, in part because there is no agreement about the causes, let alone potential remedies. Some economists point to the impact of mechanization and foreign competition. Others say that legal changes have undermined the bargaining power of workers. Still others think the economy is suffering from a drought of lucrative innovations.The Fed\u2019s report said the widening income gap represented a reversion to a long-term trend that was disrupted by the recession. It said that the top 3 percent of families collected 30.5 percent of all income in 2013, up from 27.7 percent in 2010, but still slightly below their 31.4 percent share in 2007.The concentration of wealth continued without interruption, albeit at a slower pace during the recession. The Fed said that the top 3 percent of families held 44.8 percent of wealth in 1989, then 51.8 percent in 2007 and 54.4 percent in 2013.One signal of the growing divide is a decline in the share of families that hold assets. The share of families that directly own stock fell to 13.8 percent from 15.1 percent, the Fed found. The share of families with retirement accounts, savings bonds and life insurance also declined. Likewise, the share of families that owned homes, owned rental properties or had a stake in a business declined.In a more positive trend, debt burdens also fell. The debts of the average American family continued to exceed its annual income, but the ratio declined to 105 percent of income in 2013 from 125 percent of annual income in 2010. Importantly, the share of Americans probably struggling to pay those debts has also declined. Just 8.2 percent of households devoted more than 40 percent of income to debt payments in 2013, the lowest rate since the 1990s.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2014-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPutin\u2019s WayST. PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 Weeks after President Vladimir V. Putin annexed Crimea in March, an obscure regulatory board in Moscow known as the Market Council convened inside an office tower not far from the Kremlin to discuss the country\u2019s wholesale electricity market. It is a colossal business, worth 2 percent of Russia\u2019s gross domestic product, and a rich source of fees for the bank that had long held the exclusive right to service it.With no advance notice or public debate, though, the board voted that day in April to shift that business to Bank Rossiya, a smaller institution that lacked the ability to immediately absorb the work. For Bank Rossiya, it was a tidy coup set to yield an estimated $100 million or more in annual commissions, yet it was hardly the only new business coming in. State corporations, local governments and even the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea were suddenly shifting their accounts to the bank, too.In a matter of days, Bank Rossiya had received an enormous windfall, nearly all from different branches of the Russian state, which was delivering a pointed message. In late March, the United States had made Bank Rossiya a primary target of sanctions, effectively ostracizing it from the global financial system. Now the Kremlin was pushing back, steering lucrative accounts its way to reduce the pain. The reason the Kremlin rushed to prop up Bank Rossiya is the same reason that the United States, and later its European allies, placed it on the sanctions list: its privileged status as what the Obama administration calls the \u201cpersonal bank\u201d of the Putin inner circle. Built and run by some of the president\u2019s closest friends and colleagues from his early days in St. Petersburg, Bank Rossiya is emblematic of the way Mr. Putin\u2019s brand of crony capitalism has turned loyalists into billionaires whose influence over strategic sectors of the economy has in turn helped him maintain his iron-fisted grip on power.Now the sanctions are testing the resilience of his economic and political system. Even as President Obama argues that the measures aimed at Mr. Putin\u2019s inner circle are pinching Russia\u2019s economy and squeezing the tycoons who dominate it, many of them have mocked the sanctions as a mere nuisance, the economic equivalent of a shaving cut, while the Kremlin has moved rapidly to insulate them. Woven deeply into the Putin system is Bank Rossiya. Founded as the tiniest of banks in the twilight of the Soviet era, Bank Rossiya, through staggering, stealthy expansion backed by the largess of the state, now has nearly $11 billion in assets. It controls a vast financial empire with tentacles across the economy, including a large stake in the country\u2019s most powerful private media conglomerate, a key instrument of the Kremlin\u2019s power to shape public opinion. How well the bank survives in a time of sanctions may ultimately be a barometer of whether economic pressure is enough to make Mr. Putin stand down at a time when neighboring countries, especially in the Baltics, are increasingly anxious about a newly aggressive Russia. Mr. Putin came to power vowing to eliminate \u201cas a class\u201d the oligarchs who had amassed fortunes \u2014 and, to the new president\u2019s mind, a dangerous quotient of political sway \u2014 under his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, in the post-Communist chaos of the 1990s. Instead, a new class of tycoons have emerged, men of humble Soviet origins who owe their vast wealth to Mr. Putin, and offer unquestioning political fealty to him in return. \u201cThese guys emerged from scratch and became billionaires under Putin,\u201d Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy finance minister and central banker, said in a recent interview.If the modern Russian state is Kremlin Inc., Mr. Putin is its chief executive officer, rewarding his friends with control of state-owned companies and doling out lucrative government contracts in deals that provoke accusations of corruption but have the veneer of legality under the Putin system. \u201cHe has given and he has taken away,\u201d said Mikhail M. Kasyanov, who served as prime minister during Mr. Putin\u2019s first term. \u201cThey depend on him, and he depends on them.\u201dThis inner circle coalesced around Mr. Putin as he began his unobtrusive rise, from a middling career as a K.G.B. intelligence officer to a midlevel functionary in the office of St. Petersburg\u2019s mayor. One of these loyalists is Bank Rossiya\u2019s chairman and largest shareholder, Yuri V. Kovalchuk, a physicist by training, sometimes called the Rupert Murdoch of Russia for his role as architect of the bank\u2019s media interests. Other Bank Rossiya shareholders include several of the country\u2019s wealthiest men, the son of Mr. Putin\u2019s cousin and even an old St. Petersburg friend of his, a cellist who was formerly first chair at the fabled Mariinsky Theater.The Kremlin has long denied giving Mr. Putin\u2019s friends preferential treatment. But in acquiring many of its holdings, the privately held Bank Rossiya benefited from Kremlin directives that allowed it to purchase prize state-owned assets at what critics have called cut-rate prices. Meanwhile the true extent of its holdings is obscured by shadowy corporate shell structures that nest like matryoshka dolls, one inside the next. Records show that the ownership of one powerful television advertising company linked to Bank Rossiya, for example, is buried in offshore companies in Panama, in the British Virgin Islands and even at a simple concrete house on Karpathou Street in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, whose owner had no idea of the company registered there.In the early days of the conflict over Ukraine, several European leaders expressed deep ambivalence about alienating a Russia that under Mr. Putin\u2019s rule has become immeasurably wealthier than it ever was under the Soviet system. Russia has been a sought-after partner in the globalized economy, a source of cheap natural gas for Europe, where wealthy Russians have also purchased billions of dollars in real estate in places like the Cote d\u2019Azur and the Belgravia district of London. Gennady N. Timchenko, an oil trader and Bank Rossiya investor whose own holding company is also under sanctions, admitted in a recent interview with Itar-Tass to a measure of annoyance. He was unhappy that his Learjet had been grounded because of sanctions, and that he could not vacation in France with his family and dog, Romi, which happens to be the offspring of Mr. Putin\u2019s beloved black Labrador, Koni.And yet, he said, he would never presume to question the Russian president\u2019s policies in Ukraine, whatever the cost to companies like his. \u201cThat would be impossible,\u201d he said, going on to refer to Mr. Putin formally by his first name and patronymic. \u201cVladimir Vladimirovich acts in the interest of Russia in any situation, period. No compromises. It would not even enter our minds to discuss that.\u201d\u2018A Bouquet of Friends\u2019In the Kolomna district of St. Petersburg, near the shipyards, is a 19th-century palace that belonged to Grand Duke Aleksei Aleksandrovich, a son of Czar Aleksandr II. Lately its elegant halls \u2014 this one in Baroque style, this one English, this one Chinese \u2014 have been repurposed as the House of Music, a training academy for classical musicians.The academy\u2019s artistic director, Sergei P. Roldugin, has his own singular back story. He is an accomplished cellist and musical director. He is certainly not a businessman, he explained at the palace the other day. \u201cI don\u2019t have millions,\u201d he said. And yet, on paper at least, he has a fortune that could be worth $350 million. That is because, years ago, he said, he acquired shares in a small bank run by men close to his old friend Mr. Putin. He had met Mr. Putin in the 1970s, and is godfather to his eldest daughter, Maria. He opened the House of Music with Mr. Putin\u2019s patronage. Last year, he recalled, the president asked him for a favor: would he organize a private concert?So Mr. Roldugin traveled to the president\u2019s official residence west of Moscow, Novo-Ogaryovo, with three young musicians: a violinist, a pianist and a clarinetist. They played Mozart, Weber and Tchaikovsky \u2014 so well, he said, that Mr. Putin invited them to play again the next night for the same small group of friends who had gathered there.They were \u201cof course, very famous people,\u201d Mr. Roldugin said, without revealing any names. \u201cQuite all,\u201d he said, \u201care under sanctions.\u201dThe concerts are a glimpse into the small, remarkably cohesive group of men who came together around Mr. Putin as the old order was crumbling and a new, post-Soviet Russia was taking form. When the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, began to allow the first experiments in private enterprise in the 1980s, St. Petersburg was still Leningrad, an impoverished shadow of the czarist capital it had been. What brought Mr. Putin into their orbit was the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. After five years as a K.G.B. officer in East Germany, Mr. Putin was part of a wave of embittered military and intelligence officers who withdrew from the Soviet satellites and returned with few prospects to a changing homeland.The committee worked closely with Russia\u2019s emerging entrepreneurs, regulating imports and exports and distributing city contracts. Some of the deals became controversial, notably one during the hungry winter of 1991-92, of a deal to barter oil, metal and other products for food. Virtually none of the food ever materialized, and a City Council committee unsuccessfully sought to have Mr. Putin fired for incompetence. For all that, Mr. Putin was considered an efficient, unprepossessing administrator, helping businessmen cut through the bureaucracy. His fluency in German was useful with the many Germans seeking a foothold in the city. Among them was Matthias Warnig, formerly of the East German secret police, the Stasi, who opened one of the city\u2019s first foreign banks, Dresdner. Mr. Putin was, in short, both collecting new friends and laying the foundation for what would evolve into the system of personalized, state-sponsored capitalism now at the heart of his power. \u201cIt was a favorable environment for such a bouquet of friends to appear,\u201d explained Mikhail I. Amosov, who served on the City Council at the time. In many cases, contracts and property were distributed through insider deals, often without open or transparent bidding. \u201cEverything was decided through personal connections,\u201d Mr. Amosov said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t like it.\u201dOne enterprise that received an infusion of municipal aid was Bank Rossiya.The bank had been founded in 1990 at the initiative of the city\u2019s branch of the Communist Party, with party funds as capital. It was also believed to handle the banking needs of the K.G.B. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was all but bust.Mr. Kovalchuk stepped in. In December 1991, he and a group of friends secured a small loan from a local shoe manufacturer and bought the foundering bank. The investors included three other alumni of the Ioffe Technical Institute \u2014 the physicists Victor Y. Myachin and Andrei A. Fursenko, and Vladimir I. Yakunin, the institute\u2019s former head of international relations. The reconstituted Bank Rossiya quickly became a favored city institution. At the mayor\u2019s instruction, according to news reports, the city opened several large accounts there, fattening the bank\u2019s coffers and setting it on its way. Business connections became deeply personal connections. In 1996, Mr. Putin joined seven businessmen, most of them Bank Rossiya shareholders, in forming a cooperative of summer homes, or dachas, called Ozero, or \u201clake,\u201d in the northeast of St. Petersburg. The group has come to have an outsize influence on Russia\u2019s political and economic life. The cooperative included the homes of Mr. Putin, Mr. Yakunin, Mr. Kovalchuk, Mr. Fursenko and his brother Sergei, Mr. Myachin, and Nikolai T. Shamalov, who headed the St. Petersburg office of the German manufacturer Siemens and would also acquire a major stake in Bank Rossiya. Vladimir A. Smirnov, a St. Petersburg businessman with an exclusive contract to supply the city\u2019s gasoline retailers, served as Ozero\u2019s director.Mr. Timchenko, the oil trader, entered the Bank Rossiya circle as an investor; according to the bank, his stake is owned by a company he controls. Mr. Warnig, the German banker, would later join Bank Rossiya\u2019s board. (When Mr. Putin\u2019s wife was badly injured in a car accident, Mr. Warnig\u2019s bank arranged to pay for her medical care in Germany.) And there was Mr. Roldugin, the cellist. \u201cThe issue was that I needed to have some money,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThere was no money for art anywhere.\u201d His investment, he said, involved \u201ca lot of manipulations\u201d and required him to take out a loan. Today the bank lists him as owner of 3.2 percent of its shares. Mr. Putin\u2019s stint in St. Petersburg ended in 1996, when his boss lost his bid for re-election. Soon Mr. Putin had a new boss, President Yeltsin. And after Mr. Yeltsin unexpectedly elevated him to prime minister and then acting president on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1999, the fortunes of many of his friends \u2014 and their little bank \u2014 began to be transformed.\u2018Bank Rossiya, That\u2019s It\u2019He had arrived in Moscow as a midlevel apparatchik in ill-fitting suits, had ascended to power as a thoroughly unexpected president and won his first presidential election in 2000 on the crest of war to suppress separatists in Chechnya. By 2004, Mr. Putin had become the paramount figure in Russia, winning a second term with 72 percent of the vote, in a race tainted by allegations of strong-arm tactics and vote rigging. Yet Mr. Putin probably would have won a fair election easily, too. The Russian economy, buoyed by high oil prices, was booming, creating huge fortunes and also lifting the middle class. The long era of post-Soviet gloom seemed done.Not many people yet understood that in the middle of Russia\u2019s prosperity, the men in the tight circle close to Mr. Putin were becoming fabulously wealthy, and increasingly powerful, in what critics now consider a case study in legalized kleptocracy. Bank Rossiya, which reported less than $1 million in profits the year before Mr. Putin became president, had grown steadily, but figures like Mr. Kovalchuk and Mr. Timchenko remained in the shadows. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know such names \u2014 Timchenko, Kovalchuk,\u201d said Mr. Kasyanov, whom Mr. Putin dismissed as prime minister shortly before the elections.In sanctioning Bank Rossiya, the Obama administration would resurface the \u201ccashier\u201d allegation, though it offered no evidence that Mr. Putin has personally profited from the bank. Mr. Kovalchuk, who through a spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment, in the past has attributed his bank\u2019s success not to any special treatment but to sound investment and business decisions. Either way, Bank Rossiya\u2019s holdings would increase tenfold during Mr. Putin\u2019s second term. Critical to this remarkable growth was the bank\u2019s ability to snap up assets, at knockdown prices, that had previously belonged to the state-owned energy company Gazprom. Those deals were documented in a series of reports published at the end of Mr. Putin\u2019s second term by Boris Y. Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister, Vladimir V. Milov, a former deputy energy minister, and others. \u201cThe total value of the assets exfiltrated from Gazprom,\u201d they estimated, was $60 billion.An early deal involved one of the country\u2019s biggest insurers, Sogaz. Bank Rossiya bought a controlling stake in Sogaz by acquiring shares that had been held by Gazprom. The bank paid around $100 million, according to Mr. Nemtsov and Mr. Milov, who later valued Sogaz at $2 billion.\u201cPutin said, \u2018Bank Rossiya, that\u2019s it,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Milov later told the Russian edition of Forbes.It seemed to be a quintessential insider deal: The year before, Yuri Shamalov, son of the Bank Rossiya shareholder and Ozero member, had been appointed chairman of Gazfond. \u201cShamalov Jr., as head of Gazfond, sold shares in the company managing Russia\u2019s largest private pension fund at a fantastically low price to the bank owned by his father,\u201d Mr. Nemtsov asserted.At the same time, Mr. Kovalchuk, the bank\u2019s chairman, began assembling a media empire that now controls some of Russia\u2019s largest television and radio stations and newspapers. Bank Rossiya had already assumed management of the assets of Gazprombank, one of Russia\u2019s largest. Now, Gazprombank purchased Gazprom Media Group, which owns five television and several radio stations. The price: $166 million.Two years later, Dmitri A. Medvedev, a Putin prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and first deputy prime minister, put Gazprom Media\u2019s value at $7.5 billion, or 45 times the purchase price.Not content merely to manage media assets, Bank Rossiya began buying up media companies of its own. In 2005, a subsidiary of Bank Rossiya bought a stake in Channel 5, a local television network owned by the St. Petersburg government. The price was $25 million. There was no competition. Channel 5\u2019s value swelled in 2006, when regulators let it acquire frequencies in 30 regions across Russia. Soon after, Mr. Putin designated it a national broadcaster, able to reach 91 cities and 53 million people. Today, it is the country\u2019s fifth-largest broadcaster. A year later, a Bank Rossiya subsidiary bought a controlling stake in Ren TV, today the country\u2019s eighth-largest broadcaster.Once known for investigating government corruption and airing opposition views that were never allowed on state television, Ren TV over time became noticeably less critical.In August, amid the fervor over Ukraine, it canceled what was widely viewed as one of the last reasonably independent national political talk shows, \u201cNedelya,\u201d or \u201cThe Week.\u201d \u201cThe first goal was political control of the media,\u201d said Roman Pivovarov, a leading analyst of the Russian media landscape. \u201cBut that was achieved relatively early on. So this was as much about money. The picture today is clear, in that the big media belongs to the small circle of people who control not only the politics but the economics of Russia.\u201dBy 2008, Mr. Putin\u2019s second term was ending and the Bank Rossiya media empire provided a supportive voice when, rather than recede from politics, he decided to serve as prime minister. Mr. Medvedev was elected president, while Mr. Putin largely retained control over the levers of government. Two years later, Mr. Kovalchuk scored his biggest prize \u2014 a 25 percent stake in Channel 1, a state-controlled network with the largest audience in Russia. The stake cost only $150 million, \u201can amazingly low price,\u201d according to the newspaper Novaya Gazeta. The next year, Channel 1 reported profits of nearly $100 million.Then, in 2012, Mr. Putin announced he would seek a third term as president. Democracy activists were deeply alarmed but powerless. No one doubted he would win, though the economy had slowed and Mr. Putin\u2019s men were targets of rising criticism, no longer hidden. \u2018My Friends Get Everything\u2019To grasp how Bank Rossiya\u2019s holdings extend around the globe \u2014 and how island tax havens and other tools of global finance may serve to obscure their true breadth \u2014 one place to visit is 13A Karpathou Street in Nicosia. This is the registered address of Med Media Network Limited, a company listed in a corporate flow chart connecting Bank Rossiya to a company called Video International. In a peculiarity of the Russian marketplace, broadcasters do not sell advertising time directly. They act through middlemen like Video International, which buy airtime wholesale, then sell to those who wish to advertise. Med Media is a major shareholder, holding a 20 percent stake. Except that Med Media\u2019s address in Cyprus is hardly a corporate headquarters at all. It is a simple concrete home with a large ficus shading a small garden. The owner, Agathi Zinonos, has never heard of Med Media or any of the other companies registered there. She regularly receives legal documents in the mail from Russia, Bulgaria, Romania and other countries. \u201cEvery day, there is a whole packet coming,\u201d she said, noting that the documents are addressed to her son, who recently moved out. \u201cWhatever comes, I take to him, because it is a lot of companies.\u201dAttempting to unwind Video International\u2019s convoluted corporate structure requires going back to 2011. That is when Bank Rossiya and a couple of partners purchased the company, according to an interview given by Video International\u2019s chief executive in 2013. Video International had controlled 70 percent of the advertising-placement market. But in the months before the sale, the government hastily enacted a new antimonopoly law, prohibiting national television networks from using advertising shops that controlled more than 35 percent of the market. Video International would have to abandon many of its contracts. But what looked like a debacle for Video International turned out to be a boon for Bank Rossiya. The new law depressed the company\u2019s value \u2014 and thus its purchase price. And while Video International gave up many contracts, its new owners managed to profit from the \u201clost\u201d business: Many of the networks simply brought the placement business in house \u2014 while continuing to pay Video International consulting and software-licensing fees. Reflecting on the way the government\u2019s antimonopoly office has looked the other way, Mr. Aleksashenko, the former deputy finance minister, invoked the saying \u201cmy friends get everything, while my enemies get the law.\u201d Among those taking part in the new arrangement was CTC Media, a company with several television channels that was partially owned by a subsidiary of Bank Rossiya. CTC continues to pay Video International around $80 million a year \u2014 but as a consultant. Yet while the arrangement allowed Video International to maneuver around Russian law, it may actually have placed CTC at risk of violating American sanctions. For though CTC is a Russian broadcaster, its headquarters are in Delaware and it is traded on the Nasdaq. The sanctions prohibit American-headquartered companies like CTC from doing business with entities that are majority-owned by sanctioned companies like Bank Rossiya. Cyprus is one of the world\u2019s busiest offshore financial-service centers, with one of Europe\u2019s lowest corporate tax rates and laws that enable foreigners to incorporate companies within days. Nearly 270,000 companies are registered there, and many are shells created to shelter income while obscuring the real owners.Cypriot laws enable the true owners of shell companies to remain secret. Of the eight corporations with shares in Video International, at least five, with a combined stake of 69 percent, are incorporated in Cyprus: Med Media, Namiral Trading Limited, Devar Investments Limited, Reibruk Limited and Attalion Investments Limited. Delving into their ownership produces yet more corporate shells, headquartered in Panama and the British Virgin Islands, equally opaque jurisdictions. Cari N. Stinebower, who advises clients on sanctions compliance at the law firm of Crowell & Moring, called the web of shell companies a \u201cred flag.\u201d \u201cThe way the law works,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s incumbent on CTC to understand the beneficial ownership of the company they are doing business with\u201d to ensure that there is not \u201csome sanctioned entity at the end of the chain.\u201d A Video International spokesman would not reveal who was behind the shell companies, and said only that they had not been sanctioned. \u201cWhy is the shareholder structure specifically like that?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the shareholders decided so.\u201d A CTC official declined to say what if any due diligence the company had done to determine if it was violating the sanctions. But he said CTC was working with the Treasury Department to ensure that it complied with the law. \u2018A Medium-Sized Bank\u2019The day after Mr. Obama blacklisted Bank Rossiya, Mr. Putin met with his national security council. Told that a total of 20 people had also been sanctioned \u2014 including three security council members, Putin compatriots from St. Petersburg \u2014 the president turned sarcastic. \u201cWe should distance ourselves from them,\u201d he said, deadpan. \u201cThey compromise us.\u201dAs for Bank Rossiya, he went on: \u201cAs far as I recall, this is a medium-sized bank. Personally, I did not have an account there, but I will definitely open one on Monday.\u201d He later directed the presidential administration to begin depositing his official salary \u2014 roughly $7,500 a month \u2014 into a Bank Rossiya account.Mr. Kovalchuk later gave a rare television interview with Dmitry K. Kiselyov, a prominent news anchor and ardent defender of Mr. Putin\u2019s Russia. The president\u2019s public gesture, Mr. Kovalchuk said, had prompted a flood of new customers, including an old, impoverished woman who wanted to deposit her life savings. For a bank with billions in assets, \u201cthis old woman means nothing financially, but the fact is that is worth more than any financial investments,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a Putin factor, and it is unconditional. The fact is that people intuitively feel which side of the barricades business stands on.\u201dMr. Putin\u2019s efforts to protect the bank were not just symbolic. He ordered the Central Bank to provide assistance if needed. State-owned energy companies transferred accounts to Bank Rossiya, and the governors of St. Petersburg and the surrounding Leningrad region told state institutions in their jurisdictions to do the same, according to Russian news reports. Additionally, in the lower house of Parliament, the main party loyal to Mr. Putin provided the margin needed to rescind the law effectively limiting Video International to just 35 percent of the advertising-placement market.

But he declined to provide details, and Alfa Bank declined to comment.As the United States and Europe continue to ratchet up the economic pressure, it is an open question how long the government can continue to prop up the growing number of institutions faced with sanctions.

{"Headline": "In Afghanistan, Time for Compromise", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialHaving spent several weeks auditing ballots in Afghanistan\u2019s fraud-plagued presidential vote, election officials there are expected to declare a winner within days. If the two candidates vying for the post fail to reach a power-sharing deal beforehand, the announcement could easily kick off a wave of unrest that would all but guarantee a catastrophic wind-down to America\u2019s longest war. The window of opportunity to strike a compromise is narrowing dangerously. Without a new government in place, the Obama administration may well pull back on plans to keep a military contingent in Afghanistan beyond 2014, and without that force, the international community will cease bankrolling the impoverished nation. Abdullah Abdullah, the former foreign minister, not without reason, is fighting the outcome of an election in which his rival, former finance minister Ashraf Ghani, is widely expected to be declared the winner. Western officials say that the audit of millions of ballots cast on June 14 has made clear that the scope and sophistication of fraud was staggering even for Afghan standards. Having ceded another fraud-plagued election to President Hamid Karzai in 2009, Mr. Abdullah and his powerful backers are not willing to concede defeat in another corrupt election. But they ought to understand that they stand to lose far more by being intransigent. The Taliban are fighting hard to retake crucial urban areas, and the country\u2019s anemic economy is likely to collapse amid the uncertainty. The Obama administration, which had preferred to limit its involvement in the election, has sensibly offered a power-sharing structure under which the losing candidate, or a designee, would hold a chief executive position with considerable authority. A senior American official said that Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah appear close to signing off formally on the deal, but they remain at odds over just how much power the losing candidate would wield. One sticking point is whether ministers would report to the chief executive, rather than to the president. Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah have displayed considerable pragmatism in recent weeks as the electoral dispute has dragged on, raising hopes that they could in fact govern jointly. This week, the two men sent a letter to NATO leaders meeting in Wales, pledging that they are committed to forming a \u201cgovernment of national unity that will honor the epic participation of our people in the electoral process.\u201d The message shows that both men understand continued international support to be indispensable for the fledgling state they aspire to lead. A solution to the government crisis will take more than pragmatism, though. Both candidates must rein in their most reactionary constituents and work hard to manage expectations in the days ahead. The power-sharing deal will need to be detailed, clear and public to reduce the temptation for the winner to sideline his rival after taking office. In this crisis, the Obama administration has had to take on a broker\u2019s role. It must remain engaged and patient in helping the Afghans avert the chaos of a government rived by ethnic or sectarian divisions. The alternative could look much like Iraq\u2019s unraveling. Except in Afghanistan, it would almost certainly come quicker. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Benefits of Easing Climate Change", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic SceneOn Tuesday, more than 100 world leaders gathered at the United Nations to open a climate summit meeting that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hopes will provide momentum to a new round of negotiations toward a global environmental agreement to be signed in Paris next year.You\u2019re forgiven if you hold your applause. World leaders have been trying without success to cut such a deal for almost two decades, crashing time and again into the fear that slowing the emissions of carbon that are inexorably changing the climate carries an economic cost that few are willing to bear.This time, though, advocates come armed with a trump card: All things considered, the cost of curbing carbon emissions may be considerably cheaper than earlier estimates had suggested. For all the fears that climate change mitigation would put the brakes on growth, it might actually enhance it.Whether this can tip the balance toward the global grand bargain that has eluded world leaders so many times depends on a couple of things. The first is to what extent it is true. The second is whether this is, in fact, the issue that matters most to the people making the decisions.\u201cThere is now huge scope for action which can both enhance growth and reduce climate risk,\u201d it reads. Efficient investments could deliver at least half of the emission cuts needed by 2030 to keep global temperatures in check. And they could do so while delivering extra economic gains on the side.At first blush, the proposition that replacing fossil fuel with more expensive energy could produce a net economic gain seems implausible. Until now, even many supporters of tough action accepted the idea that there would be a necessary price to pay initially to achieve the long-term goal of avoiding catastrophic climate change.But the new thinking turns that on its head by taking more careful account of the hidden benefits of mitigating climate change.\u201cThe cost of action is well known,\u201d said Helen Mountford, director of economics at the World Resources Institute, which worked on the \u201cNew Climate Economy\u201d report. \u201cThe co-benefits, like reduced health costs, are less known.\u201dThis finding does not depend on any technological breakthroughs. It happens whether solar energy is cheap or expensive.\u201cIt\u2019s only recently that policy makers are beginning to appreciate the power of fiscal instruments like environmental taxes,\u201d Mr. Parry told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only fairly recently that we\u2019ve been able to value the health and other environment impacts so we\u2019ve only recently got some sense of the substantial and pervasive undercharging for environmental damages.\u201dWhile this is all theory, some empirical research also supports the finding.Could this new understanding change the debate over climate change?At the very least, the belief that there is a climate-related free lunch out there might provide welcome harmony to negotiations that usually end in acrimonious finger-pointing. The new research might even help move the debate away from the failed strategy of seeking legally binding emissions targets on every country, providing a blueprint for countries to voluntarily take on ambitious goals because it is in their own self-interest regardless of what other nations do.For even if every country reaped net benefits from embracing a low-carbon development path, governments still must allocate costs and benefits within individual economies, mediating between winners and losers.\u201cHealth is a social benefit that is not included in the accounts of private investors,\u201d noted Zou Ji, deputy director of China\u2019s National Center for Climate Change Strategy, a research institute affiliated with the government\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission. \u201cBut abatement costs will be felt by private investors.\u201dNavigating these distributional issues will be tricky. Getting it wrong can be expensive. For instance, Mr. Parry and his co-researchers found that if carbon revenue was not used to reduce other income taxes, the net gain from a carbon tax evaporated and became a net cost.Germany \u2014 perhaps the country most committed to developing an economy powered with renewable energy \u2014 has struggled with the trade-offs. First it exempted its export-oriented, energy-intensive industries from the surcharges levied to pay for subsidies to solar and wind generators. More recently, alarmed at the rising cost of power, it has begun reducing its subsidies for renewables, which has led to a drop in the rollout of solar power.So maybe it\u2019s no surprise that few countries have been willing, at least so far, to commit to take the promised high growth/low carbon path.Last July, Australia\u2019s newly installed conservative government repealed the carbon tax introduced by the Labor government before it, and the country\u2019s carbon emissions quickly shot up.\u201cIf the Chinese and the Indians found it much more economically efficient to build out solar, nuclear and wind, why are they still building all these coal plants?\u201d asked Ted Nordhaus, chairman of the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank focused on development and the environment.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Chinese and the Indians are stupid,\u201d Mr. Nordhaus told me. \u201cThey are looking at their indigenous energy resources and energy demand and making fairly reasonable decisions.\u201dFor them, combating climate change does not look at all like a free lunch.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kansas Governor Hopefuls Hurl Barbs in First Debate", "Date": "2014-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUTCHINSON, Kan. \u2014 Debating for the first time in a tight governor\u2019s race, the two major candidates offered few specifics on their visions for the state, but lobbed sharp attacks at one another Saturday before a feisty crowd at the Kansas State Fair that seemed befitting of a football game.Sam Brownback, the Republican incumbent caught in a tough battle despite his state\u2019s deep conservatism, and Paul Davis, the largely unknown Democratic challenger and state representative who is enjoying the benefit of the governor\u2019s unpopularity, often had to shout into microphones to be heard over the heckles of their detractors. Mr. Brownback called Mr. Davis the Nancy Pelosi of Kansas, and Mr. Davis noted that the last person Mr. Brownback supported for president was now under indictment in Texas, referring to that state\u2019s governor, Rick Perry. The governor, who enacted some of the largest income tax cuts in the state\u2019s history, tried to portray a state pointed in the right direction and paint his opponent as a liberal who would support President Obama.For his part, Mr. Davis tried to present himself as a centrist and took every opportunity to say that the governor was bankrupting the state and hurting vital services like education.\u201cThis is where the election starts,\u201d said Mike O\u2019Neal, a Brownback supporter who is the president of the Kansas Chamber of Commerce. The race so far has been much more difficult for Mr. Brownback than he might have expected. Four years ago, he swept into office with more than 60 percent of the vote in a state where Republicans far outnumber Democrats, where Mr. Obama is highly unpopular and where conservative Republicans control both chambers of the legislature.Yet several polls have shown Mr. Davis, the minority leader in the state\u2019s House of Representatives, with a slight lead over Mr. Brownback. The governor\u2019s campaign appeared so troubled by the polls that it recently took the unusual step of releasing an internal survey that showed Mr. Brownback holding a one-point advantage, 43 percent to 42 percent. Typically, campaigns only release their own polling data when it slants a narrative significantly in their favor, but few would claim that a one-point lead would be great news for Mr. Brownback. Kansas political observers say that much of Mr. Davis\u2019s success has come from anti-Brownback sentiment, which stems largely from divisive legislation passed on the governor\u2019s watch. Mr. Brownback sought to shift that focus from the start of the debate.\u201cEverything you\u2019ve heard from Representative Davis is wrong,\u201d he said in his opening statement. Mr. Brownback went on to tout the state\u2019s low unemployment rate and the work he had done on education. He veered into a rather esoteric discussion, saying he supported rural schools and Mr. Davis did not \u2014 and in doing so, the governor\u2019s voice rose like a preacher\u2019s, and his supporters sprung to their feet and cheered.\u201cI say no forced consolidation of rural schools,\u201d Mr. Brownback exhorted.Mr. Brownback\u2019s campaign later released a statement saying the governor vowed to fight for rural schools, clearly trying to draw a line between himself and Mr. Davis, who is from Lawrence, the home of the University of Kansas and perhaps the most liberal region in the state.In some ways, the debate was Mr. Davis\u2019s first chance to introduce himself to the voters. And he immediately sought to distance himself from the \u201cLawrence liberal\u201d moniker that opponents have given him.\u201cI\u2019m a moderate, common-sense leader, an independent thinker,\u201d Mr. Davis said to open the debate. As the son of two teachers and with a child nearing kindergarten, Mr. Davis tried to position himself as the candidate who values public education. He has criticized Mr. Brownback for passing deep income tax cuts while schools were underfunded.The amphitheater hosting the debate amid the smells of grilled meat and deep-fried food was packed to the top as supporters waved signs, yelled out sports chants (\u201cI believe that we will win!) and wore T-shirts backing their candidates.Both men were plain-spoken, pointed and short with their responses. They played to the roaring crowd. Mr. Brownback wore a navy-blue blazer over a shirt with a gold tie, and Mr. Davis wore a shirt that matched the blue sky, with the top button undone. Both men sliced the air with their hands during their responses. With each question, they tried to circle back to their main attack points \u2014 Mr. Davis saying that the governor had created a fiscal mess, and Mr. Brownback painting his opponent as a proxy for Mr. Obama.Answering a question about supporting the state\u2019s agricultural economy, Mr. Davis spoke of the difficulty of addressing such issues \u201cwhen your state is in $1.3 billion of debt, and that is exactly where the governor\u2019s economic experiment has taken us.\u201dMr. Brownback started his answer by saying, \u201cI have some concerns for the agriculture industry, and a lot of it comes from the Obama administration,\u201d drawing a chorus of groans from Davis supporters.The most pointed exchange came moments later when Mr. Davis turned to the governor and asked if he would support a renewable-energy standard in the state, which would require more green energy from power companies.\u201cI supported it a lot more than you did,\u201d Mr. Brownback fired back as supporters for both candidates cheered while the men spoke over each other. Mr. Davis continued to press the governor on whether he would veto a bill that eliminated the standard, while the governor went on about waiting for a bill to reach his desk, their voices drowned out by the clamor of the crowd.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind Quaint Exterior Beats State-of-Art Heart", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTexas MonthlySuch a high-tech interior is hard to imagine within the Spanish colonial facade of an arena that originally opened in 1926 as Municipal Auditorium. The flexible floor is \u201cthe only one of that type,\u201d said Mark Reddington, a partner at LMN Architects and the Tobin Center\u2019s lead designer. \u201cWe could do a corporate breakfast or lunch, push the button, the seats pop back up, and do a concert that night,\u201d said Mike Fresher, the center\u2019s president and chief executive.The Tobin Center spent seven years in development and opened on Sept. 4 with an evening of performances from the city\u2019s ballet, symphony and opera companies. \u201cSan Antonio is the largest city in the country without a performing arts center,\u201d Mr. Fresher said. \u201cUntil now.\u201d The building was repurposed through an unusual public-private partnership. \u201cI\u2019ve been told it\u2019s never been done in the history of San Antonio,\u201d said J. Bruce Bugg Jr., founder and chairman of the Bexar County Performing Arts Center Foundation. The foundation gave architects three challenges: to preserve Municipal Auditorium\u2019s iconic limestone facade, to install top-notch acoustics and to integrate the San Antonio River into the facility, which sits on the River Walk. The architects, Marmon Mok of San Antonio and LMN Architects of Seattle, met the challenges while including elements like the flexible floor and an automated sound-absorbing curtain system. The building\u2019s two original rotundas, at the east and west corners of the main entrance, were kept, while the interior was updated. \u201cDo you remember in the 1980s when people would take carpet and glue it on the wall?\u201d Mr. Bugg said, recalling what the rotundas looked like when Municipal Auditorium changed hands in 2008. \u201cWe didn\u2019t preserve that d\u00e9cor, let me just put it that way.\u201d The Tobin Center is outfitted with color-changing LED lights, which decorate the aluminum veil that adorns the building\u2019s exterior and illuminate the perforated wood panels in the H-E-B Performance Hall.When the floor is not flat, the hall seats 1,759, with no seat more than 143 feet from the stage. \u201cI think what the hall creates is this synergy between the audience and the stage,\u201d said Sebastian Lang-Lessing, the San Antonio Symphony\u2019s conductor. \u201cIt is really the first time in the history of the San Antonio Symphony that we have a hall with the proper acoustics,\u201d Mr. Lang-Lessing said, \u201cbut at the venue where the orchestra was founded 75 years ago.\u201dIn addition to the Performance Hall, two other spaces are available for the 10 artistic groups that call the Tobin Center home \u2014 the Carlos Alvarez Studio Theater, which can seat 250 to 350 people, and the River Walk Plaza, which can seat 600 and accommodate 1,600 people in all. \u201cI think the Tobin Center is going to be a huge economic generator for San Antonio,\u201d Mr. Bugg said. \u201cNot only will it support the creative economy that already exists, but it\u2019s going to augment the opportunities to bring other activities to San Antonio.\u201d Graham Weston, a founder of the web hosting company Rackspace and a Tobin Center donor, agreed. \u201cMost recruiters these days are selling two products: their company and their city,\u201d Mr. Weston wrote by email. \u201cEspecially if you are in the technology sector, people want to move to a city that has unique cultural options.\u201d The Tobin Center is already attracting big-name acts \u2014 Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jason Mraz and Trace Adkins all played on the first weekend \u2014 and 444 events were booked from Sept. 4 and June 30, 2015. \u201cSan Antonio is still searching a bit for where they fit in the cultural landscape that is Texas,\u201d Mr. Fresher, the Tobin Center\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cThere\u2019s much more to do before we can say where we are with the cultural arts in San Antonio, but building a world-class, $203 million building is certainly a good start.\u201d Recruiting Paul McCartney to play the opening benefit on Oct. 1 was, too. \u201cMcCartney in a 1,750 seat hall,\u201d Mr. Fresher said. \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous.\u201dNicole Beckley is a writer based in Austin.

{"Headline": "The Source of New York\u2019s Greatness", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorSuch anniversaries may typically be of interest only to antiquarians, but the occasion resonates so sharply against the backdrop of recent events \u2014 the widening divide in American politics, racial and religious intolerance at home and abroad \u2014 that reflecting on it might provide a useful perspective on the principles that made us who we are today.From the moment it was so named, New York City began its ascent as part of England\u2019s expanding empire. Then again, to say that Sept. 8 is New York\u2019s birthday is misleading, for it became a uniquely dynamic place, the model of a modern city, because of what it had been before the English took over. In founding New Amsterdam in the 1620s, the Dutch planted the seeds for the city\u2019s remarkable flowering. Specifically, the Dutch brought two concepts that became part of New York\u2019s foundation: tolerance of religious differences and an entrepreneurial, free-trading culture.In the 17th century, when it was universally held elsewhere in Europe that a strong society required intolerance as official policy, the Dutch Republic was a melting pot. The Dutch codified the concept of tolerance of religious differences, built a vast commercial empire and spawned a golden age of science and art in part by turning the \u201cproblem\u201d of their mixed society into an advantage. Dutch tolerance was transplanted to Manhattan: They were so welcoming that a reported 18 languages were spoken in New Amsterdam at a time when its population was only about 500.While many economies elsewhere in Europe were still feudal, the Dutch pioneered an economic system based on individual ownership of real estate. That came about because the Dutch provinces occupied a vast river delta, in which land was at or below sea level and therefore constantly under threat. People in those communities banded together to build dams and dikes and reclaim land. The new land was not owned by a king or a church. Instead, the people who had created it divided it and began buying and selling parcels. That incentivized a whole society, fueled the growth of an empire, turned the Dutch into entrepreneurs and made them the envy of other Europeans.This new economic mind-set likewise got transferred to New Amsterdam, where everyone was a trader, an entrepreneur. The port became so efficient that even archrivals in the English colony of Virginia sent their goods to Europe via what would become the New York harbor. The nonaristocratic, egalitarian bent of the Dutch also gave society on Manhattan a uniquely upwardly mobile character, distinct from that of, say, Boston. Who you were mattered less than what you could do.But England was on the rise. The people who took control of Manhattan realized quickly that a unique society had formed there, and kept its features in place. As part of a newly energized commercial empire that was to span the globe, New York, with its pluralistic, business-savvy and upwardly mobile society, rose to unimagined heights.The concepts of tolerance and free trade both related to a new appreciation of the individual. New York was born alongside the world-historic force of liberalism, a philosophy that prized individual freedom above all else. What is little appreciated, though, is the grounding of individualism in collectivism. It was the Dutch agreement to work together for the common good of holding back the sea that allowed for the rise of prosperity and a society based on singular achievement.The Dutch maintained the balance between the individual and the collective out of necessity, for water management continued \u2014 and continues to this day \u2014 to be vital to protecting their country. Funnily enough, because of climate change, the rest of us are all in that same place today. We don\u2019t just need to rebuild infrastructure to guard against flooding. We need to embrace concepts like regional planning, to acknowledge that there are issues in which individual and even municipal autonomy have to be sacrificed to the greater good.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Prepares to Offer Low-Cost Checking Accounts", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere comes Wal-Bank. After years of thwarted efforts to break into banking, Walmart is making its biggest foray yet into everyday financial services. Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, is teaming up with Green Dot, known for its prepaid payment cards, to supply checking accounts to almost anyone over 18 who passes an ID check.Daniel Eckert, senior vice president at Walmart, said on Tuesday that the accounts would be available nationwide by the end of October. The accounts are intended to be low-cost alternatives to traditional bank checking accounts, with no fees for overdrafts or bounced checks and no minimum account balance. In comparison, a basic checking account at Citibank charges $12 if a check is returned and $34 for overdrafts.The new accounts from Green Dot, called GoBank, will cost $8.95 a month if they have direct deposits totaling less than $500 a month. Mr. Eckert said that most people on Social Security or fixed pensions would qualify. GoBank, as the service is known, is part of Walmart\u2019s long-running push into financial services for people with little or no access to traditional banking. In recent years, many banks have reduced services to those with weak credit. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an estimated 10 million households in the United States do not use a bank. Consumer advocates say that many people without checking accounts are forced into the financial hinterlands, where they have little choice but to turn to costly alternatives for basic transactions. Fees for these services can quickly add up, making saving even more difficult.In an uneven economic recovery, Walmart is also pushing to win back customers it is losing to lower-price retailers, from T.J.Maxx to dollar stores like Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. On Tuesday, the NPD Group, a market research company, said dollar stores were seeing the largest increase among brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201cTheir core consumer, the lower-end consumer, is faring disproportionately poorly in the overall economy,\u201d said Faye Landes, retail analyst at Cowen, an investment management group. \u201cSo anything they can do to get them back from the dollar stores and back in their own stores makes total sense.\u201dWalmart has been eyeing financial services for some time. Two years ago, the company announced a partnership with American Express to offer a prepaid card and debit accounts. Retailers like Target and 7-Eleven also offer prepaid cards.But the new Walmart initiative will be the first full-blown, off-the-shelf checking account. To help attract customers, Walmart and Green Dot will forgo a screening system many banks use to vet potential customers and rely instead on a proprietary system. The model is expected to allow almost any consumer who passes an identification check to open an account in minutes, according to Green Dot.In the past, Walmart has tried to secure a federal bank charter to become a deposit-taking bank, but abandoned that effort in 2007 in the face of opposition from the banking industry. Since then, the retailer has assembled an array of services that could be offered without a charter, as well as partnerships with financial service companies like Green Dot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Willing to Sue When Cause Is Yours", "Date": "2014-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneRoss Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for the Tribune.Change the target, and that strategy could be straight out of Ralph Nader\u2019s playbook \u2014 or the game plan of anyone trying to use the courts to change the way things work.Taking a powerful foe to court is part of the American bedrock. But it can be jarring to a political movement built around restraining the legal system to spawn a collection of officeholders eager to use the courts to get their way.Texas is suing the federal government over a variety of matters, including air quality, health care, banking regulation and money for education. School districts are suing the state. The governor has hired trial lawyers who specialize in civil law to defend him against criminal indictments in Travis County.The groups that pushed to limit lawsuits against business apparently have no problem with all of this litigation. They are still contributing to those campaigns, still railing against the trial lawyers and still fighting for their cause.Wars between lawyers and executives are not new, but the recent history hit a high mark with George W. Bush\u2019s campaign for governor 20 years ago. The lawyer-bashing was cresting just as he did, a convergence that gave him one part of a four-pronged campaign platform (he proposed to \u201creform\u201d civil justice, education, juvenile justice and welfare) and that served as a business attack on trial lawyers, who were disproportionately generous campaign donors to Democrats like Gov. Ann Richards, Mr. Bush\u2019s opponent in 1994.The reformers wanted to make it harder to file some civil lawsuits and to constrain practices that they thought had been abused or were unfair or that regularly put them at a disadvantage. The law was reworked to limit the liability of defendants when more than one party was responsible in a lawsuit. Certain kinds of venue shopping, when lawyers try to steer cases to favorable courts, was restricted.The list of civil justice legislation from Mr. Bush\u2019s first session as governor was long, but the political message was clear: The proponents of change were trying to control civil lawsuits and the trial lawyers who filed them.The civil justice lobby is still around, still in possession of real political money and influence, through lobbying, candidate recruitment and political action committees. In many conservative circles, \u201ctrial lawyer\u201d remains a slur.While it does not have the punch it had when Mr. Bush took office, the sentiments behind it \u2014 especially the political rhetoric that came with the movement \u2014 are marbled into the Republican value system.Part of the 2014 platform of the state Republican Party says: \u201cWe believe that a favorable business climate and strong economy emerges when government is limited by low taxation, sensible regulation and tort reform.\u201dA similar chestnut has long been a part of Mr. Perry\u2019s stump speech (this quote is from a 2011 talk at the Iowa State Fair): \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist. You don\u2019t have to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand that you have to keep the taxes low, have a regulatory climate that\u2019s fair and predictable and you have a legal system that doesn\u2019t allow for over-suing.\u201dThat is the same Rick Perry who, in 2013, appointed Tony Buzbee, the kind of trial lawyer that makes the self-styled tort reformers grind their teeth, to the Texas A&M Board of Regents.

{"Headline": "Bank of England Resists Change to Interest Rate", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 To raise or not to raise, that is the question \u2014 in Britain, at least.On Thursday, nearly a month after two monetary policy makers at the Bank of England broke ranks from the majority and voted to raise interest rates, the central bank voted again to keep rates at historically low levels.Britain\u2019s central bank said it would keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009, as officials try to balance Britain\u2019s economic recovery against anemic wage growth and a muddied geopolitical picture.The bank also left unchanged a stimulus program of holding 375 billion pounds, or about $617 billion, in government bonds that it has purchased over the past five years.The Bank of England had not been expected to act, but minutes from the meeting in August showed that two members of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee had voted to raise rates, the first dissenting votes since Mark J. Carney became the bank\u2019s governor in 2013.The panel members who cast the dissenting votes, Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, cited strong employment growth, underscoring the sentiments of those who say that emergency measures put in place to reignite the British economy are no longer needed.The International Monetary Fund expects Britain to be the fastest-growing country among the Group of 7 advanced economies this year. Others see a potential rate increase as a threat to Britain\u2019s recovery, citing low wage growth and a rising tide of external risks.Dominic Bryant, a senior economist at BNP Paribas, wrote on Wednesday: \u201cDespite the buildup in global geopolitical risks (something that may be tempered if the cease-fire announced earlier today in Ukraine holds), U.K. data remain robust.\u201dGrowth looks strong, Mr. Bryant suggested, putting interest rates increasingly at odds with economic developments. A 25-basis-point rise in November to 0.75 percent \u201cis therefore more likely than the market thinks,\u201d he predicted.The votes in August to raise rates were particularly notable considering what some analysts say are mixed messages from Mr. Carney, who said this year that rate increases would come sooner than the market expected and then appeared to retract those sentiments as economic indicators pointed to a more mixed growth picture.While the economy has surged forward and employment has risen, wage growth has been weak. The housing market, once the great fear and then red-hot, appears to have slowed as geopolitical risks have risen.Recent economic data for Britain and Europe underscored the complex picture. Strong British service-sector and construction data contrasted with weaker manufacturing data, as exports were hurt by stresses in the eurozone.\u201cThe U.K.'s recovery is lopsided again but it has not lost pace, yet,\u201d said Robert Wood, the chief Britain economist at Berenberg Bank. Mr. Wood predicts an increase in February of 25 basis points, which he said would be unlikely to hurt the economy\u2019s expansion.The British services sector showed strong growth, with the Markit/CIPS index rising to 60.5 in August, up from 59.1 in July. Any score above 50 indicates expansion. It was the sharpest rise in business activity in the services sector since October. A similar survey by Markit suggested that growth in the eurozone\u2019s services and manufacturing sectors had slowed.On Aug. 7, the committee at the Bank of England voted 7 to 2 to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a low of 0.5 percent. Members of the committee had been unanimous since July 2011 in their monthly votes to keep rates unchanged.\u201cFor two members, in particular, economic circumstances were sufficient to justify an immediate rise in bank rate,\u201d the committee minutes said. \u201cThese members noted that the continuing rapid fall in unemployment alongside survey evidence of tightening in the labor market created a prospect that wage growth would pick up.\u201dIn the bank\u2019s quarterly Inflation Report in August, the bank predicted that the British economy would grow at a pace of 3.5 percent in 2014, slightly ahead of its forecast in May. For 2015, the bank maintained its estimate of 2.9 percent growth.The central bank said that it expected inflation to be 1.9 percent by the end of the year, up slightly from its May projection of 1.8 percent, both hugging the target of 2 percent. Inflation would remain at slightly lower levels for 2015 and 2016, the bank said. Annual inflation reached 1.9 percent at the end of June, up from 1.5 percent in May.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In California Governor\u2019s Race, the Risks of Running a Low-Risk Campaign", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySACRAMENTO \u2014 When the one-and-only scheduled debate in the California race for governor came to its end Thursday evening, the moderator, remarking on how spirited it had been, suggested that Gov. Jerry Brown, the Democrat, agree to another.No way. \u201cI think we have exposed the differences,\u201d Mr. Brown said after an uncomfortable pause. \u201cThis kind of format you can play over and over again.\u201dBut voters were given little idea of what a second Brown term \u2014 which polling suggests is fairly certain \u2014 would look like, in keeping with Mr. Brown\u2019s studious attempt to pretend there is not a campaign going on. Indeed, when he was asked what he might do over the next four years to tackle rising pension costs, he responded in the vaguest of terms.In many ways, the campaign that Mr. Brown is running is politically conventional and arguably smart. Strong incumbents have little incentive to take risks or do anything that might draw attention to little-known challengers.But some analysts suggest that such a campaign does a disservice to voters and contributes to the increasing alienation many people feel to the political process; already, voter turnout in parts of California is notoriously low. Running on a platform of nothing in particular can put a candidate in a position of taking a second term with little authority to claim any kind of mandate or guidance from voters.And there is reason to think a second Brown term would not be quite as easy as the first. Because of term limits, he would be a lame duck, and, as a rule, his authority would begin to diminish as a new generation of Democratic leaders who have been waiting for Mr. Brown \u2014 and for that matter, this state\u2019s two elder Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein \u2014 to step aside begin circling. At 76, Mr. Brown is seeking his second consecutive term as governor; the state\u2019s term limits bar him from serving a third.\u201cI think he\u2019ll avoid laying out a vision,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who was a senior adviser to Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican here. \u201cAbsent another debate to push him in that direction or a well-funded opponent to do the same, my guess is he\u2019ll stick to the formula of having delivered on 2010 promises.\u201dThere is little indication that Mr. Brown is overly concerned about that. He is a highly pragmatic politician and, from that perspective, there is little reason to keep debating.\u201cThere are not going to be more debates,\u201d said Dan Newman, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Brown. \u201cAs Mr. Kashkari pointed out, Jerry Brown has been in the public eye for a long while and has been governing right now. It\u2019s not about sloganeering and rhetoric. You can watch him do that job, which is the best way to figure out he\u2019ll do the job.\u201dBy way of examples, Mr. Newman said, Mr. Brown would in the months ahead campaign heavily for two initiatives before voters: one creating a rainy-day fund to give California fiscal protection during the inevitable bust of its boom-and-bust cycles, and another authorizing the borrowing of $7.5 billion to pay for water construction projects.The debate made clear the choice Californians have. Mr. Kashkari, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Treasury official, stared unblinkingly into a camera as he portrayed Mr. Brown\u2019s governorship as a failure and painted California as a state with a crippling business environment, staggering poverty and some of the worst public schools and prisons in the nation.\u201cHis 40 years in government have left him out of touch with California middle-class families,\u201d Mr. Kashkari said of Mr. Brown. \u201cToday our schools are ranked 45th out of the 50 states. We are No. 1 in poverty.\u201dMr. Brown responded with an aggressive account of a successful term in office. He said California\u2019s economy had greatly improved, partisan bickering in Sacramento had ended, and the state had moved out of a severe deficit and was beginning to pay down its long-term debt.\u201cHe likes to make the construct that we\u2019re not making progress,\u201d Mr. Brown said of his opponent. \u201cWell, we are making progress. A lot of people forget the mess California was in just four years ago.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Usually, the phones would ring with Russians booking rooms, villas, even helicopters. But the phones suddenly went quiet.Not to worry.\u201cFor a few days, there was a pause, and business looked like it was slowing down,\u201d said Paolo Corchia, owner of the Hotel President, one of the town\u2019s most elegant hotels, and president of the regional hotel association. \u201cBut then business went back to normal.\u201dIf normal can be defined as one shop selling violet-colored crocodile-skin loafers for 1,690 euros, or about $2,200. Or simple beach canopies that rent for up to \u20ac250 a day just to reserve 10 square feet of shaded sand. Or aviation companies that rent helicopters to take Russian shoppers on day trips to Monte Carlo for \u20ac4,450.Russian money is so important that even as European leaders are taking a tougher line with Mr. Putin, none want to damage the broader economic ties with measures that go beyond targeted sanctions.Unlike the days when Russians were cloistered behind the Iron Curtain, today they are so ensconced in Europe that more punitive steps would be likely to inflict the greater damage on still-weak European economies.That is so especially, but not only, in Italy. Like Germany, Italy is a major consumer of Russian natural gas, but ties go far beyond energy. Once a favorite summer spot of Italian industrialists, Forte dei Marmi has survived the economic downturn since 2008 largely because of Russian money.Russian tourism has grown rapidly in Italy, increasing by 25 percent in 2013 alone. According to Italy\u2019s Foreign Ministry, 747,000 Russians visited Italy in 2013, while 52,000 Italians visited Russia. Russians are also roughly tied with Japanese as the biggest spenders among tourists, averaging \u20ac150 to \u20ac175 a day, roughly $195 to $225, according to Italy\u2019s Foreign Ministry.Before the Ukraine crisis, the two countries had declared 2014 as the year of Russia-Italy cross-tourism \u2014 a campaign whose timing has turned out to be awkward, at best. Italy\u2019s tourism agency was participating in a trade show in Moscow when Russia annexed Crimea. New direct flights were started from Italy\u2019s Adriatic coast to different Russian cities to attract middle-class tourists, even as Forte dei Marmi continued to lure the Russian superrich to the Mediterranean coast.\u201cHere, it is beautiful, safe, clean, comfortable, equipped with boat and yacht rentals \u2014 and full of elegant people,\u201d explained Irina Krassiouk, a native of Moscow who has lived in Italy for 23 years and manages one of the private beach clubs lining the shore. In August, Ms. Krassiouk organized a fashion show for Russian clients, with contestants from the Miss Italy pageant prowling a catwalk in furs. Guests also were allowed to browse Ferraris, Maseratis, jewelry and other luxury Italian goods.\u201cNow that Russia is closing its relations with Europe, I imagine it\u2019s hard to have Italian products there,\u201d Ms. Krassiouk said. \u201cIf they come here, my clients will know where to find them.\u201dRussians have been coming to Forte dei Marmi for two decades and have steadily reshaped to their own tastes what was once a quiet, elegant beach village for the Italian elite. Locals describe a real estate frenzy that became so crazed a decade ago that Russian buyers would purchase homes sight unseen \u2014 and then knock them down and build bigger villas. The village center, once filled with quaint local shops, has been overtaken by luxury brands such as Prada and Gucci, along with furriers and other designer shops.Rich Russians have long been regulars in the Mediterranean, having established a prominent enclave at the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in France. But Forte dei Marmi offered wider beaches, a good location for jumping off to other areas (hence the thriving helicopter services), an established infrastructure of beach services (some clubs offer piped-in music or Wi-Fi with beach chairs) and, most of all, exclusivity. It is not unusual, according to several shop clerks, for Russian customers to arrive just before closing and request that a store be kept open, just for them.Map of European energy imports that come from Russia.\u201cThey would leave a shop with \u20ac150,000 or \u20ac200,000 in clothes,\u201d said Enrico Salvadori, a journalist who has covered the region for 25 years for the newspaper La Nazione. \u201cThe Russians have been vital, especially from 2008 onward, when the economic crisis hit and the number of Italians coming here started falling.\u201dYet many longtime residents do not regard the Russians as saviors. \u201cA tsunami can be from the ocean, but from money, too,\u201d said Fabio Genovesi, author of \u201cMorte dei Marmi,\u201d or \u201cDeath of the Marmi.\u201d \u201cThis place wasn\u2019t ready for the amount of money the Russians brought.\u201dMr. Genovesi and others tell stories of Russian excess that have become local lore: of \u20ac400 tips to gardeners or \u20ac1,000 tips to waiters; of a Russian driver who, having bumped a person on a motorbike, handed over \u20ac4,000 ($5,182) in cash and drove away; of early-morning fireworks shows above private residences that cost thousands of euros and make laughable the fines of a few hundred euros handed out by the police.\u201cIt is too late,\u201d said Mr. Genovesi. \u201cThe economy is now built on them. We can\u2019t go back.\u201dOthers are less gloomy. Mr. Corchia, the hotelier, said Russians have steadily adapted to village ways, eschewing giant sport utility vehicles for bicycles. \u201cThe leitmotif is understated elegance, not ostentation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the beginning, it was not easy.\u201dThe prospect of expanded sanctions raises worries that the local economy will feel a pinch. Across the country on the Adriatic coast, the number of Russian visitors dropped by 12 percent in Rimini Province, which had targeted a middle-class clientele. In Forte dei Marmi, tourism is also down from last year, but many people blame a rainy July and the continued decline in Italian visitors.At Lobster Russian Corner, a private restaurant and club, the Ukraine crisis has been an inconvenience, since members living in Moscow are no longer allowed to fly over Ukrainian airspace, and must follow longer routes. Some members have decided not to make the trip, yet for many of the wealthiest Russian businessmen, little has changed. The billionaire Roman Abramovich, who lives in London, stopped by the village on his yacht in August, local residents say, as did the former governor of Moscow, Boris Gromov.\u201cThe oligarchs have not changed anything because of the war,\u201d said Indrek Alberg, an ethnic Russian raised in Estonia, who is one of the owners of the club. \u201cI think these are political games. Not so much has changed. It is basically the same.\u201dOr so Forte dei Marmi is hoping.\u201cWe\u2019re like Crimea, and we\u2019ll ask to be part of Russia,\u201d Mr. Corchia said, laughing, only to quickly add, \u201cThat is just a joke.\u201dGaia Pianigiani contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s Dubious Reforms", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Many Mexican politicians are losing sleep lately pondering an enigma: How is it possible that the most important set of governmental reforms in decades has aroused so much enthusiasm abroad and yet so much rejection in Mexico? How is it that, while the groundbreaking reforms were approved by a two-thirds majority of Congress, ordinary Mexicans affirmed in a poll that they believe their country is moving in the wrong direction?Some observers have compared the scope of Mexico\u2019s reforms with American legislation to combat monopolies initiated by Theodore Roosevelt early in the 20th century. Roosevelt\u2019s program put formal limits on the ownership of railroads, mines, oil resources, and steel and tobacco production. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in the 21 months he has been in office, has set limits on the state\u2019s longstanding monopoly on the extraction, production and distribution of oil, gas and electricity by permitting private investment; he has diminished the power of the telecommunications giants Telmex and Televisa by opening the door to competition; and he has compelled the huge National Union of Education Workers to accept reforms that prohibit the sale or inheritance of teaching positions and that introduce compulsory exams to evaluate teachers.For Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto and his team of old-guard politicians and young technocrats, these reforms were a top priority, especially as the government risks losing its legislative majority in the interim elections next July. The legislation is all the more significant because it was pushed through as a grand \u201cPact for Mexico\u201d via a previously unthinkable deal with the major opposition parties. So why is practically no one celebrating the president\u2019s achievement? One answer lies in the bitter experiences of Mexico\u2019s recent history. Toward the end of the 1970s, the discovery of huge oil deposits in the Gulf of Mexico led President Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo to promise the Mexican people an \u201cadministration of abundance.\u201d A wave of hope swept the country. But these vast resources were siphoned off into an ocean of waste, bad investments and corruption. The reckoning came in 1982 with Mexico\u2019s financial bankruptcy. Reforms subsequently put in place during the administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988-1994) were undermined by political scandals and violence, and then a series of economic errors provoked a second financial collapse. But with the arrival of President Ernesto Zedillo (1994-2000) and his moves to battle corruption and initiate political reforms that would permit a transition to democracy in the 2000 elections, the national mood improved once more. Nevertheless, the fundamental problem of powerful public and private monopolies was not addressed, and neither of the next two presidents, Vicente Fox (2000-2006) or Felipe Calder\u00f3n (2006-2012), were willing or able to confront the issue head-on. Unfortunately, at the beginning of this century, a new factor entered the political equation: the fast-spreading violence of the drug cartels and organized crime. Suddenly, ordinary citizens\u2019 illusions about the protective power of the government were shattered as thousands of people died in the drug wars year after year. Even with the recent arrests of some of the kingpins, the drug trade, kidnapping and extortion remain the scourge of many parts of the country \u2014 leaving the people little hope of an imminent return of national confidence.This background of more than a decade of unrelenting violence has colored the public\u2019s reaction to the reforms of the Pe\u00f1a Nieto government: Many people doubt whether the changes will be productive, much less transparent.The government insists that investment in the energy sector will rise significantly with the entry, though limited, of private capital. But people are asking how this process will be controlled and monitored. Will the regulatory agency be effective? And who will run that agency? Will the expected benefits of the new rules actually reach the Mexican people, especially those most in need? Or will the entire scheme become just another opportunity (as so often before) to grow another bureaucracy and enrich yet another crew of politicians and businessmen? The other reforms are raising questions as well. Will they improve the quality of television programming, telephone service and the Internet? The teaching profession once held a place of high honor in Mexico. Can this be regained by breaking the hold of bureaucratic inertia and ideological sectarianism among many teachers? Fiscal reforms have widened the tax base and substantially increased the amount collected, but opponents claim that their effect \u2014 along with delays in public investment, especially in infrastructure \u2014 has been to inhibit economic growth.Making things more complicated, the government has done a poor job of communicating about the nature, extent and possible results of all these reforms. Opening the oil industry to even limited private investment contradicts 75 years of nationalist thinking. To understand such a profound policy change, the public deserves to hear more than prepackaged promotional messages from the government. Instead, it needs a sincere explanation of the changes, the sacrifices they imply, and the time it will take them to bear fruit.Perhaps if the economy were growing at a reasonable rate and offering new opportunities, the national mood would be more positive. But the economy is barely moving \u2014 and the people are fed up. They believe their government acts in its own political interests and not for the good of society; they feel powerless against the corruption pervading the political spectrum.Although Mexico has now opened up its economy and operates under an electoral democracy, there remains one reform that could be more vital than all the others: full establishment of the rule of law. Its most important element should be limits on the legal impunity of criminals and criminal officeholders \u2014 one of the gravest ills of our society. Without sufficient judicial controls and punishment for the authors of crime and corruption, the Mexican people will never be able to believe in a better future. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pair Charged in Manhattan Apartment Rental Fraud", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a certain kind of desperation that just about anyone who has rented an apartment in Manhattan can recognize.It often comes after weeks or months of trekking to far corners of the island only to discover that the place they had hoped to call home is dank or dark or just simply terrible. It comes after a moment of hesitation that led to the decision not to snap up the one place that was, maybe, livable. One way or another, it comes to almost all apartment hunters.And it was this desperation that Matthew Wada, 36, and Jennifer York, 27, used to their advantage in a scheme that exploited the sharing economy in a most unfriendly fashion, law enforcement officials said.\u201cProspective renters lost thousands of dollars in this alleged scheme, which left several of them temporarily homeless,\u201d the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement. \u201cMany of the victims were young, first-time New Yorkers who believed they had signed a legitimate lease only to find out when attempting to move in that their new apartment was already occupied.\u201dIt was hardly the first time people had been swindled during their hunt for a New York apartment, but the indictment outlined a distinctly modern approach to the art of the con.The pair would rent an apartment for a short-term stay, to gain access, then advertise the place for rent on various websites, including Craigslist.With so many people so hungry for so few apartments, they did not have to wait long for responses to what seemed like reasonably priced homes.When victims arrived for a viewing, they were told that Mr. Wada was the landlord and that they needed to act immediately.Victims would sign short-term leases with move-in dates and were told they needed to leave security deposits and advance rent.From late October 2013 to early March 2014, the pair falsely rented apartments in Midtown, Chelsea, Greenwich Village and the East Village, to 40 victims in all, including \u201ca chef from the United Kingdom, a graduate student from California with a Polish girlfriend, a young Polish family, and various people in the creative fields,\u201d according to court records.Lawyers for Mr. Wada and Ms. York, who were arrested on multiple charges of fraud, did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. The authorities were able to track down the pair after Mr. Wada was seen with one of the victims in a surveillance photo, which was then published in Polish-language newspapers. Several weeks later, someone who saw the photo identified Mr. Wada by name.According to court records, the victims lost $150 to $4,500. In some cases, multiple victims paid for the same apartment.When the renters tried to move into the apartments, they would find them occupied or unavailable. By that time, Mr. Wada and Ms. York, who used aliases during the scheme, were long gone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Fed Is Boring Again. That\u2019s a Relief.", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMonetary PolicyWASHINGTON \u2014 FOR the last six years, Federal Reserve policy has been sexy, or at least as sexy as monetary policy can ever be.Leaders of the central bank have had to improvise answers to tremendously consequential questions. What should the Fed do to combat a severe financial crisis? (Pretty much anything they could think of, and then some, was the answer.)What should the Fed do to stimulate a depressed economy when interest rates are already near zero? (Buy trillions of dollars in securities and pledge to keep interest rates at zero for a really long time.) Should it consider more radical measures like lifting its target for inflation? (No.)But now, the big questions of Fed policy have mostly been answered, all the more so after this week\u2019s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the news conference on Wednesday by Janet L. Yellen, its chairwoman. And that is terrific news.At their October policy meeting, they are going to end their program of buying bonds to try to stimulate growth.Sometime next year, they will raise their target for short-term interest rates, which has been at zero since the end of 2008. They will gradually increase that rate until it gets to somewhere in the 3 to 4 percent range in 2017. They will hold on to most of the securities they have acquired as part of their quantitative easing programs for quite a long time; it could take until the end of the decade for the Fed balance sheet to get back to normal.If the economy does better than they expect \u2014 growing faster than the roughly 3 percent pace they expect in 2014, for example \u2014 they will do all those things faster than they now forecast, and move more slowly if they underperform.Want more detail on how they will exit from their era of extraordinary support for the economy? Or the range of expectations of future interest rates, and the economic forecast that supports that outlook? All that is addressed in documents released Wednesday. There are open questions on exactly how far the Yellen Fed will move to end its era of extraordinary support for the economy. But they are either minor ones in the scheme of things (does it first raise interest rates in March 2015, or June, or September?) or ones dependent on much bigger questions that nobody can answer for sure (has the long-term potential of the United States economy been permanently damaged by the downturn?).You may not like the Fed\u2019s policy strategy. But the problems with it now are not a lack of clarity or transparency. Yes, something could come along to throw an unexpected wrench into all this, but if the American economy proceeds pretty much the way it has the last couple of years, with steady and gradually improving growth and few inflationary signs, we know what Ms. Yellen\u2019s policy will look like.There is an entire world of people, small as it may be, who are paid \u2014 often very well, indeed \u2014 to parse the finer points of Federal Reserve policy to advise people who buy and sell bonds, currencies and the like. They spent Wednesday afternoon doing things like counting how many blue dots had been moved slightly higher or lower in a table revealing Fed officials\u2019 forecasts of interest rates in 2017, and pondering why the 2015 projection for gross domestic product growth might have been reduced by two-tenths of a percent. Life isn\u2019t very exciting for them anymore. But because it\u2019s fun and intellectually interesting to parse the small differences between the last Fed statement and the new one and so on, we can sometimes miss the big picture. The economy may not be going gangbusters, but it is now far removed from crisis mode. And the Fed, after years of improvising a response to an unprecedented crisis, is going back to its usual self: slow-moving, deliberate and more than a little bit boring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Philadelphia Nears Deal to Ease Marijuana Laws", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople in Philadelphia caught with small amounts of marijuana or smoking it in public may soon face no more than a written citation and a modest fine as the City Council moved Thursday to decriminalize the drug after a reversal by Mayor Michael A. Nutter.Under the measure, which if approved would be effective Oct. 20, people stopped with less than 30 grams of marijuana, about one ounce, will be fined $25, and those caught using it in public will be fined $100 or be required to perform up to nine hours of community service.In neither situation will violators be arrested, taken to police stations, fingerprinted or left with a criminal record \u2014 all of which stigmatize small-time users, making it harder to find and keep jobs or attend college, advocates of decriminalization say. Of the more than 4,000 arrests in Philadelphia each year for possessing small amounts of marijuana, 83 percent are of blacks or Latinos, said James F. Kenney, a City Council member who sponsored the decriminalization bill.\u201cIt follows you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re young, black and trying to find a job in this economy, it\u2019s very difficult. With a criminal arrest, it\u2019s impossible. On top of that, you\u2019re not eligible for college financial aid and you can\u2019t go into the military.\u201dMr. Kenney said nearly three out of four of those arrested have no previous police record. Moreover, he said, possession is already effectively decriminalized for white residents, whom the police rarely target. \u201cThere are no arrests at Phish concerts or fraternity parties,\u201d he said.In August, Mr. Nutter, who is African-American, called that argument \u201ca bogus issue\u201d and an \u201cinsult to the community.\u201d He denied that the police discriminate against blacks. Arrest rates on marijuana charges are higher for blacks because, the mayor said, there is more police \u201cengagement\u201d in black communities, where most of the city\u2019s shootings and homicides take place. Blacks, like whites, want safe neighborhoods without \u201cknuckleheads\u201d smoking marijuana on the corner, the mayor said. On Wednesday, in an appearance with Mr. Kenney, who is white, the mayor said he would support an amended version of the bill that included a separate civil offense for marijuana use in public. In cases of possession or use, police officers will write a notice of violation and confiscate the marijuana. \u201cWe want to ensure that the punishment for using or possessing small amounts of marijuana is commensurate with the severity of the crime, while giving police officers the tools they need to protect the health and well-being of all Philadelphians,\u201d Mr. Nutter said. An amended version of the original bill was introduced in the Council on Thursday, with a vote scheduled for next week. The mayor has said he will sign it. Under Pennsylvania law, possession of small amounts or public use of marijuana is still subject to arrest and heavy fines. A spokesman for the State Police said the agency would enforce the state statute along portions of Interstate highways it patrols in the Philadelphia limits. \u201cAs far as our department is concerned, it\u2019s not going to change anything for us,\u201d said the spokesman, Trooper Adam Reed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "France Won\u2019t Meet Budget Deficit Target Until 2017, Government Warns", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s economic recovery will be much more fragile this year than originally thought, and the government will not be able to meet targets for reducing the deficit for at least another two years in the face of sputtering growth, the French Finance Ministry announced on Wednesday.The French economy will expand at a tepid 0.4 percent pace in 2014, well below the 1.7 percent rate the government forecast earlier this year, said Michel Sapin, the finance minister. The public deficit, he added, will remain at around 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, up from 4.2 percent last year. That is well above the 3.8 percent target that the government had been aiming for in an effort to gradually bring France\u2019s finances into line with the eurozone\u2019s fiscal rules.Mr. Sapin amplified that message on Wednesday, saying France would \u201cnot take measures that would exacerbate the slowdown in growth that we already know, and further add to a slowdown in inflation.\u201dMr. Moscovici\u2019s nomination as commissioner for economic and financial affairs \u2014 an appointment that France lobbied heavily for him to receive \u2014 may elevate the argument for European governments to make growth a greater priority. Mr. Moscovici, a Socialist, would succeed Olli Rehn of Finland, who has been widely accused \u2014 Mr. Rehn would say unfairly \u2014 of being too focused on austerity budgets.But Mr. Moscovici is no spendthrift. He has repeatedly urged the French government to stick to promises of fiscal rectitude and significant spending cuts to reduce the deficit. \u201cThere is no alternative policy when 57 percent of gross domestic product is devoted to public spending,\u201d he said recently.Mr. Sapin said on Wednesday that France would not ask for wholesale changes to European fiscal rules. \u201cBut we will take into account economic reality\u201d as the government tries to improve France\u2019s growth situation, he said.France has been lobbying the European Commission for greater leniency in meeting deficit reduction targets, even as it presses ahead with a platform, outlined by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande earlier in his term, to improve France\u2019s finances through large spending cuts and tax increases.The deficit will not fall to the 3 percent limit required by eurozone rules until at least 2017, Mr. Sapin said. France has already pushed back the deadlines for meeting that target twice in the last three years \u2014 postponements that Mr. Rehn in Brussels had agreed to.France says it will stick to its pledge to cut its government spending bill by 50 billion euros, or $65 billion, through 2017. But because the recovery is so weak, less than half that amount \u2014 \u20ac21 billion \u2014 will be cut starting next year. Mr. Sapin predicted growth would rebound to 1 percent in 2015.In the meantime, he warned, weak growth is also a factor in the economy\u2019s worrisomely low inflation, which, as in many other parts of the eurozone, is seen at risk of lapsing into a downward spiral of deflation.Inflation in France will end this year at an anemic rate, 0.5 percent, Mr. Sapin added, before picking up to a 0.9 percent pace in 2015. The government is bracing for a \u20ac2 billion tax shortfall this year because of the weak economy, but Mr. Sapin on Wednesday pledged there would be no new taxes any time soon.Advertisement"}

(A more precise measure of competition takes into consideration enrollments into plans offered by insurers, not just number of insurers: A four-insurer market in which one has 90 percent of all enrollment is less competitive than a four-insurer market in which enrollment is split evenly.)The researchers found that if one additional insurer had entered the market, premiums would have fallen by 0.4 percent. The savings are modest because there are diminishing returns to competition: Adding one insurer to a market with 18 has a much smaller effect than adding one to a market in which only a few insurers participate.How might we make exchanges with low levels of competition even more attractive to potential participants? Ms. Dafny thought that some changes in how exchanges operate could help. She suggested favorable placement of new insurers\u2019 plans \u201cin search results, on-site ads, or automatic enrollment of certain individuals.\u201d Another possibility is allowing some organizations \u201cto offer insurance on a trial basis before having to satisfy all of the standards imposed by state departments of insurance.\u201dFor a given individual, gains from competition could be offset by other effects on net premiums, like subsidy level or age. So even if President Obama\u2019s promised $2,500 savings actually materialize for some people, they won\u2019t for others. By one interpretation, it was ambitious for the president to have ever made that promise. Premiums almost always go up year to year. However, if competition can be enhanced, particularly where it is weakest, premiums could come down considerably in the future, relative to what they would otherwise be in more concentrated markets.The premise that consumers can save money in more competitive health insurance markets is reasonable. The challenge is to lure enough competitors to reap the benefits.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 Frustrated by the United Nations\u2019 passive response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, President Bronislaw Komorowski of Poland has said he intends to call on the organization to change its rules to prevent Moscow from vetoing Security Council actions on the region.\u201cMy main message will be that perhaps the United Nations should be reformed to make the institution capable of addressing the threats that really exist today,\u201d Mr. Komorowski said in an interview this week at the presidential palace here in advance of his visit to the United Nations in New York next week. \u201cI think blocking the Security Council on Ukraine is a token, a symptom, of the general weakness of the U.N.\u201dLike the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council \u2014 Britain, China, France and the United States \u2014 Russia has the power to veto any of the Council\u2019s actions. But actually removing Russia\u2019s veto on the Council is nearly impossible. Under Article 108 of the organization\u2019s charter, removing the right to veto would require both a vote of two-thirds of the General Assembly and ratification by whatever constitutional process is in place in two-thirds of the member nations, including all five permanent Council members.In other words, Russia has a veto over removing its own veto.Still, Mr. Komorowski\u2019s call is a sign of Poland\u2019s unease over the international response to the Ukraine conflict and the country\u2019s growing confidence and rising profile in European and trans-Atlantic affairs.With a thriving economy \u2014 Poland was the only nation in Europe to go through the recent economic downturn showing growth in every quarter \u2014 it has become a more prominent voice in European Union and NATO affairs, particularly on issues concerning the region\u2019s eastern flank.Mr. Komorowski will make his call in an address to the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, part of the parade of dignitaries that ushers in every September assembly gathering. It is part of an official visit by the Polish head of state that will include a stop at Fort Bragg, N.C., and an address to the World Leaders Forum at Columbia University, as well as a tour of the university\u2019s Polish studies program.Sipping tea in the White Room of the presidential palace, overlooking gardens and surrounded by aides and security officers, Mr. Komorowski reiterated Poland\u2019s commitment to strengthening European unity as well as trans-Atlantic business, political and military ties.At a time when many European states have drifted away from strong support for the European Union, Poland has been among the most vociferous voices for strengthening it.\u201cThis is a permanent tenet of our foreign policy, to remind the Western world that the very foundation of freedom will be safe and unshaken as long as we have cooperation between Europe and America,\u201d Mr. Komorowski said. \u201cThis is the cornerstone of our commitment, and that is why we also expect, by way of reciprocity, that the United States will sustain its interest in upholding the security of the Western world.\u201d\u201cI think it is the type of operation and reaction that can be an effective answer to the kind of nonclassical threats that we have seen happening on the Russia-Ukraine border,\u201d Mr. Komorowski said. \u201cThat being said, we must regularly take stock of the security situation along the Eastern flank. Something that is sufficient nowadays may need to be expanded in the future.\u201dRussia has shown that it intends to \u201crebuild its imperial position and far-reaching zone of influence\u201d with the clear intention of growing \u201cback to the size of a superpower,\u201d he said.But Mr. Komorowski is confident that one of the outcomes of the Ukraine crisis has been a growing realization that Russia remains a palpable security threat \u2014 as Polish leaders had warned for two decades. \u201cWe know this is not the right time to reset relations with Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the right time to limit any commitment to Euro-Atlantic relations.

{"Headline": "Israel\u2019s Lessons From the Gaza Wars", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRAMALLAH, WEST BANK \u2014 Finally, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief. An open-ended truce has been reached between Hamas and the other groups fighting alongside it against Israel. The recent war, which lasted over 50 days, has ended for now. It was a brutal one, killing over 2,000 Palestinians and maiming 12,000 others while destroying over 11,000 dwellings. It hasn\u2019t been easy on the Israeli side either. Seventy-one Israelis were killed, and everyday life was brought to a standstill in most of the areas hit by rockets launched from Gaza. Israel\u2019s economy and its tourism sector were harmed, air traffic at its main airport was briefly halted, and it was criticized by the international community for its targeting of Palestinian civilians. This was the third war against Gaza since 2008. And it won\u2019t be the last, unless the proper lessons are learned. The first is that Israel\u2019s deterrence capabilities are limited. Israel has always sought to maintain its military-technological strength, and relies on the superiority of its military vis-\u00e0-vis the Palestinians and the Arab world as a whole. Because of its victories in previous conflicts, Israel has developed a sense of invincibility, particularly since it has one of the best-trained armies in the world. The latest war in Gaza has put an end to the myth of Israeli invincibility. A technologically-superior military force was not able to achieve victory over a resistance movement whose fighters number in the few thousands, and whose equipment barely registers when compared to Israel\u2019s advanced arsenal. Israel claims that, despite the truly enormous scale of its destruction in Gaza, it was selective in its bombing due to the area\u2019s population density. But that\u2019s the point: Israel\u2019s future wars with Palestinians are going to be in very densely populated areas. Since Palestinians have discovered that Israel is not able to bear the costs of a ground campaign in a densely populated area, they have now learned the limits of Israeli capabilities, and will exploit them in the future.Israel was unable to achieve the goals that it announced before the war. It was unable to disarm the various resistance movements and turn Gaza into a demilitarized zone, nor was it able to put an end to the tunnel system, or impose calm and guarantee the security of its own citizens. All that its vaunted military machine was able to achieve was \u201ccalm for calm.\u201d Meanwhile, the Palestinians were able to achieve a balance of deterrence despite the chasm that separates their military strength from Israel\u2019s. The second lesson is that Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza can\u2019t continue. It is neither possible nor acceptable that 1.8 million Palestinians continue to live in the world\u2019s biggest open-air prison, and that they be required to surrender and acquiesce to the conditions of their detention. It is unacceptable that Palestinians living there are banned from travelling out of Gaza. How much longer will Israel continue to rule the lives of Palestinians and demand their compliance, branding all those who resist the state of siege and occupation terrorists? Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed. Its reconstruction will require not only a massive infusion of donor money, but also the free flow of construction and building materials. No real or effective reconstruction of Gaza could possibly happen if Israel keeps issuing lists of banned materials. Israel must see that lifting the siege on Gaza and allowing its reconstruction is not only a humanitarian imperative, but also a politically expedient action. Allowing the Palestinians in Gaza the hope of a decent life and a promising economy that will lift them out of poverty is Israel\u2019s best way to achieve safety and security. The third lesson is that Israel\u2019s relentless campaign to weaken the Palestinian Authority, its president and moderate Palestinians seeking a political settlement has always been misguided and will only breed disaster. This policy has blocked all the opportunities that Palestinians have had to end the occupation through negotiations and political settlements. When members of the Israeli cabinet claim that the Palestinian Authority\u2019s president, Mahmoud Abbas, who is criticized for his dovishness in Palestinian circles, is not a possible partner for peace, they are essentially demanding a puppet, who completely submits to all Israeli demands. Power and the continued threat of force will not bring Israel security or peace. Nor will grabbing more West Bank land, as the Israeli government did last week. The road to peace is both clearly delineated and short: It is the public acceptance of the legitimate right of the Palestinians to end the occupation and establish a state.If Israel is unwilling or incapable of understanding that this is the only way to end the conflict, then the international community must take it upon itself to intervene and enforce the two-state solution. It can no longer be claimed that direct negotiations between two unequal partners, Israel the occupier and the Palestinians who live under its occupation, are the only way to achieve this. It hasn\u2019t worked for over 20 years. The United States, as Israel\u2019s main sponsor and protector, must redirect the course of the conflict from a state of constant war to a state of peace. But if it remains completely biased toward Israel, then the Palestinians must seek other international alternatives as Mr. Abbas has stated he plans to do.If the course is not set toward a solution, then we must all prepare for the inevitable next war.

{"Headline": "Former Putin Aide Reinforces Dangers of Sanctions", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Obama has warned Russia that \u201cthere will be costs\u201d for its policies in Ukraine. European leaders and the head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have done the same.On Tuesday, an influential figure in the Russian political elite and a longtime aide to President Vladimir V. Putin drove home this argument.European Union and American sanctions have pushed Russia to a tipping point between growth and recession, Aleksei L. Kudrin, a former finance minister, told an audience of Western executives at a conference in Moscow hosted by the American chamber of commerce. Mr. Kudrin then outlined, in unvarnished and detailed terms, what awaits Russia if a fragile cease-fire in the war in eastern Ukraine breaks down: possibily a contraction over 5 percent lasting one to two years.\u201cThe ceasefire is important for everybody, and for Russia most of all,\u201d Mr. Kudrin said. \u201cWe should study these consequences, and avoid a worsening of the situation.\u201dAlready, Mr. Kudrin said, sanctions have trimmed about 1 percent from Russia\u2019s $2 trillion gross domestic product this year, with the effects now being felt beyond the tight coterie of businessmen deemed close to President Putin who first felt the sting. Economic growth slowed to what Citigroup projects will be 0.5 percent this year. Since January, $110 billion has left Russia as capital flight.Faint consumer demand caused car and other durable goods sales to contract. Rosneft, the state oil company has asked for a government bailout. Yevraziya, a chain of sushi restaurants, closed in Moscow after the price of salmon doubled.Bob Foresman, the chief executive of Barclays bank in Russia, in a speech to the gathering cited a survey of businessmen\u2019s views on the Russian economy, highlighting phrases like \u201cfatigue,\u201d \u201ccaution,\u201d \u201cfalse hope\u201d and \u201cfalse dawn.\u201dIn Ukraine this week, Separatist gunmen and the Ukrainian army are exchanging artillery fire daily over military objectives like a regional airport and a strategic village, Debaltsevo, northeast of Donetsk, where Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers came under fire Sunday.If European leaders decide the cease-fire has failed, they have vowed to leave in place financial and oil industry sanctions imposed last week, rather than repeal them. That, Mr. Kudrin said, would stall the Russian economy with zero growth in 2015, or push it into a mild recession.If the European Union and United States escalate sanctions on the banking sector by prohibiting Russian banks from accessing SWIFT, the international secure money transfer system, the Russian economy will go into deep recession with a contraction of at least 5 percent lasting one or two years, Mr. Kudrin said.Turning inward and relying on a revival of domestic manufacturing and agriculture helped by the weakening ruble, the plan to fortify the Russian economy of so-called import substitution outlined by an acting deputy prime minister who also spoke at the gathering, is unrealistic, Mr. Kudrin suggested.Soft-spoken and with a wry sense of humor, Mr. Kudrin seems at times to almost take pleasure in pointing out the dismal realities of the global economy, when nobody else here will.Europe and the United States, the governments imposing sanctions on Russia, spend about $1.5 trillion on research and development annually, while Russia spends $20 billion, he noted. As such, Russia can never hope to replicate a wide range of these nations\u2019 imported goods. The Russian government should designate only select niches of the economy for this policy, he said.The Russian leadership, he said, understands the costs but may be willing to pay them. Earlier, he described the economic blow as the price for Russia having a foreign policy independent of the United States.\u201cAt a minimum, two or three years are needed to resolve the questions,\u201d of the Ukraine crisis, he said, even if no escalation takes place.\u201cUntil then, we won\u2019t know what investment climate we have and the final state of our relations with the West,\u201d he added, and the Russian economy will be in a \u201cperiod of instability.\u201dMr. Kudrin, whose ties to Mr. Putin stretch back two decades to the city hall of St. Petersburg, where both worked, is retired from government. His is a rare public voice of a liberal wing of the Russian elite on the mounting economic costs of the war and sanctions. Kremlin watchers, though, are divided on whether such sentiments carry any weight now with Mr. Putin.One attendee at the conference questioned whether the Kremlin, already hurt by sanctions, sees no point in changing its behavior in Ukraine, citing Winston Churchill saying \u201cIf you\u2019re going through hell keep going.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sun and Wind Alter Global Landscape, Leaving Utilities Behind", "Date": "2014-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Big FixHELIGOLAND, Germany \u2014 Of all the developed nations, few have pushed harder than Germany to find a solution to global warming. And towering symbols of that drive are appearing in the middle of the North Sea.They are wind turbines, standing as far as 60 miles from the mainland, stretching as high as 60-story buildings and costing up to $30 million apiece. On some of these giant machines, a single blade roughly equals the wingspan of the largest airliner in the sky, the Airbus A380. By year\u2019s end, scores of new turbines will be sending low-emission electricity to German cities hundreds of miles to the south.It will be another milestone in Germany\u2019s costly attempt to remake its electricity system, an ambitious project that has already produced striking results: Germans will soon be getting 30 percent of their power from renewable energy sources. Many smaller countries are beating that, but Germany is by far the largest industrial power to reach that level in the modern era. It is more than twice the percentage in the United States.Electric utility executives all over the world are watching nervously as technologies they once dismissed as irrelevant begin to threaten their long-established business plans. Fights are erupting across the United States over the future rules for renewable power. Many poor countries, once intent on building coal-fired power plants to bring electricity to their people, are discussing whether they might leapfrog the fossil age and build clean grids from the outset.A reckoning is at hand, and nowhere is that clearer than in Germany. Even as the country sets records nearly every month for renewable power production, the changes have devastated its utility companies, whose profits from power generation have collapsed.Taking full advantage of the possibilities may require scrapping the old rules of electricity markets and starting over, industry observers say \u2014 perhaps with techniques like paying utilities extra to keep conventional power plants on standby for times when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining. The German government has acknowledged the need for new rules, though it has yet to figure out what they should be. A handful of American states are beginning a similar reconsideration of how their electric systems operate.The potential payoff for getting the new rules right is enormous: a far greener electricity system that does not pump as much greenhouse gas and other pollution into the atmosphere. Yet as the German experience shows, the difficulties of the transition are likely to be enormous, too, and it is still far from clear whether the system can be transformed fast enough to head off dangerous levels of global warming.Plummeting PricesOne recent day, under a brilliant California sun, saws buzzed as workers put the finishing touches on spacious new homes. They looked like many others going up in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, but with an extra feature: Lennar Corporation was putting solar panels on every house it built.The prices of the panels have plunged 70 percent in the past five years. That huge decline means solar power is starting to make more economic sense, especially in parts of the United States with high electricity prices.At about 100 Lennar subdivisions in California, buyers who move into a new home automatically get solar panels on the roof. Lennar, the nation\u2019s second-largest homebuilder, recently decided to expand that policy to several more states, starting with Colorado. The company typically retains ownership of the panels and signs 20-year deals to sell homeowners the power from their own roofs, at a 20 percent discount from the local utility\u2019s prices.Germany has spent more than $140 billion on its program, dangling guaranteed returns for farmers, homeowners, businesses and local cooperatives willing to install solar panels, wind turbines, biogas plants and other sources of renewable energy. The plan is paid for through surcharges on electricity bills that cost the typical German family roughly $280 a year, though some of that has been offset as renewables have pushed down wholesale electricity prices.Wind power, too, has come down sharply in price in recent years, and it is now competitive with the cost of new coal-burning power plants in parts of the United States.A Threat to BusinessThe decline in the cost of renewable power spells potential trouble for companies that generate electricity. They make a lot of their money at times of day when demand for power, and therefore power prices, are high. Solar power, even a small amount, could be especially disruptive, shaving wholesale prices during those peak periods.Nipping at the heels of those utilities are fast-growing start-up companies that are putting tens of thousands of panels on rooftops and leasing them to homeowners for no money down, with Wall Street banks providing the financing. The hot spot is California, which is aiming for 33 percent renewable power by 2020 and seems increasingly likely to get there.In Germany, where solar panels supply 7 percent of power and wind turbines about 10 percent, wholesale power prices have crashed during what were once the most profitable times of day. \u201cWe were late entering into the renewables market \u2014 possibly too late,\u201d Peter Terium, chief executive of the giant utility RWE, admitted this spring as he announced a $3.8 billion annual loss.The big German utilities are warning \u2014 or pleading, perhaps \u2014 that the revolution cannot be allowed to go forward without them. And outside experts say they may have a point.The Achilles\u2019 heel of renewable power is that it is intermittent, so German utilities have had to dial their conventional power plants up and down rapidly to compensate. The plants are not necessarily profitable when operated this way, and the utilities have been threatening to shut down facilities that some analysts say the country needs as backup. The situation is further complicated by the government\u2019s determination to get rid of Germany\u2019s nuclear power stations over the next decade, the culmination of a long battle that reached its peak after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. As that plan unfolds, shutting down a source of low-emission power, Germany\u2019s notable success in cutting greenhouse gases has stalled.In fact, the problems with the energiewende (pronounced in-ur-GEE-vend-uh) have multiplied so rapidly in the past couple of years that the government is now trying to slow down the transition. \u201cI think we need a little bit of time,\u201d said Jochen Flasbarth, a deputy minister of the environment.But the German public is not taking that well. Marching down a Berlin street with thousands of other protesters one recent day, Reinhard Christiansen, the head of a small company focused on renewable energy in the town of Ellh\u00f6ft, said, \u201cWe are afraid they are trying to put the brakes on the energy transformation.\u201dThe chanting demonstrators demanded that the government, far from slowing the transition, find a way to speed it up.Technological InnovationAs renewable energy sources start to cause gyrations in power supplies and prices, experts contend that clever new market rules could keep the costs reasonable.Some of the innovations they recommend are already in use to some extent \u2014 pioneered in the United States, with Germany avidly studying them. They include regular payments to persuade utilities to keep some fossil-fuel power plants on standby for times when renewable sources lag. \u201cIt\u2019s like a retainer you pay your lawyer to keep her around in case you need her,\u201d said Jay Apt, an electricity expert at Carnegie Mellon University.But the larger innovations are likely to focus on how people use electricity, rather than on how it is supplied.Electricity prices, instead of being averaged over a month, could theoretically vary in real time, at least for willing customers. Price spikes would encourage conservation. Conversely, smart chips built into appliances like dishwashers or water heaters could switch the devices on when power was plentiful and prices low. American tests of this approach have been promising.Other methods could help, too. More high-voltage power lines could link wind farms and solar panels in disparate locations, smoothing out the variations. This is politically difficult, but some such lines are being built in both the United States and Germany.For Germans, the unpredictability of onshore renewable power explains the appeal of offshore wind. The stiff, steady breezes in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea mean that turbines built there will produce far more power than land turbines.That is why three utilities have virtually seized control of the tiny resort island of Heligoland, renting out one hotel for 10 years straight. It is the most convenient body of land to use as an operations base for the huge wind farms they are installing, with long-range plans to go as far as 125 miles offshore.The streets of the island are thronged with well-paid workers. \u201cReally, all areas on Heligoland are profiting,\u201d declared Eike Walenda, the manager of a local outfitter and fueling station.The costs of building in the sea are far higher than on land, of course. The price tag of up to $30 million per turbine is not just for the machine itself, but also for power cables, installation and many other items. To induce utilities to go forward, the government has had to guarantee them power prices of several times the market rate.But, just as with earlier forms of renewable technology, the Germans expect the costs of harnessing offshore wind to drop sharply as the market grows over the coming decade. If that happens, the United States could be a big beneficiary. Studies have shown that offshore wind could supply as much as 15 to 20 percent of the power needed by East Coast cities, and construction is about to start on a handful of American projects.For now, the German offshore farms are adding billions to the costs consumers are already bearing for solar panels, onshore wind turbines, biogas plants and the rest of the transition to renewable energy. Polls suggest it is a burden they are willing to carry.\u201cIndeed, the German people are paying significant money,\u201d said Markus Steigenberger, an analyst at Agora, the think tank. \u201cBut in Germany, we can afford this \u2014 we are a rich country.

Even as Republicans nationally blast the Obama administration\u2019s economic record as a dismal failure, governors like Mr. Scott and Rick Snyder in Michigan are promoting the improving economy in their states.Both parties see something else at stake beyond presiding over the nation\u2019s fourth most populous state: control of the levers of state government before the 2016 presidential election.Less than two months before Election Day, the two men are virtually tied in polls, with Mr. Scott, who trailed Mr. Crist early on, now squeaking past him in some of them. A third candidate, Adrian Wyllie, a Libertarian, seems likely to siphon votes from both candidates.In interviews and polls, voters have hardly been swooning for any candidate, seemingly casting about for the least unpalatable option. This is true of Edith Biller, a longtime Clearwater resident, which is near Mr. Crist\u2019s home turf in a quintessential swing county. A lifelong Democrat, Mrs. Biller, 87, said she would vote for Mr. Crist, even though she was not thrilled with him \u201cbecause he is a bit of flip-flopper\u201d and did not do much when he was governor from 2007-11.\u201cBut I just, I just don\u2019t like Scott at all,\u201d she said, adding that she does not trust him and believes that he bought the election last time by spending $70 million of his own money on the campaign and has mismanaged the state. \u201cHe scares me a little bit.\u201dHer daughter, Joanie Biller-Cauce, a less committed Democrat from Miami, said she would probably vote for Mr. Crist but asked herself, \u201cIs it all about winning for him?\u201d In the end, she added, she might not vote at all.At a Scott rally at La Carreta, a Cuban restaurant in Miami, Olga Suarez, 77, said Republicans were bitter about Mr. Crist and called him a \u201clost cause.\u201d\u201cRepublican to Democrat \u2014 por favor,\u201d Mrs. Suarez said. \u201cHe won\u2019t do anything he says he\u2019s going to do.\u201dThe issues are important, too: Mr. Scott, 61, promotes Florida\u2019s revitalized economy and his drive for $1 billion in tax cuts, along with more funds for schools. Mr. Crist, 58, pledges an increase in the minimum wage, lower insurance rates and a fight for women\u2019s and gay rights. But the issues all too often disappear in the muck of the campaign.\u201cThe race is extremely negative,\u201d said Rod Smith, a former chairman of the Florida Democratic Party. \u201cIt used to be when I asked someone, they would say, \u2018I\u2019m voting for Jeb Bush\u2019 or \u2018for Lawton Chiles,\u2019\u00a0\u201d referring to two former governors. \u201cThe answer now seems to be, \u2018I\u2019m not voting for Charlie Crist\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m not voting for Rick Scott.\u2019\u00a0\u201dRepublicans agree. \u201cThe winner of this race will have a 19 percent approval rating and the loser 17 percent,\u201d said John M. Stipanovich, a longtime Republican political consultant.The antipathy for both candidates reflects, in part, the deepening malaise among voters around the country. But it is also a reaction to a bitter campaign awash in negative advertisements, outside groups with political agendas and seemingly bottomless reservoirs of cash.Mr. Scott is expected to spend at least $100 million in the race \u2014 this time, none from his pocket \u2014 and Mr. Crist about half that amount. Mr. Scott\u2019s war chest, and that of the state Republican Party, fortified him with an early advantage; he began to run political TV ads months ago, lifting him up in polls and dragging Mr. Crist down. At the same time, a record 49 Scott field offices have opened around the state. His campaign says volunteers have knocked on one million doors.But the fact that Mr. Crist withstood the early attacks, winding up tied at the moment, is a testament to his strength as a campaigner, political analysts on both sides said.\u201cWhat you are seeing,\u201d said Steven A. Geller, a former Democratic state senator and Crist supporter, \u201cis Charlie Crist being tough enough to absorb months-worth of body blows that would have knocked anybody else out.\u201dThat is true, analysts said, but negative ads have a way of tamping down turnout in an off-year election, particularly among Democrats.\u201cA lot of their effort is designed to try to drive down turnout,\u201d Steve Schale, an adviser to Mr. Crist who ran President Obama\u2019s 2008 Florida campaign, said of the Scott campaign.The ads cut to the heart of the strategy of Mr. Scott, who made job creation his mantra and is drawing a clear contrast between Florida\u2019s depressed economy in 2010 and its rebounding one today. At every chance, Mr. Crist is repeatedly portrayed as an opportunist who ditched his party and the governorship when he ran for the United States Senate as Florida was deep in recession.\u201cThe economy is doing much better,\u201d Mr. Stipanovich said. \u201cAnd the governor is getting plenty of traction in saying Charlie led us into the wilderness and he led us out.\u201dAt the campaign rally Ms. Suarez attended, Mr. Scott accused Mr. Crist of \u201cusing the Obama playbook\u201d and rattled off then-and-now state unemployment figures, tax obligations and deficits, all of them much improved, he said. He also chuckled about his awkward style on the stump, contrasting himself with the \u201csmooth talker,\u201d Mr. Crist.\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to do the job of running the state of Florida and making this the best place to raise a family,\u201d he said of Mr. Crist.On the flip side, Mr. Crist said Mr. Scott had favored the wealthy and powerful to the detriment of the poor and the middle class. And he casts Mr. Scott as too conservative for Florida, saying the governor has pushed to curb abortion and voter rights, has failed to acknowledge the threat of global warming and, in his first year in office, drastically cut school funding.\u201cI understand if you don\u2019t want to talk about Florida, because his record on Florida is terrible,\u201d Mr. Crist recently said of Mr. Scott.To offset Mr. Scott\u2019s fund-raising advantage, Mr. Crist is focusing on the grass roots, using Mr. Obama\u2019s turnout strategies. Mr. Crist is now rolling out his money on television ads, which should blunt some of Mr. Scott\u2019s attacks. He has also opened 25 field offices.Rather than duck from his party switch, Mr. Crist and his supporters remind voters that he is a centrist who worked well with Democrats as governor and pushed for changes that sometimes scored him no political points, like making it easier for nonviolent felons to regain the right to vote.\u201cHe did it because he knew it was right and he knew that we are always a country of second chances,\u201d Mr. Clinton told a crowd that was largely African-American, a constituency that has lobbied the state about that issue, in a hotel ballroom here.By now, the vast majority of Floridians know whom they will choose, analysts said. The fight will play out along the margins in certain swing counties, a pocket of Hispanics here, a group of Tea Party activists there.The key to success in November for either candidate is turnout \u2014 something that analysts said would be easier for Republicans in this midterm election \u2014 and luring away independent voters, who make up 25 percent of the electorate. Mr. Crist also needs a large number of African-American and Hispanic votes.\u201cThis whole shebang is going to depend on who shows up,\u201d Mr. Clinton scolded the Democrats in the room. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s on you whether he becomes governor.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumer Inflation Cooling Off in Japan", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Consumer inflation eased in Japan in August, in another sign that the central bank could eventually have to take additional steps to meet its target of a 2 percent inflation rate next year.But there is virtually no chance for such steps at the next meeting of the central bank, the Bank of Japan, which ends Oct. 7, although one source of debate will be a business survey set for release in the coming week that is forecast to show a weakening in sentiment resulting from the sales tax increase in April.So-called core consumer prices, which include oil products but exclude fresh food, rose 3.1 percent in August from August 2013, after a 3.3 percent annual rise in July. The median estimate among analysts surveyed by Reuters was for a 3.2 percent increase.The Bank of Japan estimates that the sales tax increase in April, to 8 percent from 5 percent, added 1.7 percentage points to annual consumer inflation in April and two points from May onward. Excluding the sales tax increase, annual core inflation slowed to 1.1 percent in August from 1.3 percent in July.The Bank of Japan had predicted that inflation would slow a little in the middle of the current fiscal year, which began in April, as a lift from the weak yen on import prices started to fade.Lackluster inflation and sentiment, combined with recent weakness in consumer spending and exports, could also push the government to create a stimulus package to see the economy through a second sales tax increase, scheduled for next year.\u201cThe B.O.J. will have to ease policy next year, because inflation will not accelerate again,\u201d said Takuji Aida, the chief economist for Japan at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Securities.Bank of Japan officials say, however, that inflation will accelerate because of the tight labor market and rising price expectations.The central bank\u2019s business survey, known as the Tankan and set for release on Wednesday, is forecast to show that manufacturers turned less optimistic in the July-to-September quarter, and that sentiment will probably improve only slightly in the coming quarter, highlighting worries about the economy.The Bank of Japan is likely to downgrade its gross domestic product forecasts at a subsequent meeting, on Oct. 31, economists say, which could propel speculation that an expansion of stimulus efforts is unavoidable.\u201cThe B.O.J. argues that a tighter labor market will push up wages and prices, but I don\u2019t think that will happen, given weakness in the underlying economy,\u201d said Takeshi Minami, the chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. \u201cYou cannot rely solely on a weaker currency to achieve sound and stable inflation. As such, I expect the B.O.J. will be forced into additional easing as early as the end of October, when it reviews its growth and price projections.\u201dThe Bank of Japan has stood pat on monetary policy since April 2013, when it pledged to aggressively purchase government debt and other assets. The aim was to accelerate inflation in two years, ending decades of deflation.This exercise in what is known as quantitative easing helped push the yen to a six-year low versus the dollar. A weaker yen has buoyed exporters\u2019 share prices and earnings, but it has raised concerns that higher import prices could hurt other companies.The government agreed to raise the sales tax in two stages to pay for welfare and health care spending, but now that Prime Minster Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic agenda is showing signs of stalling, political opposition to the second tax increase could grow.The economy shrank 7.1 percent in the quarter that ended in June, the biggest contraction since the global financial crisis, mostly because of the first sales tax increase.Advertisement"}

He did not, however, reply to specific questions about his current wealth and possible involvement in past Catalan corruption cases.The leader of the Catalan branch of the Popular Party, Alicia S\u00e1nchez-Camacho, said at a news conference on Saturday that Mr. Mas had \u201ccrossed the red line of legality\u201d by signing the decree. \u201cIllegality isn\u2019t democracy,\u201d she added.The leader of the Catalan branch of the Socialist Party, Miquel Iceta, said at another news conference on Saturday that Mr. Mas was \u201cgenerating false expectations\u201d among Catalans by signing an illegal decree. \u201cThe only way is that of dialogue and negotiation,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debate on Independence Lingers in Scottish Homes", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGLASGOW \u2014 Fiona Ivanski and her husband, Vincent, woke early the morning after the Scottish independence referendum, even though they had barely slept. Anxious to discover the verdict on Scotland\u2019s future, they sat down on their living room couch at 6:08 a.m. Friday and turned on the television.Dr. Ivanski\u2019s face fell. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she said.\u201cThank God,\u201d her husband replied, smiling.Dr. Ivanski, a veterinary surgeon, had voted for Scottish independence. Her husband, a retired police officer, had voted against it. She said she was devastated that her country did not grab this \u201conce-in-lifetime opportunity to break free.\u201d He said he was relieved to retain the safety of the status quo, including the pound and his pension.In homes across Scotland, a civil war of a very personal kind has been raging, pitting husband against wife, mother against son, and brother against brother. Like countless other families, the Ivanskis, married for 33 years, found themselves on opposite sides of a national rift opened by two years of intense debate about the most momentous decision their country has faced since joining the union with England over three centuries ago.Fifty-five percent of Scots cast their ballots in favor of staying in that union. But 45 percent would rather leave. And after a high-energy pro-independence campaign that dominated cityscapes and was fueled by slogans of hope and positivity, the losing side may now collectively be feeling what Dr. Ivanski described as \u201ca terrible emptiness.\u201d\u201cWe got so close, you could almost touch it,\u201d Dr. Ivanski said.\u201cThere is a split, it\u2019s there now,\u201d Mr. Ivanski said, taking his wife\u2019s hand. \u201cPeople voted for yes and no in about equal measures. How do you move on from that?\u201dOn the commuter train outside Glasgow, crestfallen faces could be seen side by side with those discussing in hushed voices their delight at the outcome. On George Square, for weeks the hub of local pro-independence campaigners, unionists and nationalists briefly faced off, forcing the police to separate the two sides.Politicians on both sides were quick to urge reconciliation. Before conceding defeat in the referendum and announcing that he would step down this year, Alex Salmond, the leader of the Scottish Parliament and the pro-independence Scottish National Party, changed his profile image on Twitter and Facebook from a \u201cYes\u201d slogan to \u201cOne Scotland.\u201dHalfway through the morning on Friday, Dr. Ivanski turned down the volume on her television. She paused, then smiled. \u201cYou have to take the positives from it, the turnout, the new powers they are promising,\u201d she said. Her husband nodded. \u201cThis may be the beginning of something new anyway?\u201dThe day before, the Ivanskis had driven to the polling station together in their black Volkswagen \u2014 she trying one last time to persuade him to change his mind \u2014 he trying to change the subject. But they were able to agree at least on one thing.\u201cWhatever the outcome, Scotland is better off for having had this referendum,\u201d Mr. Ivanski said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a kind of kick up the backside to Westminster, and in a way, I\u2019m kind of proud and happy that it went this close. Scotland woke up and voiced an opinion.\u201dThe debate had galvanized both of them early on. Mr. Ivanski, 56, had not voted since he was 18, having become disillusioned by politics. \u201cBut this was different,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a historic moment. It was too important to leave to other people to decide.\u201d\u201cI was worried,\u201d he said, \u201cworried about the economy, the currency and companies leaving Scotland.\u201dDr. Ivanski, 54, had had her own doubts, but one day in July, house-sitting for a friend, she found the white paper on independence on a coffee table. She read the chapter on economics and was won over.\u201cRead this,\u201d she told her husband later that night. He refused, and they had a fight. \u201cNothing too serious,\u201d she said, \u201cbut basically that day we agreed to disagree.\u201dAround them, similar debates were happening.Dr. Ivanski\u2019s brother voted no, while her sister voted yes. Three couples the Ivanskis socialize with are split the same way they are. Their son, Adam, 25, a yes voter like his mother, had sparred so much with his father in the run-up to the vote that they ended up banning the subject.\u201cIn the end we avoided the conversation and just talked about football,\u201d Mr. Ivanski said, adding: \u201cLuckily we support the same club.\u201dAt their home, outside Glasgow, both the \u201cyes\u201d and the \u201cno\u201d leaflets have gone into the trash. Not even Dr. Ivanski wants another referendum.\u201cThis was the best shot we had,\u201d she said.Her son, Adam, disagreed.

I went home and cried. I was about 14 years old. I had just been fired from my first job.I learned something that day: An employee ignores her boss\u2019s expectations \u2014 whether they seem reasonable or not \u2014 at her own peril. Thirty-odd years have come and gone, but I have never forgotten that lesson.On the negative side: In this unsettled economy, teenagers are increasingly competing with adults for many of the part-time, entry-level and seasonal positions once commonly held by high school students and young adults, economists say. The result: Far too many young people are marching into adulthood \u2014 when the stakes are high \u2014 without having learned vital workplace lessons from making those all-too-common first-job blunders as teenagers.It\u2019s hard not to worry about what kind of impact this will have, particularly on less-privileged young people. I\u2019m talking about the teenagers who lack the connections and financial cushions that might allow them to land the unpaid internships and foreign travel experiences that have become popular training grounds for their upper-middle-class peers.Christian Gonz\u00e1lez-Rivera, the research associate who wrote the Center for an Urban Future report, estimated that 172,000 young people in New York City were not in school and were not working.\u201cThe city hasn\u2019t really caught up to the magnitude of the need,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez-Rivera said, adding that city development programs aimed at the young reach too few people and do too little to help them find jobs.He did praise the de Blasio administration and the City Council for expanding the Summer Youth Employment Program, the city\u2019s biggest jobs program for young people, which had been shrinking for more than a decade.This summer, more than 47,000 young people got jobs through the program, city officials say, about 12,000 more than in 2013. But that didn\u2019t come close to meeting the demand: About 83,000 applicants ended up without jobs.Just ask Alfredo Rosario, a 17-year-old high school senior from the Bronx. He and 11 friends applied for jobs through the program. Only four were hired. Mr. Rosario was not among them. He eventually found a summer job anyway, but several of his friends did not.Alan Cheng, the assistant commissioner for youth work force development at the Department of Youth and Community Development, said officials were working hard to improve and expand job-training programs for young people, while strengthening ties with private employers and improving communication between \u2014 and sharing expertise across \u2014 city agencies.Back then, my middle sister, now a civil rights lawyer, got her first taste of the working life at the old Genovese Drug Store on Bay Street, where she found a job as a cashier. My youngest sister, now an elementary school teacher, collected her first paycheck as a hostess at the Perkins restaurant on Forest Avenue.As for me, I found my next opportunity on the job bulletin board at Stuyvesant High School when I was a student there. A magician in Manhattan needed help with her bookkeeping and marketing. After I was hired, I discovered that she also wanted me to cut her hair and to create and deliver elaborate balloon bouquets to clients.It was odd, for sure, but I held my tongue. I liked the job.

{"Headline": "U.S. and Europe Are Struggling With Response to a Bold Russia", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American and European officials are struggling to devise a response as Russia bears down on Ukraine, searching for new measures that will have more impact than the economic sanctions imposed so far, without risking major damage to their own industries or a military escalation that could spiral out of control.The officials are meeting this week to assemble a new package of sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s banking, energy and defense sectors, but expressed skepticism that the measures would force Moscow to reverse course. President Obama faced rising calls from advisers and from Congress to move beyond economic actions to provide arms and more intelligence to Ukraine\u2019s beleaguered military.The NATO meeting \u201cis about drawing a line west of Ukraine,\u201d said Shashank Joshi, a senior researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cNo one will quite abandon Ukraine, but there is a recognition that there will be no confrontation with Russia on Ukrainian soil. The focus will be on NATO\u2019s boundaries, on reassurance for Poland and the Baltic nations, and drawing a sharp distinction between those in and out of NATO.\u201dBoth Democrats and Republicans in Congress urged Mr. Obama to step up direct assistance to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, reinforcing private advice he has been getting from some officials inside his own government. The lawmakers and administration officials argue that economic sanctions have not been effective so far and that the Kremlin respects only strength.\u201cThis is a watershed moment,\u201d said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who just returned from a visit to Kiev. Mr. Menendez proposed sending antitank missiles and radar systems to Ukraine.\u201cThousands of Russian troops have crossed into Ukraine,\u201d he told NPR. \u201cThey\u2019ve come in with columns of tanks and armored vehicles and surface-to-surface missiles. This is no longer the premise that, oh, separatists are fighting.\u201dAdministration officials are considering such moves. \u201cPeople are looking at all those options,\u201d said one official, who like others declined to be identified discussing internal deliberations. But Mr. Obama has so far been reluctant to take such steps out of concern that they would worsen the fighting and encourage escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia.Despite anger at Russian actions, there are few signs that Europe has the stomach for a more confrontational policy if the White House does not. In the end, European leaders whose economies are dependent on Russian energy are reluctant to widen the conflict beyond additional sanctions. Instead, they may seek an outcome that makes some concessions to the Kremlin.It may be \u201cdeeply unappetizing,\u201d Mr. Witney said, but Europe favors \u201csome form of cease-fire and some degree of negotiation that will give eastern Ukraine more autonomy than Kiev wants and a clear sign that Ukraine won\u2019t join NATO.\u201dMap of European energy imports that come from Russia.Such a concept has driven a deep divide in Washington in recent days. A group of American and Russian experts and former government officials produced a 24-point plan during a meeting on the Finnish island of Boisto to defuse the confrontation over Ukraine. They proposed a cease-fire enforced by United Nations peacekeepers, a withdrawal of Ukrainian and Russian forces, partial amnesty and a guarantee that Ukraine remains unaligned.Among those leading the effort were Thomas Graham, a former Russia adviser to President George W. Bush, and Andrew Weiss, a former Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton. Among those on the Russian side were Alexander Dynkin, a former government official in the 1990s, and Alexey Arbatov, a former member of Parliament.But the plan drew a swift and heated response from other Russia experts in Washington, who complained that it was drawn up without Ukrainian participation and would reward Mr. Putin for aggression. Signing a letter assailing the Boisto plan were David J. Kramer, a former Bush administration official; Strobe Talbott, a deputy secretary of state under Mr. Clinton; Melanne Verveer, a longtime adviser to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; and Michael McFaul, Mr. Obama\u2019s former ambassador to Moscow.Some in Europe are pushing for a tough response. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who had been energetic in trying to negotiate a de-escalation with Mr. Putin, has proved in the last weeks to be resolute since Russian troops and weapons crossed into Ukraine. While continuing to stress that there is \u201cno military solution,\u201d Ms. Merkel has made clear there will be new sanctions soon if Russia does not pull back.\u201cRussia is trying to alter existing borders under the threat or even the use of force,\u201d she told Parliament on Monday.Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, head of the German Parliament\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee, said the most recent sanctions \u201creally impressed Putin,\u201d adding, \u201cNow the Europeans must make clear that this was not a one-off show of strength, but is part of a system.\u201dPeter Baker reported from Washington, and Steven Erlanger from London.

This nerve-racking financial insecurity has come to characterize life in cities across the country.In Newark, for example, three-quarters of the population does not have enough money to meet basic expenses for three months at the federal poverty level, about $6,000 for a family of four. The absence of assets that can be quickly converted to cash \u2014 like stocks, bank accounts or retirement accounts \u2014 is why the study calls these people \u201cliquid asset poor.\u201d Other cities where more than half the population has nearly no financial leeway include Detroit at 68 percent, Miami at 67 percent, Cleveland at nearly 65 percent, as well as Laredo, Tex.; Birmingham, Ala.; Milwaukee; Buffalo; and Memphis.\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve ever had data on all the cities and municipalities in the United States that tells us about the level of savings and financial security or insecurity,\u201d said Andrea Levere, president of the Corporation for Enterprise Development, a nonprofit based in Washington that is supported by foundations and banks. What it shows, she explained, is that \u201cit\u2019s not just income; it\u2019s also assets that matter when you\u2019re attempting to change financial opportunity.\u201dThe lack of savings not only means that families are frighteningly vulnerable to setbacks but that they are also unable to plan for the future even in the good times.

The lack of a bank account makes it even harder to save. On average, an \u201cunbanked\u201d person spends $1,000 a year on financial services, paying to cash a check or paying high interest on an expensive payday loan, she said.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia to sustain a truce in eastern Ukraine, and that Ukraine was now looking ahead to pursue membership in the European Union.Speaking at a news conference in Kiev, the capital, Mr. Poroshenko said that he planned to meet with Mr. Putin within the next three weeks and expressed confidence that the cease-fire with pro-Russian rebels would hold.At the same time, Mr. Poroshenko voiced several positions certain to irk the Kremlin, which has worked aggressively to prevent Ukraine from shifting politically and economically toward Europe. He said that Ukraine would never relinquish the embattled eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, that plans to grant those regions greater autonomy would have firm limits, and that Ukraine must move as quickly as possible toward European integration.\u201cThe doors of the E.U. are open to us; I am absolutely convinced of this,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cEvents in Kiev and Brussels gave us a firm hope, a belief, that we will soon get the prospect of E.U. membership. We have every right to knock on this door.\u201dEarlier in the day, Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office said the government planned to push legislation that would repeal a 2010 law barring Ukraine from membership in any military or political alliance, a step viewed as a prelude to an application to join NATO.Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s news conference was called in large part to discuss an ambitious plan of reforms to be carried out through 2020. These include aggressive efforts to combat corruption and overhaul the economy, challenges that have hobbled Ukraine since its independence from the Soviet Union more than 20 years ago.\u201cYes, we cast away the tyranny, confirmed our European choice and survived the fight with the external enemy,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cBut the internal challenge is just as important. Corruption, poverty and economic weakness is our biggest threat and the main weapon of the attackers.\u201d He said there was no time to walk or crawl. \u201cWe must run, fly,\u201d he said.Nearly all of the big changes will require the support of Parliament, and Mr. Poroshenko expressed confidence that a new, reform-minded group of lawmakers would come to power in national elections to be held on Oct. 26.It is still unclear, however, if the government will succeed in carrying out voting in the war-torn east. More than 3,000 people have died there since fighting began in April, and tens of thousands of people have fled the region for safety.At the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Poroshenko sought to clarify the extent of the autonomy that the government would grant to the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk, which he said would be limited to a \u201cspecial regime of local authorities.\u201d\u201cNone of the central functions are delegated,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cSeparation of this region from Ukraine is out of the question. We only have a process of decentralization. It is beginning throughout the country.\u201dMr. Poroshenko said the Kremlin had underestimated Ukraine\u2019s strength.\u201cSome people in the Russian administration thought that Ukraine was a colossus on clay legs, and that once you push it a little, Donbass will fall apart,\u201d he said, referring to the southeastern region of the country. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201dAsked by a reporter if he was ever threatened by Mr. Putin, Mr. Poroshenko replied: \u201cI\u2019ll answer simply. I am not afraid of anything, and I never was. I represent a great country of strong people, and it gives me additional confidence. I can\u2019t imagine anyone threatening me.\u201dOlga Rudenko contributed reporting from Kiev, Ukraine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Sanctions to Stall Exxon\u2019s Arctic Oil Plans", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Exxon Mobil\u2019s ambitions in Russia appear to have been dashed, at least until the Ukraine crisis is resolved.As part of the latest round of sanctions against Russia, the United States government took aim at Exxon\u2019s project in the Arctic Ocean, ordering American companies to cut off exports to Russian oil exploration within 14 days.The United States and Europe originally banned technology transfers that aided Russia\u2019s deep water, Arctic offshore or onshore shale rock formation projects over the summer, but the language did not stop Exxon Mobil from starting drilling in the Kara Sea with a rig it had just moved. The new measures applied on Friday were meant to close those loopholes by also banning the export of goods and services.Exxon said its lawyers were studying the sanctions. \u201cWe have to look at what was issued today\u201d by the United States and the European Union \u201cand determine how it affects us,\u201d said Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman.American officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the impact of sanctions on individual companies, said they recognized that Exxon Mobil lawyers might look for creative ways around the sanctions. But they said the government\u2019s intention was to shut down the company\u2019s operations in the Kara Sea.The sanctions won\u2019t hurt Exxon\u2019s profit for years. Exxon, which is working with the Russian energy giant Rosneft, just started exploratory drilling in the Arctic, and it could be a decade before the project started producing oil in meaningful quantities.But the sanctions, particularly if they last for an extended period, could damage Exxon\u2019s relationship with Russia, crimping the company\u2019s growth strategy. The Kara Sea project in the Arctic Ocean is a central piece of Exxon\u2019s effort to gain new reserves and replace production lost in aging fields and in countries like Venezuela that have grown unfriendly to Western oil companies.Western governments have been gradually ramping up the pressure on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in an effort to halt his support of separatists in Ukraine. The prolonged crisis and the sanctions, against financial, defense and energy companies, as well as individuals, have weighed heavily on the Russian economy.But the country\u2019s cash-rich energy industry so far has shown few signs of a slowdown. Western energy giants, too, have been largely operating as normal.The new measures threaten the status quo.\u201cIt will infuriate the Kremlin, and Russia\u2019s sanctions response will now be tougher than had been expected,\u201d said Christopher J. Weafer, a partner at Macro-Advisory, a Moscow-based firm that advises businesses on Russia.Exxon and other Western energy giants could feel the pinch, too. While the European Union exempted existing contracts from the sanctions, the United States did not.The United States Treasury put a deadline on its order, saying that American companies engaged in such activities with five big Russian energy companies had until Sept. 26 to \u201cwind down applicable transactions with these entities.\u201d In addition to Rosneft, the American sanctions preclude transfers of technology, goods and services to the Russian energy companies Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil and Surgutneftegas.American officials said the new sanctions would not affect current day-to-day oil production. And even if they had, Russia isn\u2019t a meaningful contributor to Exxon\u2019s bottom line.Exxon\u2019s primary business in Russia is a partnership on Sakhalin Island with Rosneft, Japan\u2019s Sodeco and O.N.G.C. of India. The project produces 140,000 barrels of oil a day, which translates to less than 50,000 barrels a day for Exxon. That represents a small fraction of the 2.1 million barrels Exxon produces worldwide every day.But the sanctions are a potential blow to Exxon\u2019s future growth.Earlier this summer, Exxon, with its Russian partner Rosneft, started drilling in the Kara Sea, the body of water between the northern coast of European Russia and the Novaya Zemlya island chain. The project offers Exxon access to an area with great promise; the Arctic holds an estimated one-fifth of the world\u2019s undiscovered, recoverable oil and natural gas, much of it concentrated in the ocean\u2019s Russian sector.The Arctic is part of a long-term strategy at Exxon to help bolster production, as many of its fields around the world start to decline. The company reported in the second quarter that its oil and gas output dropped 6 percent from the same period in 2013, largely because of the expiration of its rights to a field in Abu Dhabi.Mr. Jeffers, the Exxon spokesman, wrote in an email on Friday that a rig brought this summer from Norway continued to drill the joint venture\u2019s first Arctic well. But he added that, \u201cwe are assessing the sanctions. It is our policy to comply with all laws.\u201dThe new sanctions will almost certainly lead to serious project delays. The sanctions will prohibit the export of many services for deepwater, shale and Arctic oil exploration and production, including drilling, well testing and advanced well completion techniques like hydraulic fracturing. While previously completed fields can continue to operate, expansions that tie in foreign companies will be far more difficult.The wording of the United States and European sanctions are not entirely consistent. A Barclays report noted that each uses different clauses for describing deepwater, Arctic and shale projects \u201cin such a way that adds uncertainty for companies involved in the production of both oil and gas in Russia.\u201dBarclays forecast that Russian oil production would decline by a mere 20,000 barrels a day in 2015 \u2014 a drip in a 90 million barrel a day world market. But it added that they would \u201cthrow a wrench\u201d into plans to expand the Sakhalin fields.Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based research firm, said that the Exxon joint venture and similar projects would likely have to deal with significant disruptions until sanctions are lifted. Oil service companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes, major suppliers to the Russian industry, may also face pressure.The ban on technology transfers could cripple a sweeping plan by Russia to move from declining Siberian fields to ones offshore in the Arctic Ocean, newly accessible because of the thawing sea ice from global warming. In recent years, Russia has also developed ambitious plans to extract oil from its huge onshore shale rock formations, though little such oil has been produced so far.Exxon, as well as Norway\u2019s Statoil and Italy\u2019s Eni, have Arctic ventures with Rosneft. A number of major companies, including Exxon, BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell, are engaged in projects to test the potential of Russian shale.In a presentation, Igor Sechin, the top executive at Rosneft and a close aide to Mr. Putin, said Arctic and so-called tight oil development that relies on Western technology would attract $300 billion to $500 billion in direct investment, and spur the economy with infrastructure work like building roads and railroads in the Arctic.Without that investment, Russia\u2019s energy future may be in jeopardy. If new offshore and shale oil fields are not developed, Russia\u2019s current oil output of about 10 million barrels per day is expected to decline one million barrels by the end of the decade.Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the effect of sanctions against Russia on Exxon Mobil\u2019s Arctic oil production plans misstated, in some copies, part of the name of an oil service company that may also feel the pressure. It is Baker Hughes, not Baker Hughers.Stanley Reed reported from London and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington and Andrew E.

{"Headline": "U.S. and European Sanctions Take Aim at Putin\u2019s Economic Efforts", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States and the European Union dealt a blow on Friday to Russian efforts to develop future oil sources in the Arctic and elsewhere, broadening and deepening the range of sanctions imposed on Moscow in retaliation for its intervention in Ukraine despite the potential cost to Western firms like Exxon Mobil and BP.The new measures also placed further limits on access to American and European capital markets, making it harder for Russian banks to obtain any credit in foreign capitals beyond short-term loans. The United States singled out Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank, for the first time.The American measures apply not just to future contracts but to existing interactions, and the Treasury Department gave American firms until Sept. 26 to wind down any current activities. The European Union, by contrast, did not apply the new restrictions to existing projects.The Europeans also banned travel by and froze the assets of 24 more individuals, including Russian lawmakers and others who have supported President Vladimir V. Putin over Ukraine, while the Americans blocked the assets of five Russian state-owned defense technology firms.Also targeted was the Russian military conglomerate Rostec and its leadership, as its subsidiary plans to build energy plants in Crimea, the autonomous Ukrainian region that was annexed by Moscow this year in an action still rejected by the outside world.While imposing new sanctions on Russia, the European Union also made a significant concession to Moscow on Friday, agreeing at a meeting with Ukrainian and Russian officials in Brussels to delay the implementation of important parts of a trade and political pact with Ukraine, a deal that Moscow has bitterly opposed all along. A statement from the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive arm, said that all sides were ready to show \u201cadditional flexibility\u201d and added that this would mean delaying until Dec. 31 of next year the full implementation of a pact that had been expected to go into effect in November of this year. Russia put heavy pressure on the former Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, to reject the trade deal. By doing so last November and tilting toward Moscow\u2019s orbit, he set off weeks of street protests that in February toppled him from power. Ukraine\u2019s new government swiftly reversed Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s decision and, to Moscow\u2019s fury, endorsed the trade deal he had rejected, which Russia views as part of an effort by\u00a0the West to wrest Ukraine from its influence.\u00a0The cumulative impact of the measures was to take aim at the heart of Mr. Putin\u2019s project to reshape and revive Russia\u2019s flagging economy through the development of Chinese-style state capitalism. The sanctions targeted a raft of financial, defense and industrial companies in the vanguard of Mr. Putin\u2019s push to replace the wild free-market capitalism of the 1990s with state-led development.European Union officials plan to review their sanctions before the end of the month and could revise them if the peace holds.European leaders agreed on the sanctions last month but held off amid calls by some countries to see how the cease-fire played out. But the European Council, a body representing the leaders of European Union member nations, said in a notice in its Official Journal announcing the measures on Friday, that it \u201cconsiders it appropriate to take further restrictive measures in response to Russia\u2019s action destabilizing the situation in Ukraine.\u201dIn Moscow on Friday, the main stock market index, the Micex, rose 2.1 percent as details of the European measures became public. The index lost ground later in the day and closed up 0.6 percent, but that was before the tougher American measures were announced.Addressing the new sanctions for the first time on Friday, Mr. Putin called them illogical and accused Western leaders of trying to derail the peace process in eastern Ukraine, according to Russian news agencies.\u201cI don\u2019t even understand what these present sanctions are related to,\u201d Mr. Putin told reporters in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. \u201cMaybe someone does not like that the process has moved toward a peaceful scenario.\u201dIn trying to shut down energy development in the Arctic, the United States and the European Union went after a pet project of Mr. Putin and a close associate, Igor Sechin, chief of Rosneft, the largest Russian oil company.Exxon Mobil executives said their lawyers were trying to determine if their current oil and gas production in Russia would be affected. Aside from Arctic drilling and other exploration for future production, Exxon Mobil participates in a consortium on Sakhalin Island to produce oil and gas.Russia is heavily dependent on American and European assistance in developing new energy sources. American officials said the new measures were not intended to curtail current production but to make clear to Moscow that its energy future would be severely curtailed unless it changed course.The officials acknowledged that the moves might harm Western economies as well, but said that they fashioned them to minimize that.\u201cAs in all of the sanctions steps we have taken,\u201d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement, \u201cwe have designed the actions announced today to deliver significant pressure on the targets of our sanctions while safeguarding, to the extent possible, global financial markets and the global economy.\u201dThe new sanctions prohibit American and European entities from issuing new debt with a maturity of more than 30 days to targeted Russian banks, energy companies and defense firms. That tightened the debt-financing limit, which was originally set at 90 days in the summer.The banks targeted by the European measures are the same as those subjected to an earlier round of less severe restrictions in July, including Gazprombank and Sberbank. The oil companies include Rosneft, Transneft and Gazprom Neft, and the defense groups were identified as Oboronprom, the United Aircraft Corporation and Uralvagonzavod.Limiting big Russian banks and other firms to 30-day loans could cause a credit crunch as early as December, when $25.1 billion in Russian foreign corporate debt matures, Ivan Tchakarov, the chief economist for Citigroup in Russia, said in a telephone interview.The Kremlin would then need to dip into windfall oil funds to bail out companies. Russia has about $470 billion in foreign reserves, which would cover all foreign debt maturing over the next two years, Mr. Tchakarov has estimated.At his news conference, Mr. Putin responded to the travel bans with characteristic bravado, saying that he was pleased that more Russians would be unable to travel in the West because they should spend more time at home. \u201cThe less our officials and corporate executives travel abroad, the better,\u201d he said.With the latest additions, there are now 119 individuals on the list of those subject to travel bans and asset freezes by the European Union.President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said from the capital, Kiev, that the new sanctions were an endorsement of his country, particularly given the economic problems that Europe faces. The Ukrainian president is scheduled to meet with President Obama in Washington on Sept. 18, and has said he will seek a security alliance with the United States outside the framework of the Atlantic alliance.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Andrew Higgins from Brussels.

Scotland and England have been united as Great Britain since 1707, sharing a monarch, a Protestant faith and, for a time, an empire, and fighting side by side in global wars.Advocates of independence actually want to keep the queen, the pound and membership in the European Union, though maintaining the status quo on the currency and membership in the union is far from certain. In fact, this absence of acrimonious differences and a more unified Europe has made it easier for a modern nation of five million to ask itself what it wants to be.The issue of independence involves far more than economic benefits, and the debates in Scotland and England have often been passionate since the Scottish National Party won a majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament in 2011 and started the ball rolling toward a referendum. Globalization and loss of empire have weakened a shared British identity, and the European Union has made it possible for distinct peoples like the Scots, Catalans or Basques to contemplate going it alone.Unionists have countered that such dreams overlook the advantages of bonds, values, economies and shared identities forged over centuries, and that separation holds many unknowns. Quebec, for instance, has demonstrated that even if the separatists fail, the debate on independence contributes to a nation\u2019s identity and narrative.It is testimony to democratic values in Britain and in Spain, where a vote on Catalonia\u2019s independence is scheduled for November, that the question can be put to the people peacefully \u2014 in stark contrast to Russia\u2019s armed campaign to punish and dismember Ukraine for trying to break out of the Kremlin\u2019s orbit. In Scotland, there is no threat of reprisals for either choice, and the only pressure is the complexity and fatefulness of that simple question.An editorial on Sept. 4 about Scotland\u2019s independence vote in-correctly stated that Scotland and England have lived together in peace since 1707. In 1745, several Scottish clans joined Charles Edward Stuart in an uprising to reclaim the British throne, which was ultimately defeated.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 65-Ton Dinosaur as a Distraction From NATO, Ukraine and ISIS", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick HistoryThe important news was the convergence of a NATO summit meeting, the beginnings of a cease-fire in Ukraine and the commitment to destroy ISIS. Those events will shape the world. The news that won\u2019t change anything is the discovery of a humongous dinosaur, and yet that may have been the most compelling story.Ukraine and ISIS are bad news in its purest form, dreary replays of horrors we thought we had left behind: Cold War sabre-rattling with Russia, only this time without the competition of ideologies; and with ISIS, medieval cruelties and religious fanaticism.Dinosaurs, by contrast, combine the \u201conce upon a time\u201d appeal of fantasy with the mind-boggling knowledge that these monsters actually walked our earth, when our ancestors were little mammals hopping around trees eating insects. The new dinosaur reported last week followed the preferred template of sandbox toys \u2014 small head dangling from a long neck and a long sweeping tail aft. But the scale of the vegetarian beast was one never unearthed before \u2014 85 feet long, 30 feet tall and probably tipping the scales at 65 tons.That\u2019s equal to more than eight African elephants, the biggest mammals on land today. And Dreadnoughtus, as its discoverers playfully named the giant, was only an adolescent when it perished in what is now the Patagonia region of Argentina. The Dreadnoughtus \u2014 actually, a big one and bits of a smaller one \u2014 was discovered in 2005 by an international team led by Kenneth J. Lacovara, a paleontologist at Drexel University in Philadelphia, who described the find in the journal Scientific Reports. It took four years to excavate the skeleton and several more years to prepare and study the 16 tons of bones back in Philadelphia, where they were shipped.And now back to the present.Ukraine Cease-FireAfter five months of fighting and at least 2,600 deaths, Ukraine and Russia\u2019s proxy militias in Ukraine\u2019s Donbass region agreed to a cease-fire on Friday. That was obviously good news for residents of Donetsk, Luhansk and surrounding regions that have been devastated by fighting since separatist rebels backed by Russia seized control and declared \u201cpeoples\u2019 republics\u201d in April.Ukrainian reports said the agreement called for a departure by rebels from the administrative buildings they controlled, amnesty to rebels who laid down their arms and did not commit serious crimes, a prisoner exchange and a 10-kilometer buffer zone along the Russia-Ukraine border. For the future, the accord said power would be decentralized and the Russian language protected.But many details remained unclear. A central question was whether the truce would create a \u201cfrozen conflict,\u201d with details left unresolved and a Russian threat permanently hanging over southeastern Ukraine. The announcement of the cease-fire coincided with a NATO meeting in Wales at which the allies took a stern stance toward Russia. It included announcing the creation of a 4,000-member NATO rapid reaction force to be headquartered in a yet to be chosen site in Eastern Europe, neighboring Russia; imposing new economic sanctions against Russian officials, banks and enterprises; and inviting President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine to Wales to meet with the allies. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, most likely had the NATO session in mind when he first indicated on the eve of the meeting that a cease-fire was imminent and then announced it on Friday, figuring that a halt to fighting would weaken Europe\u2019s resolve to order new measures against Russia that hurt its own economies.At a news conference in Newport, Wales, President Obama said he was \u201chopeful, but, based on past experience, also skeptical\u201d about the cease-fire. In any case, he said, the United States and Europe were finalizing measures to \u201cdeepen and broaden\u201d sanctions and to provide security assistance to Ukraine.Marshaling allied unity against Russia and reassuring Russia\u2019s neighbors, especially the small Baltic States, was an important part of Mr. Obama\u2019s mission. Stopping in Estonia before the NATO meeting, he promised that the United States and other allies would fight for any ally that came under attack, and he repeated the pledge in a joint op-ed article with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain published in The Times of London.France took one of the more dramatic steps against Moscow when it announced that it would not schedule delivery of the first of the two Mistral-class amphibious warships that Russia had ordered. It was not immediately clear whether France intended to scrap the entire sale, but even if not, the announcement was an act of political courage by the Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, given the number of jobs at stake.Vow to Eradicate ISISTangential to the meeting in Wales, but not as part of it, the Obama administration announced that it had formed a coalition to battle ISIS, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The plan called on the United States \u2014 for now alone \u2014 to bomb the jihadis from the air while the coalition bolstered moderate forces in Iraq and Syria. The American hope was to include as many countries as possible in the coalition, including Middle Eastern states like Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the policy was not just to contain but rather to eradicate ISIS. \u201cThey\u2019re an ambitious, avowed, genocidal, territorial-grabbing, caliphate-desiring quasi-state with an irregular army, and leaving them in some capacity intact anywhere would leave a cancer in place that will ultimately come back to haunt us,\u201d he declared.Mr. Kerry and other officials ruled out boots on the ground, and the effort to support the Iraqi Army, the Kurdish militia and moderate forces within Syria appeared to be still in the planning stages. Words of a Slain JournalistNearly 1,000 mourners gathered at Temple Beth Am in Pinecrest, Fla., on Friday for a memorial service for Steven Sotloff, 31, the second American freelance journalist to be decapitated by ISIS. There, a cousin read a letter from Mr. Sotloff smuggled out by a former cellmate in May.\u201cPlease know I\u2019m O.K.,\u201d it read. \u201cLive your life to the fullest and fight to be happy. ...

An increasing number of Jews, if still relatively modest in total, are now migrating to Israel. Others describe \u201cno go\u201d zones in Muslim districts of many European cities where Jews dare not travel.But there is also concern about what some see as an insidious \u201csofter\u201d anti-Jewish bias, which they fear is creeping into the European mainstream and undermining the postwar consensus to root out anti-Semitism. Now the question is whether a subtle societal shift is occurring that has made anti-Jewish remarks or behavior more acceptable.\u201cThe fear is that now things are blatantly being said openly, and no one is batting an eyelid,\u201d said Jessica Frommer, 36, a secular Jew who works for a nonprofit organization in Brussels. \u201cModern Europe is based on stopping what happened in the Second World War. And now 70 years later, people standing near the European Parliament are shouting, \u2018Death to Jews!' \u201dThis is not the Europe of 1938. French leaders have strongly condemned the violence. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany this month led a rally against anti-Semitism in Berlin at which she told Germans, \u201cIt is our national and civic duty to fight anti-Semitism.\u201dYet as European support for the Palestinian cause and criticism of Israel have hardened, many Jews describe a blurring of distinctions between being anti-Israel and being anti-Jew.With Europe still shaking from a populist backlash against fiscal austerity, some Jews speak of feeling politically isolated, without an ideological home. Many left-wing political parties are anti-Israel. Many right-wing parties, some with anti-Semitic origins, are extremist and virulently anti-immigrant. And many Jews who have voted with the Socialist Party in France and Belgium worry that those parties are weak and becoming more dependent on fast-growing Muslim voting blocs.Even among those inclined to condemn racism in any form, fighting anti-Semitism is no longer seen as a priority, with Jews often perceived as privileged compared with Muslims and other minorities confronted with discrimination.Many younger Muslims often seem alienated in Europe. Struggling to find work and frustrated by their lack of acceptance, a small but vocal group of them has become inflamed by the politics of the Middle East, especially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.European officials are deeply concerned that radical Islam, nurtured in the Middle East, could take root in Europe. Mehdi Nemmouche, a French Muslim arrested in connection with the killings at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, fought as a jihadist in Syria. A French journalist who was held captive in Syria until April said Mr. Nemmouche had been one of his torturers.\u201cWe are a microcosm of the Middle East,\u201d said Philip Carmel, European policy director for the European Jewish Congress. \u201cThe Middle East is being imported into Europe.\u201dVisits to some of the flash points of the summer violence revealed a picture of what Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France has called a \u201cnew anti-Semitism.\u201d In Sarcelles, the Paris suburb where pro-Palestinian protests spiraled into riots, the alienation of France\u2019s immigrants and minorities lies just below the surface. In Brussels, the headquarters of the European Union, some secular Jews described a changing atmosphere and questioned whether it was time to leave.And in Wuppertal, Germany, a city proud of its commitment to religious and ethnic diversity, the attempted firebombing of a synagogue exposed underlying tensions that became even clearer this month when, unexpectedly, a group of Muslim men patrolled a neighborhood wearing makeshift uniforms that said \u201cShariah Police.\u201dThe French Melting PotOn the afternoon of July 20, a siege mentality gripped Little Jerusalem, the Jewish commercial district in Sarcelles. A crowd of young Jewish men had gathered at the synagogue as a pro-Palestinian protest was held a few blocks away. France\u2019s Interior Ministry had tried to ban the protest, which spun into a riot. Cars were burning. Young men were throwing rocks as the police fired tear gas. A Jewish-owned pharmacy was set on fire.\u201cWe were all concentrated here to defend the synagogue,\u201d said Levi Cohen Solal, 21, who joined the human cordon outside the synagogue. \u201cEverybody was scared.\u201dBlocked by the police, the rioters never reached the synagogue, but Sarcelles became a televised symbol of France\u2019s new anti-Semitism \u2014 a depiction many local residents did not recognize. A working-class suburb where generations of immigrants are packed into government housing, Sarcelles is a melting pot of religions and ethnicities, where many people speak of a largely peaceful coexistence.To many residents, the demonstration, which was organized by outsiders on social media, was an indictment not of Sarcelles, but of France. Youth unemployment is soaring, especially in immigrant havens like Sarcelles, and many French-born children and grandchildren of immigrants have become alienated from French society.\u201cThey have a real hatred against the state,\u201d said Bassi Konat\u00e9, a city social worker, who added that many of the protesters came from poorer districts nearby. \u201cA big proportion of these people feel neglected. A lot of these people don\u2019t know anything about Gaza. But they want to confront the police.\u201d\u201cFor the past four or five years, we have felt a growing insecurity,\u201d said David Harroch, who runs a Jewish bookstore in Little Jerusalem. \u201cMy customers tell me how worried they are about the climate here, the situation. A lot of people have left.\u201dIsraeli officials predict that as many as 6,000 Jews will migrate from France this year, a stark reversal from the 1950s, when Sephardic Jews, Arabs and others began arriving in Sarcelles from North Africa. A booming economy made work plentiful.But during France\u2019s recession in the late 1970s, the city\u2019s ethnic groups became pitted against one another for limited public resources. Rahsaan Maxwell, a political scientist who has studied Sarcelles\u2019s ethnic groups, said the Sephardic Jews had incurred resentment because they were better organized and able to mobilize politically to win certain perks from the elected local council: a special Jewish section in the local cemetery, widening of a road in front of the main synagogue, kosher offerings at an annual city dinner for the elderly, and segregated swimming hours for men and women at a city pool.In his 2012 book, \u201cEthnic Minority Migrants in Britain and France,\u201d Mr. Maxwell wrote that Sephardic Jews became so influential that \u201cwhen Israel was at war with Lebanon in the early 1980s, Sephardic Jewish activists in Sarcelles were aggressive about using it as a litmus test for local politicians to see whether they supported Israel and the Jewish people.\u201dYet many Jews and Muslims born in that era grew up together without rancor in government housing. Not far from one of the city\u2019s storefront mosques is a small Superette grocery owned by a Muslim family. One of the owners, Abdel Badaz, recently stood behind the counter with a childhood friend, Micka\u00ebl Berdah, 36, a Jew whose family emigrated decades ago from Tunisia. They both criticized the riot as the work of young troublemakers.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve grown up in the neighborhood, and you know everybody, there isn\u2019t that kind of hate,\u201d Mr. Berdah said. \u201cWhen there is that kind of hate, it is at the roots, something about the way parents have educated their children.\u201dLater, near the grocery, a tall teenager pedaled his bicycle toward two journalists and shouted at them to leave, saying the media had lied about Sarcelles. The youth, Diakit\u00e9 Ismael, 19, the French-born son of Senegalese immigrants, soon calmed down and, like others, argued that there was no animosity in Sarcelles between local Muslims and Jews.\u201cLook,\u201d he said, as a bearded Jewish man in a dark suit and skullcap walked by, \u201cthere\u2019s one.\u201dBut when asked about Gaza, Mr. Ismael became agitated, rambling and warning that the world was hurtling toward a catastrophe. He said he had seen video of an Israeli bomb hitting a funeral in Gaza. \u201cSomehow, some Jews control politics, information, business and finance,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the Jews here. I\u2019m talking about Jews in general.\u201d\u201cJews, in general,\u201d he added, \u201conly let you see what they want you to see.\u201dIn Brussels, Heightened AlertMusic rose from the center of Brussels on Sunday, with joggers and bicyclists moving freely down city streets as the seat of the European Union held its annual no-car day. It had the giddy air of a street fair, if less so for the city\u2019s Jewish organizations, which the police had placed under heightened security since two recent incidents.The first happened the previous Sunday, Sept. 14, which marked the European Day of Jewish Culture. As people gathered to dedicate a plaque at a Holocaust memorial, youths hurled stones and bottles until the police arrived. Three days later, a fire erupted on an upper floor of a synagogue in the city\u2019s Anderlecht district; the authorities are investigating the incident as arson.It was the May shooting at the Jewish Museum in Brussels \u2014 and the subsequent arrest of Mr. Nemmouche \u2014 that attracted international attention, as four people were killed, including two Israelis. But there have been smaller incidents that received less notice: a Turkish shop owner in Li\u00e8ge who posted a sign saying he would serve dogs but not Jews, a voice on the intercom of a commuter train that announced a stop as \u201cAuschwitz\u201d and ordered all Jews to get off.\u201cThis summer, I started to see the world in a different way,\u201d said Marco Mosseri, 31, a native Italian who works in the automotive industry in Brussels. \u201cI was scared. I spent several nights without sleep. For the first time, I was thinking that maybe I could die from my religion.\u201dWith its chocolate shops, Trappist beers and gray gloom, Brussels is the center of Europe\u2019s sprawling bureaucracy, a symbol of the loathed policies of austerity. But Brussels also embodies the demographics transforming much of urban Europe, with generations of Muslim immigrants and their descendants now representing roughly a quarter of the population.And since the start of the conflict in Gaza this summer, many describe social media, especially Facebook, as a swamp of hatred.\u201cI have friends who are never political and they are posting things about Gaza every day,\u201d said Ms. Frommer, the employee of the nonprofit organization. \u201cIt seems like an obsession. Is your obsession because you want to save children, or because you have a problem with Jews?\u201dIn a city so devoted to politics, the issue of Israel can seem unavoidable to some Jews, even those who strive to be apolitical or tend to be critical of Israeli policy. Ms. Frommer grew up in Brussels, but then left for college in Britain, followed by a long stint working in Cambodia. When she returned to Brussels four years ago, she was struck by how much more polarized life seemed. Her Jewish friends were sticking closer together as office chatter now sometimes bore a sharper edge.This summer, one of her Belgian colleagues repeatedly mentioned the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cHe would often try to bring up the subject when I tried not to,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the subject would shift from Israel to Jews. Then it was, \u2018Were there really six million Jews killed in the Second World War?\u2019 \u201dNor was the comment isolated. There have been signs that anti-Jewish sentiment transcended the immediate backlash against the Gaza war. In Hungary, the rise of the far-right Jobbik party has brought concerns that anti-Semitic views are gaining mainstream traction.In Brussels, several pro-Palestinian marches were held this summer, most of which were peaceful, but a few bore an anti-Semitic edge, including shouts of \u201cDeath to Jews!\u201d While Belgian politicians quickly condemned the shooting at the Jewish Museum, some Jews felt the response to the protests, including that of the center-left Socialists, was tepid at best.\u201cThe Socialist Party is afraid, because of the votes here in Belgium,\u201d said Dr. Maurice Sosnowski, an anesthesiologist and prominent Jewish leader in Brussels. \u201cIn Belgium, they are not willing to speak loudly, because there are a lot of Muslims.\u201dIn the nonprofit world of Brussels, the politics of Israel, which some on the European left view as essentially the pursuit of racist objectives against Palestinians, have made it difficult to keep the fight against anti-Semitism high on the agenda.\u201cNobody comes,\u201d she said, adding that she has started pairing the sessions together.\u201cYou have, basically, a golden opportunity for the right fringe to blame it on Muslims and claim innocence,\u201d Mr. Privot said.On Sunday, as much of the city enjoyed the car-free streets of Brussels, a group of secular Jews gathered at the headquarters of CEJI with a visiting journalist to discuss ordinary life for them. Because of the heightened security alert, three plainclothes police officers were stationed in the lobby.\u201cI would never be able to vote for someone like that,\u201d Ms. Frommer said. \u201cBut some people are now. It is more and more legitimate to vote right wing.\u201dShe and others said that many friends were talking of moving to Canada or to the United States, if not Israel, even though they are uncertain whether their anxieties are fully justified.\u201cThese are people with good jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd life is comfortable here. The big question is: Should we be paranoid or not?\u201dAnxiety in GermanyThe news spread quickly in the early morning of July 29 among the Jews of Wuppertal, Germany. Someone had tried to firebomb the city\u2019s synagogue. The devices had failed to ignite, leaving the building with little damage, unlike the collective psyche of its members.\u201cFor Jews in Germany, especially for us, this has very, very deep meaning,\u201d said Artour Gourari, a local businessman and synagogue member. \u201cSynagogues are burning again in Germany in the night.\u201dNowhere in Europe has the postwar imperative to fight anti-Semitism been more complete \u2014 and more intertwined with national redemption \u2014 than in Germany. In Wuppertal, a manufacturing center, the city\u2019s synagogue was burned in 1938 during the two-day rampage known as Kristallnacht, when an anti-Jewish pogrom swept across Nazi Germany.After the war ended, Wuppertal\u2019s Jewish community had no synagogue and, with only 60 members, seemed destined for extinction. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the German government opened the country to persecuted Soviet Jews, and soon refugees from Uzbekistan, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia had settled in Wuppertal. The local Jewish population reached 2,500. The presidents of Germany and Israel attended the 2002 inauguration of the new synagogue.Now a police van is stationed around the clock in a small park across from the synagogue. The police have arrested three suspects in the firebombing attack, all Palestinians, including one from Gaza, as well as a 17-year-old refugee. The refugee has lived in Wuppertal for two years, among the different Muslim communities of Turks, North Africans and asylum seekers from Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.Until the synagogue attack, Wuppertal officials had taken pride in the peaceful coexistence of so many religions and ethnicities. Many of the older Muslims had arrived in the 1960s for work but assumed they would eventually return to their home countries. Now a third generation, born in Germany, is growing up with different expectations, as well as a sense of alienation.\u201cThey have to justify why they don\u2019t fully belong to the society,\u201d said Samir Bouaissa, a local Muslim leader.One of the local high schools is named after a famous Jewish poet, Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler, and is commonly called \u201cThe School Without Racism.\u201d Yet two recent graduates described rising tensions in the multiethnic student body, including resentment by some Muslim students over a sister-school arrangement with a school in Israel. This summer, during the Gaza crisis, several Muslim adolescents began circulating anti-Israel posts on social media.This one \u201cgot shot yesterday,\u201d said a Facebook post from Gaza shared by a student. It showed a photograph of a female Israeli soldier and added an obscenity. The student added his own postscript: \u201cYou get what you deserve.\u201dAntonia Lammertz, 19, a recent graduate, said only a small minority of students were extreme but that a softer bias was common even among the mainstream. \u201cIn my school, to be called a Jew was to be cursed, or insulted,\u201d she said, noting a problem that officials have tried to root out at many German schools.City religious leaders reacted quickly after the synagogue attack. Imams and Christian ministers rushed to the building to pledge support. More than 300 people came to a hurriedly organized peace meeting the next day.\u201cPeople were shocked,\u201d Mr. Bouaissa said. \u201cA threat against one of our religious houses is a threat against all of us.\u201dEarlier this month, the city\u2019s religious leaders, including many Muslims, got another shock: a small group of men, one only 19, spent an evening walking through a Muslim neighborhood, lecturing young people about vices like gambling (while apparently not mentioning Jews). They were wearing orange jackets that read \u201cShariah Police.\u201d The leader was a Salafist, Sven Lau, who called the event a one-time publicity move to stir more \u201cIslamic discussion.\u201dThat, it did. Local prosecutors filed charges. German officials, including Ms. Merkel, reacted with a blend of shock, indignation and alarm, while mainstream Muslims also protested. And local neo-Nazis responded with their own patrol, dressing in red pullovers and pledging to protect the public from Islamists.For Leonid Goldberg, the community leader of the Wuppertal synagogue, the emergence of a radical Islamic fringe is less a surprise. Just four days before the synagogue attack, someone had spray-painted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d on the front wall of the building. In recent years, Mr. Goldberg has used a celebration of Rosh Hashana at the synagogue \u2014 an event attended by elected officials and religious leaders of the city, including Muslims \u2014 to warn about rising anti-Semitism among extremist Muslims in the city.\u201cNo one wanted to hear that,\u201d he said.An article on Sept. 24 about the rising alarm over a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe erroneously included an attack in Sweden among examples of anti-Semitic violence. Although the police suspected that an attack in July in which a man with an Israeli flag in his window was beaten with iron pipes was a hate crime, they concluded that was not the case. (An investigation showed that the victim was not Jewish and that the flag might have been unrelated to the attack.) This correction was delayed for research.Aurelien Breeden and Ma\u00efa de la Baume contributed reporting from Sarcelles, and Katarina Johannsen from Wuppertal, Germany.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Putin Urges \u2018Statehood\u2019 Talks for Eastern Ukraine", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called on Ukraine on Sunday to begin talks on \u201cthe statehood\u201d of that country\u2019s rebellious southeast, a vague and provocative turn of phrase he used while demanding that the Ukrainian government negotiate directly with pro-Russian separatists.Western governments have accused Russia of backing the separatists with arms and fighters and of sending Russian troops to lead a counteroffensive in Ukraine over the past week that threatened Mariupol, an important port city, and left thousands of government troops encircled.\u201cWe must immediately begin substantive, meaningful negotiations, not on technical questions, but about the political organization of society and the statehood of Ukraine\u2019s southeast for the unconditional securing of the legal interests of the people who live there,\u201d Mr. Putin said.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\u2019s spokesman, said that Mr. Putin was not calling for independence for eastern Ukraine. Rather, he said, the Russian leader was seeking inclusive negotiations that would provide greater autonomy for the southeast as it remained a part of the country.The self-proclaimed independent republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, which held haphazard, self-organized referendums on independence in May, have repeatedly requested Russian recognition, protection and annexation. Although the Kremlin annexed Crimea in March, it has for months avoided formally recognizing the separatist states.In the interview, Mr. Putin veered between veiled threats and demands for negotiations to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. He said that country should cease hostilities immediately and replenish its supplies of natural gas, which are piped in from Russia, to survive the coming winter.\u201cI think that nobody thinks of that anymore, except Russia,\u201d Mr. Putin said of the winter. \u201cThere are ways of helping resolve the issue. First, to immediately stop hostilities and start restoring the necessary infrastructure. To start replenishing reserves, conducting the necessary repair operations and preparing for the cold season.\u201dMr. Putin, however, gave rare praise to President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine after a meeting with him in Minsk, Belarus, calling Mr. Poroshenko \u201ca partner with whom dialogue can be conducted.\u201dHe called for the militias to open corridors to allow Ukrainian troops to retreat, and the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, said he would comply. Mr. Zakharchenko said, however, that the Ukrainian forces must surrender their artillery and heavy vehicles.Ukraine\u2019s Security Services said the men had been detained about 20 miles from the border and were evidence of the presence of Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. Russia claimed that the men had strayed into Ukrainian territory by accident during a routine border patrol.\u201cThe negotiations were very difficult,\u201d said Aleksei Ragozin, the deputy commander of Russia\u2019s Airborne Forces, according to the RIA Novosti state news agency. \u201cHowever, common sense triumphed, and all ended well. The most important thing is that our guys are back with us, in Russia.\u201dPro-Russian separatists also said that they had released several hundred Ukrainian regular and irregular soldiers on Sunday who had been captured during last week\u2019s offensive.In Mariupol, the industrial port city now within the sights of the pro-Russian militants, an obstacle to any recognition of the separatist government was on full display on Sunday: Large parts of the Donetsk region were still inhabited by overt supporters of the Ukrainian central government, and now beyond the control of their organization.Unlike the unrecognized pro-Russian enclaves of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Transnistria that were formed in the 1990s with the backing of Russian peacekeeping forces, the borders of the self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk are now amorphous, and most of these regions\u2019 territories, in spite of the recent counteroffensive, are under government control.On the eastern edge of Mariupol, a city of about half a million people on a bluff overlooking sunflower fields, workers from the city\u2019s Soviet-legacy steel plants and a few hundred volunteers were digging trenches and bunkers and filling sandbags to defend against the expected attack.Men in hard hats and the gray and red overalls of the Azov Steel Works filled sandbags, stopping to wipe their brows in the midday sun. Asked why he was laying the steel slabs on the fortification, one man replied that he wanted to show Mr. Putin that he would not be welcome in Mariupol.The workers arrived with flatbed trucks carrying yellow backhoes and mobile cranes to hoist over the tops of bunkers gigantic 22-foot by 7-foot slabs of raw steel fresh from the blast furnaces, each nine inches thick and weighing 25 tons. \u201cEverybody is trying to help in their own way,\u201d said Vasili Sisentsov, a steelworker.Mariupol, considered a solidly pro-Ukrainian city, never fell under full control of pro-Russian groups. As elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, the separatist movement failed to attract the urban middle class, but in Mariupol it also lost the backbone of the community and local economy, the steelworkers, who feared that their plants would close and jobs would be lost in an isolated, unrecognized republic.\u201cThe Donetsk People\u2019s Republic didn\u2019t work out in our town,\u201d Mr. Sisentsov said. \u201cThey were all drug addicts, homeless people and criminals. It was clear it would never succeed.\u201d Last spring, steelworkers, with the support of the factory management, formed volunteer foot patrols in the city to drive out the pro-Russian agitators.Now, the mood is more uncertain, he said. Families with children have left, he said, and the steel slabs the workers were unloading were more symbolic than militarily useful, as the fields beyond were wide open for tanks to cross. The soldiers who seized the border town of Novoazovsk, 27 miles away, who claim to be from the Army of Novorossiya, say they intend to capture Mariupol, but have not said when.At one point, a man drove by the volunteers and steelworkers digging in at the checkpoint, yelling out of his car window: \u201cIt\u2019s worthless! Russia is coming!\u201dAndrei Markov, a grocery store manager, showed up with his son, Artur, 13, carrying work gloves and asking the soldiers where to dig. \u201cI came to help my country, to help my city,\u201d he said. Other residents arrived and asked the soldiers: \u201cGuys, what do you need? We\u2019ll buy it for you.\u201dA few soldiers stood about, nervously watching the road to the east. Denis, a private who declined to give his last name, said he had been assigned to crowd-control duties on Maidan Square in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital, last winter, when protesters hurled insults, cobblestones and homemade bombs at him for weeks. He said he disagreed with the protesters\u2019 methods and felt vilified for having served on the square during that period, but would nonetheless stand his post at the edge of Mariupol now.\u201cNo matter what this country\u2019s problems, and no matter how it treats me, it\u2019s my country and I am a soldier,\u201d he said. \u201cI will defend it.\u201dAndrew Roth reported from Moscow, and Andrew E. Kramer from Mariupol, Ukraine. Neil MacFarquhar contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Georgia, Politics Moves Past Just Black and White", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStates in PlayLAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. \u2014 A gated community of regal brick homes with impeccable landscaping and $450,000 price tags might seem an unlikely place for a voter-registration drive. The neighborhood, with its swimming pool and tennis courts, evokes stability and a sense of having arrived.But when Maria Palacios, 24, a part-time canvasser for a Latino rights advocacy group, knocked on doors on a sweltering summer afternoon, she was greeted by those who had never cast ballots, immigrants like herself \u2014 newcomers from Korea, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and Mexico, all faces of a changing Georgia.\u201cThere are a lot of people here from Mexico like us,\u201d said Hector Velazco, an information technology consultant, telling Ms. Palacios that he and his wife are awaiting naturalization so they can vote. \u201cIt\u2019s not only workers to mow the grass.\u201dThis is the new Georgia, a state whose transformed economy has spawned a population boom and demographic shifts that are slowly altering its politics. With African-Americans coming in large numbers from other states, and emerging immigrant communities like this one in Lawrenceville, Georgia is less white and less rural than it was a decade ago.Black Democrats have long held power in Atlanta, but in the state legislature Republicans \u2014 who are nearly all white \u2014 outnumber Democrats two to one. Political debates center on issues like curbing illegal immigration and expanding gun rights. And many of Georgia\u2019s new immigrants do not or cannot vote. If Democrats are to win statewide in November, they must increase turnout among minorities, especially blacks, and bring back moderate whites, especially women.\u201cGeorgia is a conservative state \u2014 it was a conservative state when the Democrats were in control,\u201d said Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican who has been in public office nearly 40 years. \u201cThat Georgia is all of a sudden changing to be a different state, I think, is a myth. Georgia is continuing to be what it has been, which is a growth state with a diverse economy and a diverse population.\u201dIn 1980, Georgia was what Mathew Hauer, a demographer at the University of Georgia, calls \u201ca black-and-white state.\u201d Whites were 72 percent of the population and blacks, 26 percent. Now, Georgia\u2019s population has more than doubled, to nearly 10 million. By last year, the state was 55 percent white, 31 percent black, 9 percent Latino (up from 1 percent in 1980) and nearly 4 percent Asian.\u201cOur motto is: \u2018A world of places in one place,'\u2009\u201d Mr. Allen said.On Gwinnett\u2019s main thoroughfare, Pleasant Hill Road, a giant Asian market, Assi Plaza, occupies a former Walmart; on Saturday mornings, it bustles with shoppers, picking over lychee, Korean melon and 10 varieties of shrimp, as tilapia swim in a tank. Honor boxes carry four different Korean-language newspapers.Down the road at the Santa Fe Mall, a former outlet center converted into a Hispanic market, retailers sell bright-colored cowboy boots and frilly quincea\u00f1era gowns. A Spanish-language radio station broadcasts from here; its Mexican-born general manager, Franco Vera, moved to Georgia from Chicago.\u201cI love Georgia,\u201d Mr. Vera declared. Asked why, he searched for words to convey its energy and growth. \u201cIt\u2019s the boom!\u201dThat boom has its roots in what Rajeev Dhawan, an economic forecaster at Georgia State University, calls \u201cthe three Ts\u201d \u2014 transportation, tourism and telecommunications \u2014 industries that he said were \u201cturbocharged\u201d in the 1990s and still drive the state\u2019s economy, somewhat more slowly, today.Those industries were hit hard by the dot-com bust and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and home construction \u2014 which kept Georgia humming through the early 2000s \u2014 was crippled by the recession. Unemployment is now 7.8 percent, the second highest in the nation, behind Mississippi. Yet after a slow recovery, economists say, Georgia is bouncing back; the state added 83,400 jobs last year.Traveling the state in this midterm election season, it is possible to see the pull and tug over which way Georgia will go. Its population may be shifting faster than its politics.A Center of ChangeDot Padgett, 87, and a lifelong Democrat, stepped onto the front porch of her century-old home in the Atlanta suburb of Douglasville, carrying sweet tea in tall glasses and sugar wafers on a silver tray. She sat down in a white painted rocker to talk about how her native Georgia has changed.In 1976, Mrs. Padgett helped lead the volunteer \u201cPeanut Brigade\u201d that ushered Jimmy Carter to the White House, then worked in Washington as his deputy chief of protocol. That was when Georgia was solidly Democratic, before whites and conservatives, alarmed at what they saw as the party\u2019s liberal tilt on cultural issues, fled to the Republican Party.So when Mr. Perdue and Mr. Isakson came to a little plaza in downtown Douglasville, Mrs. Padgett dashed over to give the senator a quick peck on the cheek, but slipped out before Mr. Perdue arrived. She backs Ms. Nunn \u2014 partly out of loyalty to Ms. Nunn\u2019s father, Sam, a centrist Democrat who served in the Senate from 1973 to 1997. \u201cI think there\u2019s a little conservative streak in her also,\u201d Mrs. Padgett said.As to whether she voted for President Obama, she leaned back in her rocker, arched her eyebrows and reiterated her own words.\u201cI am a Democrat,\u201d she said coyly, \u201cwho will vote Republican.\u201dDouglasville and its surrounding county, Douglas, are part of the housing boom that has remade the metro region. Two decades ago, downtown Douglasville was surrounded by farmland.Douglas County\u2019s black population rose more than 200 percent from 2000 to 2010; its Democratic Party is experiencing a revival. More than a decade ago, white Republicans held all five seats on the County Commission; today there are three white Republicans and two black Democrats. Mitt Romney won Georgia in 2012 with 53 percent of the vote, but Mr. Obama won Douglas County.Among the newcomers is Dalia Racine, an African-American prosecutor running for county district attorney. She was born in New York, attended high school in Virginia, college in Florida, law school in Atlanta. She and her husband moved to Douglasville, in search of a bigger home in which to raise a family, when they discovered they were having twins.A friend recently hosted a house party for her; a diverse, though mostly African-American, crowd attended, nibbling on wrap sandwiches, sweets and fruit.\u201cHighly qualified, professional candidates like myself \u2014 we\u2019re able to throw our hats in the ring right now,\u201d Ms. Racine said. \u201cThe voters are aware of it. The media\u2019s aware of it. Republicans are aware of it.\u201dBlack and WhiteA marble obelisk with a soldier on top \u2014 a monument to Confederate veterans \u2014 greets visitors to Waycross, on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. If Atlanta, four hours north, is the new Georgia, Waycross is steeped in the old.On a recent morning, a small crowd of several dozen Democratic enthusiasts, mostly blacks, gathered in an old railway depot, where their Senate nominee, Ms. Nunn, was to speak. Among the first in line was Johnny Lee Roper, 77, who serves on the City Council in nearby Douglas, dressed in olive green suit, suspenders and black straw hat.\u201cAll us people of color believe that Michelle is going to be our liberator,\u201d he said.Ms. Nunn\u2019s appearance in this city of roughly 14,000 people was a reminder that she needs every black vote she can get \u2014 and of how race still governs politics in much of Georgia. The handful of whites in the crowd included a woman who gave her name only as Glenda; she did not want her Republican neighbors to learn she was there.She is worried about the economy, she said; she gave up her job as a medical office manager when her mother was ill and gets by cleaning houses. A campaign worker asked her to take a lawn sign; she resisted. As a Democrat, she said, \u201cI\u2019m shunned enough.\u201dSeated at his paper-strewn wooden desk, Mr. Williams echoed Republicans across Georgia. He is worried about the rising federal debt, angry over the Obama administration\u2019s failure to secure \u201cour porous border to the south\u201d and feels that a vote for Ms. Nunn would be a vote to keep Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, in power.\u201cI think the Democrats are taking us the wrong way,\u201d Mr. Williams said, \u201cand most of my readers \u2014 with the exception of my black readers \u2014 feel that way.\u201dBroadening PerspectivesOn the wall of her cluttered office across the street from the state capitol, Stacey Y. Abrams, the Democratic leader of the Georgia House, keeps two giant maps of Georgia\u2019s legislative districts. In each district held by a Democrat, she has posted a tiny black-and-white photo of the lawmaker.There are 180 districts, but just 60 photos, most clustered around Atlanta. All told, not counting a black Republican recently defeated in a primary, there are 51 minorities in the Georgia House; 49 are Democrats.\u201cOur caucus is 80 percent African-American; the Republican caucus is 98 percent white,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sustainable model.\u201dThe effort, though officially nonpartisan, is controversial; Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, Brian Kemp, a Republican, is investigating the project, alleging fraud; project leaders accuse Mr. Kemp of voter suppression and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dYet there are hints that the conversation in Georgia is taking on a different tone.Immigration rights advocates have taken heart in the words of State Senator Tommie Williams, a tree farmer and former member of the Republican leadership, who favors passing a state version of the Dream Act to help young people brought here illegally by their parents gain a path to legal residency.And Representative Pak, the Korean-American Republican \u2014 who voted with his party on the Arizona-style immigration bill \u2014 helped block a measure to require English-only drivers\u2019 tests. He says Republicans can succeed in embracing immigrants, and prides himself on broadening their perspective.\u201cWe were at a caucus meeting, and nobody was raising this issue about how this will impact first-generation immigrants,\u201d Mr. Pak said of the English-only bill. \u201cAnd afterward, a lot of the caucus members were like, \u2018You know what? I didn\u2019t even really think about that; I\u2019m glad you said that.\u2019 And I was able to put an amendment on that killed the bill.\u201dImmigration and the VoteLatinos in Georgia, as in much of the country, are the fastest growing minority.\u201cThe Latino vote continues to grow,\u201d Jerry Gonzalez declared, over lunch at a Caribbean restaurant in Lawrenceville. \u201cIt\u2019s grown from 10,000 in 2003 to well over 220,000 right now \u2014 that\u2019s estimated. There\u2019s over 80,000 Latinos that are eligible, not yet registered.\u201d An estimated 600,000 eligible blacks are also unregistered. \u201cSo what we are doing today,\u201d he said, \u201cis really important.\u201dCarl Griffin of Waycross, Ga., adjusted his University of Georgia cap after Michelle Nunn, the Democrat seeking a United States Senate seat from Georgia, autographed it. Mr. Griffin, a lifelong Waycross resident, asked Ms. Nunn to sign his cap beside the autograph of Vince Dooley, a longtime football coach and athletic director at the university.Its aim, beyond bolstering Latino voting power, is to build support for a bipartisan immigration overhaul, stalled in Washington. For Ms. Palacios, that is personal.Her parents, as California migrant workers, brought her to the United States illegally when she was 2 months old; the family later settled in Georgia, where many Latinos work in poultry processing plants. When she graduated from high school, Ms. Palacios applied to college; lacking papers, she was required to pay out of-state tuition. So she followed her parents\u2019 path, weighing chicken tenders on an assembly line.Eventually she returned to Mexico, paid the United States government a fine and came back to Georgia legally. Today she is a senior and debate champion at the University of North Georgia who dreams of becoming an immigration rights lawyer and seeking public office. \u201cHad I been born here,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d be looking to run for president.\u201dBut Ms. Palacios is not yet a citizen. And so, like many new Georgians, there is one thing she still cannot do: vote.States in Play: Articles in this series will examine\nthe voters and issues in seven\nstates with the most competitive\nSenate races.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Boris Johnson\u2019s Blond Ambition", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 It is perhaps appropriate that one of the few British politicians who can claim global reach was not born in Britain. Though quintessentially English in manner and upbringing \u2014 he was educated at Eton and Oxford \u2014 Boris Johnson is, in fact, a native of New York City, where he was born in June 1964 (his family moved back to England soon after).As a child, he declared his ambition to be \u201cworld king,\u201d and even looked into Article II of the Constitution to assess his prospects as a presidential contender (he still holds an American passport). In adulthood, however, Boris Johnson has always had his eyes fixed on Downing Street.Boris \u2014 nobody calls him Mr. Johnson \u2014 is now in his second term as the mayor of London, which is arguably the most prominent political office in the land after the prime minister\u2019s. The world was introduced to his contagious enthusiasm, stand-up routine and shock of blond hair during the 2012 Olympics, when he performed as master of ceremonies at the London Games with the civic pride of Pericles and the slapstick of Jerry Lewis.But this was far from the summit of his ambition. For Boris recently announced his hope to return to the House of Commons at next May\u2019s general election.Bear with me on the technicalities: He must first seek selection as the Conservative Party\u2019s parliamentary candidate for the solidly Tory West London constituency he has targeted. It is a safe bet that he will clear that hurdle, since local Conservative associations love celebrity candidates. His path back to the Commons, where he used to represent Henley, a picturesque small town on the Thames, to the west of London, should then be straightforward.Why do these parochial affairs matter? Because once he is an M.P. again, Boris will become eligible for the leadership of his party \u2014 and thus a potential prime minister.Imagine, now, this irrepressible figure transposed to the Group of 8 summit chamber, or with his finger on the nuclear button, or in the Downing Street equivalent of the White House Situation Room, deciding whether or not to send British troops to war. Makes you think, doesn\u2019t it?I should disclose that I succeeded Boris as the editor of The Spectator magazine in 2006, and I know from years of familiarity that he is more than capable of handling pressure \u2014 as he did, as London\u2019s mayor, during the English riots of 2011. The question is whether the Conservative Party is similarly persuaded of his competence and sang-froid.Charisma and amiability can get you a long way in politics. But they are merely necessary, not sufficient, if you want to reach the very top.True, no figure since Margaret Thatcher has transfixed the party as completely: The sheer force of his personality and rhetorical skills have seen to that. But charm can be beguiling. Many Conservatives project their own convictions onto the blond screen of Boris\u2019s ambitions, assuming he is something he is not.And what are his political convictions? In his championing of low taxes and his euroskepticism, he is in tune with the Conservative right. But in his liberalism on social issues, he is most certainly not. Boris is also pro-immigration, and was a strong supporter of same-sex marriage. He is not the reactionary some Tories imagine him to be. If Boris did become leader, there would be disappointments, sulks and rifts. (Rather like the Tea Party movement, the Tory right lives to be betrayed.)All this may become a matter of pressing concern after the general election. Even if David Cameron wins with a small parliamentary majority, or forms another coalition government, the presence of his longtime friend and rival in the Commons would change the political landscape significantly. But it is also possible that Mr. Cameron will lose in May. If that happens, he will stand down as Tory leader and there will be a race to succeed him. Boris would be a strong contender.What sort of a leader would Boris be? More inclined than Mr. Cameron to leave the European Union, probably. In his handling of the economy, he would be less strategic and more Mr. Micawberish (\u201csomething will turn up\u201d) \u2014 likely to cut taxes first and worry about the finances later. Like Mr. Cameron, Boris would maintain the Atlanticist tilt of British foreign policy, but be less disposed to intervene militarily.He has the stamina for the job, but he may lack the patience. There are those who say that Boris is simply too much of a lone wolf to run a government; that he has failed to build up the factional strength in the party in order to delegate to people he trusts. Many senior Tories are envious of his stardom and the ease with which he \u2014 often a magnet for controversy \u2014 manages to shrug off minor scandal.At the moment, he lacks a praetorian guard of political protectors \u2014 unlike, for instance, the well-guarded chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. Boris may yet fall victim to the daggers of the Tory grandees.What he has, in spades, is what the Conservatives have lacked for more than two decades: popularity. His demographic appeal is broader than his party\u2019s, especially among young people. The Tories are still seen by many voters as a tribe of the selfish, a party of the affluent that only pretends to feel compassion for the vulnerable. The fact that so many senior members of this government went to elite private schools and universities has compounded this perception of detachment. Like Mr. Cameron, Boris went to Eton and Oxford, and was a member of the university\u2019s most ludicrously posh dining club, the Bullingdon. Somehow, though, the mayor\u2019s background does not deter voters.There is surprisingly little public polling available on the difference that Boris would make to Tory fortunes, but those surveys that have been carried out suggest that he would, at the very least, wipe out the Labour Party\u2019s lead in the polls. More will be conducted in the months to come, and their findings will be pored over by Tory sages.At every stage of his ascent, these same sages have predicted that he could rise no further: A comedian could never be a prime minister. But what was unthinkable yesterday may tomorrow be necessary. If the cult of Boris survives the scrutiny to which he will now be subjected, the game may be on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "P.R. Firm for Putin\u2019s Russia Now Walking a Fine Line", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn 2006, executives from the public relations firm Ketchum flew to Moscow to secure an account that has since been worth tens of millions of dollars.President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had hired Ketchum to provide advice on public relations before the nation hosted the Group of 8 meeting in St. Petersburg. At the time, Mr. Putin \u201ccared a great deal about what other leaders, especially presidents, thought about him,\u201d said Michael A. McFaul, a former United States ambassador to Russia who now teaches at Stanford.Times have changed. The escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine has turned relations with the United States as frosty as they have been in years. Last week, President Obama said that as a result of the economic sanctions imposed on Russia, the country \u201cis already more isolated than at any time since the Cold War.\u201d And the United States ambassador to the United Nations called Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine a \u201cthreat to all of our peace and security.\u201d\u201cThere has been a sharp turn in how much they care anymore,\u201d Mr. McFaul said. \u201cThey decided, O.K., we\u2019ve had enough of these guys, let\u2019s not worry so much about our reputation.\u201dKetchum, a division of the advertising and marketing giant Omnicom, now finds itself walking an increasingly fine line. It once had three dozen employees in at least six countries working with the Russia account. Now it has cut back to about 10, said Kathy Jeavons, a Ketchum partner in Washington who heads the Russia account, citing the difficulties of the \u201cglobal environment.\u201d And its deal to represent Russia\u2019s giant government-controlled energy company Gazprom recently ended because, she said, Gazprom had decided to focus on Europe.The Ketchum staff members who continue to work with Russia in Moscow, Washington, New York, London and Brussels must avoid being seen as defending acts contrary to American interests but continue to provide some luster for a lucrative, and even prestigious, client.Ms. Jeavons spoke publicly for the first time generally about the account, but declined to comment on specifics. Asked whether she or her staff members had qualms about representing Russia, or whether the account might be terminated, she said, \u201cWe constantly look at and evaluate our interaction with them, as we do with any client.\u201d Ketchum\u2019s primary aim, she said, is to promote investment in Russia. Dialogue between the United States and Russia, she said, is \u201ca reality of the connectivity of the global economy and financial markets.\u201dKetchum is far from alone in representing foreign governments and their leaders. In 2011, the Washington public relations firm Brown Lloyd James helped arrange a profile in Vogue of Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. The story, headlined \u201cA Rose in the Desert,\u201d was later removed from Vogue\u2019s website and the magazine\u2019s editor, Anna Wintour, issued a statement deploring the actions of the Assad government.Another firm, Sanitas International, represents both Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani, foes in an election in Afghanistan, according to State Department filings. China has 11 different public relations representatives.Public relations experts said there was a long history of American firms working for controversial foreign governments. Guy J. Golan, a professor of public relations and public diplomacy at Syracuse, compared Ketchum\u2019s business relationship with Russia to that of public relations firms who worked for tobacco companies as the dangers of smoking were revealed.\u201cThere are some who would argue that Russia is just as legitimate a client as Philip Morris cigarettes,\u201d Mr. Golan said.From Russia\u2019s standpoint, the Ketchum relationship makes perfect sense, Mr. McFaul said. He pointed to the Winter Olympics in Sochi this year, which cost tens of billions of dollars and were in part a public relations exercise. The Games were seen, Mr. McFaul said, as a way \u201cto introduce the new Russia to the world.\u201d And Ketchum\u2019s fees are tiny in comparison with a production like Sochi, so it is logical to retain the company to continue to help with its image and business interests.Angus Roxburgh, a former Ketchum consultant and journalist for the BBC and The Economist, recounted his experiences working with the company in his 2011 book, \u201cThe Strongman: Vladimir Putin and the Struggle for Russia.\u201dKetchum worked with members of the Russian leader\u2019s inner circle, Mr. Roxburgh wrote. The Russian officials, he said, were initially convinced they could pay for better coverage, or intimidate journalists into it. They were eventually persuaded to take reporters to dinner instead. But after the murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a critic of the Kremlin who was assassinated in her Moscow apartment block under mysterious circumstances, they stopped engaging with the news media, because they did not want to face questions about her death.\u201cAs the Politkovskaya murder was followed by the Litvinenko murder,\u201d Mr. Roxburgh wrote, referring to another mysterious death of a Kremlin critic in London, \u201cand then by the Russian invasion of Georgia, I began to wonder whether the very reason the Kremlin had decided to take on a Western P.R. agency was because they knew in advance that their image was about to nose-dive.\u201dThe company still works with Mr. Putin\u2019s closest advisers, according to current and former employees of Ketchum. Some of its work is relatively mundane, like fielding press inquiries for Russian officials and liaising with pro-Russia groups. In the State Department filings that detail Ketchum\u2019s work, prominent names like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Henry Kissinger appear alongside policy analysts, politicians and United States government officials. In the filings, the company said it worked with Time magazine to have Mr. Putin named the magazine\u2019s Person of the Year in 2007.Ketchum also monitors press clippings, and provides a daily analysis of perspectives on Russia from Washington, Brussels and New York. It tracks sentiment on Capitol Hill, particularly the congressional committees that might affect Russia. It writes strategic plans on specific issues.Mr. Roxburgh, who did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, said to The Daily Beast this year that Ketchum\u2019s aim, to make Russia more attractive to investors, \u201cmeans helping them disguise all the issues that make it unattractive: human rights, invasions of neighboring countries, etc.\u201dDuring Russia\u2019s war with Georgia in 2008, there was a movement in Ketchum\u2019s New York office to drop Russia as a client, according to a former Ketchum employee who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the firm. Those who expressed concern were placated by the Washington office, the employee said.Ms. Jeavons declined to address internal discussions at Ketchum. And while she defended her firm\u2019s work with Russia, she acknowledged that it was a complicated relationship.\u201cWhere we can help facilitate communication, at the end of the day that can only help,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean this is why I\u2019m in this business. It\u2019s not always perfect, not always black and white, but I think it helps.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Solar Company Seeks Stiff U.S. Tariffs to Deter Chinese Spying ", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the daunting battle against corporate online espionage worldwide, one major solar company wants to deploy a powerful and novel weapon: higher tariffs. SolarWorld Americas, the largest manufacturer of solar panels in the United States, has asked the Commerce Department to investigate claims that Chinese military personnel broke into the company\u2019s computers and stole documents important to its business and its long-running trade dispute with China.SolarWorld says the new prosecution underscores the sophisticated ways that Chinese companies are retaliating against trade obstacles, especially the use of cyberwarfare.As a deterrent, the company is proposing that the administration should use tariffs to crack down on such retribution.\u201cWe think it is critically important that the Commerce Department set a precedent here and take a strong stand that it will not tolerate cyberhacking of U.S. companies that file trade cases,\u201d said Timothy C. Brightbill, a lawyer representing SolarWorld.While acknowledging that the Justice Department is unlikely to compel the suspects to appear in a United States courtroom, he said the federal government could impose additional steep tariffs on imports of Chinese solar panels. \u201cThis is a way that the U.S. could actually make it hurt,\u201d Mr. Brightbill said.A broader investigation by the Commerce Department into the costs of solar panels divided the industry from its start. Domestic solar farm developers and installers of solar systems, whose businesses had benefited from an abundance of cheap imported equipment, worried that the passed-on costs of tariffs would slow solar adoption among consumers.And American companies exporting polysilicon, the main raw material for solar products, to China feared that tariffs would make it harder for them to do business there. Indeed, China imposed steep duties on American polysilicon at the beginning of this year and recently tightened import policies on the material.Still, many executives and officials have been frustrated in trying to hold Chinese companies accountable for what they see as unfair or unscrupulous business practices. A federal judge recently found a state-controlled Chinese drywall manufacturer, Taishan Gypsum Company, in criminal and civil contempt after it abruptly abandoned court proceedings five years into a case that found it liable for contaminated drywall used in the homes of seven Virginia families.Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, said he believed the implications of the case went far beyond drywall.\u201cIt poses a defining moment for the Chinese government and its companies, which raises grave questions as to the risk of doing business with the Chinese,\u201d Senator Nelson said in July on the Senate floor. \u201cWill the Chinese government and its companies honor their moral and legal obligations under this or any other commercial contract?\u201dIn the case of online crime, corporations across many industries are frequently reluctant to cooperate with prosecutions, said Shawn Henry, president of CrowdStrike Services, a security technology and services company, and a former executive assistant director of the F.B.I. They worry that publicizing security breaches risks their reputation and erodes competitive advantages, as well as opening the door to lawsuits.The threat of trade sanctions, Mr. Henry said, could offer the government a rare way to thwart hacking schemes before they happen.\u201cThe value to the Chinese government and the companies that are benefiting from these thefts of intellectual property is in the billions of dollars, and the penalties or the risk is almost zero,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any mechanisms to hold anyone accountable.\u201dIt is not clear how or if the Commerce Department will proceed; officials there declined to comment beyond saying that they were reviewing the request. Also uncertain is whether the White House, which is struggling to balance promoting the spread of green energy and protecting domestic manufacturing, would support the use of tariffs in such cases. A Justice Department spokesman, Marc Raimondi, said that the administration \u201cembraces an all-tools approach to these types of crimes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just a criminal justice solution,\u201d Mr. Raimondi said. \u201cThere are a number of different tools that can be used to target this type of criminal activity.\u201dTrade officials would first have to open an inquiry into how SolarWorld had been harmed and how the Chinese-owned solar companies \u2014 unnamed in the Justice Department indictment \u2014 had benefited, in order to impose additional duties on imports from those companies. If the Chinese government or companies decline to respond to information requests, the department can use other facts, including those presented by the other side in making a determination, trade lawyers said.Even if the Commerce Department does not open an investigation, trade experts say, the SolarWorld request and the Justice Department indictment are bringing needed attention to a government that is more aggressive than others have been in trying to promote its industries.\u201cThe Chinese have taken their efforts on behalf of their economy \u2014 and a lot of them are state-owned enterprises, a lot of them are state-supported \u2014 to a level that I think most people within the trade area haven\u2019t seen,\u201d said Paul C. Rosenthal, a lawyer at Kelley Drye in Washington. \u201cIt needs to be addressed, and there need to be better remedies available to address it.\u201dSolarWorld Americas, the Oregon-based subsidiary of a German company, originally brought its trade case in 2011 as a flood of cheap solar panels from China was pushing several domestic manufacturers to the edge of bankruptcy and beyond. After the Commerce Department found that the Chinese companies had benefited from unfair subsidies from their government and were selling equipment below the cost of manufacture, it began imposing stiff tariffs on Chinese imports in May 2012.According to the Justice Department, that is when a Chinese soldier sometimes known online as WinXYHappy and at least one co-conspirator began a series of break-ins into SolarWorld\u2019s computers to steal emails and attachments. Those included cash-flow records indicating SolarWorld\u2019s ability to survive financial strain, detailed information on proprietary technology and production costs and methods, as well as strategic discussions about the trade case with its lawyers.But even though the duties cut into China\u2019s solar business, that first Commerce Department decision applied only to panels made from Chinese solar cells, the final major parts that are assembled into finished modules. Many companies were able to avoid the duties by assembling panels from cells produced elsewhere, especially in Taiwan, so last year SolarWorld brought a new case to close the loophole. Preliminary decisions have gone in the company\u2019s favor, and the United States started collecting amended tariffs on imports ranging from roughly 19 to 55 percent this summer.The trade case is not yet final, but the new tariffs have begun reshaping the solar panel industry, helping SolarWorld and other manufacturers based outside China while also raising prices of equipment.The Chinese foreign and defense ministries have denied any wrongdoing and have accused the United States of cybertheft and spying activities of its own, pointing to revelations from Edward J. Snowden about National Security Agency activities around the world.\u201cThe problem for the United States is that it\u2019s trying to promote this norm against industrial espionage \u2014 cybertheft of intellectual property \u2014 as distinct from traditional political or military espionage,\u201d said Adam Segal, a senior fellow for China studies and director of the digital and cyberspace policy program at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s not an argument that many people bought even before Snowden, and now it\u2019s even harder to make.\u201dSome analysts say that the issues facing the two countries require a political and economic, rather than legal, solution and are calling for a settlement between governments. China recently asked for a suspension of the tariffs along with talks toward an agreement, but that has not yet moved forward.\u201cEveryone\u2019s just going back and forth, tit-for-tat, on this,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. \u201cThere needs to be some type of negotiation amongst all the parties and basically have a truce in the legal war and figure out what are the new rules of the game.\u201dAaron Kessler contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Moves to Reduce Global Warming Emissions", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration on Tuesday announced a series of moves aimed at cutting emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, powerful greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.The White House has secured voluntary agreements from some of the nation\u2019s largest companies to scale down or phase out their use of HFCs, which are factory-made gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Red Bull, Kroger, Honeywell and DuPont, the company that invented fluorinated refrigerants, have agreed to cut their use and replace them with climate-friendly alternatives.Over all, the administration estimated that the agreements announced on Tuesday would reduce cumulative global consumption of HFCs by the equivalent of 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide through 2025. That is about 1.5 percent of the world\u2019s 2010 greenhouse gas emissions, or the same as taking 15 million cars off the road for 10 years.The announcement came a week before President Obama is expected to join over 100 other world leaders at a United Nations climate change summit in New York, which will begin 15 months of negotiations as leaders work toward a global climate change agreement in Paris next year.The primary focus of that deal will be to push for enactment of new laws around the world aimed at cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, the abundant planet-warming gas caused by burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Negotiators anticipate it will take a grueling battle to achieve such an agreement, which would require the world\u2019s largest economies \u2014 including the United States, China and India \u2014 to greatly cut their use of burning coal and oil.But climate policy advocates say small steps aimed at reducing other greenhouse gases will also help. While HFCs are less abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, they have 10,000 times the planet-warming potency. But carbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, while HFCs disintegrate after about 15 years.\u201cEvery drumbeat in this symphony helps. It drives it along. This is part of that drumbeat,\u201d said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a research organization. \u201cThe benefits from cutting non-CO2 come much faster,\u201d he added. \u201cCO2 is like a supertanker \u2013 you can stop it, but it keeps drifting for a long time. Cutting HFCs are like stopping a steamboat. You stop it and that\u2019s that.\u201dTuesday\u2019s announcement also came as part of the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to push for an amendment to the 1987 Montreal Protocol, aimed at decreasing HFCs worldwide. That agreement was designed to cut emissions of gases that harm the ozone layer. Last year, the Obama administration announced an agreement with China to jointly work toward phasing down HFCs in both countries.The administration has directed federal agencies to purchase alternatives to HFCs whenever possible, to work on expanding a list of HFC alternatives, and to fund Energy Department research into HFC alternative technologies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lifting the Soul, and the Spanish Economy, Too", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA group of pilgrims gathered near Lavacolla, Spain, on their way to the Shrine of St. James in nearby Santiago de Compostela.SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain \u2014 There are the pilgrims who hobble along with a staff, painstakingly making their way through a monthlong journey of contemplation. Then there are the others, looking all the fresher for walking a shorter route or paying a tour operator to carry their backpacks, and more likely to be clutching a cellphone or a guidebook.All, however, must navigate the proliferating array of souvenir shops selling Jesus key rings and T-shirts and painted scallop shells: the symbol of the pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James, which ends in this city in northwestern Galicia and has become known simply as the Camino, or the Way. The surge in popularity of the pilgrimage, which dates from the ninth century, has turned what was a spiritual obstacle course in medieval times into a booming part of modern Spain\u2019s tourism industry. At a time when other parts of the economy are still suffering, the pilgrimage has become big business here \u2014 so much so that it has invigorated not only local economies but also a debate over how to balance mass tourism and spiritual reflection.\u201cYou suddenly find yourself, exhausted, walking alongside people who are in party mood, as if they were heading to an entertainment park,\u201d said Marie Ange de Montesquieu, who works for a Christian radio station in Paris and was completing a 480-mile route that began on the French side of the Pyrenees.Still, she was philosophical. \u201cIt\u2019s like life itself,\u201d she added, \u201ca mix of pleasant and less pleasant experiences.\u201dSuch challenges transcend Santiago. In southern Spain, the municipality of Aznalc\u00e1zar announced earlier this year that it would impose an environmental fee on pilgrims going to worship the Virgin of El Roc\u00edo, to cover the cost of cleaning up the trash left in the wake of the springtime passage. The decision generated an outcry, forcing Aznalc\u00e1zar to shelve the plan.Near Santiago, dozens of private establishments have started to compete with the network of government-owned hostels, and some municipalities have been pushing to add more official routes to the Camino, hoping to benefit as well from this tourism bonanza.Santiago was the final resting place of St. James, and the discovery of his remains created one of the main medieval pilgrimages. Its importance dwindled because of the rise of Protestantism and the effects of the plague and conflicts, which hindered European travel.In 1984, just 423 pilgrims were certified as having completed the route here. This year, an estimated 240,000 pilgrims are expected to come, up from 215,880 last year. The most prominent recent visitors included Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain, who walked a short part of the route when they held a meeting on Aug. 24.Ahead of Ms. Merkel\u2019s visit, Santiago\u2019s mayor, Agust\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, criticized the lack of public money spent on upgrading the access ways to his city for pilgrims. In an editorial, El Correo Gallego, a regional newspaper, urged Ms. Merkel to pressure the Spanish government to invest more in the Camino.The reasons for the growing popularity of the pilgrimage are not altogether clear. The Roman Catholic Church has welcomed the swelling numbers as evidence of a religious pickup, perhaps coinciding with hard economic times. The number of people attending Mass in Spain rose 5.7 percent in July from a year earlier, according to a study by the Center for Sociological Research, a government institute.But it has no doubt helped, too, that with joblessness at about 25 percent in Spain and also high in other parts of Europe, people have more time on their hands. Many have chosen to travel, helping to leave tourism one of the few unscathed parts of the Spanish economy. Last year, Spain welcomed a record 60.6 million visitors.The Camino has \u201cgiven me confidence that I can overcome obstacles like not having work,\u201d said Maria Jo\u00e3o Martins, who is from Portugal and lost her job as a supermarket cashier in 2011.Much of the Camino\u2019s recent growth has come from abroad. Lolita Forj\u00e1n, the owner of a grocery store in the village of Escravitude, was excited about having recently welcomed clients from Alaska and South Africa. \u201cWho would have thought that a pilgrim would ever show me a bank note with Mandela\u2019s face on it?\u201d she said.Ms. Merkel followed in the footsteps of Germans whose presence on the Camino almost tripled in a decade, reaching 16,203 pilgrims last year. German interest rose after Hape Kerkeling, a television presenter, published a 2006 diary of his pilgrimage that became a best-seller. \u201cThe Way,\u201d a 2010 movie featuring Martin Sheen, helped broaden awareness among Americans.Such is the popularity of the Camino today that many of the more devout pilgrims now travel off-season to avoid the summer rush, according to Maria Angeles Fern\u00e1ndez, the president of the Spanish Federation of Associations of Friends of the Camino de Santiago.In the village of Faramello, a new hostel with 40 beds opened in May. \u201cThis tourism has really become the main opportunity to find work around here,\u201d said Concha, the receptionist, who would not give her full name. Before finding this job, she had been unemployed for five years, she said.The Spanish authorities \u201cmust strike a balance between developing tourism and maintaining the tradition of the Camino,\u201d warned Lijia Zhang, a Beijing-based writer, who spent two weeks walking in August. \u201cOtherwise it will lose its soul, and therefore its appeal, before too long.\u201d Other pilgrims describe their experience as unforgettable, even if some seasoned visitors remember more fondly earlier and less commercial times. For pilgrims, the final hurdle comes in Santiago itself, at the office where certificates are delivered to those who have walked at least the last 100 kilometers, or 62 miles.There, the line in August can take as long as three hours, said Walt Scherer, an American volunteer. Mr. Scherer, a former mayor of Loomis, Calif., discovered the Camino after surviving colon cancer. As a young pilgrim complained to him about the line, Mr. Scherer replied, \u201cThe first thing you should learn on the Camino is patience.\u201dVirginia G\u00f3mez and C\u00e9sar Mart\u00ednez, an unemployed couple from Madrid, said they were delighted to have reached Santiago but disappointed by the costs of nearly everything along the way. Some establishments did not provide free toilet paper, they said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you needed to bring a full wallet to a pilgrimage,\u201d Ms. G\u00f3mez said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "G.O.P. Hopefuls, Light on Experience, Try to Build Foreign Credentials", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky likes to note that he didn\u2019t have a foreign policy three and a half years ago, when he was a full-time ophthalmologist.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was an appellate lawyer in Houston before he was elected in 2012, a job that put him in front of judges, not world leaders.Gov. Bobby Jindal has little reason to worry that a foreign crisis is going to rock Louisiana. So when Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state and current Stanford professor, visited him last year they spoke mostly about education reform.In fact, several of them will have to confront an especially glaring paradox. Like Mr. Obama when he first ran for president, they are relatively young first-term senators, with limited experience beyond the country\u2019s borders.If the world\u2019s unstable regions continue to dominate headlines in the next two years, some Republicans say they worry that their party\u2019s nominee could have trouble persuading Americans to elect someone untested in international affairs.\u201cThe potential for some unforeseen events is clearly going to create a great deal of unease,\u201d said Richard G. Lugar, the former Republican senator from Indiana who led the Foreign Relations Committee twice, in the late 1980s and the mid-2000s. With so much unrest, Mr. Lugar said, Americans will inevitably ask themselves, \u201cWhat if one of these Republicans became president? Would it be any better? Are they any better prepared?\u201d\u201cAnd at the moment,\u201d he added, \u201cthe answer is probably not.\u201dUnlike when the elder George Bush and John McCain won the Republican nomination in part because voters put trust in their foreign policy experience, the 2016 field is likely to be dominated by candidates who lack that background \u2014 senators who have been in office just a few years and governors who have had no exposure to the complexities of war and diplomacy.Republican senators like Mr. Paul, 51, Mr. Cruz, 43, and Marco Rubio of Florida, also 43, could have an awkward case when arguing that they are better suited to address the world\u2019s problems than Mr. Obama was when he was first elected. And while senators can point to their time in Washington as educational, the Republican governors who are weighing a White House bid, like Mr. Jindal and Chris Christie of New Jersey, have had limited global exposure.\u201cWe have just seen an incompetent senator as president, from the Republican point of view,\u201d said Elliott Abrams, who served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush and is now with the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cAnd that argues for someone with significant executive experience,\u201d like a governor, he added. \u201cBut those people are by definition not going to have foreign policy experience.\u201dWhile unstable international conditions would seem to boost Hillary Rodham Clinton, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, if Americans still associate her with the policies of an administration they view with growing disapproval, Mrs. Clinton could find her tenure as Mr. Obama\u2019s chief diplomat a liability.\u201cShe does not want to totally identify herself with Obama foreign policy,\u201d said Lee H. Hamilton, the Democratic former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees. \u201cOn the other hand, it\u2019s not credible to totally separate herself.\u201dStill, voters tend to look to their own economic prospects rather than to conflicts thousands of miles away. Even in presidential elections when foreign involvement was central, including in 1980, during the Iranian hostage crisis, the percentage of people who named international affairs as the most important issue facing the country has been outnumbered by those who cited economic concerns in Gallup polls.In a CNN/ORC International poll\u00a0conducted Sept. 5 through 7, just 7 percent of respondents said the situation in Iraq and Syria was the most pressing concern facing the country today, compared with 30 percent who identified the economy as the top concern \u2014 by far the most common response. International inexperience has not prevented Republicans or Democrats from winning. Ronald Reagan, who as a former California governor had a limited background in foreign policy, defeated Jimmy Carter. (A badly deteriorated economy was even more important to voters that year.) Mr. Reagan\u2019s pick of Mr. Bush, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and ambassador to the United Nations, helped balance the ticket.In 1992, Mr. Bush found out painfully that his credentials, which by then included winning the Persian Gulf war, did not sway voters who wanted a new direction on the economy and elected Bill Clinton.George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, persuaded voters in 2000 to overlook his foreign policy shortcomings by surrounding himself with respected hands like Dick Cheney, a former defense secretary, and Ms. Rice.Mr. Rubio, who is one of only two Republican senators to serve on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, is planning a major foreign policy speech this month. His schedule, advisers said, has included meetings with foreign dignitaries, including the former leader of the Syrian opposition coalition, Ahmad al-Jarba.Mr. Cruz has wooed leading conservative thinkers like William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard.Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and Mr. Christie have been courting Republican elder statesmen. Mr. Perry has met with George P. Shultz, Mr. Reagan\u2019s secretary of state. And Mr. Christie has met with Henry Kissinger.But conservatives acknowledge that candidates in the 2016 field have a long way to go in convincing voters they can be trusted on the world stage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about, \u2018I spent three hours with Henry Kissinger and now I\u2019m ready to be president,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said James Jay Carafano, vice president of foreign and defense policy studies for the Heritage Foundation. Mr. Carafano has met with almost all the 2016 contenders.\u201cIt really is about doing your homework,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a voyage of self-discovery.\u201dA web headline in an earlier version of this article misstated the election year.

{"Headline": "Across Eastern Europe, Military Spending Lags", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 A window-rattling F-16 passed just above the main control tower at the Polish military\u2019s 32nd Air Base, screaming across the same stark plains that have seen armies sweep across them throughout the nation\u2019s history.\u201cNinety percent of what you see here has been either rebuilt or built from scratch in the last nine years,\u201d said Lt. Col. Tomasz Jatczak, commander of air operations at the base in Lask, southwest of Warsaw, where a contingent of 170 American troops arrived Friday to begin a monthlong NATO training exercise with their Polish counterparts.But if the base, with its pristine runways, gleaming hangars and sparkling new command headquarters, embodies the hope of integrating Eastern Europe fully into the Western alliance, it is also a reminder of how far much of the region still has to go in building the kind of military ability that would allow it to feel secure in the face of a newly aggressive Russia.Eastern European nations have been among the loudest in calling for a more assertive response from NATO to Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its support for the separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. But many of the same countries have been laggards in meeting the military spending commitments that come with NATO membership or still have a long way to go in building the kind of military strength necessary to deter Russia.After years in which a combination of fiscal pressures and a complacent trust in the alliance\u2019s protection may have led them to drop their guard, those nations are facing new pressure to pump more money into their own defense, in one of their most fundamental shifts in priorities since the end of the Cold War.The result has been increases in military spending and promises of more to come in countries up and down NATO\u2019s eastern flank, though after years of plummeting military outlays, many countries are building from a very limited ability and remain years away from fielding anything resembling a formidable force against a military as large as Russia\u2019s.NATO asks member states to spend 2 percent of their gross domestic product on their armed forces, yet only a handful of them actually do. Estonia, the small Baltic state at the alliance\u2019s far eastern edge, is one of them, and Poland, by far the largest and richest country on that flank, is at 1.95 percent.\u201cThis is one of the reasons that when President Obama comes to the region, he visits Estonia and Poland,\u201d said Karlis Bukovskis, deputy director of the Latvian Institute of International Affairs.But even the most vulnerable nations, including some with sizable Russian ethnic minorities that might tempt a repeat of Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine, are spending far less than the 2 percent benchmark. Latvia and Lithuania are spending less than 1 percent, though both have indicated they intend to ratchet up to 2 percent by 2020. Hungary and Slovakia are at about 1 percent, and Romania, which recently said it would bolster military spending, is at about 1.5 percent.The unease has moved to Scandinavia as well: Sweden recently announced an increase in military spending.\u201cIt is looking like, as a result of Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, that military spending is likely to start increasing in those countries that are nearest to Russia, the front line and the Nordic countries,\u201d said Sam Perlo-Freeman, head of the military expenditure project at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Poland \u2014 driven by a growing economy, a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d coming from the end of its involvement in the Afghan conflict, and a law requiring it to spend at least 1.95 percent of its G.D.P. on the military \u2014 is several years into a major modernization program of its aging military, including a new missile defense system, submarines, attack and support helicopters, battlefield management systems, high-tech equipment for troops and assorted military electronics.\u201cSince Poland is already at 1.95 percent, going to 2 percent will be quite easy and politically good,\u201d said Marcin Terlikowski, a military affairs expert at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. \u201cNext year, it is expected to rise to 2.5 percent.\u201dBut it will be a decade before the full impact of this modernization is felt in the field, he said.\u201cPoland is the key,\u201d said Andrew Michta, an adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThe bottom line is that the Poles are essentially the most serious of the countries in the region when it comes to investment in the military. This is no longer a post-Soviet military, and it is modernizing rapidly.\u201dWhen it comes to the Baltic states, the issue is one of scale. They are all small countries with relatively tiny standing armies \u2014 3,800 soldiers in Estonia, plus a reserve force of 13,000, according to its government; 10,350 in Latvia, including its border guards; and about the same number in Lithuania, according to the Defense Suppliers Directory.\u201cThe sense of vulnerability that they have is perfectly rational,\u201d Mr. Michta said.In recent years, Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops for exercises just across their borders.\u201cThings are not that rosy in the Baltics,\u201d Mr. Terlikowski said. \u201cThey never had a big army, so they must build it from scratch. Even under Communist rule, Poland always had an army, a command structure and a defense industry. It is easier to modernize something that already exists.\u201dWhen the Baltic states entered NATO a decade ago, they were urged not to spend their limited resources on building large standing armies, but to depend on others in the alliance to come to their aid in an emergency. Instead, the Baltic countries and other former Soviet satellite states focused their military spending on building specialties that they could offer the alliance, such as Estonia\u2019s focus on cybersecurity.\u201cCentral and Eastern European countries that abolished conscription followed the principle of focusing on quality rather than quantity,\u201d said Tomasz Szatkowski, president of the National Center for Strategic Studies in Warsaw. \u201cBut in the case of a classic threat, you also need quantity.\u201dThe plan NATO has agreed on \u2014 to set up forward supply bases on the alliance\u2019s eastern front in which 4,000 or so troops could be deployed within 48 hours \u2014 might be useful in combating a small, stealth insurgency, like the masked gunmen who arrived in Ukraine to set off that crisis, but would be useless in the face of an invasion. \u201cWhat is required is to be able to hold off any aggression for at least a couple of weeks, to buy some time and provide some sort of sanctuary for reinforcements\u201d from those in the alliance with larger armies, Mr. Szatkowski said.Such an ability, though, is far in the future for the Baltic states, if it is reachable at all.\u201cRussia was not seen as an immediate threat before the Ukrainian thing,\u201d Mr. Bukovskis said. \u201cNow, we have the astonishing realization that something like that could actually happen. And we are a country, in the Latvian case, where we don\u2019t even have armored vehicles. People are feeling a little bit embarrassed that they are asking for NATO\u2019s assistance, but, at the same time, they haven\u2019t done their own homework.\u201dJoanna Berendt contributed reporting from Lask, Poland.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Are O.K. With Big Business. It\u2019s Business Lobbying Power They Hate.", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPulse of the PeopleHow do Americans really feel about corporate America? Are businesses, in our collective psyche, the drivers of wealth, innovation and jobs? Or a profit-sucking engine of greed and exploitation?The answer: Yes.A new survey fills in more of the details of Americans\u2019 nuanced picture of the corporate sector \u2014 and in particular how those views of business in the United States compare with the rest of the world.When you look at the finer details, it appears that in gauging whether Americans (and residents of other countries) view business positively or negatively, it matters a great deal what, precisely, you ask.For example, when asked whether corporations have too much, too little or just the right amount of influence over our economic future, 48 percent of Americans chose \u201ctoo much.\u201d That\u2019s roughly in the middle of 24 percent in China and 63 percent in Brazil.But interestingly, you get very different results with a similar question phrased in a more theoretical way. Is it a good thing or bad thing for corporations to be strong and influential? Only 31 percent of Americans answered that it is a good thing, among the lowest of the countries surveyed and far below the 60 and 70 percent levels in some emerging countries.Similarly, Americans are more likely than respondents in any country surveyed except Italy to believe that corporate lobbyists exercise a high degree of influence over the national government, with 59 percent of American survey respondents saying that corporate lobbyists have \u201ca lot of influence\u201d over policy.Let me try to make sense of these results, which would seem on their face to be contradictory:When it comes to business exerting power over the economy, Americans have mixed views but are generally comfortable. But when it comes to business exerting power over government, they are much more exercised.Americans aren\u2019t antibusiness, in other words. They\u2019re just against business having what they see as too much power in Washington.Compare that with China, where citizens seem to view businesses as less powerful in terms of lobbying (only 19 percent seeing a lot of influence by corporate lobbyists, a full 40 percentage points lower than in the United States) but are more likely to believe it is good for companies to be strong and influential. One might imagine that Chinese citizens see less a phenomenon in which business overly influences government and one more in which government overly influences businesses.Indeed, a remarkable pattern stands out. In some of the places where big business has the least power and capitalist economies are the least developed, optimism and support for the corporate sector is highest.In Communist Party-led China, 74 percent of respondents agreed with the statement that \u201cit is a good thing when corporations are strong and influential, because they are engines of innovation and economic growth.\u201d That is around three times the level of support found in capitalist paradises like Britain, the United States and Australia.Perhaps we all want what we don\u2019t have.And when asked whether they view the role of corporations in the future as a reason for hope or for fear, some of the highest levels of fear were in the United States and other prosperous Western nations. The highest levels of hope in the corporate sector were in the emerging Asian economies of Indonesia, China, Malaysia and India.In other words, the less developed a corporate sector is in a given country, the more hopeful its people are that it will be a force for the better.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hiring in Services Sector Points to Growth", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American businesses hired workers at a steady clip in August, and services sector activity accelerated to the highest point in six and a half years, providing evidence that the economy is on track for sturdy growth in the third quarter.That view was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing only a slight increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week and a narrowing in the trade deficit in July to its lowest point in six months.\u201cThe story line of underlying growth momentum at least being sustained and at best picking up this quarter has more or less been confirmed,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.ADP, a payroll processing firm, said private sector payrolls increased by 204,000 last month after rising by 212,000 in July, with gains spread across a range of industries.While the ADP report was a bit softer than economists expected, it was the fifth consecutive month of gains above 200,000 and augured well for the broader employment report that the government will release on Friday.In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 59.6 last month, the highest reading since its inception in January 2008, from 58.7 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sector..The government on Friday is expected to report that employers added 225,000 jobs last month after an increase of 209,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The upbeat employment picture was also captured in another report from the Labor Department showing that initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week held at levels consistent with a tightening of labor market conditions. Initial jobless claims rose 4,000, to a seasonally adjusted 302,000.\u201cThe broad evidence is that the labor market continues to improve at a very solid rate,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.The I.S.M. services report followed strengthening auto sales and manufacturing data in suggesting a solid base for growth, as did the report on international trade.The Commerce Department said the United States trade deficit fell 0.6 percent to $40.5 billion in July, its smallest size since January. When adjusted for inflation, it reached its narrowest point since December 2013, prompting economists to raise their estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product.Goldman Sachs lifted its G.D.P. growth forecast by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.2 percent annual rate. Morgan Stanley raised its estimate to a 3.3 percent pace, from 3 percent.In July, exports rose 0.9 percent to a record high, with automobile and nonpetroleum exports surging to new highs. That eclipsed a 0.7 percent rebound in imports. The rise in imports, which was driven by food and autos, is a sign of underlying strength in domestic demand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jobless Rate May Be a Flawed Indicator for Fed Policy", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHigh & Low FinanceThe United States job market has been improving. But is it close to being good?That is one of the chief issues likely to be debated next week at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. If it is close, and one traditional indicator seems to show that it is, then the time is near when the Federal Reserve should begin to tighten monetary policy. To not do so would be to risk a return of rising inflation.But if it is not close, such a tightening could do serious damage to the recovery, hurting the prospects for employment of many who have been out of work for years.\u201cThis is involving millions of prime-age Americans who have dropped out of the work force,\u201d says Andrew T. Levin, a research fellow at the International Monetary Fund who spent 22 years at the Fed, the last two years as a special adviser to Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who were chairman and vice chairwoman at the time. \u201cThe question is, Do we give up on those people?\u201dThe percentage of prime-working-age Americans, those between 25 and 54, who are in the labor force fell to a 30-year low of 80.7 in July. In April, the percentage of prime-working-age men in the labor force fell to 87.9, the lowest figure reported since the government began computing the figure in 1948.At issue is why all those people are not in the labor force. If it is some sort of structural problem \u2014 most of them either do not want to work or do not have the appropriate skills to obtain jobs \u2014 then monetary and fiscal policy are not going to help.\u201cOur overall assessment is that much, but not all, of the decline in the labor force participation rate since 2007 is structural in nature,\u201d states the paper by Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith and William Wascher. \u201cAs a result,\u201d they added, \u201cwhile policy makers can view some of the current low level of the participation rate as indicative of labor market slack beyond that indicated by the unemployment rate alone, they should not expect the participation rate to show a substantial increase from current levels as labor market conditions continue to improve.\u201d Their model says the rate will continue to fall.Economists are taught something called \u201cNairu,\u201d for \u201cnonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment.\u201d If the unemployment rate goes below that level, it is supposed to lead to rising inflation. Some people think that figure could be as high as 6 percent \u2014 meaning that the time to tighten is virtually here \u2014 while others put it at 5.5 percent or less. But Mr. Levin argues that it is misleading to look only at the unemployment rate. He points to the large number of workers who say they work part time only because they cannot find full-time work, as well as to the decline in the labor force. He thinks there are a lot of people who would take jobs but have not looked for one recently. \u201cLabor market conditions have improved substantially over the past several years, and the conventional measure of unemployment is now close to its longer-run normal rate,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the participation gap and the underemployment gap remain substantial.\u201d After adjusting for those factors, he says, labor market conditions are \u201croughly equivalent to a level of around 8 percent for the conventional unemployment rate.\u201dIf that is correct, there is every reason for the Fed to keep interest rates low for a substantial period of time. One noted labor market economist, the Nobel laureate Peter A. Diamond, has looked at the recent data and concluded that much of what he and others have written previously is misleading because the unemployment rate is no longer an accurate labor market gauge. Who is right? If the paper by Ms. Aaronson and her colleagues is correct, and the Fed nevertheless fails to tighten credit, we can expect that clear signs of wage inflation will emerge as employers are forced to pay more to lure workers from the limited available pool. Given the decline in median real income in recent years, some such inflation would be welcome, but Fed tightening would still make sense.But if Mr. Levin is correct, and the Fed listens to those who disagree with him and tightens credit too soon, the risk is that a lot of people who could eventually find jobs will not do so.The wiser course seems to be to wait for the inflation \u2014 not just for a model that says something is likely to happen \u2014 before we give up on all those people who might rejoin the labor force.Now, the good news is that the percentage of respondents who believe jobs are plentiful has risen to a six-year high \u2014 18 percent. That compares with 31 percent who think jobs remain hard to get. You don\u2019t need to be an economist to know when jobs are easy to get. The members of the F.O.M.C. would be better advised to watch the consumer confidence survey than to focus on the unemployment rate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scot Backing Independence Says Rivals Use \u2018Bullying\u2019 ", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEDINBURGH \u2014 With tension rising a week before Scots vote on independence, Alex Salmond, the leader of the \u201cyes\u201d campaign, accused opponents on Thursday of bullying and subterfuge, and he demanded an official inquiry into disclosures that the Royal Bank of Scotland would shift its registered office to England in the event of a Scottish breakaway.Speaking in Edinburgh Mr. Salmond said that officials at Britain\u2019s treasury had been caught leaking information to the news media before a market-sensitive announcement, and he described their actions as a \u201cmatter of extraordinary gravity.\u201dWith the outcome of next week\u2019s referendum hard to predict from the latest opinion polls, the news of the bank\u2019s possible move underlined the highly charged nature of the debate over the likely impact of independence on important sectors of the Scottish economy.Late Wednesday the treasury confirmed the forthcoming announcement to some British news media by email, though officials said privately that they did so only in response to inquiries about reports in the newspaper The Sun. There was no official comment from the treasury on Thursday, and the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for the civil service, said it had not yet received any letter requesting an inquiry from Mr. Salmond.The banks\u2019 contingency plans have been prompted by uncertainty over what currency an independent Scotland would use. All three main British political parties have rejected the idea of a currency union if Scots vote to break away, though Mr. Salmond contends that they are bluffing.On Thursday he stepped up his attack on London politicians, accusing them of \u201cbullying and intimidation\u201d and demanding an official inquiry into the actions of officials who, he said, are \u201cnot allowed to brief market-sensitive information.\u201dAt the same time Mr. Salmond played down the significance of a move by the Royal Bank of Scotland as largely technical, pointing to an internal letter from the bank in which it said the changes would have no effect on employment or operations in Scotland.Nonetheless, the bank\u2019s announcement, and similar statements of concern from other well-known businesses and financial institutions, may check some of the momentum that has seemed to be gathering behind supporters of independence. On Thursday morning, Charlie Mayfield, the chairman of John Lewis, a retail group, told the BBC that there would be \u201ceconomic consequences to a \u2018yes\u2019 vote.\u201d\u201cIt does cost more money to trade in parts of Scotland, and therefore those hard costs, in the event of a \u2018yes\u2019 vote, are more likely to be passed on,\u201d he said.Mr. Salmond appealed to voters to ignore such warnings, telling Scots that they were \u201con the cusp of making history\u201d and adding that \u201cthe eyes of the world are upon Scotland.\u201dIn one testy set of exchanges, he accused the BBC\u2019s political editor, Nick Robinson, of heckling him after Mr. Robinson challenged him several times to answer questions about the economic impact of independence.Scottish supporters of the opposition Labour Party are thought to be crucial to the outcome of the vote on Sept. 18. The party\u2019s leader, Ed Miliband, spoke in Scotland for the second consecutive day on Thursday, in Glasgow. He said independence would entail \u201chuge risks\u201d to jobs, the economy and the National Health Service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Big-Ticket Engineering at a Deep Discount", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel15 PhotosTaking account of its gasoline, diesel and high-performance GTI variants, the latest Golf highlights Volkswagen engineering at its best. A Euro-sporty hatchback that the world has long embraced, the Golf helped VW to sell five million cars in the first half of 2014, sneaking past General Motors and barely trailing Toyota as the global sales leader. But like soccer in some quarters, the Golf\u2019s virtues have largely been lost on Americans. Here, the Golf has played the sporty German underdog to dependable Asian appliances, and \u2014 before they got serious about small cars \u2014 cheap disposables from the Detroit Three.For decades, the hatch-only body style has been the Golf\u2019s main obstacle here. Americans have stubbornly resisted liftgates, unless they came attached to the soaring hulls of S.U.V.s. But people are finally wising up to the do-it-all virtues of hatchbacks, including Golf rivals like the Ford Focus and Mazda 3. And today\u2019s small crossover utilities, so popular with Americans, are essentially hatchbacks on tiptoes.But no crossover, and no hybrid for that matter, can do what I managed in the new diesel-power Golf TDI: 60.6 miles per gallon over 75 highway miles along the Jersey Shore. That\u2019s my personal highway m.p.g. record for any American-market car I\u2019ve tested, including the Toyota Prius. In stark contrast to a Prius, a car in which I feel my life force oozing away with every mile, the VW isn\u2019t a sluggish chore to drive. The Golf is richly designed and executed, and it is economical and fun to drive even when you\u2019re running to the drugstore for a prescription.Gas, diesel or GTI, the 2015 Golf is a bit longer, lower and wider than before, with a touch more passenger and cargo space. The shape, as familiar in its own way as a Porsche 911\u2019s, is subtly retailored, with crisply stamped hood creases and horizontal strakes across its chin. The Mazda 3 and Focus flaunt their curves, but the VW is handsome in its own temperate way.The chassis, interior and powertrains are decisively upgraded. The Golf rides on VW\u2019s new weapon of mass consumption: The MQB architecture will be the flexible building block for dozens of VW Group models, including Audis.This is sophisticated stuff. Between its well-tuned suspension and a chassis heavy on high-strength steel, the Golf feels as smooth, solid and poised as its small Audi cousins. It shushes noise like a no-nonsense librarian. An airy, smartly crafted interior makes its own deluxe statement, with no trace of the cost-cutting that once marred the Jetta. A 5.8-inch touch screen is standard. One change appears small, but sums up the advances: The Golf ditches VW\u2019s awkward rotary seatback-adjuster knob, the wrist-wrenching bane of VWs for decades.Cargo space, always a strong suit for the Golf, expands further to outstrip that of the Ford or Mazda hatchbacks: There\u2019s 16.5 cubic feet below the hatch\u2019s parcel shelf and 22.8 cubic feet if you load up to the roof, much more than in the typical full-size sedan. Folding the rear seats opens a bountiful 52.7 cubic feet of storage, nearly as much as in BMW\u2019s X1 crossover. The VW is one small car that can help you move to a new apartment, rather than just fetch pizza. The gasoline-powered Golf banishes its aging 2.5-liter in-line 5-cylinder for a 1.8-liter direct-injected TSI turbo 4 that\u2019s more powerful even as it sips less fuel \u2014 up to 20 percent less. It combines 170 horsepower and a class-thumping 200 pound-feet of torque with an E.P.A. rating of 25 m.p.g. in the city, 36 on the highway (up from 23/30). Those figures apply to the 6-speed automatic transmission; an available 5-speed manual does 1 m.p.g. better on the highway.The TDI gets a new quiet-running 2-liter turbodiesel that makes 150 horsepower and 236 pound-feet. The TDI now carries an onboard tank of urea, a pollution-fighting fluid, to meet coming emissions standards. The TDI also trades the gas version\u2019s conventional automatic transmission for a dual-clutch 6-speed DSG automated manual. So equipped, the Golf TDI is rated at 31/43 m.p.g., or 30/45 with the 6-speed manual.But forget the official story. The E.P.A.\u2019s crazy fudge-factoring of fuel economy tests has forced Ford, for one, to reduce its hybrid mileage ratings.Yet while the E.P.A. rules tend to overstate hybrid mileage, they vastly underestimate diesels\u2019 real-world economy. In my testing, the TDI effortlessly delivered 50 to 53 m.p.g. even as I cruised at 65 to 70 miles per hour and passed dawdlers at will. And in an admittedly Prius-like run, holding at a resolute 55 m.p.h., the TDI sipped at a wallet-friendly 60 m.p.g. Quibbling about the performance of a car that gets 50-plus m.p.g. seems churlish, but the TDI is almost a bit too obsessed with fuel economy, with a languid throttle and transmission programming that resist efforts at haste. Popping the transmission into Sport mode helps to keep things moving. And with its generous midrange torque, the TDI still has no trouble negotiating or passing traffic.Car and Driver magazine found that the automatic-equipped TSI was barely faster, at 7.7 seconds from 0 to 60 m.p.h., than the 7.8 seconds of the diesel automatic, but that the stick-shift gasoline Golf whipped its diesel counterpart at 6.8 seconds versus 8.3.\u00a0Still, in my automatic-transmission test cars, the gasoline version felt much quicker.Both versions are pleasingly agile, with tightly controlled body motions \u2014 right up there with the class benchmark, the Mazda 3. The standard XDS system automatically dabs a front brake on the inside of a turn to quell wheelspin and sharpen handling. Disc brakes combine impressive strength with direct pedal feel. A limited number of two-door Launch Edition Golfs are available at $18,815. The better-equipped two-door Golf S starts at $19,815 with a manual transmission, $20,915 with the automatic and $21,515 for a four-door automatic. A deluxe Golf SE, available only with four doors and the automatic, starts at $25,315. A range-topping SEL at $27,815 is stuffed with everything from a navigation system and 18-inch alloy wheels to sport seats, keyless locking and ambient LED cabin lighting. Diesel Golfs come only with four doors, though every trim level offers a manual transmission. VW\u2019s diesel brigades will notice that the least-expensive TDI S starts $3,000 less than its predecessor, at $22,815. That rises quickly to $26,315 for the TDI SE and $28,815 for the TDI SEL. For every diesel version, add $1,100 for the dual-clutch DSG automatic. The Golf S 1.8T that I tested was priced at $21,515, with no added options. The diesel TDI S test car, which had the $695 Driver Assistance Package with parking sensors and forward collision warning, was $25,610. As ever, this VW hatchback is not cheap. But if you\u2019re about to buy a small car, and you\u2019ve never driven a Golf, take a test spin and prepare to be impressed. As with its premium Ford and Mazda peers, you get what you pay for.

The predicted surge in inflation has never arrived, but despite being wrong year after year, hardly any of the critics have admitted being wrong, or even changed their tune.

Our economies have been dragged down by the woes of debtors, who have been forced to slash spending. To avoid a deep, prolonged slump, we needed policies to offset this drag.

{"Headline": "Western Companies Appear to Push Back Against Chinese Crackdown", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, tentatively but together, they appear to be pushing back.\u201cFor American businesses operating in China, China\u2019s A.M.L. regime is creating more questions than answers,\u201d John Frisbie, the president of the Washington-based council, said in a news release, referring to the antimonopoly law. \u201cWill China use the A.M.L. to protect its domestic industry rather than promote fair competition? Is the Chinese government using the A.M.L. to force lower prices, rather than letting the \u2018market play the decisive role\u2019 as enshrined in China\u2019s new economic reform program?\u201d\u201cThe answers are not fully determined yet, but in at least some cases so far,\u201d Mr. Frisbie said, the council \u201csees troubling reasons for concern.\u201d\u201cPractices such as informing companies not to challenge the investigations, bring lawyers to hearings or involve their respective governments or chambers of commerce are contrary to best practices,\u201d the European chamber\u2019s statement said.The 48-page report by the U.S.-China Business Council highlights some similar worries, noting that 86 percent of the companies it surveyed expressed some concern about competition enforcement activities in China. Companies that have fallen under antitrust scrutiny in China complained about a lack of due process, unfair treatment, lengthy review periods for approving mergers and acquisitions and the lack of transparency in how rulings are reached and fines are set.Examples include unidentified companies\u2019 being pressed by Chinese antitrust enforcers to admit guilt without having a chance to see or respond to the evidence against them, or even to be informed about why they are under investigation, according to the council\u2019s report. Companies also reported being denied the chance to call their legal representatives before enforcers carried out surprise raids on their offices \u2014 a right that is generally afforded in the United States and Europe \u2014 and their lawyers\u2019 being excluded from the protracted negotiations that can ensue.\u201cTargeted or not, foreign companies have well-founded concerns about how investigations are conducted and decided,\u201d said Mr. Frisbie, the council\u2019s president. \u201cDue process, transparency and the methodology for determining remedies and fines all need improvement.\u201dSo far, it is primarily foreign business lobbying groups that are sounding the alarm, although certain complaints about China\u2019s antimonopoly law enforcement did figure in the most recent Strategic and Economic Dialogue. For that dialogue, Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew of the United States traveled to Beijing in July for annual bilateral talks with China\u2019s state councilor, Yang Jiechi, and vice premier, Wang Yang.\u201cThe objective of competition policy is to promote consumer welfare and economic efficiency rather than promote individual competitors or industries, and that enforcement of their respective competition laws should be fair, objective, transparent, and nondiscriminatory,\u201d the two sides said in a news release after the talks.If China\u2019s antitrust actions are giving Western companies a chill, it comes against the backdrop of an already frosty investment environment.Foreign direct investment into mainland China fell 17 percent in July compared with a year earlier, and fell 0.4 percent, to $71.1 billion, in the first seven months of the year. The figures, which exclude the financial sector, showed investment from Japan was down 45.4 percent in the first seven months, while American investment fell 17.4 percent and European investment fell 17.5 percent.China\u2019s slowing economic growth and rising labor and other operating costs no doubt weighed on investment flows. But the country\u2019s antitrust actions are unlikely to help improve the situation.In announcing the investment figures last month, Shen Danyang, a spokesman for China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce, was quick to reject any connection between declining investment and the energetic enforcement of the antimonopoly law.\u201cGroundless speculation is completely unnecessary,\u201d Mr. Shen said, according to Xinhua, the official news agency. Investment flows may fluctuate as China readjusts its economy, he said, \u201cbut such fluctuations are not evidence for changing trends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In China, Steel Consumption Drops as Economy Slows", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDALIAN, China \u2014 China\u2019s steel consumption dropped this year for the first time since at least 2000 because of slower economic growth, leading to a surplus of iron ore in the country and a plunge of more than 40 percent in its price.The consumption dropped 0.3 percent, to 500 million metric tons, in the first eight months of the year compared with a year ago, Wang Xiaoqi, vice chairman of the China Iron and Steel Association, said during an industry conference Thursday.\u201cThere are many reasons for this \u2014 the economy slowing and the economy undergoing restructuring,\u201d he said. \u201cSteel-consuming sectors have cut their demand.\u201dWith China now steering growth toward consumption and away from the investment that has propelled years of expansion in the domestic steel sector, Mr. Wang said, \u201cfrom now, domestic steel output and consumption won\u2019t rise along with economic growth.\u201dThe decline in China\u2019s steel consumption this year is the first time demand has shrunk since 2000, said Ian Roper, a commodity strategist at the brokerage firm CLSA, who has tracked the data since that year.\u201cWe\u2019ve been bearish for a while, saying property construction activity has peaked, but maybe the scale of the decline will be faster than we anticipated,\u201d Mr. Roper said. \u201cThis reinforces our view that there will be a multiyear downtrend in demand for iron ore, and there\u2019s no hope for a recovery in prices to anywhere near $100 per ton,\u201d he added.Iron ore supply exceeded demand in China by 81 million tons in the period from January to August, Mr. Wang said.Iron ore fell below $80 a ton this week for the first time since September 2009 and is on track for its biggest annual drop amid a deep supply glut stoked by global mining companies like Vale and Rio Tinto, which can produce the ore at a lower cost than smaller companies.Shanghai rebar futures, an indicator of demand for steel, plunged more than 3 percent to a record on Thursday. The futures have shed about 30 percent of their value this year and could come under further pressure if output remains high amid poor demand.Estimated crude steel consumption in China, the world\u2019s top consumer and producer of the metal, fell 1.9 percent in August, compared with a year ago, to 61.9 million tons, Mr. Wang said.China\u2019s crude steel output is likely to hit 826 million tons for the year, Mr. Wang said, up 6 percent from the official 2013 output figure released by the government, but only slightly above the 822 million tons cited in August by the leading Chinese steel maker, Baoshan Iron and Steel.But the major mining companies, which have invested billions of dollars to increase output in order to sell more iron ore to China, are still convinced that Chinese demand has yet to peak.Claudio Alves, the global director of iron ore marketing and sales at Vale, the Brazilian company that is the top iron ore producer, said the \u201ccycle of development and urbanization in China will continue for another 10 years.\u201dVale is planning to raise its annual output to 453 million tons by 2018, compared with 306 million tons last year. Rio Tinto, the second-largest producer, agrees, saying that the long-term fundamentals remain strong.\u201cWe expect Chinese growth in steel consumption per capita to continue out as far as 2030,\u201d said Alan Smith, president of the company\u2019s iron ore unit for Asia. \u201cRio Tinto\u2019s assessment remains that China will reach around 1 billion tons of crude steel demand by 2030.\u201dLess optimistic is Dai Zhihao, a top executive at Baosteel, who said that low iron ore prices were here to stay. He estimates that China\u2019s steel production will peak at 800 million to 900 million tons around 2018.\u201cI personally feel this fall represents a new status quo,\u201d Mr. Dai said. \u201cLooking at the distribution of profit across this industry and at the relationship between supply and demand, the current price is rational.

{"Headline": "The New History Wars", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorDisagreement is not a bad thing. But learning history means engaging with aspects of the past that are troubling, as well as those that are heroic.There was a time, for example, when historians didn\u2019t worry much about the slave trade and the emergence of an economy based on forced labor. Historians likened the plantation to a \u201cschool,\u201d and emancipated people as children let out of class too soon. Only slightly more than a half-century ago, historians began to \u201crevise\u201d that narrative, examining sources previously ignored or unseen, informed by new ideas about race and human agency. More recently, scholars have revised 19th-century images of the \u201cvanishing Indian,\u201d a wildly inaccurate narrative that lives on in public monuments and popular lore, and has implications for public policy. This essential process of reconsideration and re-evaluation takes place in all disciplines; imagine a diagnosis from a physician who does not read \u201crevisionist\u201d medical research.Revisionism is necessary \u2014 and it generates controversy, especially when new scholarship finds its way into classrooms. But debate over what is taught in our schools is hardly new. Part of the logic underlying the creation of Catholic schools in 19th-century America had to do with a public-school curriculum that took a distinctly Protestant view of religious conflicts and cultural values. Since the early 20th century, battles have been waged over the relative place of \u201chistory\u201d and \u201ccivics\u201d in public education, a dichotomy that many professional historians don\u2019t even accept. The critics are unhappy, perhaps, that a once comforting story has become, in the hands of scholars, more complex, unsettling, provocative and compelling.And there\u2019s the rub. Fewer and fewer college professors are teaching the United States history our grandparents learned \u2014 memorizing a litany of names, dates and facts \u2014 and this upsets some people. \u201cCollege-level work\u201d now requires attention to context, and change over time; includes greater use of primary sources; and reassesses traditional narratives. This is work that requires and builds empathy, an essential aspect of historical thinking.The educators and historians who worked on the new history framework were right to emphasize historical thinking as an essential aspect of civic culture. Their efforts deserve a spirited debate, one that is always open to revision, rather than ill-informed assumptions or political partisanship. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hiring Data Isn\u2019t Strong Enough to Lift Democrats\u2019 Hopes for November ", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 With Friday\u2019s disappointing jobs report for August, Democrats can pretty much give up any remaining hopes that voters will shake their gloom about the economy before this fall\u2019s midterm elections.After six consecutive months of monthly job gains exceeding 200,000, the Obama administration and Democratic candidates across the nation had harbored some optimism that the political climate might become less negative for their party if growth on that scale continued. It did not, despite analysts\u2019 predictions of up to 250,000 new hires.The latest report of a tepid 142,000 increase in employers\u2019 payrolls in August instead is likely to leave voters\u2019 attitudes little changed. That is discouraging news for Democrats, given that Americans tell pollsters that the economy is their No. 1 concern going into elections that will determine which party controls the Senate and House for President Obama\u2019s final two years in office, and voters generally hold the president\u2019s party responsible.Some economists cautioned against drawing broad conclusions from a single month\u2019s report, particularly given other, more positive data lately. But politicians know that for voters, the unemployment rate generally is the best-known and understood measure, and that just one more jobs report \u2014 on September hiring \u2014 will be released before final ballots are cast on Nov. 4.\u201cThe most important issue driving this election cycle is the economy,\u201d wrote Celinda Lake a Democratic pollster, in an analysis this week of results from a bipartisan poll conducted with Ed Goeas of the Tarrance Group, a Republican firm.Before the jobs report, which came after weeks of more positive reports on construction, manufacturing, exports and business orders, Democratic strategists urged the White House and congressional Democrats to step up their campaigning for the party\u2019s job-creation agenda. \u201cThe president and the vice president should hit the road with the Democratic alternative on the economy, and Bill Clinton as well,\u201d Ms. Lake said in an interview.But the president, who finished a NATO summit in Wales on Friday, has been distracted by a series of international crises this year from concentrating on domestic issues, as he and his advisers had planned. In any case, Mr. Goeas, the Republican pollster, said it was too late to improve voters\u2019 negative assessment of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic stewardship \u201cbecause the hole is so deep.\u201dRepublicans are putting greater emphasis on the economy as well. Their pollsters and consultants have warned them that the party\u2019s chances for a good political year were diminished by its record-low popularity, the lack of legislative achievements in the Republican-controlled House and Republicans\u2019 seeming focus on investigating and suing Mr. Obama.Both parties are promising action to invigorate the economy. Republicans are calling for deep corporate tax cuts, while Democrats are emphasizing investments in infrastructure improvements, a higher minimum wage and pay equity for women, as well as targeted tax cuts for small businesses.Typically, political consultants say that voters\u2019 attitudes about the economy are set by summer in an election year. But this year, some Democrats suggested that a continuing trend of positive job growth could sway voters right up to the election, with the help of social media. Yet while August was the 54th consecutive month of jobs growth \u2014 \u201cthe longest streak on record,\u201d administration officials say, adding more than 10 million jobs \u2014 news about the employment report was somewhat negative given the markets\u2019 higher expectations.The August hiring occurred against a backdrop of increasing global tension, with Europe again tipping toward recession. That suggests that the United States economy is facing the kind of headwinds that have repeatedly hindered its full recovery in recent years and dragged down Mr. Obama\u2019s popularity.The fitful economic progress has stoked Americans\u2019 gloom, as has the fact that growth in the economy, jobs and stock markets has not been accompanied by meaningful gains in workers\u2019 wages. That has deterred the White House and congressional Democrats from taking credit for ending the recession Mr. Obama inherited, lest they seem out of touch with workers\u2019 worries.\u201cThere are no victory laps,\u201d Ms. Lake said.The fine line that the White House walks \u2014 between drawing attention to good economic news and recognizing weaknesses that linger \u2014 was evident this week. On Wednesday, reflecting anticipation in the private sector that Friday would bring another good employment report, Mr. Obama\u2019s three top economic advisers invited reporters in for an overview of the economic progress to date.Reacting on Friday to the labor report, Jason Furman, the chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, again emphasized the continued job growth, calling the figure \u201ca marker of the progress that has been made.\u201d But, he immediately added, it was also \u201ca reminder that more must still be done to create jobs, especially for the long-term unemployed, and grow the middle class.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Reports Expansion as Economy Improves", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The economy strengthened in all regions of the country in July and August, including in areas like consumer spending, auto sales and tourism, the Federal Reserve reported in a survey released on Wednesday.A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that business orders for factory goods shot up by a record amount in July, reflecting a surge in demand in the volatile category of commercial aircraft. But outside of transportation, orders actually fell slightly during the month, although the setback was expected to be temporary.The Fed said all 12 of its regions reported growth. Six \u2014 New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, Dallas and San Francisco \u2014 characterized growth as \u201cmoderate.\u201d The other regions reported somewhat slower expansion. Four described growth as \u201cmodest,\u201d and two noted signs of improvement.The survey found no clear evidence that the economy was expanding so fast that the Fed might soon need to begin raising interest rates to prevent inflation.Most regions reported optimism about crucial economic sectors. A majority cited increased loan demand, for example, and hotel occupancies.The survey, known as the Beige Book, is based on anecdotal reports from businesses and will be considered with other data when Fed policy makers meet on Sept. 16 and 17.After that meeting, the Fed is expected to reduce its monthly bond purchases for a seventh time but leave its key short-term interest rate unchanged. That rate has been near zero since December 2008 in an effort to overcome the financial crisis and revive the economy. Now, with job growth strong and unemployment falling, investors have been speculating about when the Fed will start raising rates. Most analysts think the first increase will occur around mid-2015.In other economic news, the Commerce Department said factory orders rose 10.5 percent in July, the biggest one-month increase on record going back to 1992. Orders for civilian jetliners rose fourfold. But excluding transportation, orders edged down 0.8 percent and an important category that serves as a proxy for business investment plans fell 0.7 percent.Manufacturing has been a source of strength this year, helped by robust demand for new cars, other consumer items and business equipment. Economists expect that strength to continue.The report showed that orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, were up 22.6 percent in July, unchanged from the estimate in a preliminary report last week. Orders for nondurable goods such as paper, chemicals and food were down 0.9 percent in July after a 0.4 percent increase in June.In addition to the surge in demand for airplanes, orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 7.3 percent, reflecting continued strong consumer demand for new cars and trucks.But there was slippage in other areas. Orders for primary metals such as steel fell 0.3 percent, demand for machinery was down 1.2 percent, and orders for computers and other electronics products fell 14.7 percent.Most economists expect that manufacturing production will provide solid support in the second half of this year.Advertisement"}

If nothing is done, the federal government will run out of money on Oct. 1, and the federal Export-Import Bank \u2014 which underwrites American private-sector exports \u2014 will exhaust its charter.But Mr. Cantor was the man who could translate the wishes of Big Business to the conservatives. Without him, the Export-Import Bank and its business supporters have lost their most persuasive advocate. Asked who in the new leadership can talk to business interests and Wall Street, Mr. Scalise said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201dWithout him, House Republicans are left with a comparatively inexperienced leadership team. In his 24th year in Congress, Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio has broad legislative experience and the skills of a political survivor. Below him, the new House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, is in his fourth term and Mr. Scalise his third. In official rankings, Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, Mr. Scalise\u2019s chief deputy, is the second-most senior member of leadership, just nudging out a fellow fifth-termer, the Republican Conference chairwoman, Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington.Besides the speaker, no member of the House Republican leadership was in Congress for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or the invasion of Iraq. The top six Republican leaders have served a collective 64 years in the House. The top three Democratic leaders have served 80. \u201cThis is unique,\u201d said Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cYou now have a sizable number in leadership who were not there when the parties routinely worked together or who have a significant understanding of operating in divided governance. The only thing they\u2019ve seen is tribalism.\u201dWhat is more, with so little time in Washington, the new leadership team has yet to develop deep connections to the K Street lobbying world or the elders in either political party.Mr. Scalise said his degree is in computer science, an interest he maintains, but what animates him most is the oil and gas industry that has long been central to the Louisiana economy.\u201cBuild the Keystone pipeline, open up the outer continental shelf, bring in billions of dollars to the Treasury to help us balance the budget, look at the E.P.A. and what it\u2019s trying to do to shut down energy production in America,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is real stuff that\u2019s happening in the country, and it\u2019s not just Louisiana.\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask for it,\u201d Mr. Livingston said of his advice. \u201cI volunteer it.\u201dAnother former House member from Louisiana, Jim McCrery, was once the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. Now, as a senior tax lobbyist in Washington, he said he had spoken with the new majority leader on a broad overhaul of the tax code.\u201cLouisiana over the years has managed to have a delegation that is stronger than its numbers,\u201d Mr. McCrery said. \u201cWe\u2019re still a long way away from being where we used to be, but it\u2019s a good start.\u201dLouisiana\u2019s gain has been New York\u2019s loss. Representative Peter T. King, one of the last in New York\u2019s shrinking Republican delegation, said Mr. McCarthy had been developing contacts with Wall Street and the Big Business community. But it is a measure of business\u2019s relative lack of influence that Mr. McCarthy turned against reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank shortly after Mr. Cantor\u2019s defeat.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups have mounted an all-out campaign to save the bank, arguing that its loans and loan guarantees to foreign customers of American exporters are vital to the country\u2019s competitiveness in a global economy. But conservative activists have denounced the bank as corporate welfare, an argument Mr. Cantor was willing to rebut but his successor has avoided.With Mr. Cantor gone, the coalition supporting the bank has opted for a bottom-up campaign, sending home-district manufacturers to lobby rank-and-file members and largely bypassing Republican leaders.\u201cWe need a durable solution to this issue,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former Bush administration official organizing the campaign.The new leadership team at one point turned to Mr. McHenry, the chief deputy whip, as the possible point person with Wall Street. He does serve on the House Financial Services Committee, but as the sixth man in leadership, he can wield only so much influence.\u201cObviously Eric was the conduit on a number of these issues,\u201d Mr. King said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Kentucky, Health Law Helps Voters but Saps Votes", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRemaking MedicineLOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 The Affordable Care Act allowed Robin Evans, an eBay warehouse packer earning $9 an hour, to sign up for Medicaid this year. She is being treated for high blood pressure and Graves\u2019 disease, an autoimmune disorder, after years of going uninsured and rarely seeing doctors.\u201cI\u2019m tickled to death with it,\u201d Ms. Evans, 49, said of her new coverage as she walked around the Kentucky State Fair recently with her daughter, who also qualified for Medicaid under the law. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me out a bunch.\u201dBut Ms. Evans scowled at the mention of President Obama \u2014 \u201cNobody don\u2019t care for nobody no more, and I think he\u2019s got a lot to do with that,\u201d she explained \u2014 and said she would vote this fall for Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, who is fond of saying the health care law should be \u201cpulled out root and branch.\u201dMs. Evans said she did not want the law repealed but had too many overall reservations about Democrats to switch her vote. \u201cBorn and raised Republican,\u201d she said of herself. \u201cI ain\u2019t planning on changing now.\u201dArticles in this series will examine how the Obama health care law is affecting lives in one American city.But there is little evidence that the expansion of health coverage will help Kentucky Democrats in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. Republicans hold all of the state\u2019s congressional seats except for one, in a district centered in Louisville, and none are considered vulnerable this year. Republicans, who already control the State Senate, have a chance of taking the State House of Representatives, where Democrats hold an eight-seat majority. And several recent polls have put Mr. McConnell ahead of his Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, even though his approval ratings are tepid.Mr. McConnell and other Republicans here, while more focused on other issues, like protecting Kentucky\u2019s coal industry, continue to attack the health law as a symbol of government overreach and Democratic bungling. And far from flaunting Kentucky\u2019s strong enrollment numbers, Democratic candidates \u2014 most notably Ms. Grimes \u2014 have remained reticent about the law, even its successes.\u201cThe campaign by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s critics against it has been very effective in demonizing the phrase Obamacare and anything to do with the president,\u201d said Mr. Beshear, who cannot seek re-election next year because of term limits. \u201cSo I think you find a reluctance on the part of people, even though the law is benefiting them, to publicly acknowledge it.\u201dAt the state fair\u2019s annual ham breakfast, Mr. Beshear tried to humanize the law, describing how several farmers in attendance had signed up for the new coverage and how one had used it to check out a spot that turned out to be skin cancer.A year after it was fully in place, the Affordable Care Act has largely succeeded in delivering on President Obama\u2019s main promises, even as it fell short in some ways and gave birth to a new and powerful conservative movement.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the president,\u201d he told the crowd of 1,600, who did not applaud once during the six minutes he spent discussing the law. \u201cIt\u2019s about you. It\u2019s about your families. It\u2019s about your children.\u201dThat message has not persuaded people like Billy Bishop of Lexington, who is retired and gets health insurance through his former employer. He said his out-of-pocket costs had risen sharply while his coverage had gotten worse. He blamed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 particularly its expansion of Medicaid to many more low-income Americans.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything good about it, to be honest,\u201d said Mr. Bishop, who has diabetes and heart stents. \u201cI\u2019ve heard with this, you can\u2019t get doctors\u2019 appointments and people get put on wait lists for surgery.\u201dNonetheless, at the state fair, Mr. Bishop, 57, and his wife, Cindy, 56, stopped by an information booth run by Kynect, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace. Mrs. Bishop was curious about whether she could get less expensive coverage through Kynect, even though her husband refused to consider it for himself.She took some brochures but said that regardless of what she learned about the cost, she and her husband would vote for Mr. McConnell. Mrs. Bishop said Ms. Grimes was \u201cwith Obama on everything,\u201d and she called the president \u201cthe worst we\u2019ve ever had.\u201dAt the teeming fairgrounds in late August, the Kynect booth handed out 26,000 reusable shopping bags stamped with its logo and toll-free number, and more fairgoers were clutching them than corn dogs or cotton candy. Crowds also gathered around information booths sponsored by the managed-care companies providing Medicaid coverage for the newly insured, one of which had a star University of Louisville basketball player greeting passers-by one day.All the marketing did not sway Teri Eisenmenger of Louisville, who said she was against the health care law even though it had allowed her adult daughter to get Medicaid coverage.\u201cMost people are going to see things through their partisan default position,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, Kentucky\u2019s lone Democrat in Congress. \u201cThey separate the personal impact of policies from their perception of what is good for the country.\u201dAt one such gathering last month, at Paul B. Hall Regional Medical Center in Paintsville, Dana Keaton Collett, the hospital\u2019s director of rehabilitation services, told Mr. McConnell that her insurance rates were rising so sharply that it was not worth keeping her coverage.\u201cThis is the consequence of this awful law,\u201d Mr. McConnell replied, adding, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you on the road with me.\u201d(Experts say that although insurance costs are indeed going up, they have been doing so for years, and a slowdown in the rate of health-cost growth since 2009 has moderated the increase in premiums for most people.)Ms. Grimes typically avoids talking about the health care law but, when pressed, says she wants to improve it. At a candidate forum here last month, during which Mr. McConnell called the law catastrophic, Ms. Grimes said, \u201cWe have to work to streamline the Affordable Care Act to make sure there aren\u2019t overburdensome regulations on our businesses.\u201d She also called for letting more people keep their old insurance policies, a point of contention that emerged last fall when several million people\u2019s plans were canceled because they did not comply with the law\u2019s coverage requirements.Some party activists and political analysts say Ms. Grimes is missing an opportunity to excite the Democratic base \u2014 and perhaps siphon votes from Mr. McConnell in places like southern and eastern Kentucky, where the drop in the uninsured rate has been especially steep \u2014 by not vigorously defending the law. \u201cIt may be her last, best chance,\u201d said Al Cross, a longtime Kentucky political reporter.For now, Ms. Grimes is focusing on painting Mr. McConnell as a creature of Washington who will perpetuate partisan battles and gridlock.\u201cI think she realizes, as does the McConnell camp, that this is not going to be an issue that\u2019s going to sway people that much one way or the other,\u201d Mr. Beshear said. \u201cSo she is concentrating her efforts on where they should be, reminding people of the last 30 years of Senator McConnell and the fact that he is part of the problem in Washington, and not part of the solution.\u201dSome Kentucky voters seem receptive to that message.Karen Ekstrom, 60, who described herself as an independent voter, said she and her husband were deeply disappointed with the private insurance he got through Kynect. With the cost at $439 a month, \u201cI really feel we are being ripped off,\u201d she said.Ms. Ekstrom, who works for a medical marketing company in Lexington, is ambivalent about Mr. Obama. But she said she planned to vote for Ms. Grimes, mostly because she sees Mr. McConnell as spending too much time trying to block Mr. Obama on the health care law and other initiatives.\u201cI\u2019m tired of that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a law. Let it go, move on and get some stuff done.\u201dRemaking Medicine: Articles in this series are examining\nhow the Affordable Care Act is\naffecting lives in one American\ncity.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "British Labour Leader Calls for Security Council Resolution on Syria Strikes", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANCHESTER, England \u2014 The British Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, said Tuesday that he supported the United States-led airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State militants, but implied that his support for British participation in military action would depend upon a United Nations Security Council resolution.Mr. Miliband also put the Labour Party firmly behind British membership in the European Union, in counterpoint to Mr. Cameron, who has promised to hold a referendum on British membership if he is still prime minister in 2017. Unless more powers are transferred to the European Union, Mr. Miliband has rejected that idea.\u201cLet me say it plainly,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future lies inside, not outside the European Union.\u201dWhile Mr. Miliband did not speak extensively on foreign affairs, he said that \u201cwe support the overnight action against ISIL,\u201d an alternative acronym for the Islamic State, but \u201cwhat needs to happen now is that the United Nations needs to play its part, a U.N. Security Council Resolution to win the international support to counter the threat of ISIL.\u201dA little over a year ago, Mr. Miliband\u2019s party opposed and helped block British military action alongside the United States against the Syrian government for its use of chemical weapons in part because there was no Security Council resolution, resulting in even Washington giving up the idea.Labour is currently ahead in opinion polls, but only narrowly, and Mr. Miliband is still regarded in the polls as a less credible leader than Mr. Cameron, who is none too popular himself. Labour is also considered a less trustworthy manager of the economy than the Conservatives, and Mr. Miliband spoke more extensively on domestic politics.Speaking for more than hour without notes to a large hall and a national television audience, Mr. Miliband promised that a Labour government would make a large investment in the National Health Service, funded by a tax on properties worth more than 2 million pounds, or $3.27 million, and a further levy on the profits of tobacco companies.The party faithful gave him standing ovations when he defended the health service and promised to spend an additional \u00a32.5 billion, in part to hire 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more doctors, 5,000 more careworkers and 3,000 more midwives by 2020.He promised more homebuilding and help for young workers to add to earlier pledges to increase the minimum wage to more than \u00a38 an hour by 2020 and to freeze energy prices.Mr. Miliband\u2019s task is more difficult because the British economy is rebounding faster than most others in Europe, making a strictly economic appeal less convincing. Instead he sought to capitalize on the sense that middle- and lower-income Britons face a continuing squeeze on living standards and to portray Mr. Cameron\u2019s Conservatives as heartless and uncaring servants of the wealthy.He said Mr. Cameron was a friend to bankers in trouble, a \u201cP.R. man\u201d to energy companies and took big campaign contributions from Russian oligarchs and their spouses. \u201cWell, David Cameron, you\u2019ve been found out,\u201d Mr. Miliband said. \u201cHe stands up for the privileged few.\u201dHe used it for his main theme of \u201cTogether, we can,\u201d and said that any new constitutional arrangements to devolve power to England should be done carefully. And he accused Mr. Cameron of thinking less while lying awake at night about the United Kingdom than about the United Kingdom Independence Party, or UKIP, which threatens the Conservative hold on marginal constituencies in England. Praising the democratic exercise in Scotland, Mr. Miliband called for those age 16 and older to be given the vote in all elections, as they were in the referendum.Mr. Miliband\u2019s speech as a whole seemed to lack the impact of his speech last year and some said it was less passionate. He was competing against big news elsewhere \u2014 the aftermath of an exciting Scottish referendum, the airstrikes on Syria, even the conviction of another BBC radio personality, Dave Lee Travis, for a past sexual abuse.Advertisement"}

You know what I mean.

Their airplanes have rooms, for heaven\u2019s sake. But if it did.President Obama would not yell. He would sigh a deep sigh. The atmosphere around him would grow very cold. More sighs. Time passes very slowly.John Boehner might yell, but he would not actually expect anyone to pay any attention.It is possible that Hillary Clinton would not know the seat in front of her had reclined, since she is famous for being able to fall asleep at will. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s staff says she, too, is often conked out before the plane even takes off. Perhaps this is a woman thing, but, speaking as a woman, I doubt it. Bill Clinton might simply regard the reclinee as a new listener who had entered his orbit unexpectedly, and begin recounting a very long story.Joe Biden: \u201cNow that you\u2019re in my lap, would you mind taking a selfie?\u201dThe reclining-seat debate has become a bit of an aviation crisis. We had three flight diversions in eight days recently because of it. The latest occurred this week when an elderly woman who was knitting dropped her seat back, bonking the woman sitting behind her, who had been resting her head on a tray table. You could see why the victim would be irked, but demanding that the pilot \u201cput this plane down now\u201d seems a bit much. A flight from Miami to Paris wound up on the ground in Boston after a Frenchman took offense at being reclined upon. And then, of course, there was the United Airlines passenger who locked the seat in front of him into an upright position with a Knee Defender, and got a glass of soda thrown in his face. Two weeks ago, most of us had no idea something called a Knee Defender existed, and now we have intense opinions about whether or not it should be legal.\u201cI\u2019d never heard of that product, but I think it\u2019s a crazy idea,\u201d said Representative Rick Larsen of Washington. Larsen is the lead Democrat on the House Aviation Subcommittee. I think Washington needs to look into this. Americans want to know more about the airline recliner options, mainly because, at the moment, this is the only current affair that is not incredibly frightening or depressing. It could be the 2014 version of a feel-good public hearing. Yet no. \u201cWhile he\u2019s had his fair share of bruised knees and close quarters with his fellow passengers, Congressman LoBiondo does not believe this is an issue for Congress to tackle,\u201d said a spokesman for Representative Frank LoBiondo, the chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee.Well, maybe they\u2019ll have a hearing about the theft of the naked movie star pictures.Members of Congress do sometimes fly coach. The ones who\u2019ve been around for a while often move into perpetual upgrade territory because they\u2019ve been on so many airplanes they reach frequent-flier nirvana, like George Clooney in that movie. But most have their coach moments. Representative Larsen says he definitely does not yell when somebody reclines into his space. \u201cIn my job, I don\u2019t want to be the person who makes someone else mad on an airplane,\u201d he said. \u201cNo way.\u201d We all know, of course, that air travel is extremely uncomfortable. That your average economy seat is now 17 inches wide and has about 31 inches of space before the one in front. That the flights are frequently jam-packed, that the air terminals generally have the ambience of a North Korean hotel and the comfort of a mammogram. Nobody expects a tasty snack or space in the overhead compartment. The reclining seat is the last remaining marketing symbol of travel comfort. \u201c \u2018Sit back, relax and enjoy your flight\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019ve been hearing that since I started doing this work,\u201d said Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants.Maybe the airlines should just admit the truth. Instead of telling the benumbed passengers about their flotation devices, maybe the announcer could warn them, at the beginning of their flight, that reclining their chairs will probably create discomfort for the person behind them, and that they might want, at minimum, to go back gradually so the poor soul behind has a moment to adjust to the inevitable. \u201cWe\u2019ve not taken a position on that,\u201d said Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for an airline trade association. Passengers might behave better if they were encouraged to abandon hope. Instead of \u201cWelcome Aboard,\u201d the airlines could leave a message in the seat pockets: \u201cFace it: You\u2019re going to be uncomfortable and wide-awake for the next several hours.\u201dUnless you\u2019re Nancy Pelosi.

Prices of staple goods are going up, and food supplies are dwindling. Border posts are being closed, foreign workers are going home and national growth rates are projected to plummet.Ebola \u2014 the reality and the hysteria over it \u2014 is having a serious economic impact on Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, three West African nations already at the bottom of global economic and social indicators. Aggravating both the financial and social consequences, these countries and their frightened neighbors are imposing concentric circles of quarantines, cutting off neighborhoods, regions and even whole nations.International medical authorities have warned against such practices, arguing that they will worsen suffering and deprivation, and do little to stop the spread of the disease. But many African nations have gone ahead anyway, sealing borders, barring entry to residents of the affected countries and barring their airlines from flying to those countries. Senegal has even refused to allow humanitarian flights with urgently needed supplies and medical personnel to take off from Dakar, the West African hub for international aid agencies. South Africa and Kenya, two of the continent\u2019s economic heavyweights, have restricted entry to people coming from the Ebola zone.For the worst-hit countries, \u201cisolating and stigmatizing them and making it difficult to transport supplies, personnel and other resources\u201d can only make things worse, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional director for Africa, Luis Gomes Sambo, said at a meeting in Ghana last week.For three nations that have only recently emerged from decades of war and political upheaval, Ebola has dealt a hard blow.\u201cAfter a decade of conflict we were set to restore the economy to its prewar status,\u201d Amara Konneh, Liberia\u2019s finance minister, said in an interview. \u201cThis outbreak is dealing a serious blow to all of our efforts. This is the biggest crisis we have faced since the end of our civil war.\u201dWith sections of Liberia and Sierra Leone under quarantine and the borders of Senegal and Guinea sealed, the movement of goods has slowed. National budgets are under strain, health care expenditures are rising, government revenues are dropping and agricultural production, especially in Sierra Leone, has been hurt. South Africa is barring entry to non-South Africans who have been in the affected countries, and Kenya and Senegal are practicing similar measures.Questions and answers on the scale of the outbreak and the science of the Ebola virus.This week the United Nations warned that the price of cassava, a staple starch, increased 150 percent in Monrovia, the Liberian capital, in the first week of August. In Sierra Leone, rice, fish, palm oil and other basics have all risen in price, according to the country\u2019s finance ministry.\u201cMy staff said, \u2018At least during the war, you knew when the rebels were coming,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Day said. He has had to shut down much of his operation and lay off many in his staff of around 90.Five months into the epidemic, World Bank officials said they were still working out its economic impact in light of a new World Health Organization estimate of 20,000 potential Ebola cases.Yet the bank has already projected a drop in Guinea\u2019s G.D.P. growth rate of at least 1 percent. In Liberia, health care expenditures will now account for 25 percent of the government\u2019s annual budget because of Ebola, instead of 8 percent, said the country\u2019s finance minister. ArcelorMittal, which runs a major iron ore mining operation in Liberia, has delayed an expansion because contractors have evacuated 645 employees. In Sierra Leone, where the country\u2019s main agricultural region has been hardest hit, the finance ministry wrote this week of the \u201cdevastating impact of the disease\u201d on the country\u2019s economy, and predicted a 4 percent drop in growth.In Sierra Leone, where the finance ministry this week produced a detailed summary of Ebola\u2019s economic implications, there will be fewer farmers to harvest cassava, cocoa and coffee in the country\u2019s breadbasket. Villagers spoke of harvests being canceled this year because so many farmers had died, and the finance ministry predicted \u201cthe loss of a whole planting season.\u201d It projected a one-third drop in agricultural output.Roads normally well-traveled by produce-bearing vehicles are empty. At checkpoints along the main road, crowds of small traders are backed up, refused passage by soldiers and the police.In the capital, Freetown, patrons are sparse at hotels and restaurants catering to the expatriates who are vital for the economy. Hotel occupancy rates have dropped 40 percent.There is already \u201cscaling down\u201d at the country\u2019s three biggest manufacturers: a brewery, a bottling company and a cement plant, the finance ministry said. Construction on major road projects has been suspended after the evacuation of foreign staff members overseeing them. Mining, of iron and diamonds, most significantly, presents a mixed picture, with some companies expected to meet production targets, but diamond miners probably not, with a production drop in the latter sector of 10.4 percent.In Kenema, population 600,000, the major city in Sierra Leone\u2019s Ebola zone, the market stalls are still full of goods and produce, but it is unclear how much of the produce, on which the rest of the country depends, is flowing out. There is a \u201cshortage of basic food items in the markets, especially in the urban areas,\u201d the finance ministry said.\u201cYou have a general sense that the economy is completely shut up,\u201d said a leading official in the region, David Keili-Coomber, the paramount chief. Timber harvesting, a mainstay, is frozen because trucks cannot move the trees out due to roadblocks.Farmers need bank loans to hire labor to clear the land around the cacao trees, but \u201cbecause of Ebola they won\u2019t give us loans,\u201d Mr. Keili-Coomber said. \u201cThere is a general atmosphere of fear.\u201dMr. Day, the manager of Tropical Farms, said the epidemic had stymied his operation. Buying cocoa and coffee beans has become nearly impossible. \u201cWe can\u2019t take the risk of sending staff into the bush,\u201d to buy beans from small-scale growers, he said in an interview in Kenema.Many of them have died, in any case. \u201cThe guys from this village, or that village, have died,\u201d Mr. Day continued. \u201cThat makes it really upsetting. I know these guys.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worth Its Weight", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.If you said that a principal cause of the 2008 financial crisis was an explosion in credit, most economic commentators would nod their heads in agreement. If you then said this credit boom was due to lax monetary policy, you\u2019d still earn a healthy fraction of nods. If you then asserted that America\u2019s departure from the gold standard caused the lax monetary policy, not many folks would be nodding. Nevertheless, this attenuated causal chain has been embraced by a motley collection of wonks, cranks and presidential candidates: Michele Bachmann, Glenn Beck, Steve Forbes, David Stockman and politicians whose last name is Paul. These gold bugs have a deep suspicion of fiat currency. They fret that governments that can just print money will be tempted to print even more, triggering inflation, currency depreciation and worse. Most citizens do not share this obsession, but they might share an unease about the dollar being backed by nothing more than a social convention to treat greenbacks as if they are worth more than the paper they are printed on.It is this unease that Kwasi Kwarteng tries to tap into with \u201cWar and Gold.\u201d A Cambridge-educated historian, Conservative member of Parliament in Britain and the author of the excellent \u201cGhosts of Empire: Britain\u2019s Legacies in the Modern World,\u201d Kwarteng attempts to recount 500 years of monetary history in accessible prose. He makes his thesis clear at the outset: The history of money is one of oscillation between \u201cperiods of monetary chaos,\u201d when governments issue fiat currency, and \u201cperiods of relative order,\u201d when currencies are linked to gold. The bulk of \u201cWar and Gold\u201d is devoted to observing that things seemed much, much better during eras when currencies were tied to gold. In his introduction, Kwarteng explicitly says he is not advocating a return to the pre-1914 gold standard. Rather than echoing Rand Paul, Kwarteng writes more like a Tory nostalgic for the solidity of Robert Peel in 19th-century England or the Eisenhower era in 20th-century America. At the outset, Kwarteng says, \u201cThis book is a work of history. It is not a tract of economic theory.\u201d His statement reveals both the biggest strengths and weaknesses of \u201cWar and Gold.\u201d One strength is in the lucidity of Kwarteng\u2019s narrative style. \u201cWar and Gold\u201d manages to sweeten the abstruse parts of his monetary history with anecdotes about the major actors \u2014 gamblers like John Law (a Scotsman who engineered a massive financial bubble in 18th-century France) or statesmen like Joseph Dodge (an American who tamed inflation in post-1945 Germany and Japan). Kwarteng has a flair for the elegant turn of phrase. He describes the Bretton Woods system that prioritized policy autonomy over open capital markets as one in which \u201cdomestic policies would be lead partner in the dance.\u201d As a good historian, Kwarteng also acknowledges some occasions when the facts do not go his way. He is candid, for example, that the United States\u2019 adherence to the gold standard helped cause the credit bubble in the 1920s that led to the 1929 stock market crash. When it comes to fiat currency, \u00adhowever, \u201cWar and Gold\u201d tries and fails to convert modest correlation into strong causation. Kwarteng is correct to point out that \u00adbefore 1918, fiat currency tended to be associated with massive economic uncertainty. This elides the rather important fact that countries usually issued such currencies during times of war or revolution, and maybe it was those events, and not the paper currency, that were responsible for the economic chaos. Kwarteng should be aware of this \u2014 the book is called \u201cWar and Gold\u201d after all \u2014 but he focuses much more on the paper currency and much less on the reasons behind it.Unfortunately, that is not the only problem with this book. Even as history, Kwarteng\u2019s account is incomplete in ways inconvenient for hard money fans. There is no discussion of the link between the gold standard and the prevalence of deep recessions and crippling deflations during the late 19th century. There is no mention that the countries that stayed on the gold standard the longest during the interwar period \u2014 including America and France \u2014 were among the ones that suffered the deepest economic pain from the Great \u00adDepression. They were also more likely to resort to trade protectionism after the 1929 stock market crash.Kwarteng stumbles further when he tries to connect his historical narrative to current monetary debates; these are the places where a better grounding in economics would have served him well. At one point, he paints modern advocates of quantitative easing \u2014 printing more money even after slashing interest rates close to zero \u2014 as \u201cthe intellectual descendants of John Law.\u201d The obvious inference the reader is supposed to draw is that quantitative easers are fated to repeat the bubble that Law created 300 years ago. Similarly, in his discussion of Keynesianism, Kwarteng argues that \u201cthe country which best typified this new, \u2018gold-free\u2019 approach to finance\u201d was Nazi Germany. Both assertions have a weak reed of plausibility, but they obscure far more than they reveal. Since modern central bankers all believe in fiat currencies and expanding the money supply to stimulate economic growth, they are all the intellectual descendants of John Law. Quantitative easing is simply another policy consistent with this belief. The parallel between Nazism and Keynesianism is even more off-base. A raft of \u00adDepression-era governments boosted government spending; what made the Nazis unique was the tight rationing of credit as a policy tool. Keynes has been accused of a lot of things over the years, but advocating credit rationing during a depression is not one of them.I doubt Kwarteng was trying to be disingenuous with these comparisons. Rather, he is genuinely uncomfortable with the ability of countries to issue paper money to perpetuate fiscal profligacy, expand credit and erode currency values. Kwarteng\u2019s worries are understandable given what has happened in the past, but \u201cWar and Gold\u201d overlooks compensating trends that mitigate some of these concerns. The rise of independent central banks over the past half-century was designed to be a bulwark against monetary authorities kowtowing to politicians. Insulated from political pressures, central bankers can take unpopular actions to cool off \u00adinflation. Independence allowed the Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker to wring inflation out of the United States \u00adeconomy in the early 1980s, and the Bundesbank\u2019s Helmut Schlesinger to do the same \u00adfollowing German reunification in 1990. Kwarteng\u2019s qualms are not entirely groundless, but recent history shows that the greater \u00adconcern should come from monetary \u00adauthorities obsessing about inflation at the expense of growth (see: \u00adeurozone, crisis of). Kwarteng has written an engaging but radically incomplete history of money. Gold bugs will embrace it. I sincerely hope the Fed does not.

Putin of Russia that there is room for a cease-fire between Ukrainian forces and the separatists battling them with Russian support in eastern Ukraine.Mr. Hollande\u2019s announcement came as the heads of the NATO allies were preparing to meet in Wales on Thursday to discuss how to deal with Russia\u2019s increasingly aggressive behavior.France had agreed in 2011 to a $1.6 billion deal to build two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships for the Russia Navy and to train the Russians in operating them. The warships are designed to carry up to 30 helicopters, 60 armored vehicles, 13 tanks and 700 soldiers.In June, more than 400 Russian sailors arrived in Saint-Nazaire, a shipbuilding city on the Atlantic coast southwest of Paris, to begin training on the Vladivostok, the first of the two warships. The Vladivostok was scheduled for delivery this fall, while the second ship, the Sevastopol, was due for delivery next year.It was unclear from Mr. Hollande\u2019s statement whether the delay would affect the training of the Russian sailors or other work on the ships. The statement also did not specify when or under what conditions the government might revisit its decision to delay the delivery.In a recent interview in the newspaper Le Monde, Mr. Hollande, speaking about the possibility of delaying the delivery of the warships, acknowledged that \u201cif there was additional tension and it was impossible to find a way out, we would have to think about it.\u201dRussia sought to play down the significance of the delay. \u201cThe Defense Ministry doesn\u2019t see any tragedy in this, though, of course, it is unpleasant and lays certain tension on our cooperation with the French partners,\u201d the deputy defense minister, Yuri Borisov, was quoted as saying by Russia\u2019s state-run news agency Itar-Tass. \u201cBut a rejection of this contract won\u2019t be any tragedy for us in regard of the rearmament plan and implementation of the state armament program.\u201dThe United States, which has long expressed concern about the Mistral sale, welcomed the French decision.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, speaking at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., before traveling to Wales for the NATO meeting, called the delay \u201cpretty significant,\u201d and described it as another example of how Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine had isolated the Kremlin. Jen Psaki, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters at the daily briefing in Washington that France had made \u201ca wise decision.\u201dDespite growing concerns from the United States and Germany, France had until now insisted on completing the sale even as Russia seized and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in March and supported the pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Sevastopol, the second warship\u2019s namesake, is in Crimea.The 2011 deal was viewed as a triumph in Saint-Nazaire, where the shipyards had fallen on hard times and the unemployment rate has been running about 14 percent. Half of the workers at the main shipbuilder, STX France \u2014 some 2,500 employees \u2014 were put on reduced hours in 2009.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Demanding More From College", "Date": "2014-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019M beginning to think that college exists mainly so we can debate and deconstruct it. What\u2019s its rightful mission? How has it changed? Is it sufficiently accessible? Invariably worthwhile? I have a problem with all of this. But my concern isn\u2019t about the arguments themselves or some of the conclusions drawn. It\u2019s about the narrowness of the discussion, which so heavily emphasizes how a career is successfully forged and how financial security is quickly achieved.While those goals are important and that focus is understandable, there\u2019s another dimension to college, and it\u2019s one in which students aren\u2019t being served, or serving themselves, especially well. I\u2019m referring to the potential \u2014 and need \u2014 for college to confront and change political and social aspects of American life that are as troubling as the economy.We live in a country of sharpening divisions, pronounced tribalism, corrosive polarization. And I wish we would nudge kids \u2014 no, I wish we would push them \u2014 to use college as an exception and a retort to that, as a pre-emptive strike against it, as a staging ground for behaving and living in a different, broader, healthier way.As we pepper students with contradictory information and competing philosophies about college\u2019s role as an on ramp to professional glory, we should talk as much about the way college can establish patterns of reading, thinking and interacting that buck the current tendency among Americans to tuck themselves into enclaves of confederates with the same politics, the same cultural tastes, the same incomes. That tendency fuels the little and big misunderstandings that are driving us apart. It\u2019s at the very root of our sclerotic, dysfunctional political process.And college is the perfect chapter for diversifying friends and influences, rummaging around in fresh perspectives, bridging divides. For many students, it\u2019s an environment more populous than high school was, with more directions in which to turn. It gives them more agency over their calendars and their allegiances. They can better construct their world from scratch.And the clay hasn\u2019t dried on who they are. They\u2019re not yet set in their ways.But too many kids get to college and try instantly to collapse it, to make it as comfortable and recognizable as possible. They replicate the friends and friendships they\u2019ve previously enjoyed. They join groups that perpetuate their high-school experiences.Concerned with establishing a \u201cnetwork,\u201d they seek out peers with aspirations identical to their own. In doing so, they frequently default to a clannishness that too easily becomes a lifelong habit.If you spend any time on college campuses, you\u2019ll notice this, and maybe something else as well: Many students have a much more significant depth than breadth of knowledge. They know tons about what they\u2019re interested in, because they\u2019ve burrowed, with the Internet\u2019s help, into their passions. But burrows are small and often suffocating, and there are wide spaces between them. You\u2019re in yours; I\u2019m in mine. Where\u2019s the common ground?The Internet has proved to be one of the great ironies of modern life. It opens up an infinite universe for exploration, but people use it to stand still, in a favorite spot, bookmarking the websites that cater to their existing hobbies (and established hobbyhorses) and customizing their social media feeds so that their judgments are constantly reinforced, their opinions forever affirmed.That\u2019s also how students should approach classes and navigate their social lives, because they\u2019re attending college in the context not only of a country with profound financial anxieties, but of a country with homogeneous neighborhoods, a scary preoccupation with status and microclimates of privilege. Just as they should be girding themselves for a tough job market, they should be challenging the so-called sorting that\u2019s also holding America back.Arum and Roksa, in \u201cAspiring Adults Adrift,\u201d do take note of upsetting patterns outside the classroom and independent of career preparation; they cite survey data that showed that more than 30 percent of college graduates read online or print newspapers only \u201cmonthly or never\u201d and nearly 40 percent discuss public affairs only \u201cmonthly or never.\u201dArum said that that\u2019s \u201ca much greater challenge to our society\u201d than college graduates\u2019 problems in the labor market. \u201cIf college graduates are no longer reading the newspaper, keeping up with the news, talking about politics and public affairs \u2014 how do you have a democratic society moving forward?\u201d he asked me.Now more than ever, college needs to be an expansive adventure, yanking students toward unfamiliar horizons and untested identities rather than indulging and flattering who and where they already are. And students need to insist on that, taking control of all facets of their college experience and making it as eclectic as possible.It could mean a better future \u2014 for all of us. And there\u2019s no debate that college should be a path to that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Scotland Should Stick With Britain", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionEDINBURGH \u2014 ON Sept. 18, residents of Scotland will head to voting booths to answer the question, \u201cShould Scotland be an independent country?\u201d The most recent poll suggests that they will say no \u2014 the pro-union Better Together campaign leads by 53 percent to the independence campaign\u2019s 47 percent. But even if the answer is no, why did Scotland feel the need to ask itself this question in the first place? As long ago as 1962, President John F. Kennedy called for a global Declaration of Interdependence to complement the United States\u2019 Declaration of Independence of 1776. Yet even today, in an era of global markets and global brands like Starbucks, McDonald\u2019s, Twitter and Facebook, nationalism has failed to disappear. Instead, by reworking the old idea that \u201csmall is beautiful,\u201d secessionist movements from Scotland and Catalonia to Flanders and Lombardy are campaigning for the rebirth of small independent states whose greater adaptability and cultural homogeneity, they claim, will make them economic success stories and paragons of social justice.It has taken the Scottish National Party only a half-century to move from irrelevance \u2014 securing 0.5 percent of the Scottish vote in 1955 \u2014 to center stage as the majority government in the devolved Scottish Parliament. What changed in the interim was not Scotland\u2019s sense of \u201cScottishness\u201d \u2014 the country\u2019s distinctive identity has been a constant feature of its cultural and civic life throughout the Union With England, which dates from 1707. Scotland never became \u201cNorth Britain,\u201d but equally, for three centuries, Scottish patriotism did not demand expression in a separate state.What is new is the impact of global change. Scotland has been transformed from one of the workshops of the world to a service economy. At one point, Scotland\u2019s shipyards produced a fifth of the world\u2019s ships, and its manufacturing and mining sector employed more than 40 percent of Scottish workers. It now employs just 8 percent.Scotland had to embark on a 50-year search for new skills, new jobs and a new prosperity \u2014 its real quarrel should be with globalization, rather than England. But just as, during the Industrial Revolution, nationalist movements sprang up as people tried to protect and shelter their communities against uneven and inequitable patterns of growth, Europeans are once again mobilizing around traditional identities, this time amid the insecurities of globalization.And so Scots ask what post-imperial Britain can do for them and, in particular, question whether the current Conservative-led Britain \u2014 itself planning a referendum on its membership of the European Union before the end of 2017 and making controversial cuts in social security \u2014 is capable of uniting Britain around a common project and shared purpose for the global era.Britain has never been united by ethnicity. We are four nations in one state. And, always pragmatic, we have never shouted from the rooftops about the shared ideas that bind us together in the manner of America (land of liberty and opportunity) or France (libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9). Instead, Britain has its institutions \u2014 from the monarchy and the army to the House of Commons and the BBC \u2014 none of which now appear able to generate enough Scottish pride in the union to secure a decisive \u201cno\u201d vote. To many, the United Kingdom today looks as if it is \u201cunited\u201d in name only.But delve deeper, and the United Kingdom does indeed have a basis for partnership in the values that underpin our unique National Health Service and welfare state. It is the idea that by pooling and sharing resources across four nations we guarantee Scots, English, Welsh and Northern Irish rights to health care, education, welfare and minimum standards in the workplace, irrespective of their nationality.Americans may share equal civil and political rights, and the European Union may share a common market, but Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have gone much further by sharing the same social and economic rights. The impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s achievement is striking. The median income of a family in Mississippi is around 60 percent that of a family in New Hampshire. The average income in Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union, is about 9 percent of that of Luxembourg, the richest. Yet the income of a typical Scot is now on a par with that of his English neighbor. So the United Kingdom rose to the 20th-century challenge of spreading the benefits of cooperation across a multinational state while upholding the cultural traditions of each of its nations. Globalization creates a complex 21st-century challenge. How can nations successfully maintain their distinctiveness in an interconnected world where goods and services are no longer sourced locally, but globally, and where capital flows across national borders? There is a fear that if you integrate you may lose your identity, and yet also an ancillary fear that clinging to your identity may cut you off from the world\u2019s opportunities.Proud of their enduring cultural distinctiveness and yet also well aware of the advantages of cooperation, Scots may offer an answer. They have already insisted that the United Kingdom change from the old unitary state of the classic constitutional textbooks, based on an indivisible Westminster sovereignty centered in England. With Scotland as the pacemaker for the transfer of power from London to its devolved representative assemblies across the country, the United Kingdom is moving as close to a federal state as is possible in a country where 85 percent of its population comes from only one of its four parts: England. Next it has to prove that the union is the best platform upon which Scots can successfully engage with the wider world.A member of the British Parliament, a former chancellor of the Exchequer and prime minister, and the author of \u201cMy Scotland, Our Britain.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rise in New-Home Sales Bolsters Outlook for U.S. Housing Market", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of new single-family homes in the United States surged in August to their highest level in more than six years, a sign the housing recovery remains on course.The recovery, however, will probably remain gradual against a backdrop of relatively high unemployment and sluggish wage growth, two factors that are seen as sidelining younger first-time buyers.\u201cThis is welcome news in an otherwise mixed outlook,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. \u201cWe are still a long way from the housing market recovering from the bust.\u201dNew-home sales jumped 18 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000 units, a second straight monthly gain, which took them to the highest level since May 2008, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday.Though new-home sales account for only about 9 percent of the housing market, the increase helped allay fears of renewed weakness after a surprise decline in sales of existing homes last month.\u201cWe expect some of this buoyancy to be reversed in the coming month, but continue to believe that the underlying fundamentals of the housing sector remain favorable,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that sales of existing homes fell in August for the first time in four months as investors who had been supporting the market stepped away.Economists said they hoped the departure of the investors would leave an opening for first-time buyers, but they expressed concern that still-high unemployment and tepid wage growth would continue to constrain sales.The share of first-time buyers in the market for existing homes has been stuck around 29 percent, well below the 40 percent to 45 percent considered ideal by economists and by real estate agents.\u201cIt\u2019s still a challenging environment for those buyers,\u201d said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS. \u201cYou can make a good case for a slow, gradual improvement.\u201dIn a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to buy homes fell last week as mortgage rates crept up. New loan applications are well off peaks seen early last year.With average hourly earnings up only 2.1 percent over the past year, many Americans are choosing to rent, while some of those who have recently graduated from college are moving back home or staying with friends, factors that are weighing on home sales.According to government data released last week, 492,000 households were formed last year, well below the one million that economists say would be consistent with a healthy market.\u201cHousehold formation, a major driver of new construction, is falling asleep at the wheel,\u201d said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight.Despite the rise in sales in August, the stock of new houses on the market hit its highest level in four years, giving buyers more choice.At August\u2019s sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in July. A six-month supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home Sales Fall, but Economists Are Unfazed ", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Sales of existing homes unexpectedly fell in August as investors stepped away from the market, but the decline may not point to renewed weakness in the housing market.The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that existing-home sales dropped 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. The decrease was the first in four months, although the sales pace was still the second-highest for the year.\u201cThere is no fundamental economic weakness story in the fall,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. \u201cMaybe investors are leaving the market because home prices are too high\u201d and there are \u201cno more bargains to be had.\u201d Economists had forecast sales increasing to an annual pace of 5.20 million units. Compared with August 2013, sales were down 5.3 percent.Investors had propped up the housing market by snapping up distressed properties and converting them to rental units. But last month they accounted for only 12 percent of transactions \u2014 the smallest share since November 2009.Although first-time buyers did not step up in August, the retreat by investors means fewer bidding wars and increased opportunities for ordinary buyers that could support future sales. In addition, a strengthening labor market is likely to culminate in faster wage growth, a plus for potential buyers.\u201cThis report indicates an orderly rotation in the distribution of the buyers\u2019 profile from investors to first-time home buyers, which we believe is a first crucial test of the sustainability of the housing recovery,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities.A survey last week showed that home builder sentiment hit its highest level this month in nearly nine years, with builders reporting a sharp pickup in buyer traffic. Lennar, a leading home builder, said its orders jumped 23 percent in the latest quarter.The report on sales of previously owned homes showed all-cash sales made up 23 percent of transactions in August, the smallest proportion since December 2009.The share counted as distressed properties \u2014 foreclosures and short sales \u2014 was the smallest since the National Association of Realtors started tracking the series six years ago.First-time buyers accounted for 29 percent of sales, well below the 40 to 45 percent that economists and real estate agents consider ideal.The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 4.5 percent from a year ago, to 2.31 million.At August\u2019s sales pace, it would take five and a half months to clear houses from the market, unchanged from July. A six months\u2019 supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.The improving supply is restraining price increases. The median home price increased 4.8 percent from a year ago, slowing from double-digit growth in much of 2013.Slower price gains and a leveling off in mortgage rates last year should help support sales.

Born in this small town in the foothills of the Andes on Oct. 26, 1864, Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez spent much of his life in Caracas, the capital, where he studied and practiced medicine and became known as \u201cthe doctor of the poor\u201d because he routinely treated needy patients for free.He died in 1919, run over by a car at a time when only a few hundred automobiles traveled the streets of Caracas. He was so beloved that newspaper accounts at the time reported that the city was left practically denuded of flowers to make the floral wreaths and bouquets for his funeral.Tens of thousands of people filled the streets outside the cathedral where the ceremony was conducted, the accounts said, and when the coffin was about to be placed in a hearse a cry went up: \u201cDr. Hern\u00e1ndez is ours!\u201d In a spontaneous display of popular mourning, the coffin was carried to the cemetery on the shoulders of the capital\u2019s citizens.Over the years, his legend grew. The sick or the injured prayed to him to be cured, and many believed he was responsible for miracles. He was also embraced by the followers of two popular religions that combine elements of Roman Catholicism with African and indigenous beliefs \u2014 Mar\u00eda Lionza, which is native to Venezuela, and Santer\u00eda, which spread here from Cuba.Today Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s image is ubiquitous in Venezuela, perhaps even more so than pictures of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the former president who died last year but is still widely portrayed on posters, on billboards and in graffiti.Dr. H\u00e9rnandez\u2019s familiar figure, usually dressed in a black suit with a high-peaked felt hat and a mustache, his hands behind his back (an image based on a widely reproduced photograph taken during a stay in New York City in 1917), can be seen all over the country \u2014 painted on walls, reproduced in small statuettes, and displayed in roadside shrines or simple altars in stores and homes. His image is so instantly recognizable to Venezuelans that a simple dark silhouette of a man in a hat with his hands behind his back is often all that is used to represent him.\u201cJos\u00e9 Gregorio is quintessentially Venezuelan,\u201d said Laura Zambrano, who helps run the sainthood effort conducted by the Archdiocese of Caracas. \u201cHe took all of our virtues to an extreme, to the extreme of perfection.\u201dIn 1986, Pope John Paul II declared Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez \u201cvenerable,\u201d a step toward being considered for sainthood. To take the next step, known as beatification, the church would need to show that Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez had performed a miracle. Once that was done, proof of a second miracle could qualify him to be canonized, or declared a saint.Twice, in 1986 and 2009, the Venezuelan church documented what it believed were medical miracles attributable to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. It sent them to Rome for approval by a panel of experts assigned to evaluate such cases, but each time they were rejected.Now, with the 150th anniversary of Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s birth approaching, the church here has started a campaign to find the miracles needed to propel him to sainthood. It has distributed millions of palm-size cards encouraging the faithful to pray for Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s canonization and asking them to send in accounts of miracles.This year already, the office in charge of seeking Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s sainthood has received more than 800 testimonials recounting possible miracles, compared with 234 last year and just 65 the year before.Here in Isnot\u00fa (pronounced ee-sno-TOO), hundreds and often thousands of pilgrims arrive every day to pay tribute to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez at a large shrine that has become the town\u2019s main attraction.Melvin Andrade, who recently made the nine-hour drive from Caracas, prayed silently before a life-size marble statue of Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez, which shows the doctor with his right hand extended, holding a pill bottle and other medicines.Mr. Andrade said that he had appealed for Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s help during a series of grueling operations after a motorcycle accident in January. Now he had come to give thanks.\u201cThe spinal operation I had could have left me an invalid and I came out perfectly,\u201d he said.His girlfriend, Marvella Rivas, 46, had no doubt about Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s status. \u201cFor me he\u2019s a saint even though he hasn\u2019t been beatified, which is something I can\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.Ms. Rivas recalled a teenage relative who was found during a medical examination to have a tumor. But a subsequent test found the tumor had mysteriously disappeared.\u201cShe said that Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez operated on her,\u201d Ms. Rivas said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it was a dream or real, but when they took another X-ray, the tumor was gone.\u201dThere is not much to Isnot\u00fa beyond a main street dominated by the sanctuary and souvenir stalls selling trinkets and statuettes of Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez.The sanctuary was built in the 1960s by the federal government, on the spot where Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s childhood home had stood. In a move that many residents regret today, the house was torn down to make way for the sanctuary. Around the same time, the church where Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez was baptized and confirmed was also demolished, and a larger church was built in its place.Yet Venezuelans have embraced this town as a link to the man they already venerate as a saint, to a degree that has made the church hierarchy in Caracas uncomfortable. That has led to a tug-of-war over his legacy.\u201cJos\u00e9 Gregorio cannot be worshiped there because Jos\u00e9 Gregorio has not been beatified, he has not been canonized,\u201d said Msgr. Fernando Castro, the auxiliary bishop of Caracas, who is in charge of the campaign to win sainthood for Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. He stressed that the sanctuary is officially dedicated to the baby Jesus, not to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. \u201cOnly saints can be the object of worship,\u201d he said.Bishop Castro said Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s tomb in a Caracas church, known as the Candelaria Church, should be the center of attention as the 150th anniversary of his birth approaches, not Isnot\u00fa.\u201cThere are indications in that place that would make it appear that it is like the center of everything to do with Jos\u00e9 Gregorio,\u201d Bishop Castro said of Isnot\u00fa. \u201cNo. The center of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio is the Candelaria Church.\u201dOn a recent visit, the Candelaria Church was under renovation and Dr. Hernandez\u2019s white marble tomb, behind a metal grating, was covered in dust and surrounded by construction debris.Meanwhile in Isnot\u00fa, a large stained glass window in the sanctuary chapel shows Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez kneeling before the Virgin Mary, with the baby Jesus in her lap, surrounded by angels. His image appears in other stained glass windows and on the metal doors to the chapel.A gift shop operated by the parish sells dozens of souvenirs depicting Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez, including plastic penholders and statuettes, alongside only a few representing the Virgin Mary, or posters of Pope John Paul II.All over the sanctuary, the walls are covered in small plaques left by the faithful attesting to miracles or favors they attribute to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez. They date back as far as the 1940s.Local residents said that Bishop Castro came to Isnot\u00fa in December 2012 and asked to have the statue of Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez removed. Bishop Castro said that he could not remember making such a request.The statue stayed, but now many here feel the need to defend the town\u2019s claim to its favorite son.Helder Dur\u00e1n, a member of the municipal commission to commemorate Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s 150th birthday, accused church leaders in Caracas of seeking to switch the focus of Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s devotees to the capital.\u201cEconomically it\u2019s more profitable for the Catholic Church,\u201d he said, charging that the Caracas church wanted to get its hands on the revenues from the tens of thousands of pilgrims who flock to Dr. Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s shrine each year.\u201cThey want to make Isnot\u00fa invisible,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Colorado\u2019s Perceived Left Turn Puts Governor in Tight Race ", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJULESBURG, Colo. \u2014 When a Democratic mayor and former brewpub owner named John W. Hickenlooper was elected governor four years ago, he did it with support from voters like Mark Turner. Mr. Turner is a gun dealer, a small-town politician in eastern Colorado and an avowed enemy of partisan labels \u2014 \u201cJust call me an American,\u201d he says. He liked Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s wonky centrism and positive campaigning style.But now, as Mr. Hickenlooper slogs through an increasingly tough re-election battle, he is spending lots of time answering criticism from voters like Mr. Turner that he has steered a swing state too far to the left. Mr. Turner especially detested a state law passed over unanimous Republican opposition that limited ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.\u201cI am the protector of my home,\u201d he told the governor, who had stopped at the Julesburg Cafe in this northeastern Colorado town for a vanilla malted. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have the right to protect my family with a 30-round magazine?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had this discussion a hundred times,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper told Mr. Turner, and reeled off data about the prevalence of high-capacity magazines in mass shootings and said they played a scant role in home-defense cases. He pointed out that his own security detail was not armed with large magazines. Mr. Turner gave a tight grin, unpersuaded.\u201cI voted for him,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m kind of on the bubble.\u201dSo is the governor. Four years after vaulting over a divided Republican field in a three-way election, Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s approval ratings and political fortunes have been clouded over, amid missteps and a torrent of advertisements attacking his record and leadership. A loss in November would raise doubts about the durability of recent Democratic gains in a state that has legalized marijuana and passed tough new gun laws, but also drubbed two gun-control supporters out of elected office and recoiled at raising taxes to fund schools.Recent polls show Mr. Hickenlooper locked in a tight contest with the Republican nominee, Bob Beauprez, a former congressman and bison rancher who lost his last bid for governor by 17 points. Conservative groups are hammering Mr. Hickenlooper as a faltering leader, and some independent voters are questioning whether to support him again.From the start of the race, Mr. Hickenlooper has vowed not to turn to negative advertising, a move that may be hurting him.\u201cThe other side\u2019s out there trying to convince people that our policies didn\u2019t work, that I\u2019m indecisive,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper said in an interview. As a rebuttal, he pointed to a bustling start-up scene in Denver, and described how his administration had worked tirelessly to rebuild mountain roads swept away by floods last year. \u201cThat\u2019s indecisive?\u201d he said.The narrowing race has surprised political analysts who predicted that Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s affable style and consensus-building approach would help him brush off Republican challenges. Conservative voters \u2014 even those who want to oust him \u2014 say he seems good-hearted and genuine. He is presiding over a growing economy. And he earned high marks from many Coloradans after guiding the state through a relentless string of fires, floods and shootings.But Republicans are attacking Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s leadership away from disasters and emergencies, saying he has been weak on making tough decisions.They have homed in on the case of a death-row inmate named Nathan Dunlap, a convicted killer whose fate has become intertwined with the governor. Last May, three months before Mr. Dunlap was to be executed for killing four people at a restaurant in 1993, he received a temporary reprieve from Mr. Hickenlooper. The order fell short of clemency, and is only valid so long as Mr. Hickenlooper is in office.Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s decision angered victims\u2019 family members, including Bob and Marjorie Crowell, whose daughter Sylvia was killed by Mr. Dunlap. Mrs. Crowell said the reprieve was \u201ccowardly,\u201d and represented \u201ca can kicked down the road.\u201dThe Beauprez campaign and the Republican Governors Association have both run advertisements excoriating Mr. Hickenlooper for his decision, saying that \u201cGovernor Hickenlooper stood in the way of justice.\u201d Mr. Beauprez said he would \u201cstart the clock\u201d on Mr. Dunlap\u2019s execution if he is elected.Emotionally potent as the issue may be, only a handful of voters in recent polls cited it as a top priority compared with the economy, health care and education.For Mr. Hickenlooper, the Dunlap decision was a difficult way station on an evolution toward opposing the death penalty. He had pored over studies on mass shootings to decide whether to support the gun-magazine limits as the gun-control debate stirred the Capitol, and he read through court documents, talked with victims\u2019 families and studied death row\u2019s costs and history as he considered how to deal with Mr. Dunlap and with his broader stance on capital punishment.But the way he has explained his actions has left him vulnerable on these issues. On the death penalty, he has said that if he fails to win re-election, he might consider granting full clemency to Mr. Dunlap. (The comment was an unaired part of a CNN interview that became public through a conservative blogger\u2019s open-records request.)And on gun control, a video of a meeting Mr. Hickenlooper had with Colorado sheriffs who felt their concerns had been sidelined during the gun debate also become campaign fodder, after it was posted online by a conservative group in June: In the video, Mr. Hickenlooper said one member of his staff had made a commitment to sign the ammunition magazine limits if they passed, and \u201cto be honest, no one in our office thought it would get through the legislature.\u201dIn addition to the death penalty and gun control, Republicans are focusing on the drilling process called fracking and energy regulations, water and other issues that underscore the fissures between urban and rural Colorado. At a recent meeting with leaders from northeastern Colorado, Mr. Beauprez said that government was \u201ctying a knot in our belly.\u201d The countryside would be a key to undoing it, he said.\u201cRural Colorado, I think, probably determines the outcome of this election,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can start making Colorado great again.\u201dBut Republicans say Colorado\u2019s growth is anemic compared with that of its neighbors. A broader measure of unemployment shows that 10.9 percent of workers are jobless, have dropped out of the labor pool or have found only part-time work. While Mr. Hickenlooper says he has cut 1,200 needless regulations, Mr. Beauprez said businesses are still tangled in red tape. One recent Friday, in the farming town of Wiggins, the campaign was on many voters\u2019 minds as they watched Mr. Hickenlooper kick off the Pedal the Plains bicycle ride. Mr. Hickenlooper came up with the idea as a way to bind together two sometimes disparate groups of the state, introducing Lycra-clad cyclists and residents of eastern farm towns to one another. But the political gap was too wide for many voters, who said they had no intention of voting for someone who supported gun control or showed a killer mercy.But Kathy Klausner, a school secretary whose family has an unirrigated farm, said she wasn\u2019t as certain.\u201cWe\u2019re pretty conservative in our household, but I think he\u2019s done a good job,\u201d she said. \u201cI shook hands with him this morning. He\u2019s taken an interest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gary Hart, the Elusive Front-Runner", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the Archive\u201cPlease,\u201d said the frustrated politician on the other side of the Formica breakfast table in a New Hampshire hotel, \u201ckeep your mind open to the possibility that I\u2019m not weird.\u201dGary Warren Hart was doing something he doesn\u2019t like to do: he was talking about himself, his childhood, his parents, his religious beliefs, his marriage.It was an infuriating experience for Hart, the leading Democratic Presidential candidate, because his psyche has been probed more often and more deeply than that of any other contender. He has sat for interview after interview in which the questions focused not on arms control or economics \u2014 subjects he knows much about \u2014 but on who he is really. He has been forced to reveal more about himself in the last four years than most politicians do in a lifetime. Yet many in politics and the press still insist that they don\u2019t know him.And so this self-controlled man will sometimes explode when those he perceives as dime-store Freuds try to get at his deepest motivations, his darkest secrets. A week after the New Hampshire interview, the candidate was in a small plane flying from Austin to Denver, where he lives. He had just answered a few questions about his transition from a boy who would be a minister in the conservative Church of the Nazarene to a man who would be a Democratic politician. \u201cI\u2019m going to answer about three more of these, and then I\u2019m not going to answer any more,\u201d he said, his blue eyes at once fierce and cool. \u201cI was 13 at the time. It\u2019s nonsense. Who cares what Ronald Reagan was thinking when he was 13? Or Joe Biden?\u201dThere was nothing at all odd about his struggle with his pietistic Nazarene upbringing, he insisted. \u201cMy struggle was with the institution. Thomas Jefferson had that struggle and so have half or more of the thoughtful people in the world. It is not unique to me. And is it something that plagues me today? No. I am very normal and very healthy.\u201dThen he laughed, as he often does at the ironies of politics. He imagined what his words would look like in print and realized that in the public search for the private man, everything Gary Hart says about Gary Hart could be used against him. \u201cI can see this: \u2018Hart insists that he is very normal. In a wide-ranging and lengthy interview, Hart insists that he is not weird.\u2019 \u201dMoreover, Hart saw sooner than most that the time had come to change generations in American politics and to update the Democratic Party\u2019s message. As early as 1973, he was speaking of \u201cthe end of the New Deal,\u201d of the need for an activist but less intrusive Government. Compassion did not mean bureaucracy, he said. And in a phrase that offended some older Democrats but made the point, he insisted in 1974 that he and the new generation of Democrats were not just \u201ca bunch of little Hubert Humphreys.\u201dHart wants to build on this advantage by trying to get the campaign to focus on \u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cissues.\u201d Among the Democrats running for President, Hart has by far the most detailed approach to national problems. His lectures last year on foreign policy at Georgetown University were praised even by those who disagreed with them. He co-authored \u201cAmerica Can Win,\u201d on military reform. On almost every issue, from education to trade, the candidate who suffered in 1984 from the question \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d now has enough of the stuff to supply Wendy\u2019s for a decade.But when Walter F. Mondale turned that slogan on Hart in 1984, he was referring not just to issues, but to Gary Hart himself, the man who changed his name from Hartpence and misrecorded his age. Hart\u2019s current opponents are trying to suggest, without saying so directly, that he is lacking some deeply personal element. Indeed, no candidate suffers as much from scurrilous talk as Hart \u2014 about his relations with his wife and other women, about his own psychological makeup.For an agonizing week after announcing his candidacy, Hart found that in Presidential politics, \u201ccharacter\u201d can indeed overwhelm \u201csubstance\u201d and \u201cissues.\u201d The day after he announced, he was drawn into conversations with reporters about a whispering campaign concerning his alleged womanizing, giving currency to the very rumors that infuriate him. At the end of the week, United States marshals seized the proceeds at two Hart fundraisers in Los Angeles. Hart still has $1.3 million in debts from his 1984 campaign, and an angry creditor was seeking payment. Some of Hart\u2019s Democratic opponents couldn\u2019t resist using the episode to make \u201ccharacter\u201d the issue once again.Thus does a candidate who is certainly capable of equalling or out-thinking his competitors on the issues find himself fighting a shadow war against himself. And everything, it seems, is once again fair game.\u201cDo you want a record kept of everything you\u2019ve ever said in your life to anybody and have it thrown back at you 15 years later?\u201d Hart asked in frustration when questioned about his 1972 statement that \u201cI never reveal who I really am.\u201d \u201cMy problem,\u201d said the 1987 Gary Hart, \u201cis that I\u2019ve revealed too much about myself.\u201dAnd if character is the issue, then Gary Hart \u2014 who has published two novels, studied existentialist philosophy and likes little better than to discuss movies and popular culture \u2014 is fully prepared to go on the offensive.\u201cSee, I think you\u2019ve got the coin reversed,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I\u2019m the healthy one. I think you ought to be asking all those other guys who have done nothing but hold public office and have no other sides to their personalities: Why they don\u2019t write novels and why they don\u2019t read Kierkegaard, why they don\u2019t broaden themselves out?\u201d\u201cWhy is it,\u201d he asks, \u201cthat somebody like me is thought the oddball?\u201dIf the Plaza movie theater on Main Street has the feel of \u201cThe Last Picture Show,\u201d the analogy to that film about the life and death of small-town America is otherwise unjust. Ottawa has hung on and even managed to refurbish its downtown, which boasts a splendid Victorian public library building and even a New York-style deli. But in the process of surviving, Ottawa has lost many of its brightest sons and daughters.Young Gary Hartpence showed few outward signs that he would be one of those to leave town and shake the world. His grades were good \u2014 ranging from 86 to 96 \u2014 and he was active in other areas, editing the school newspaper, managing the basketball team and acting in plays. He worked at Scotty\u2019s hamburgers as a car hop for 20 cents an hour. And he would cruise Main Street, sometimes ending up at the airport were he and some friends would dance to music from the car radio.Even then, Hart didn\u2019t have a conventional political disposition.\u201cSome people in the school will just walk into a group and slap everybody on the back and call \u2018em by their first name and just start talking,\u201d said Jim McCrea, a friendly, extroverted bear of a man who is the town\u2019s former Mayor and was a year ahead of Hart in high school. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem comfortable with it. He wasn\u2019t that type.\u201dHart likes to offer the image of a rambunctious childhood, but the only blot on his local record uncovered by legions of journalists was the time a friend stole a chemistry test in advance and Gary and a couple of other students memorized the answers. He now regrets doing it.What troubles Hart most about the public inspection of his past is speculation about his mother. In fact, one of Hart\u2019s main political problems today may be that his parents, Carl and Nina, who died in 1972, are not around to dispel the mystery that has come to surround them and their son.Carl Hartpence was, by all accounts, including Hart\u2019s, the less complicated parent. He held a variety of jobs and was never particularly successful, though he kept his family fed, clothed and sheltered and was well-liked in town.\u201cHe was just one of those guys who could take anything anyone could dish out and go along with it,\u201d said Bob Brenner, a longtime Ottawa resident and former husband of Hart\u2019s sister.One of those things was Nina\u2019s propensity to move. The local paper, The Ottawa Herald, recently traced 16 separate addresses for Carl and Nina Hartpence while Gary was a boy. According to Hart\u2019s uncle, Ralph Hartpence, the moves came from Nina\u2019s ties to a real-estate dealer and her skill as a housekeeper: \u201cThey\u2019d fix and clean it all up and sell it, see?\u201d One day, he recalled, the family \u201cmoved over to a new house and didn\u2019t like the situation, so they moved back the same day.\u201d Hart says he has never given much thought to the moving.The ongoing interest in Nina Hartpence stems from her image in some accounts as a severe, fastidious, at times sickly woman \u2014 and from her membership in the Church of the Nazarene, an offshoot of Methodism that forbids its members to smoke, drink or dance. (The church manual says practices such as dancing \u201ctend to break down proper inhibitions and reserve between the sexes.\u201d) Nina Hart steered her son toward the ministry, and he preached a few sermons while in high school.Hart says his mother was \u201cbothered by her lack of education, somewhat insecure.\u201d But he maintains that she was capable of merriment and was, if anything, less exacting than her church.The Church of the Nazarene was formed around the turn of the century by congregations joined in the belief that mainline Methodism was soft-pedaling the doctrine of \u201centire sanctification.\u201d This miraculous experience of the Holy Spirit involves \u201ca cleansing of the inner self and an em-powering for service,\u201d according to a Nazarene tract. Like many Christians who were moved by their faith to social activism, Hart now lays heavy stress on Christianity\u2019s \u2014 and John Wesley\u2019s \u2014 advocacy of the poor and downtrodden. The words \u201cempowerment\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d play central roles in his speeches to this day.This form of social emphasis, however, came later. In Ottawa, which would reject Hart\u2019s ultimate hero, John F. Kennedy, by nearly 3-to-1 in 1960, Republicanism was the norm and religion was about \u2014 religion. And so after graduation, it seemed natural that Gary Hartpence, future minister, would pack off to Bethany Nazarene College, near Oklahoma City, to pursue his studies and his salvation. The latter would come in an unexpected way.As Johnson, Gary\u2019s philosophy professor, tells it, he looked at the record and intellect of this promising young man and decided to introduce him to thinkers who were well outside the Nazarene purvue.In effect, the journey with Johnson was \u201can opening up,\u201d as the professor, who is now retired, puts it. It was a search for a series of truths that troubled other students at Bethany Nazarene \u2014 and some officials at the college, which Johnson eventually left. Gary Hartpence lost his first election for president of the student body, partly because he was regarded as insufficiently religious, too much a free-thinking philosopher in the Prescott Johnson mold. It was Hart\u2019s first experience with the political costs of unorthodoxy. He ran a second time and won.Key to Hart\u2019s intellectual development were Plato and Soren Kierkegaard. (He is listed as Gary \u201cPlato\u201d Hartpence in a yearbook picture of the philosophy club, which he served as president.) Plato laid the groundwork for what later became Hart\u2019s intensely philosophical and coolly rational approach to politics \u2014 and encouraged his disdain for the cruder manifestations of political passion. It was Plato who favored the idea of philosophers emerging into the sunshine of enlightenment and then \u201creturning to the cave\u201d of messy, worldly politics to provide thoughtful leadership to others.Prescott Johnson said recently that he saw the Platonic obligation to \u201cgo back into the cave\u201d as a clue to Gary Hart\u2019s current approach to politics. \u201cI think he senses that he\u2019s more at home in the intellectual arena than he is in the manipulative political context,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd that creates, I think, a suffering that he has to undergo. . . . Being a politician is not his innate disposition.\u201dWhen questioned about \u201creturning to the cave,\u201d Hart dissolved into laughter and said he wouldn\u2019t dare discuss the matter. \u201cThe cave!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cLet\u2019s don\u2019t start that. That ain\u2019t going to play in Iowa.\u201dBut earlier, in New Hampshire, he had spoken of how Plato\u2019s mistrust of passion had impressed him. \u201cThere are those in politics who substitute emotion and passion for substance, content and what I would generally call governance,\u201d he said. \u201cWho, because they don\u2019t know where the country ought to be going or how to get there, rely more heavily on their ability to stir up people\u2019s emotions.\u201dBut, Hart added, this doesn\u2019t mean that people like him \u201cdon\u2019t have deep feelings. It\u2019s that we probably distrust those who only have deep feelings.\u201dJohnson offered Gary Hartpence a formidable intellectual challenge in the writings of Kierkegaard, one of the forefathers of existentialism who emphasized the solitary individual standing before God and the need to question easy rationalizations for faith. For someone who takes Kierkegaard seriously \u2014 and Hart was rereading him during a recent campaign trip \u2014 grace can never again come cheap.The result, for Hart, was a move from pietism to a highly intellectualized, existential Christianity and finally to an ethical stance that is primarily social and political. While he says he still thinks of himself as a religious person \u2014 there was a brief flap in 1984 about his friendship with a female Native American spiritualist \u2014 Hart is not a regular church-goer and he describes his present-day commitment as the pursuit of peace and justice in this world.Eventually, Hart\u2019s intellectual evolution had a practical impact. It led him away from the ministry toward a desire to teach philosophy. When he got to Yale, that ambition was itself transformed by John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign into a political commitment.Miss Ludwig was a decidedly important person on campus. Her father had been president of the institution and was an official of the church in its Kansas City headquarters.In an autobiographical essay, there is a striking suggestion that young Gary Hartpence knew that marriage to Oletha would be a step up in the world. \u201cAlways attracted by a challenge,\u201d Hart wrote, \u201cI pursued her. And her obvious disdain for me \u2014 a bumpkin \u2014 made her even more appealing.\u201d They married two months after graduation.At the Harts\u2019 rustic mountain home amid the evergreens, 25 miles from Denver, Lee Hart explains that she was drawn to Gary Hartpence as her opposite \u2014 an introspective, quiet, intellectual.Andrea, the Harts\u2019 voluble 23-year-old daughter, pipes up: \u201cDad was describing to me once how he always thought when he first met you that you were from that real rich family.\u201dMrs. Hart laughs. \u201cIs that why he married me?\u201d\u201cHe thought you were, like, the president of the school\u2019s daughter or something, and you were really rich and here was this poor little boy,\u201d Andrea says.\u201cWe probably appeared that way,\u201d says Mrs. Hart. \u201cWe hardly were.\u201d Both Gary and Lee Hart say their 28 years of marriage have not been easy. They have separated twice, in 1979 and in 1981, and reporters following them in 1984 often noted how distant they seemed from each other.The reports of womanizing anger the Harts and many of their friends. Hart says his main problem has been that, unlike some other politicians, he and his wife are honest about the troubles they have had and their efforts to patch up the marriage. He says he never hid the fact that he dated during their separations \u2014 and is again suffering from his honesty.Some of Hart\u2019s friends also say that his love for the Hollywood life and his close friendship with the actor Warren Beatty, which began during the 1972 McGovern campaign, fuel the rumors. \u201cJust because Gary is a friend of Warren Beatty\u2019s,\u201d says Lee Hart, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that Gary necessarily has the reputation Warren has \u2014 which, by the way, may be overplayed also.\u201dHart did not help his cause with certain comments he made in 1972, while he was McGovern\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cI have almost no personal life at all \u2014 I lead a completely political existence,\u201d he told a reporter then. \u201cIf one party doesn\u2019t share the same interests, you\u2019ve got a problem. Let\u2019s just say I believe in reform marriage.\u201d\u201cIt was a very stupid thing to say,\u201d he now says. \u201cLee was living in Denver and I was living in Washington and I was unhappy because my kids were little and I didn\u2019t see them much. I learned,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere\u2019s no reward for being candid. In fact, there are penalties for being candid. People say, \u2018Why are politicians such conniving, calculating S.O.B\u2019s?\u2019 It\u2019s because who knows what oddball thing you say is not going to come back 15 years later to be some profound insight into your character.\u201d\u201cFollow me around. I don\u2019t care,\u201d he says firmly, about the womanizing question. \u201cI\u2019m serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They\u2019d be very bored.\u201dLee Hart, a warm and feisty woman, defends her husband. She says the rumors are \u201cnot worth dealing with\u201d and that reports about the difficulties in their marriage tend to place too much blame on her husband. There were, she says, \u201cthings I would initially want to blame on Gary, but ultimately would have to realize that I was the one.\u201d Mrs. Hart, who bore the main responsibility for raising Andrea and John, their 21-year-old son, says women of her generation \u201chave had to realize when they get angry, oftentimes it\u2019s because they\u2019ve fallen into the trap of making their husband\u2019s bed and making him lie in it.\u201dStill, Gary Hart seems to be a man, in the words of a campaign aide, who \u201clikes to court danger.\u201d And more than most people, he seems to have contemplated the contradictory drives of human nature.Earlier, aboard the plane to Denver, Gary Hart had mused about Dostoyevsky, another of the major influences on his world view. He said that one of the lessons of \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov\u201d is the conflict between \u201cthe Apollonian and the Dionysian,\u201d between \u201cthe spiritual-and-moral versus the physical-and-emotional.\u201dAre people torn between the two sets of impulses? \u201cMost thoughtful people are,\u201d he replied.And how did he decide whether to put one or the other aside?He grinned. \u201cGood try,\u201d he said. He wouldn\u2019t touch the question.To manage the 1972 McGovern campaign was to preside over an enormously successful primary effort that upset all predictions \u2014 and then be at the helm of a general-election disaster. Hart insists that he is not a \u201cMcGovernite,\u201d as the term has come to be used to attack left-wing Democrats, and that McGovern probably was not a McGovernite either. He says he was attracted to McGovern because of the candidate\u2019s opposition to the Vietnam War \u2014 and because he had stood in at the Democratic National Convention in 1968 for the forces loyal to the slain Robert F. Kennedy.If there is a single subject on which Gary Hart is, well, passionate, it is the Kennedys. It was John Kennedy\u2019s 1960 campaign that inspired him to a vocation in \u201cpublic service,\u201d as he always puts it. John Kennedy made politics legitimate, and Hart\u2019s excitement over the campaign prompted him to go to Yale Law School after he finished Yale Divinity School. When the talk turns to Robert F. Kennedy, Hart, the political outsider, lights up.\u201cHow is it that a former Attorney General of the United States, son of one of the most wealthy and powerful men in America, brother of a President of the United States, got to be the symbol of the outsider?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow did that happen? When he had built a reputation of being \u2018arrogant, powerful\u2019?\u201d\u201cHis brother\u2019s death tilted the equation,\u201d Hart goes on, sounding a bit like the preacher his mother wanted him to be. \u201cI think Robert Kennedy realized that you can have all the wealth in the world, you can reach the office, you can seek to achieve social acceptability, prominence and all the rest, and it doesn\u2019t save you.\u201d This language, which has echoes of St. Paul\u2019s letters, is not surprising from a man who also uses Pauline language to describe his relationship to his profession: \u201cIn politics but not of it.\u201dThat is the way some of his former Senate colleagues see him: as the man who would sometimes leave the floor and watch the debate from the galleries.Some of his former colleagues, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, dismiss as \u201cpreposterous\u201d the idea that he was an outsider with few friends in the Senate. Moynihan speaks admiringly of Hart\u2019s intelligence and of his courage in opposing the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing act as constitutionally questionable and an abrogation of Congressional responsibility.But other Senators worry about Hart\u2019s distance from the system, and he expects few endorsements from his former colleagues. One Democratic Senator, who respects Hart, wondered recently why it was that a group of his colleagues tried so hard to promote the Presidential candidacy of Senator Dale Bumpers, an Arkansas Democrat who declined to run. To this Senator, who asked not to be named, the Bumpers boomlet was in part a reflection of the unease over Gary Hart.Hart, who decided to avoid an expensive and bruising battle for re-election by retiring from the Senate in 1986, provides a precedent for his lack of support among his colleagues: his hero, John F. Kennedy.In \u201cThe Double Man,\u201d the novel Hart co-authored with Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican, the hero is described as \u201csimply not interested enough in being a legislator.\u201d\u201cHe felt superior,\u201d the passage continues. \u201cHell, he was superior.\u201d The character, it turns out, wanted \u201cmore than anything else \u2014 to be President.\u201dAsked about the passage, Hart grins. \u201cCohen wrote that.\u201dFinally, Eugene Daniell Jr., the 82-year-old former Mayor and doyen of Franklin politics, speaks up. Hart, he says, is vastly better than in 1984, a much improved, more impressive version of himself. The partisan crowd laughs and cheers, though Hart can\u2019t resist saying that he thinks he was pretty good in 1984.His homecoming last month to his native Ottawa, where he came close to tears while talking about his parents, was a symbol of the change that has occured in the public Gary Hart, representing the sort of thing he could not have abided in 1984.Yet the Ottawa trip, designed to demystify his childhood, seemed only to spur even more curiosity about the man. All the facts about his life, even the ordinary ones, become part of a great mystery. They all feed the legend of the man who reinvented himself, emptied himself out; the religious, small-town boy who changed his name while at Yale and now hangs out in Hollywood with Warren Beatty.Gary Hart faces one of the most unusual dilemmas ever presented a Presidential candidate. He must prove that he is extraordinary enough \u2014 indeed, \u201cdifferent\u201d enough \u2014 to bear the burdens of the Presidency. Yet he must also prove that he is really quite ordinary, not so different from the people he would lead. This is a game that is very hard to win. He is required to engage in forms of self-revelation not demanded of other candidates. Yet the very process of self-revelation makes him stand out.Prescott Johnson, Hart\u2019s college mentor, expresses the paradox well. He thinks his former student has \u201cthe possibility of greatness\u201d precisely because he has successfully synthesized so many unusual experiences and ideas. But Johnson worries that others might not see things as he does. \u201cPeople are suspicious of somebody who really does stand out,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of him. Somebody who dares to claim that he has inner resources as an individual and has thought things through \u2014 sometimes that does not, except in moments of extreme crisis, go down well with a lot of people.\u201dHart, says Johnson, had a feeling \u201cof not being established or accepted, a feeling of difference, that you\u2019re not one of us.\u201d\u201cIn the Nazarene Church,\u201d he goes on, \u201cyou get this whole business about we\u2019re strangers and pilgrims in this land. We\u2019re not of the world.\u201d Then Johnson laughs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I shouldn\u2019t psychoanalyze Gary,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill me.\u201dWhen Gary Hart is read Prescott Johnson\u2019s final three words, his stern response is: \u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d He has never felt like a stranger in this world, he says. Then Hart himself laughs, knowing that having everyone analyze you is one of the prices of being Gary Hart.Still, he insists, the search for a hidden Gary Hart will always prove fruitless. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for something that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for a level to me that probably is not there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Saving the Euro, Draghi Struggles to Be Heard", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropeFRANKFURT \u2014 Two years ago, eurozone government leaders hung on every word of Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank. Now Mr. Draghi is struggling to get through to them. What has happened to \u201cSuper Mario\u2019s\u201d mojo?For financial markets, Mr. Draghi\u2019s words still count. But therein lies a problem \u2014 his promise in 2012 to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro has reassured investors and driven down government borrowing costs to near record lows.Eurozone governments, however, seem to have forgotten the caveat.Mr. Draghi delivered his famous \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech, and backed it up with a plan to buy \u201cunlimited\u201d amounts of bonds issued by stricken eurozone governments \u2014 but only after those governments agreed to his call for a \u201cfiscal compact\u201d on tougher budget discipline.Now he is trying to cajole governments into agreeing on a common approach to overhauling their economies, a drive he sees as a necessary step if the stagnant eurozone is ever to grow with verve. The \u201cessential cohesion\u201d of the European Union depends on overhauls, Mr. Draghi said in July and again in early August.He is having a hard time getting the message through. Like a groom dieting for his wedding day, many eurozone countries shaped up to gain entry to the eurozone, only to let themselves go once the big day was behind them.With their borrowing costs now low thanks in large part to Mr. Draghi\u2019s offer to buy eurozone bonds, governments feel less pressure than at the height of the European crisis to give the central banker what he wants.Mr. Draghi wants Europe to agree to a coordinated push to shape up its economies, possibly starting with cumbersome labor markets. Passing structural overhauls is a tricky business at the best of times. But doing so under the banner of closer cooperation is trickier still after voters pronounced a resounding \u201cno\u201d to deeper integration at European parliamentary elections in May.There are also vested interests to contend with. France\u2019s new economy minister, Emmanuel Macron, ran into trouble with trade unions Thursday for suggesting companies be allowed exemptions to the 35-hour week. \u201cAll these structural reforms involve challenging and defeating lobbies,\u201d said Richard Portes, professor of economics at London Business School. \u201cThey\u2019re small, but they\u2019re powerful \u2014 they have big voices.\u201d Sharon Bowles, who worked with Mr. Draghi as chairwoman of the European Parliament\u2019s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee until July, said the central banker\u2019s push for governments to coordinate overhauls and \u201cto learn to govern together\u201d was too much too soon. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s got to keep pushing so that there is no slip back,\u201d she added.As the eurozone crisis has shown, European governments only get serious about budget tightening and economic overhauls when faced with the prospect of \u201cdivorce\u201d \u2014 or the currency union breaking up.Mr. Draghi must react to the demand of a new generation of politicians who are looking to reframe the debt, like Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy. Mr. Renzi will hold the rotating European Union presidency in the second half of this year, and he has led calls for Europe to step away from austerity measures and loosen strict budgetary rules. For the moment, Mr. Draghi has cut him some slack. After months of pressing governments, primarily France and Italy, to push through overhauls with little success, the E.C.B. president has changed tack.Speaking at the annual conference of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Aug. 22, Mr. Draghi said it would be \u201chelpful for the overall stance of policy\u201d if fiscal policy could play a greater role alongside monetary policy, adding, \u201cI believe there is scope for this.\u201dTranslated from opaque central banker-speak, the comments indicate that having cut E.C.B. interest rates to record lows and injected money into the economy to support a recovery, Mr. Draghi is now also ready to back government-led stimulus over more austerity measures.\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to introduce these reforms, to get people to accept these changes, if you have growth,\u201d Mr. Portes said. \u201cAnd at the moment it\u2019s really tough, and everybody is out there trying to defend their special interests.\u201dIn effect, Mr. Draghi extended a thinly veiled invitation to those countries with the room, like Germany, to pursue a more expansionary fiscal policy as part of a three-pronged approach that would include monetary stimulus and structural overhauls.Sarah Hewin, head of research for Europe at Standard Chartered, said Mr. Draghi was in a tough position because \u201cthere is very little leverage to accelerate this reform process.\u201dMr. Draghi is also getting some pushback from other political heavyweights. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has insisted that the E.C.B. president was over-stepping in promoting fiscal stimulus as a way to promote growth.In France, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has reshuffled his government to bolster his agenda but is struggling to galvanize his fellow Socialists. He is also complaining about the toll the strong euro is taking on exports, pressing the central bank to do more. Mr. Draghi has one trump card: quantitative easing, or essentially printing money to buy assets and fuel growth. This prospect excites markets, which see it as the best way of heading off a worrying trend toward deflation. At 0.3 percent in August, eurozone inflation is far below the central bank\u2019s target of just under 2 percent.Richard Barwell, an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland, said it may be difficult to get governments, particularly Germany, to support quantitative easing if \u201cpoliticians are seen to be dragging their feet on reforms.\u201dBut with the bond market no longer threatening to tear the eurozone apart, \u201cDraghi is playing with a much weaker hand now,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians may be willing to call his bluff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Crisis Is Resistant to Medicine of Low Rates", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 It is getting harder and harder to find free parking for large sums of euros.In a battered regional economy, the search for safety has become so desperate that some European investors are willing to pay for the privilege of lending to France \u2014 a country dealing with economic stagnation, political gridlock and a tough business climate. Investors might not expect their money to grow in France, but they trust that it won\u2019t disappear.The yield on French government two-year bonds turned negative on Monday, before edging back into positive territory Tuesday. Yields on some German debt, another perceived bastion of safety, have been below zero off and on since last month. In addition, banks have been willing to pay their most solid peers to store their money overnight. This upside-down financial world, in which lenders pay borrowers to take their money, is the result of a decision by the European Central Bank in June. The E.C.B. effectively imposed a penalty on banks that park money in the central bank\u2019s vaults. The radical move was an attempt to stoke the economy by forcing banks to lend to businesses and consumers.But the strategy has not worked, one reason the central bank is under increasing pressure to try something else when it meets on Thursday \u2014 limited though its remaining options might be.In many cases commercial banks, rather than feeling penalized by the central bank, have decided they would rather pay someone else to keep their money safe. They may not want to take the risk of lending to, for example, an Italian entrepreneur. Or the entrepreneurs may be too pessimistic about their business prospects to want to borrow.The central bank\u2019s so-called negative deposit rate has rippled through European markets, reinforced by fear that the eurozone economy is in decline and by nervousness about war, not only in Ukraine but also in the Middle East.While some borrowers are benefiting from ultralow or even negative interest rates, it does not appear that the easy money is reaching the struggling businesses in countries like Spain and Portugal that need it most. That is why the European Central Bank may still need to do more to unlock credit to those countries and avert deflation, a ruinous downward price spiral.\u201cThe negative deposit rate hasn\u2019t worked so far,\u201d said Marie Diron, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service in London who specializes in economic and financial analysis. \u201cThe intent was that banks would lend on to the economy, and that\u2019s not happening.\u201dSpeculation is rampant that the European Central Bank will soon begin so-called quantitative easing \u2014 large-scale bond purchases intended to pump money into the economy. While most analysts do not expect the E.C.B. to announce such a program on Thursday, the central bank could signal that one is being prepared.But because one of the goals of quantitative easing is to drive down market interest rates, it is unclear how effective E.C.B. bond buying would be. Market rates are already about as low as they can go.\u201cPolicy options on monetary policy are maxed out,\u201d Ulf M. Schneider, chief executive of Fresenius, a health care company in Germany listed on the blue-chip DAX Index, said in an email. \u201cThey cannot prevent economic trouble when we are facing fiscal problems in large parts of Europe, geopolitical uncertainty and poor industrial competitiveness.\u201dThe march toward zero interest rates and below was led by the European Central Bank\u2019s decision in June to impose a charge of 0.10 percent annual interest on money that banks keep there, in excess of the regulatory minimum amounts banks are required to keep on deposit.There are undoubtedly some positive effects from the exceptionally low rates. Very short-term lending among banks is an important lubricator of the economy.One widely watched benchmark, known as the euro overnight index average, or Eonia, fell to minus 0.004 percent last Thursday, the first reading below zero. The rate was most recently at minus 0.013 percent. Eonia reflects lending between banks that is not secured by collateral, so it is an indicator of how much banks continue to trust one another.One question, though, is whether banks will bother to lend to one another when there is no return \u2014 not simply to cover short-term needs, but to engage in lending meant to support investment banking and commercial loans to businesses and consumers.The signals so far are mixed. There was a spike in lending volume the day the Eonia rate first fell below zero, to 37.3 billion euros, or about $49 billion. But a day later, volume fell to \u20ac19.2 billion, according to E.C.B. data. Before the financial crisis began in 2008, Eonia lending sometimes topped \u20ac80 billion a day.Some bankers are optimistic that interbank lending will recover. A banker in one particularly weak eurozone country, who declined to be identified because he was discussing confidential bank information, said that it was already much easier to find cash on the interbank market. He credited the improvement to E.C.B. policies, and said he expected interbank lending to increase in coming months.But banks remain reluctant to lend the cash on to businesses, the banker said. Many borrowers remain too risky.In addition, banks are behaving cautiously right now as the E.C.B. conducts what is supposed to be the most rigorous scrutiny of their books ever. The central bank is scheduled to complete the comprehensive review of the largest eurozone banks by the end of October. Lending could pick up once banks know where they stand.There is hope, though, that another central bank measure \u2014 also taken in June \u2014 could end a long drought of credit in crisis countries like Greece, Italy and Portugal. After its June meeting, the central bank announced a program to provide cheap lending to banks, on the condition that they lend the money to businesses or to individuals.The E.C.B. is to begin dispensing that money on Sept. 18, and most analysts expect the central bank to see how many banks take advantage of the offer before it takes any additional stimulus steps like quantitative easing.One clear set of beneficiaries of ultralow interest rates is eurozone governments.Only a little more than two years ago, there was fear that Spain and Italy would go bankrupt because of their rising borrowing costs. Investors now accept almost the same return on Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds as they do on United States Treasuries.On Monday, Spain sold \u20ac1 billion in bonds maturing in 50 years at an interest rate of 4 percent. Spain plans additional bond issues later this week.Spain and other eurozone countries are cashing in on the perception that the European Central Bank will not let them fail. That is why investors can harp about what they see as the ineffectiveness of President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France and his Socialist government, then buy French debt at almost absurdly low rates.\u201cIt\u2019s a paradox,\u201d said Christian Jimenez, president of Diamant Bleu Gestion, an asset management firm in Paris. \u201cFrench debt is protected by potential action of the E.C.B.\u201dMr. Jimenez added, though, that his firm was betting against French bonds in the market on the expectation rates will have to rise again. \u201cIt\u2019s a good period for issuers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s very bad for the economy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Sluggish Fight Against Ebola", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialEfforts by the United States, other nations and international organizations to curb the widening epidemic of Ebola in West Africa are falling short \u2014 too little help arriving too late. The World Health Organization estimates that as many as 20,000 people could be infected over the course of the outbreak. President Obama has called the epidemic a \u201cnational security priority\u201d and pledged to use American military assets to help the beleaguered countries, primarily Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, to bring the epidemic under control. The Agency for International Development and the Defense Department are already rushing personnel and supplies to the scene.The question is whether all the efforts are moving fast enough to keep up with increasing rates of infections and deaths. The head of the W.H.O. stressed again on Friday that the answer is clearly no: New cases are outpacing the capacity to treat them. A day earlier, Joanne Liu, international president of Doctors Without Borders, the humanitarian group that has provided most of the medical care in Liberia, reiterated that new isolation and treatment facilities must be built quickly and on a large scale, in days, not weeks or months. A 25-bed unit pledged by the Pentagon for Liberia, she noted, would treat only health care workers, not the broader population; it may not be delivered for another month. A 62-bed unit that will be built by the British in Sierra Leone will be operational within eight weeks.Because most Ebola victims remain at home, it is critical to supply families with hygiene kits, containing disinfectants, gloves and other materials that properly instructed households can use to prevent spread of the virus among family members and from them to others. About 400,000 people live in highly infected areas of Liberia, according to an Agency for International Development official, but the United States will deliver only 50,000 kits in about a month, a number that will be augmented by other donors but will still fall short of the need.The United States can do better than this. Even with its increased responsibilities in the Middle East, the Pentagon surely has enough logistical and technical resources to greatly augment aid to the Ebola-stricken countries. The United States offered prompt and vigorous support after an earthquake devastated Haiti in 2010 and a tsunami struck Indonesia in 2004. It needs to do the same now.The main reason to mount an all-out response is humanitarian \u2014 to save impoverished people from agonizing illness and death, and fragile societies and economies from destruction. The virus poses little threat to the United States or other countries with advanced health care systems that can quickly identify and isolate infected patients. The virus is not transmitted through the air from one person to another but requires direct contact with the bodily fluids of a sick person, as can happen while bathing someone infected, cleaning up vomit or burying one who has died.Some experts remain concerned that the virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warns that as the epidemic \u201ccontinues to spiral out of control,\u201d the risk will rise that a mutation might make it more transmissible. And while many experts think the risk of a mutation is small, Mr. Obama echoed these concerns when he said in a recent interview with \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that an easily transmissible virus could be \u201ca serious danger to the United States.\u201d In any case, health officials will need to be vigilant in monitoring how this virus evolves as the caseload expands.A separate worry is that infected West Africans might carry the virus to populous cities in other African nations or even to distant megacities in the developing world where the health care systems may not be primed to spot and control an incipient epidemic. That is another good reason to stop this epidemic quickly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeing Just One Way for Greece to Go: Up", "Date": "2014-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 The first time Gikas Hardouvelis left his job as a bank economist to try his hand at Greek politics, in 2000, the country was preparing to join the euro currency union, looking forward to a period of prosperity and optimism.The second time, in late 2011, Greece was teetering on the brink of a disastrous exit from the common currency, its finances and politics in free fall.Now, as the country\u2019s finance minister, Mr. Hardouvelis aims to steer Greece out of its catastrophic recession, his hopes lifted by the first indications of an upturn.Mr. Hardouvelis is the first finance minister since the onset of the country\u2019s four-year economic crisis to assume his role in the face of predictions that things will get better rather than worse. The Greek economy, now 25 percent smaller than in 2009, is expected to grow 0.6 percent this year.And because Greece recorded a primary surplus in the spring \u2014 a budget in the black before debt repayments \u2014 it is eligible to begin exploratory talks with its international creditors about easing its huge debt burden, which stands at 174 percent of gross domestic product.Success, though, will require him to enforce economic changes pledged to Greece\u2019s troika of international creditors: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. They have kept the country afloat since 2010, when it narrowly avoided bankruptcy, with rescue loans worth 240 billion euros, or $317 billion.Three days of talks with representatives of the troika on the progress of those changes are to begin on Tuesday. Analysts and international economists are divided about Mr. Hardouvelis\u2019s chances of success.Now, as a senior member of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\u2019s coalition government, Mr. Hardouvelis faces the challenge of administering harsh medicine that the recession-weary Greek public is finding tough to swallow.The regimen will include modernizing an antiquated tax system, introducing a new property tax that aims to spread the burden more evenly and continuing a crackdown on tax evasion.The second overhaul of Greece\u2019s retirement system since 2010 is already in progress. It involves consolidating dozens of pension funds into three. An effort is underway to cut about 6,500 jobs from the Civil Service. Privatization of many state-owned assets, which has long been on the to-do list but has yet to show much progress, is back in focus, as potential buyers \u2014 chiefly from China \u2014 eye airports and other infrastructure.Some experts maintain that Mr. Hardouvelis is the right man for the job, saying he has an ideal mix of experience and abilities. A widely cited academic, he has advised private and state banks, including the New York Federal Reserve, and has engaged in politics and diplomacy during critical moments in Greece\u2019s recent history.\u201cHe has a strong reputation in international economic policy circles, which should be extremely helpful in negotiating with international creditors,\u201d said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former adviser to the International Monetary Fund. \u201cOf course, his task of trying to restore growth in a country with weak institutions that faces strong creditors is not an easy one.\u201dOthers say he lacks the combative nature required for Greek politics and imposing his will on a reluctant populace.Jens Bastian, an economic consultant and former member of the European Commission\u2019s task force in Athens, compared Mr. Hardouvelis with his predecessor, Yannis Stournaras, who now heads the Greek central bank but had experience running a private bank before he was tapped for the ministry.\u201cHe never held front-line positions which required him to sign decisions like Stournaras,\u201d Mr. Bastian said.The new minister\u2019s first real test will come when he meets with the troika\u2019s representatives. After the coming talks in Paris, the parties will reconvene later in September in the Greek capital \u2014 a symbolic move intended to indicate that Greece is ready to assume greater control of its actions.\u201cGreece has done most of the reforms; the next phase is to solidify them, to make sure they don\u2019t reverse,\u201d Mr. Hardouvelis said. \u201cI think it will be done in a more efficient way in the future, precisely because the troika is not right on our neck. They\u2019ll be staying in the background.\u201dOf the \u20ac240 billion in rescue loans pledged to Greece by the troika since 2010, only a small portion remains to be disbursed: \u20ac1.8 billion from the European side and \u20ac15.6 billion from the I.M.F.The loans have been dispensed in installments in exchange for painful austerity measures, including Civil Service salary cuts and tax increases that have reduced personal incomes by a third, left nearly one in three Greeks unemployed and shrunk the economy by a quarter.Greek officials contend that it is in the troika\u2019s interest to hold off on additional austerity. \u201cThey have an incentive to allow us to let the economy grow because then we can better service our debt,\u201d Mr. Hardouvelis said. He said he was eager to draft a growth plan, investing in promising sectors like agriculture and shipping to create jobs and to diversify exports beyond the economically anemic European Union.Greece\u2019s aim, instead, is to reduce the cost of servicing its debt through lower interest rates or longer maturities. \u201cOur debt is big, but it\u2019s also very long term, so it\u2019s easily serviceable,\u201d Mr. Hardouvelis said.He added that the government planned to tap international markets with a new bond issue in the coming weeks, the third round of fund-raising in three months after four years during which financial markets were essentially closed to Greece.Problems in the broader eurozone \u2014 stagnation in Italy and France and political jousting over the continued fiscal discipline championed by Germany \u2014 may now favor Greece, Mr. Hardouvelis said, smiling apologetically at the irony. The eurozone\u2019s slump, he said, \u201cnecessitates an expansionary monetary policy, which keeps interest rates down and keeps borrowing costs down.\u201dWhen troika inspectors arrive in Athens, Greece\u2019s budget will once again come under a microscope. Mr. Hardouvelis bristles at the suggestion that inspectors might take a hard line, noting that foreign auditors originally doubted Greece\u2019s predictions of a primary surplus, only to be proved wrong in the spring. \u201cI hope this has taught them a lesson, and they don\u2019t insist so much on the fiscal side,\u201d he said, noting that a Greek recovery would be undercut by any \u201cnew, onerous targets.\u201dMr. Hardouvelis, the son of farmer from a small fishing village in Greece\u2019s southern Peloponnese peninsula, said he was sensitive to the social effects of the long siege of austerity. And despite his Harvard pedigree \u2014 he went there on a scholarship \u2014 Mr. Hardouvelis makes it clear he does not consider himself part of the entitled Greek political elite.\u201cI understand what unemployment is,\u201d said Mr. Hardouvelis, 58, who is married with two children, one still a student, the other doing his obligatory military service. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a dad who would send me $1,000 a month to make it at college.\u201dGreeks are overtaxed, he said, but he added that tax relief would need to be preceded by growth. There may be action, though, to temper some \u201cextreme cases\u201d \u2014 like a tax on heating oil, which has fallen short of revenue targets while having a negative effect on the environment because Greeks have turned to burning wood to heat their homes.Mr. Hardouvelis contends that the current government is leading a more \u201cmature\u201d society and that the lackluster results of anti-bailout opposition parties in elections to the European Parliament in May signal a public realization that there is no viable alternative to the country\u2019s living within its means \u2014 however meager for now.\u201cGreeks don\u2019t buy promises anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know they will be the ones that have to finance them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

That increased demand for bonds and pushed down their yields. In turn, stocks with big dividends became more attractive to investors seeking income-paying securities.The stock market also got a lift from a cease-fire agreement between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists. Stocks had slumped early in August in the face of worries that the conflict would inflame tensions between Russia and the West.\u201cThat development is a positive,\u201d said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust. \u201cFurther sanctions on Russia, and excluding them from the Western economies, sets global trade back.\u201dThe S.&P. 500 rose 10.06 points, to 2,007.7, surpassing its previous high close of 2,003.37, set Aug. 29. The index has now logged 33 nominal highs this year. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 67.78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,137.36. The Nasdaq gained 20.61 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,582.90.Stocks had started the day lower after a disappointing jobs report. Employers added 142,000 jobs in August, snapping a six-month streak of hiring above 200,000 and posting the smallest gain in eight months, the Labor Department said on Friday. Many analysts reasoned that the slowdown in hiring was not strong enough to suggest that the overall trend had changed. \u201cI would avoid reading too much into one number,\u201d said Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock. \u201cThe weight of evidence suggests that the U.S. is going to have a decent third quarter and will be relatively strong going into the end of the year.\u201dBond prices initially rose on the disappointing hiring news. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of price, dropped as low as 2.41 percent, before gradually giving up most of its gains throughout the day and edging up to 2.46 percent from 2.45 percent on Thursday. The price was down 1/32 to 99 9/32. The yield has dropped from 3 percent at the start of this year.The lower bond yields are, the more attractive dividend-rich utilities appear to those looking for an income. The fall in bond yields this year has helped make the utilities sector the second-best performer in the S.&P. 500 index, with a gain of 14 percent.Among stocks making big moves Friday, Vertex Pharmaceuticals was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. Its stock rose $3.49, or 3.8 percent, to $95.04 after analysts at Goldman Sachs raised their rating on the stock to buy from neutral, citing the outlook for the company\u2019s cystic fibrosis treatment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ebb and Flow of Health Spending", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe latest federal estimates of health care spending offer some good news: The growth rate for spending in 2013 will remain at a low level for the fifth straight year. But the bad news is, spending is expected to rise faster than growth in the economy over the next 10 years. The big unanswered question is what role the Affordable Care Act has played and will play in prodding the health care system to adopt more efficient practices. The act uses competition among insurers and providers to hold costs down, offers free preventive services to head off more serious illnesses, and has started pilot projects to test new ways of paying doctors to manage a patient\u2019s care, which will likely reduce needless hospitalizations and emergency room visits. While the recession and slow recovery may be the key factor holding down health care spending for now, some economists believe the act, by adjusting the behavior of health care providers, will continue to reduce growth in future spending. The slower growth in Medicare spending projected in the report is especially encouraging, with the growth rate declining from 4.8 percent in 2012 to 3.3 percent in 2013 and remaining low in 2014 and 2015. One reason is that beneficiaries have been using fewer expensive medical services, like hospital care in recent years. Provisions in the reform law that slow the growth in payments to Medicare providers could help mitigate higher spending as more baby boomers reach the eligibility age. Government officials say they hope changes in the delivery of health care have begun to rein in costs. Firm evidence is not yet available, but there\u2019s reason to believe that more efforts by reformers in the public and private health systems will pay off. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Little Efficiency Can\u2019t Hurt", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the Wheel14 PhotosIf sales charts never lie, then\u00a0BMW can do no wrong. The German automaker has shoved Mercedes and Lexus aside to become America\u2019s best-selling luxury brand.But some enthusiasts and auto writers are troubled by how BMW got there: by breeding models like rabbits, including six variations of X-badged S.U.V.s. Some core products \u2014 especially the 5 Series sedan and its\u00a0high-powered\u00a0M5 offshoot \u2014 have arguably lost the performance soul at the core of BMW\u2019s ethos and appeal.I have defended BMW\u2019s expansion into utility vehicles, just as I defended Porsche when it released the Cayenne. If Americans want luxury S.U.V.s, a manufacturer would be an idiot not to oblige, as even Bentley, Jaguar and Maserati will soon do. Yet enthusiasts have sent a message to BMW: Keep your mitts off our M3. This is the holy of holies, the sport sedan like no other. Those fans can breathe easy, as easy as the 2015 M3 (and the newly named M4 Coupe) rushes ahead with its new 425-horsepower 3-liter twin-turbo in-line 6.The previous M3, with a 4-liter naturally aspirated V8, howled to 414 peak horsepower. But with just 295 pound-feet of torque, it was like the high-strung friend who is wild and fun, but often exhausting.Despite that, some fans have feigned outrage that the M3 and M4 share an identical downsized 3-liter engine block, though little else, with the conventional 3 Series sedan or 4 Series coupe and convertible. In their orthodoxy, every molecule of the engine should trace to the company\u2019s M performance division. But such critics may have missed the auto industry\u2019s message: Downsized, turbocharged engines not only seem inevitable, but they are also unbeatable for their combination of torque and fuel economy. Not only does BMW\u2019s new twin-turbo engine generate 406 pound-feet of torque \u2014 remarkably, 111 more than before \u2014 but it\u2019s at your service at any engine speed from 1,800 to 5,500 r.p.m. Fuel economy has risen nearly 25 percent from the previous models, to 17 m.p.g. in the city, 24 on the highway, with the automatic transmission, and carbon dioxide emissions have been cut 25 percent. This Bimmer can race to 60 miles per hour in 4.1 seconds, about 0.7 second quicker than before. Considering the engine\u2019s triple whammy of improved performance, drivability and efficiency, splitting hairs over its origins becomes a pointless existential debate.It\u2019s the same story for the new M4 coupe, previously called the M3 coupe, whose tossup performance will leave prospective customers lying awake and counting doors: Two or four? Four or two? For me, it\u2019s the M3 sedan that\u2019s most appealing, so ruthlessly practical that I can overlook the M4\u2019s more alluring body. Either way, the BMWs\u2019 signature advantage is that they seat four adults comfortably, with relatively enormous cargo space compared with a two-seat sports car. Whereas husbands or wives feel compelled to trade a sports car for a less frivolous family member \u2014 a new baby \u2014 they might actually rationalize holding on to an M3.Then again, how most folks could afford this silver-spoon baby is beyond me: As breathtaking expressions of Bavarian know-how, the M3 and M4 are better than ever. But to get one, you need lots of gelt. Take a deep breath: The M3 that I tested had a sticker price of $85,000; the M4 was $86,200. Those stickers were a long way up from the base prices of $62,925 for the M3 and $65,125 for the M4. I kept checking the options list for some amazing feature that I had overlooked \u2014 like a free Mini Cooper. No dice, just some fuzzy math: The Executive Package, which includes a heated steering wheel, head-up display and rear-view camera, costs a stiff $4,000. If I were placing my order, I\u2019d save $11,000 worth of options by forgoing the $8,150 carbon-ceramic brakes and choosing BMW\u2019s delightful 6-speed manual transmission over the dual-clutch DCT automated gearbox. The DCT is also pleasurable to paddle through the gears, even as it improves fuel economy and cuts the 0-60 sprint to a sizzling 3.9 seconds. But it sets you back $2,900. Black 19-inch alloy wheels seem a must for $1,200, a sinister coup de gr\u00e2ce on these already aggressive-looking bodies. An adaptive M suspension with settings from soft to stiff is also worth the $1,000 upgrade.That would leave this compact BMW sedan or coupe hovering around $75,000. That might be $20,000 more than a well-equipped BMW 335i or Corvette Stingray, but it\u2019s $20,000 less than a Porsche 911 Carrera S with nary an option. For that, buyers get a pedigreed racetrack-ready BMW, including the first M3 lighter than the one that came before. Weight has been cut by 175 pounds.Cavernous air inlets and BMW\u2019s aero-enhancing air curtains dominate the front view, along with a \u201cpower dome\u201d hood bulge and lovely exterior mirrors perched on slender dual stalks. A rear diffuser and quad exhaust pipes jut from the rear. A carbon-fiber roof shelters both models, with the M4\u2019s specially shaped carbon-fiber trunk lid adding extra downforce. Inside, the conventional seats of the previous M3 have given way to deeply bolstered, finely wrought chairs with integrated headrests. The analog gauges are clear and classic.The standard brakes have evolved from sliding calipers to more robust four-piston units (six pistons for carbon-ceramic versions). A track-specified system enhances cooling for the engine, turbochargers and transmission. Power rushes downstream through a carbon-fiber driveshaft. That trims 40 pounds from the last model, with less energy wasted in rotating mass. As in motorsports, a rear axle subframe bolts directly to the chassis with no rubber bushings, improving control by reducing flex, and keeping the drive wheels on their proper path.Aside from the powertrain, the M Differential is the secret performance weapon. Monitoring wheelspin, steering-wheel angle and other parameters, this traction-enhancing device sends that unholy power to the pavement with thrilling efficiency.Individual performance settings for the engine, transmission, suspension and steering assist smack of BMW\u2019s signature fussiness. Thankfully, macro M1 and M2 switches on the steering wheel let you program one-touch settings for various systems. Annoyingly, the engine reverts back to its laziest setting when you start the car. The engine delivers a surprisingly basso rumble for its size and configuration, but as with many turbo mills, it still sounds relatively muffled and distant.\u201cDistant\u201d also describes the steering sensations. Yet the steering is so agile, smartly weighted and accurate, and the cars so cemented and confident, that a lack of pure fingertip feel is quickly forgiven. On a backwoods tour of the Catskill Mountains, the M4\u2019s superlative power, balance and brakes made a rousing argument: This is the rare four-seater that truly belongs on a track, including the N\u00fcrburgring in Germany, where engineers honed its reflexes. When the rear tires finally break loose around curves, a light flick of countersteer brings the body back into line.The brawny attitude is summed up by the automated launch control, no longer a complicated nanny that demanded multiple permissions before allowing any fun. Now easy to dial up, the system drops the clutch at 3,500 r.p.m., torching the rear tires and scooting the BMW half-sideways like a teenager ditching a truant officer. Inflationary concerns aside, the M3 and M4 combine tradition and the latest technology to set a breathlessly fast tempo; think of a Bavarian polka band playing at 6,500 beats per minute. The cars are also a good sign for owners and fans who gaze obsessively into BMW\u2019s crystal ball.Intriguingly, BMW\u2019s electrified carbon-fiber models \u2014 the iconoclastic i3 city car and futuristic i8 plug-in hybrid sports car \u2014 best exemplify the old BMW spirit of risk-taking and agenda-setting. The gas-burning M3 and M4 are less innovative, but they\u2019re valuable in their own way: Both reaffirm BMW\u2019s mission as a builder of pure driver\u2019s cars. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Startling Look at How Profits Elude the Taxman", "Date": "2014-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOperating OverseasStatistics cited in debates about tax reform often have a sleep-inducing effect. But Jason Furman, the chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, recently offered some eye-popping numbers to underscore just how much revenue the United States loses when American corporations shift part of their operations abroad to avoid paying taxes at home.To make his point, Mr. Furman noted that in some cases, the profits reported by an American-controlled corporation far exceeded the total economic output of the country or locality where it was situated.American-controlled corporate profits in the British Virgin Islands, for example, were 1,009 percent of the islands\u2019 gross domestic product, while in the Cayman Islands, they reached 1,430 percent, he said.Tropical vacation spots aren\u2019t the only places where American companies are wildly productive. In Luxembourg, American profits were 103 percent of that nation\u2019s total gross domestic product, and in Ireland, they were 38 percent.Mr. Furman quoted the numbers on Sept. 22 when he offered students in a tax class at New York University\u2019s law school a sometimes startling look at how tax law operates in the real world.\u201cI feel safe in saying that the fact that in 2010 U.S.-controlled foreign corporation profits represent 1,578 percent of Bermuda\u2019s G.D.P. and even 15 percent of the Netherlands\u2019 G.D.P. probably does not simply reflect business decisions made for purely business reasons,\u201d Mr. Furman said.Mr. Furman suggested that several corporations with overseas headquarters were dabbling in creative accounting to shift profits from where they were actually earned \u2014 the United States \u2014 to appear as if they had been produced in tax havens.Several tax experts saw the commission report as a sign that countries are clamping down on the tax deals that some nations are cutting with multinationals.Mr. Furman did not comment directly on Mr. Lew\u2019s proposal, but he argued generally that the current tax system is distorting economic activity rather than promoting it.The goal is \u201cneutrality,\u201d Mr. Furman said. \u201cThe tax system should not tilt the playing field between different business decisions, allowing business decisions to be made for business reasons and not for tax reasons. And this, with a few very important exceptions, maximizes overall efficiency and increases the level or growth of output.\u201dThe current system is also unfair, he added, because it means that businesses in the United States that can\u2019t or won\u2019t move their profits overseas are forced to shoulder more of the tax burden.Although the United States is described as having a worldwide system, because in theory it taxes corporate profits wherever they are generated, Mr. Furman said the combination of immediate interest deductions and the ability to indefinitely defer paying taxes on profits generated abroad made it closer to what is known as a territorial system, where business is taxed only on income earned within its borders \u2014 with one exception.\u201cOur system today is closer to what I would call a \u2018stupid territorial\u2019 system,\u201d he said, \u201cthat raises little revenue on overseas activities while still imposing substantial distortions associated with avoiding the statutory taxes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Music Row Shifts to Condo Row, Nashville Cries in Its Beer", "Date": "2014-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by7 PhotosToday, booming Nashville is trying to decide whether the tone is appropriate for the crusade that Mr. Kopp and others are waging to save Studio A, a recording room that is steeped in music history and that is scheduled for demolition to make way for a luxury condominium project.The potential loss of the 49-year-old studio has sparked a broader conversation here about whether the city\u2019s sizzling real estate market is squeezing the music business out of Music Row, even as country has overtaken Top 40 as the nation\u2019s most popular radio format.The cluster of streets southwest of downtown Nashville has long been the spiritual and commercial center of the nation\u2019s country music business \u2014 a concentration of record companies, small-time showbiz strivers and studios that Christine Kreyling, a local writer, once called \u201cthe Vatican City of country music.\u201d\u201cIf we let certain musical touchstones go, these centerpieces of collaboration between artists and engineers, then what\u2019s left that makes Nashville\u2019s music scene unique?\u201d said Mr. Kopp, a manager of Ben Folds, the rock musician who is the studio\u2019s current lessee.In recent years, Nashville has leveraged its diverse economy and honky-tonk mystique to become one of the nation\u2019s fastest growing cities. The 10-county metropolitan region of 1.7 million people is expected to grow to three million by 2040, and in the last fiscal year, the city bested its record for the total value of building permits issued.But the growth has generated an undertone of worry among some in the music industry, particularly those who work on Music Row. Larry Sheridan, a real estate agent who runs a small studio on the Row, has counted five other studios that have been torn down in the area in the last year or so.The project will reportedly include a recording studio. But for now, it is an empty lot.\u201cI know the progress is great,\u201d said Pat Holt, 61, a veteran producer and engineer who has worked with Johnny Cash and George Jones. \u201cThis is my hometown, and I love to see it grow and expand. But I\u2019d sure hate to see Music Row not be Music Row 20 years from now.\u201dBarring a last-minute reprieve, the 5,000-square-foot Studio A will be the next to go. Bravo Development, the local company that owns 30 Music Square West, the building housing the studio, announced this month that the building would be replaced with a five-story condo complex.Tim Reynolds, the owner of Bravo Development, has noted with frustration that the building remained on the market without a buyer \u2014 and without much discussion about its fate or historic worth \u2014 for years. He has said that he would also entertain offers from other buyers for the building through Sept. 30, leaving open the possibility of a more preservation-minded owner. Nashville\u2019s mayor, Karl Dean, said this month that he hoped such a buyer would step in.Mr. Folds operates Studio A under the name Grand Victor Sound Nashville, renting it out to other artists who wish to record there, so he has a vested interest in keeping the studio open. But he, Mr. Kopp, and others have also helped start a group, the Music Industry Coalition, that is committed to the broader effort of saving what Mr. Folds called the \u201cspecial formula\u201d that makes the music industry here so different from show business culture in New York or Los Angeles.\u201cYou can walk out of one door and into the next, and borrow a guitar, or write a song, or get a record deal, or find a touring musician,\u201d Mr. Folds said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlike anything else in the country.\u201dMusic Row has long been a hodgepodge of big companies\u2019 blocky headquarters and smaller offices set in turn-of-the-20th-century homes.Today, many of the city\u2019s songwriters, musicians, agents and publishers still shuttle among these offices, waving to one another on the sidewalk, and occasionally swapping ideas, and licks, on front porches.So far, the new group has generated more sympathy than success. It has asked the city how certain buildings might be saved or incorporated into new development. City officials explored the idea of a new historic protective zone, but determined that one was not feasible under current local law. And Mr. Kopp said the coalition did not want to burden property owners with such a zone, anyway. Some people have questioned whether Music Row really merits saving. The Internet and powerful home-recording software, they say, have diminished the importance of face-to-face networking and big, professional studios.Many engineers have set up shop in Berry Hill, a more affordable city nearby. And despite its reputation as a creative hub, Music Row has also had a reputation of being hopelessly square \u2014 the home of Nashville \u201csuits\u201d vilified by generations of outlaw country musicians. These days, the center of Nashville\u2019s cutting-edge culture is clustered in the hip neighborhood of East Nashville.Some high-profile music companies have already moved away from Music Row, including Universal Music Group, which decamped for downtown a few years ago. Sony Music Nashville recently announced plans to move from Music Row to a new building in the nearby neighborhood known as the Gulch.Nashville, of course, is not just about country, and over the years, in addition to the likes of Loretta Lynn and George Strait, Studio A has hosted B.

What you\u2019re seeing is the U.S. economy growing at a modest pace, not too hot and not too cold.\u201dMr. Veru said it was an environment that allowed the Fed to stick to a policy that coaxes businesses to borrow and spend and could fuel more gains for stocks.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average closed at new nominal highs. The S.&P. 500 gained 9.79 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,011.36. The Dow rose 109.14 points, or 0.6 percent, to 17,265.99.

{"Headline": "New Script, but Still Playing the Heavy ", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBehind the WheelWe\u2019re accustomed to product placements in movies, so when I took my 4-year-old son to see the animated \u201cPlanes: Fire and Rescue,\u201d I wasn\u2019t surprised to see a Cadillac Escalade on the screen. The character\u2019s name, just to drive home the point, is Cad Spinner.But I was surprised that Cad Spinner is the movie\u2019s most reprehensible character, a narcissistic blowhard whose vanity drives him to make terrible decisions. As a taciturn helicopter comments, \u201cHe waxes himself \u2014 daily.\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure General Motors didn\u2019t pay to be in \u201cPlanes,\u201d but maybe it should have.Cad Spinner is a pop-culture reflection of the Escalade\u2019s real-world dilemma, which is that the big S.U.V. doesn\u2019t enjoy the same adulation that it did in its prime years of 2004-7. Back then, before TARP and Lehman Brothers and synthetic collateralized debt obligations, G.M. consistently sold around 60,000 Escalades a year. For each of the last two years, G.M. moved about 12,000 of its Caddy trucks. The redesigned 2015 model is helping, with sales of the regular-wheelbase version up 43 percent through August. That\u2019s a healthy gain, but nothing like the glory days. Which is why I understand G.M.\u2019s decision to leave the truck pretty much alone. There were many paths they could\u2019ve taken to improve it: unibody construction, independent rear suspension, turbocharging or supercharging. But ultimately, I\u2019m not sure any of that matters. They could make the Escalade out of synthetic diamond and include a robot chauffeur, and they wouldn\u2019t sell 60,000 again. So why not just polish it up a little for the crowd that has to have one? Give them something new to show the neighbors and book the profits. I get it. By which I mean, I get it from G.M.\u2019s perspective. From the customer side, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a little perplexed. Cadillac tinkered around the margins, adding direct fuel injection and variable valve timing to the 6.2-liter V8, and finagling a fold-flat third row of seats, but the newest Escalade looks and drives much like its predecessor. Even with the magnetic-ride-control suspension, you\u2019re always aware that you\u2019re clomping around in a stiffly sprung truck \u2014 solid rear axle and all. And those fold-flat seats create a load floor that\u2019s about waist-high to LeBron James, since the engineers needed to leave room for the undulations of the solid axle beneath. There are some worthy additions to the Escalade\u2019s tech portfolio. Automatic braking, which works in both forward and reverse, is a nice feature that should mitigate a few dings to the hull of the good ship Escalade. The truck can see trouble even if you can\u2019t, and hit the brakes accordingly. The 4G LTE data connection and cordless inductive gadget-charger are nice features, too. 10 PhotosOn the hardware side, the 420-horsepower V8 manages an E.P.A. rating of 21 miles per gallon on the highway, but the city rating of 14 m.p.g. demonstrates the challenges of galumphing around in nearly 6,000 pounds of steel. That is exactly the same rating earned by the GMC Sierra Denali pickup truck, a vehicle that shares the Escalade\u2019s V8 and isn\u2019t too far away on the G.M. evolutionary tree. In an unusual move, Cadillac has already made a significant revision to its recently introduced redesign, adding an 8-speed transmission midstream in the 2015 model year. The new gearbox will presumably improve acceleration and possibly nudge fuel economy a tick in the right direction. It also brings an across-the-board price increase of $1,275, with a 2-wheel-drive Escalade starting at $73,965. The top-of-the line Platinum version, bedecked with nappa leather and three rear video screens, starts at a heady $90,270. So there\u2019s some overlap in price for the Escalade and the Range Rover, which starts at $84,225. A diesel-powered Mercedes-Benz GL350 BlueTec costs about $15,000 less than the Escalade, and it gets 26 m.p.g. on the highway. But a BlueTec won\u2019t pin you back in the seat with 0-to-60 accleration in less than six seconds, nor does it emit a bass-heavy V8 rumble. So I guess there are rational arguments in favor of the Escalade.Another is towing prowess, since the Cadillac\u2019s 8,300-pound maximum is a bit more than the European S.U.V.s are rated to handle. (Their tow ratings are calculated in kilograms, translating to strangely specific ratings like 7,716 pounds for the Range Rover.) And have I mentioned the redesigned Cadillac crest? It\u2019s sleeker and upholds the longstanding banishment of ducks from the logo. I liked the ducks.The Escalade doesn\u2019t make much rational sense when held up against a Mercedes GL, Range Rover or even a Dodge Durango, but then it never has. It\u2019s the sole surviving example of a type of vehicle that used to be Cadillac\u2019s mainstay: big rear-drive barges laden with pomp and pretention, cars with real names instead of benign alphanumeric monikers like CTS and ELR. It\u2019s a truck that\u2019s playing out of position, fulfilling the psychic need for an American S-Class, a flagship product built on American soil, in Arlington, Tex. That\u2019s a lot to ask of a reworked pickup.The solution is to build a serious big-league sedan that would challenge those offered by other luxury brands, and Cadillac has steadfastly avoided doing that. Granted, the division has had its hands full as it prioritized development of the excellent compact ATS and midsize CTS lines. But eventually G.M. will need something above the CTS, a new machine that takes the pressure off the Escalade and lets it retreat to the nostalgia S.U.V. niche occupied by the likes of the Lexus LX 570 (n\u00e9e Toyota Land Cruiser) and Mercedes G550. There\u2019s a dignity in those trucks, an outdated-and-proud-of-it vibe that the Escalade and its full-LED headlights aren\u2019t quite ready to embrace. This Escalade is fine for what it is, but one hopes that Cadillac has some more ambitious long-term vision for where this thing fits in the world. When you\u2019re lampooned by Disney cartoons, perhaps that should be a signal that a change of tactics is in order. But for now, Cad Spinner keeps rolling, brash as ever. Advertisement"}

When American presidents rain down bombs on Muslim countries, they use the awful treatment of women in the Middle East as one of their justifications.In his speech at the United Nations, President Obama said he wanted \u201cto speak directly to young people across the Muslim world\u201d and urged them to create \u201cgenuine\u201d civil societies. \u201cWhere women are full participants in a country\u2019s politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we support the participation of women in parliaments and peace processes, schools and the economy.\u201dYet, because we need the regressive rulers in the Persian Gulf to sell us oil and buy our fighter jets and house our fleets and drones and give us cover in our war coalitions, we don\u2019t really speak out about their human rights violations and degradation of women as much as we should. The Obama administration was sparked to action by the videos of ISIS beheading two American journalists. Yet Saudi Arabia \u2014 wooed to be in the coalition by Kerry with a personal visit this month \u2014 has been chopping off heads regularly, sometimes for nonlethal crimes such as drugs or sorcery. The president should just drop the flowery talk and cut to the chase. Americans get it. Let\u2019s not pretend we\u2019re fighting for any democratic principles here.America failed spectacularly in creating its democratic model kitchen with Iraq. So now we have to go back periodically and cut the grass, as they say in Israel, to keep our virulent foes in check.It is pre-emption. But the difference with President Obama\u2019s pre-emption is that there is an actual threat to the globe from a vicious, maniacal army. President Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and Condoleezza Rice made up a threat to America from a contained and diminished Saddam Hussein to justify pre-emption and serve their more subterranean purposes.Eight months ago, the president was reduced to threatening to act without Congress, warning: \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone.\u201dNow he\u2019s brandishing bombs and drones on a scale he\u2019s never done before. The ex-community activist elected on a peace platform has grown accustomed to coldly ordering the killing of bad guys.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in his wildest dreams \u2014 or nightmares \u2014 he ever foresaw the in-box he has,\u201d said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.But, as Harold Macmillan, the former British prime minister, said once, when asked what disrupted his best-laid plans: \u201cEvents, dear boy, events.\u201dAs the U.S. woos the Arab coalition, Arab leaders are not speaking out against the atrocities of ISIS against women.\u201cIt is the obligation and duty of Arab countries, where men always feel so possessive about their mother, their wife, their daughter, to condemn ISIS\u2019s violence against women,\u201d said Haleh Esfandiari, the director of the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they say a word?\u201cI\u2019ve been working with women in the Middle East for 40 years, and I\u2019ve never seen such brutality, such barbarism as that which ISIS is committing against women. It is unbelievable.\u201dWe are so far from where the dunderheads of the Bush administration were in 2003, with George W. Bush bragging about his cakewalk of weakening dictators, forging democracies and recognizing the rights of women. As it has rampaged like a flesh-eating virus through the region, ISIS has been targeting professional women. An Iraqi lawyer who worked to promote women\u2019s rights was grabbed from her home last week after she posted complaints on her Facebook page about ISIS\u2019s \u201cbarbaric\u201d destruction of mosques and shrines in Mosul. Sameera Salih Ali al-Nuaimy was tortured for days; then a masked firing squad executed her on Monday and then told her family she could not have a funeral.In a Wall Street Journal piece headlined \u201cISIS\u2019s Cruelty Toward Women Gets Scant Attention,\u201d Esfandiari toted up a litany of horrors, including the tragic story of a woman who was tied to a tree, naked, and repeatedly raped by ISIS fighters, who are \u201crewarded\u201d with droit du seigneur as they assault and pillage their way toward an Islamic caliphate.She noted that even though ISIS propaganda emphasizes protecting the morality of women, it has taken little girls playing with dolls and married them off to fighters three times older, set up \u201cmarriage bureaus\u201d in captured Syrian towns to recruit virgins and widows to marry fighters, and tied together women with a rope as though \u201cthey were being led to a makeshift slave market.\u201d She told me that \u201cit\u2019s a strategy to shame women and undermine their families. In our part of the world, a woman who has been raped, whether once or 50 times, feels ashamed, her family feels ashamed. Some commit suicide. Others become pregnant and are ostracized by their family and community, with no fault at all of their own.\u201dHaass noted that one of the lessons we should have learned in fighting halfway around the world, from Vietnam to Iraq, is \u201cthe power of local realities.\u201d\u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve learned is that we can\u2019t deliver fundamental social and cultural transformation in this part of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOur ability to influence the position or status of women in the Arab or Muslim world is limited.\u201dHe said the Arab coalition is necessary because \u201cour priority has got to be to push back and weaken ISIS. \u201cEven if we\u2019re not in a position to give women the better life they deserve,\u201d he concluded, \u201cwe are in a position to save many of them from what ISIS would do to them. And that\u2019s significant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Scotland and Beyond, a Crisis of Faith in the Global Elite", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPulse of the PeopleWhat these stories have in common is this: They lay bare a crisis of faith in the global elite.There has been an implicit agreement in modern democracies: It is fine for the wealthy and powerful to enjoy private jets and outlandishly expensive homes so long as the mass of people also see steadily rising standards of living. Only the first part of that bargain has been met, and voters are expressing their frustration in ways that vary depending on the country but that have in common a sense that the established order isn\u2019t serving them.It was evident not just in last week\u2019s votes in Scotland and Sweden, but also in a wave of votes for parties of the far left and the far right in European parliamentary elections earlier this year, in the rise of the Tea Party in the United States and in instability in Japanese politics that led to six prime ministers since 2007.The details of Scotland\u2019s grievances with the English ruling class are almost the diametrical opposite of those, say, of the Tea Party or Swedish right-wingers. The Scots want more social welfare spending rather than less, and they have a strong antinuclear environmental streak. (Scotland\u2019s threatened secession was less the equivalent of Texas pulling out of the United States than of Massachusetts or Oregon doing the same.) But there are always people who have disagreements with the direction of policy in their nation; the whole point of a state is to have an apparatus that channels disparate preferences into one sound set of policy choices. What distinguishes the current moment is that discontent with the way things are going is so high as to test many people\u2019s tolerance for governing institutions as they now exist.There is simple economic math behind it. Consider the United States, which has had stronger growth than Britain, Japan or Continental Europe since the financial crisis and the deep recession it spawned. The United States economy is now 6.7 percent bigger than it was at the end of 2007.But that masks what has been a miserable last several years for most working Americans. The Census Bureau said last week that the inflation-adjusted median household income \u2014 pay for people at the exact midpoint of the income distribution \u2014 was $51,939 in 2013, up just $180 from 2012 and still 8 percent below 2007 levels.It gets worse. The 2007 peak in real median household income was slightly below the 1999 peak. In other words, a middle-class American family is worse off financially today than it was 15 years ago.Discussion of the economy generally focuses on things like job creation and the growth of the gross domestic product. But you can\u2019t eat G.D.P. Median income is the rubber-meets-the-road measure of how the mass of Americans are living, and the results aren\u2019t good.Or, instead of polls, you can look at results, where every election seems to have the potential to be a wave election, in which one side makes major gains. The idea of overwhelmingly electing President Obama and congressional Democrats in 2008 and turning around and overwhelmingly favoring Tea Party Republicans in 2010 may not seem consistent, but it\u2019s what you might expect in a world where the political mainstream has delivered consistently mediocre results. In Britain, a Labour government led by a Scottish prime minister (Gordon Brown) and his Scottish finance minister (Alistair Darling) supported the so-called financialization of the British economy, with the rise of global megabanks in an increasingly cosmopolitan London as the center of the economic strategy.Then, in 2008, the banks nearly collapsed and were bailed out, and the British economy hasn\u2019t been the same. That economic failure ushered in a coalition government in 2010 that is even less aligned with the Scots\u2019 preferred policies, bringing an age of austerity when the Scots would prefer to widen the social safety net.But it is in Continental Europe that the consequences of bungling by mainstream elites are perhaps the most damaging, and the most dangerous.The decades-long march toward a united continent, led by the parties of the center-right and center-left, created a Western Europe in which there was a single currency and monetary authority. But that authority did not have the political, fiscal and banking union that would make it possible for imbalances among those countries to work themselves out without the benefit of currency fluctuations. When it all came to a head from 2008 to 2012, national leaders were alarmed enough by the risks of budget deficits that they responded by cutting spending and raising taxes.As such, the imbalances that built up over the years in Europe are now working themselves out through astronomical unemployment levels and falling wages in countries like Spain and Greece. Even the Northern European economies, including Germany\u2019s, are experiencing little or no growth. While the Great Depression of the 1930s brought an initially sharper contraction in economic activity, the European economy is performing worse six years after the 2008 crisis than it was at the comparable point in the 1930s.The details of the policy mistakes differ, as do the political movements that have arisen in protest. But together, they are a reminder that power is not a right, it is a responsibility. And no matter how entrenched our governmental institutions may seem, they rest on a bedrock assumption: that the leaders entrusted with power will deliver the goods.The Upshot provides news,\nanalysis and graphics about\npolitics, policy and everyday\nlife.\nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Household Net Worth Has Rebounded ", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsTHE net worth of American households is now 20 percent higher than it was before it began to decline in 2007, the Federal Reserve reported this week. It said the households together were worth $81.5 trillion at the end of the second quarter, higher than ever and up 10 percent from a year earlier.By another measure, household net worth is a little short of the record highs reached before the recession. It amounted to 471 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product in the second quarter, just short of the record 473 percent set in early 2007.Those figures are not adjusted for inflation. But adjusted for the change in the Consumer Price Index, household wealth is also at a record high, 4 percent above the 2007 level.The recovery in household wealth has come in ways that favor the wealthiest households. The Fed estimated that real estate owned by households is worth $22.9 trillion, 6 percent less than seven years earlier but 27 percent more than at the bottom of the real estate market in 2011. The biggest gains for households came in the equity markets. The Fed said households now owned $21 trillion in stock and mutual fund shares, 37 percent more than seven years earlier and almost 160 percent more than they owned at the bottom of the bear market in 2009. While many people own stocks and mutual fund shares, by far the largest holdings are among those who are the wealthiest. In 2012, more than a third of dividends reported on tax returns went to taxpayers earning at least $2 million a year. That is more than double the share of dividends that went to those with taxable incomes of $100,000 or less.During the recession, many households moved into safer fixed-income assets, including bonds issued by companies and governments. But with speculation that interest rates will rise, reducing the value of outstanding bonds, households have reduced their holdings to $3.5 trillion, a few billion less than in 2007. Total debt for households and nonprofit organizations equaled 77 percent of G.D.P., the lowest level since 2002. That figure peaked at 96 percent in early 2009.Debt has also fallen for other sectors of the economy. The financial sector, including banks, had total debt at the end of the second quarter equal to 81 percent of G.D.P., the lowest level since 2000 and down from a peak of 119 percent. Loans to nonfinancial businesses have been rising in recent quarters, and now equal 67 percent of G.D.P., but that is lower than the peak of 74 percent reached in 2009.The decline in household debt is largely due to lower mortgage debt, particularly home equity loans. But consumer credit has continued to rise and now equals a record 19 percent of G.D.P. That is largely because of the continued surge in student loan debt \u2014 an obligation concentrated in younger households and among those who are far from wealthy. It has more than doubled since 2007. In 2006, when the Fed began to report on student loan debt as a separate category, the debt totaled $509 billion, or 22 percent of total consumer debt. Now, it equals $1.3 trillion, a 40 percent share of consumer debt.That is more than Americans owe either on credit card debts ($839 billion) or auto loans ($919 billion).Auto debt, however, has recovered and is now 17 percent higher than it was before the recession. That is 5.3 percent of G.D.P., well below the 6.5 percent record set in 2003.While private sector debt has generally declined, at least relative to the size of the economy, government debt has been rising. But with the federal budget deficit falling, the ratio of federal government debt to G.D.P. slipped to 72.9 percent in the second quarter from 73.6 percent three months earlier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Help for Those \u2018Lost in America\u2019", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:The Great Recession was a traumatic blow to a middle class that was already feeling anxious and insecure. While statistics demonstrate that the economy is recovering, creating a recovery in public opinion, confidence and a sense of security will take much longer and will require aggressive reshaping of priorities.For a half-decade before the meltdown, the middle class detected instability in its economic terrain. As the wealthiest took higher ground, the middle class felt lost in a widening valley bereft of opportunity. The Great Recession froze those middle-class anxieties.The good news is that history teaches that bold and aggressive policies aimed at middle-class security always work, for everyone. Investments in infrastructure, reductions in college costs and incentives for more affordable housing are tools for rebuilding the middle class and creating optimism. All we need to do now is sharpen and modernize those tools. The writer is a Democratic member of the House representing parts of Queens, Nassau and Suffolk Counties.To the Editor:The reason we are stuck in a \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d mode and feel lost, as Frank Bruni writes, is that we are so gridlocked as a country. We have come to a point where we can\u2019t do anything except try to cut taxes and reduce benefits for means-tested programs.We can\u2019t invest in vital infrastructure, we can\u2019t reliably pay bills already incurred and we can\u2019t pass legislation to address these and other important issues.In every case, we have a Republican Party that has chosen to put politics above country by refusing to address significant issues that affect our country and its people. We are at the mercy of a party that sees success as simply being obstinate. With congressional Republicans spending all their time opposing the president and none helping the broad middle class, it\u2019s no wonder we have become a country of \u201ccan\u2019t.\u201dTo the Editor:In a country so dependent on electronic media to communicate, the widespread disaffection and distrust Frank Bruni refers to might reflect an inability to adjust our emotions to the swift cadences of news cycles and paid political announcements.When this frustration is woven together with political, religious or other preconceptions, too often our reaction is more like a meat cleaver than a scalpel.Examples of this imprecise reasoning abound: \u201cBig government is bad,\u201d many cry, although, for instance, Louisiana and Mississippi simply could not have borne the costs of Hurricane Katrina without the help of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The recent surveillance video released by the police in Ferguson, Mo., of what is being referred to as Michael Brown\u2019s \u201cstrong-arming\u201d a clerk while stealing cigars from a convenience store is \u201cconclusive evidence\u201d of his criminal nature, while the shocking video of white police officers violently beating Rodney King in 1991 wasn\u2019t enough to convict two of the four who were prosecuted.It seems that we aren\u2019t as lost in America as we are out of sequence with swiftly moving media descriptions of the country.To the Editor:The solution to the despair described in \u201cLost in America\u201d is democracy. Americans have the power to get rid of politicians they don\u2019t like or trust, and replace them with better ones.This will take time and effort. But if everybody thinks that it\u2019s unachievable, the slide will surely continue.IAN COWANChristchurch, New ZealandAug. 27, 2014To the Editor:The pessimism and helplessness that Frank Bruni sees have been a long time coming.I grew up in the 1930s and \u201940s, and knew the America of confidence in the 1950s. For me the turning point was 1968. That year and subsequent ones saw a lot, including the end of the liberal consensus when the \u201chard hats\u201d attacked student protesters. Then they voted for Ronald Reagan and, essentially, it was over.Naturally, such a fall takes time to unfold, but as the column notes, the unfolding is now in full view.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Way Out for Ukraine and Russia", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorThe progress of the conflict in eastern Ukraine is utterly predictable. Since the rebellion began with Russian backing five months ago, it\u2019s been obvious that the Kremlin would not allow the rebels to be crushed by force. So deeply is President Vladimir Putin\u2019s prestige invested in his Ukrainian strategy, and in the image of Russian strength, that to allow a Ukrainian military victory would threaten the stability and even the existence of his own regime.As many observers have been writing from the start of this conflict, there was never a chance of the Ukrainian government being able to win militarily. Russia has demonstrated an ability to send in whatever lightly disguised forces are necessary to fight the Ukrainian Army to a standstill. For the West to encourage Kiev to seek a military victory \u2014 as its governments seem to have been doing \u2014 could only lead to inevitable defeat. If confirmed, the reported Ukrainian moves toward an agreement with Moscow on a cease-fire with the rebels are a logical step. For even if the West were to provide Kiev with enough military aid to give a real chance of crushing the rebels, this would also create a real chance of a full-scale Russian invasion. Such an invasion could only be stopped by the introduction of a Western army \u2014 something which is simply not a possibility. A Russian invasion would be a disaster for both Ukraine and Russia \u2014 and a disastrous humiliation for NATO and the West.The toughness of Russia\u2019s stance does not stem from Mr. Putin\u2019s calculations alone. It is also due to the fact that a great many ordinary Russians, including those who are basically pro-Western and anti-Putin, regard American support for the overthrow of a democratically elected (albeit repulsive) government in Kiev last winter as utterly outrageous and a threat to vital Russian interests. Mr. Putin\u2019s popularity soared as a result of his stance on Ukraine, and it shows no sign of declining. As Thomas Graham of Kissinger Associates has written, Russia cares about what happens in Ukraine much more than the West does \u2014 for reasons which should be apparent to anyone who has spent 10 minutes studying Russian and Ukrainian history.At the same time, the Kremlin remains relatively cautious \u2014 were it not so, the Russian Army would be in Kharkov and Odessa by now. Moscow did nothing after the crackdown on pro-Russian demonstrators elsewhere in eastern and southern Ukraine (including the killing of more than 40 in Odessa) and accepted control of those areas by Kiev. Moscow also accepted as legitimate the election of Petro Poroshenko as president, abandoning its support for former President Viktor Yanukovych. It should be recognized therefore that in seeking de jure control of Crimea and decisive informal influence over the Donbass region, the Kremlin has drastically scaled back its hopes from where they stood a year ago, when Moscow wanted to bring the whole of Ukraine into a Russian-dominated bloc, and even from its initial response to the revolt in Kiev. This allows the possibility of a political solution, which can only consist of a special autonomous status for the Donbass region within Ukraine.The West should take advantage of any cease-fire efforts to craft and strongly advocate this solution, and should then negotiate the precise terms with Kiev and Moscow. Legally and morally, there can be no Western objection to this \u2014 it is after all the solution that the West has put forward to end conflicts in many parts of the world. In another former Soviet territory, Nagorno-Karabakh, the West went further and proposed the loosest form of confederation with Azerbaijan. This solution corresponds to history and local reality; for the Donbass is in fact a region with its own culture and traditions.To separate the Donbass in this way while preserving the principle of Ukrainian territorial integrity would allow the West to help in developing and consolidating the rest of Ukraine without constant disturbances in the East. This would open the possibility \u2014 albeit a long way in the future \u2014 of Ukraine joining the European Union; and if the people of the Donbass region at that point choose to secede and lose the benefits of European Union membership \u2014 well, so much the worse for them.An objection raised to this solution has been that, in the shorter term, it would give the Donbass region a veto over Ukraine\u2019s NATO membership. But since NATO obviously has no intention whatsoever of fighting to defend Ukraine, to offer it membership in the alliance would be morally and geopolitically criminal.The choice today is not between a united Ukraine fully in the Western camp, or a Ukraine which has lost part of its territory to Russia. As recent military developments have demonstrated, the first outcome is simply not going to happen. The choice is between a Ukraine with an autonomous Donbass region, along with a real chance of developing the country\u2019s democracy and economy in a Western direction, or a Ukraine which will be mired in a half-frozen conflict that will undermine all hopes of progress. The way out of this disaster is obvious \u2014 if only Western governments have the statesmanship and courage to take it.Advertisement"}

To make his point, Mr. Kocherlakota, speaking at a town-hall meeting at Carroll College in Helena, Mont., said that when President Gerald Ford was campaigning against inflation in 1974, he commissioned Meredith Willson to write a song. \u201cWho needs inflation?

{"Headline": "Camping Out With the Office", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a five-hour bus ride from New York City, Mr. Heath and the nearly 1,500 other people who attended Summer Camp found themselves in a wilderness expanse spread out over 150 acres of tennis courts, pine trees and bare-bones wood cabins on either side of Raquette Lake in the Adirondacks.By Friday afternoon, he happily greeted a group of friends who were arriving. On a ferry shuttling them between the girls camp and boys camp outposts, Mr. Heath and his cohort could be seen plotting their weekend. There would be work, perhaps. There would be play.One friend, who wore a bandanna around his forehead and clutched a Super Soaker water gun, declared to the crowd, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see me naked, don\u2019t go to camp.\u201dAnother had turned his free camp T-shirt into a crop top and said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna bro out so hard.\u201d For Mr. Heath, Camp was providing a different vibe than that which he experiences elsewhere. \u201cWhen you are within the confines of the city or even the Hamptons, you still have a certain level of internal restraint,\u201d he explained.While the image of technology sector neophytes was once signified by math geeks and nerdy coders, the surge of business-school graduates and marketing majors entering this professional stratum is changing the culture of the start-up economy. Post-collegiate aspiring millionaires who once might have flocked to junior analyst programs at Wall Street banks or law schools are now trying to create \u2014 or at least glom onto \u2014 a Next Big Thing.And because ambition never truly takes a vacation, the sounds of both industry buzzwords and youthful chatter filled the air at Summer Camp. Overheard: \u201cI want to start a hybrid incubator and rehab\u201d; \u201cI have a bang straightener if you need one\u201d; \u201cYou should come to my next UX meet-up\u201d; \u201cI went from jock to dork, it\u2019s very unusual\u201d; \u201cEntrepreneurial creatives who are early adopters\u201d; \u201cThis is like a mini Burning Man!\u201d; \u201cI told my office, \u2018Sorry guys I\u2019m going off the grid\u2019\u00a0\u201d; \u201cI said to him, \u2018Just chill out and kiss me.\u2019\u00a0\u201d WeWork was founded in 2010 by Adam Neumann, 35, and Miguel McKelvey, 40. But the grande dame of Summer Camp was Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, 36, WeWork\u2019s chief brand officer and Mr. Neumann\u2019s wife. (She is also Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s cousin.) Ms. Neumann\u2019s relatives own the campground where the event has been held since 2012. As campers scampered to and from activities, she lazed in a rocking chair and took in the scene. She pointed to a guy walking by. The company, Ms. Neumann said, sees itself less as a landlord providing yoga classes, reliable Wi-Fi and beer on tap to tenants and more as an architect of \u201ca community that empowers people everywhere to do what they love.\u201dSome attendees took a broad interpretation of Ms. Neumann\u2019s vision. Lisa Markuson, 27, who works in sales and marketing, went to Summer Camp with a simple agenda. \u201cMy goal was to hook up with a stranger, and I actually hooked up with two,\u201d she said. With that task attended to, she spent her final day writing poetry on a typewriter on the beach with a group of friends who call themselves the Haiku Guys.The festival was not a revenue-generating event for WeWork. Admission started at $375 for the three days and included sleeping accommodations, with some tents arranged in groups bearing rapper-name designations like Wu-Tang Way and Biggie Boulevard. The price also covered meals of cold cuts and beer as well as transportation. Marijuana was not provided, though it was enjoyed in abundance.Rather, Summer Camp is a perk WeWork offers for the 1,475 people who boarded the buses in the pursuit of sharing business plans, networking and drinking shots. It may best be described as Coachella meets Allen & Company\u2019s Sun Valley meets \u201cMeatballs.\u201d Despite a whole lot of drinking, attendees said they knew they got much more than a bad hangover from attending. For instance, while wakeboarding, Mr. Heath said that he met someone who runs a digital marketing agency he may call upon professionally. \u201cIt felt so much more organic than going to a conference,\u201d he said. \u201cI shared something with this guy that went beyond business networking. Now I feel like I know him on a personal level because we did some back flips and shared some beers.\u201d Days at Summer Camp revolve around a loose schedule of events, lectures and games, like a tug of war and a pie-eating contest.General Assembly, the continuing education company, hosted a \u201cSpaghetti and Marshmallow Innovation\u201d workshop in the boys\u2019 camp theater. At a nearby fire pit, Michael Parrish DuDell, the writer of a book tied to \u201cShark Tank,\u201d the hit TV series, delivered a talk entitled, \u201cPutting the (Type) \u2018A\u2019 in Achievement: How to Build a Framework for Success.\u201d Reddit sponsored an \u201cArts and Crafts Hackathon\u201d in the boys\u2019 camp theater. Tim Rowe, a representative from UPS, led a workshop, \u201cLogistics for a Start-Up.\u201dLew Frankfort, the executive chairman of Coach and a board member of WeWork, gave a well-attended talk that included the advice to be \u201crelentless and single-minded in whatever your quest is.\u201d As he concluded, someone asked, \u201cLew, are you going to party with us?\u201d This demographic of Internet entrepreneurs \u2014 driven and often well funded (by parents and investors alike) \u2014 is attractive to all sorts of brands, including UPS, Early Growth Financial Services and Restoration Hardware, which helped sponsor Summer Camp. Start-ups, small businesses and freelancers are the bread and butter of WeWork, which has locations spread between cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle and Chicago. It rents business accommodations ranging from an unassigned desk in a common area to office spaces, according to the company. The idea is to create a community among a diffuse work force, which may otherwise toil alone in city apartments or parents\u2019 basements.As an additional benefit, some WeWork members end up collaborating with and investing in one another\u2019s projects. Tenants include a matchmaking service called A Little Nudge and a software company for medical scheduling called Intrigma, as well as BuzzFeed and Airbnb, which use WeWork spaces as satellites to their headquarters. In New York, WeWork charges $350 and up, depending on the space (a six-person office space can be as much as $6,000 a month).Camp was about offering the WeWork community a change of pace. There was neither reliable cellphone service nor Wi-Fi. Instead, hookahs, vintage typewriters and canoes loaded with beer were aplenty. It was not unusual to see a drone overhead. At least one bear was spotted.The scene was an ideal respite for WeWorkers and their friends \u2014 not just from working, but from weekending in the Hamptons. Adrian Winn, 31, was wearing tattoos on his face and body and holding Super Soakers filled with vodka and a brown Afro wig he wore on and off during Camp. \u201cI\u2019m getting into as much trouble as humanly possible,\u201d said Mr. Winn, who was a co-founder of a company called Aura Social Technologies and works out of the WeWork offices on Fulton Street. \u201cI spend my weekends in Montauk trying to get pretty girls to download my app.\u201dThere were antidotes to revelry. On Saturday morning, several fitness classes were offered: boot camp, CrossFit, yoga. Emily Brobeck, 32, a yoga instructor who also works at an alternative asset management firm, wore a tank that read \u201calmond milk lattes\u201d and kept the practice on-brand. During the final pose, savasana, she played a cover of Radiohead\u2019s \u201cCreep,\u201d which featured prominently in the trailer for the movie \u201cThe Social Network.\u201d The nights were dominated by live music, D.J.s and light shows. After dinner on Saturday, the Brooklyn band St. Lucia performed. After sunset, Michael Franti & Spearhead played songs about unity, and two women in shorts kissed as men around them cheered. A woman dressed as a taco twerked with a man dressed as Sailor Moon. Trevor Croop, 29, a strategist at Salesforce.com, had no such problems. This was his third annual pilgrimage to Summer Camp, and this year he brought his wife. They have an idea for a project involving a dance performance and an Xbox Kinect. They came to Camp in search of collaborators, and found them: An aspiring D.J. and makeup artist they met are eager to work with them.But the best part, Mr. Croop said, is that though they accomplished a professional goal, the vibe never felt overtly mercenary. \u201cI don\u2019t want to network,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s so vacuous.\u201dAdvertisement"}

According to many recent studies, cleaner and safer energy sources like solar, wind and nuclear could provide a viable alternative to our dangerous dependence on coal.\u00a0The death toll of more than 76,000 miners since 1968 is just the beginning of coal\u2019s unacceptable consequence. Add to that the thousands of citizens who die each year from heart and lung ailments caused by coal\u2019s toxic emissions.And then add the ultimate risk: the carbon-caused climate disruption that scientists say threatens life on earth. Clearly, the cost of this so-called cheap energy is way too high.Studies show that such plans will save lives, improve health, grow our economy and cause a rapid shift toward cleaner and safer energy sources. That, too, would be something worth fighting for.\u00a0To the Editor:Sadly, black lung disease has been making a comeback, particularly among younger miners. Even so, the coal industry objects to federal rules that would limit workers\u2019 exposure to coal dust.Miners take significant health risks for high-paying jobs with good benefits. Increasingly, they also face the risk of losing those jobs. As natural gas displaces coal, companies have been laying off thousands of miners. We\u2019re also moving away from coal production to reduce risks from climate change. That\u2019s a good thing, but we cannot forget the men and women \u2014 like those in my native West Virginia \u2014 who have helped keep the lights on for generations.Congress has in the past provided assistance to displaced workers, and it should do so now.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Big Push for Growth Is More About Trust Than Anything", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecovery in Need of a RecoveryThe question for Europe now is whether the new actions announced by Mr. Draghi, the European Central Bank president, will be enough to solve that institution\u2019s credibility gap: Global investors may doubt that the E.C.B. will stick to its guns, no matter what it may take, to return inflation to the 2 percent that the E.C.B. aims for (it clocked in at 0.3 percent for the 12 months ended in August) and to return growth into positive territory (even the mighty German economy shrank 0.2 percent in the spring quarter).Now, the central bank will buy privately issued securities using its bottomless capacity to create euros, essentially a limited, European version of the quantitative easing policies that have been a primary tool of the Federal Reserve and other global central banks in trying to nurse their economies to health. He would not specify how much the bank would spend on the securities.Mr. Draghi himself rejected the quantitative easing label in a news conference, for whatever that\u2019s worth and indeed the E.C.B.'s approach has significant differences with the policies embraced by its fellow central banks. The Fed has focused less on buying private securities, for example, and Mr. Draghi\u2019s plan is targeted directly at reducing interest rates for consumers and businesses in Europe. Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments hold out the possibility that the bank will announce larger-scale purchases, its ultimate policy bazooka, at a future meeting if conditions don\u2019t improve.For good measure, the central bank also cut interest rates again; a key bank deposit rate that was already negative, at 0.1 percent, is now negative 0.2 percent. In effect, the central bank will pump money into the financial system using one policy tool (the asset purchases), then charge banks (via the negative interest rates) if they park the money rather than put it to more productive use like loans to businesses or consumers.The announcement drove the euro down more than 1 percent against the dollar \u2014 an intended effect of the easier money \u2014 and drove European stock markets up sharply.To understand why Mr. Draghi felt the need to deploy these expansive tools, it is important to understand not just the economic situation facing Europe but also the credibility problem facing the institution in charge of its money supply.The economic situation is gloomy, if familiar. Low inflation and stagnant growth feed on each other in a vicious cycle, making existing debt burdens more onerous and making adjustments between the more prosperous northern European countries and weaker southern European countries more painful.But in many ways, the central bank\u2019s credibility problem is worse. Investors do not believe that the bank will show sufficient determination to stick with easy money policies long enough to return inflation to 2 percent. Measures of inflation expectations based on bond prices have plummeted in the last few months.In effect, markets are betting that the central bank will be paralyzed by fear of any hint of inflation and blowback from the German government to stick with easy money policies long enough and consistently enough to get inflation back up to 2 percent and European growth on track.Central banks have spent the last generation developing trustworthiness as inflation-fighters; when people making economic decisions believe that a central bank will not allow inflation to get too high, that result tends to be self-fulfilling.But there is a flip side to that. In an environment like today\u2019s, they also need credibility that they will stick to their guns when inflation is falling too low and joblessness is too high. And here the E.C.B. has trouble. Throughout the last five years, whenever there has been the barest hint of rising prices, the institution has taken the punch bowl away; in spring 2011, when forces were building that would nearly undo the currency union, the central bank actually increased interest rates.When you lack credibility, it takes that much more dramatic an action to regain it. When the Fed lacked credibility as an inflation fighter in the late 1970s and early 1980s, it took the Fed chairman Paul Volcker\u2019s hiking of rates, triggering a steep recession, to persuade the world that the central bank was really serious about stable prices.Essentially, Mr. Draghi\u2019s challenge is to be the anti-Paul Volcker, to establish credibility as a sufficient monetary dove that investors, businesses, and consumers can have confidence that the E.C.B. will do whatever it takes to get growth and inflation on track.Thursday\u2019s announcement was a big deal, as big as they come in international economics. But credibility isn\u2019t earned in a day.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "VW Shows Off Its 2015 Lineup", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIDDLEBURG, Va. \u2014 Volkswagen occupied a corner of Northern Virginia\u2019s lush horse country with a collection of its newest vehicles recently, affording a group of journalists a closer look at its 2015 model line. With a chance to sample VW\u2019s wares came an opportunity to reflect on the automaker\u2019s struggle to meet its ambitious sales goals in North America.But good weather and uncrowded roads made it easy to evaluate the cars in a situation where they would undoubtedly shine: within the confines of normal, everyday driving. All of the cars \u2014 even the sporty GTI \u2014 felt responsible and comfortable in that setting.Naturally, there are only so many hours a day, so it was impossible to try them all. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the various models tested:By the numbers:There are three driving modes that can be selected to either go faster or help save juice: Normal, Eco and Eco-Plus. Normal mode makes the car feel fresh and sprightly, but it drains the battery much more quickly than Eco-Plus. Unfortunately, the high-economy setting simply makes the car perform like an underpowered mid-1980s Subaru (although you could probably scoop up one of those from Craigslist for $34,000 less than the e-Golf\u2019s $36,000 price). Clearly, ecological and economical driving come at a cost \u2014 in terms of power, cost and range \u2014 when compared with gasoline-powerd Golfs.By the numbers: While the elevated driver position seems an obvious selling point, the altered geometry \u2014 over Volkswagen\u2019s cars, which are nicely laid out \u2014 affected the way the steering column sat in relation to the driver. It\u2019s not anything like the nearly horizontal steering wheel of an old Volkswagen bus, but it took a longer reach to keep hands fully engaged with the wheel at all times. The shiny \u201cR\u201d perched near the edge of the flat-bottom leather-wrapped steering wheel served as a reminder of the R-Line\u2019s sportiness.By the numbers: Stepping into this car is likely to make you feel as carefree as a 19-year-old college woman about to embark on a spring break trip armed with her parents\u2019 credit card. The Beetle convertible would be a perfect accessory for such a trip, as it has seats, a radio, a beautiful 360-degree of the world and a trunk for stashing bathing suits and other small items.It\u2019s fast enough, but the 2-liter turbo isn\u2019t as easy to drive gently as the low-revving diesel models, the powerful GTI or the e-Golf in its gutless \u201880s econobox mode. As a result, the transmission tended not to respond to the \u201cgo only slightly faster\u201d foot command on uphill grades, but waited until the accelerator pedal was buried deep enough to drop the transmission down a gear and give the car a pulse of acceleration. That could be something an owner gets used to, but this engine may just play nicer with a manual transmission. (Luckily, the Beetle convertible is available with Volkswagen\u2019s brilliant diesel engine, too.)What would probably be more difficult to get used to is the Beetle convertible\u2019s rather complicated roof-closing mechanism. Across the model line, buttons for sunroof and convertible operation are difficult to see from the driver\u2019s seat. On the convertible, if you don\u2019t remove the all-one-color (black) tonneau cover latches, the roof won\u2019t close. What the blinking orange light that makes this announcement doesn\u2019t tell you is that you also have to remove the entire cover and stash it someplace or else it will fall on you as the roof closes. I threw the cover in the back seat as it dangled from a nearly closed roof. It looked out of place, and its stuffed animal puffiness made me reluctant to fold it and jam it into the trunk. And if you think it may rain, leave the tonneau cover off so that you can close the roof quickly when the skies open.Things don\u2019t improve after the roof is closed. The wind buffeting and sunshine pelting the driver with the top down evaporates as the interior dims into a dark cavern with the roof latched shut.By the numbers:Advertisement"}

That still has not happened.That plan sank in a swamp of legal confusion and squabbling over control of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s opulent hideaway and its contents, estimated to be worth over $1 billion in all, including gold bathroom fixtures, a white Steinway grand piano and a menagerie of exotic birds, deer and other animals.Supported by a group of former protesters from Independence Square and now by volunteer fighters back from the war in eastern Ukraine, he has kept would-be looters and vandals away and, arguing that corrupt bureaucrats only want to enrich themselves, has steadfastly resisted government orders that he hand over his domain to a state-owned agricultural company.\u201cLots of people want to take it away. They are playing the same old game,\u201d said Mr. Tarachkotelyk, speaking on the veranda of his office, a luxury guest villa known as \u201cPutin\u2019s House\u201d because of rumors that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia stayed there once during a visit to Kiev. \u201cYanukovych has gone, but an army of bureaucrats stayed behind. All they think about is how to steal for themselves.\u201dBut while fuming against greedy, inept politicians and officials, Mr. Tarachkotelyk has himself been besieged by accusations of thievery and incompetence.\u201cWho is this person? He is a nobody,\u201d said Mr. Syrotiuk, the legislator. He described Mr. Tarachkotelyk as a \u201cnumbskull\u201d and said his principal goal was to keep control of the cash flow generated by ticket sales to visitors.On one point, however, all sides in the feud agree: Ukraine\u2019s February revolution is far from finished and needs to deliver on its promise of a clear, fresh start to avoid going the way of the so-called Orange Revolution of 2004 that generated high hopes and then fizzled in a morass of infighting and corruption.The bloody military campaign in eastern Ukraine against pro-Russian rebels, now in abeyance after a cease-fire agreement, has helped to keep frustration with Ukraine\u2019s new leaders and their tycoon backers in check. And even their most fervent critics acknowledge that President Petro O. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman elected in May, has avoided the larceny associated with Mr. Yanukovych.Many Ukrainians blame Mr. Putin, saying his principal objective is keeping Ukraine in an uproar and so preventing its new leaders from meeting the hopes of change raised by the Maidan protests.But another problem is that just about everyone other than the pro-Russian gunmen in the east proclaim themselves guardians of the revolution, a role that can provide easy cover for narrow personal ambitions.Mr. Tarachkotelyk says he has used money collected from ticket sales not only to pay the salaries of 145 staff members but also to buy helmets, bulletproof vests and other equipment for soldiers fighting the separatists. He also boasts of buying food to feed scores of fighters now recuperating on the estate as well as around 80 refugees from Donetsk and other parts of the war zone.It costs just over a dollar to enter the estate but around $15 for a guided tour of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s palatial villa. The number of visitors has fallen sharply since February, when hundreds of thousands rushed to gawk at the former president\u2019s excess, but tens of thousands still visit on weekends, marveling at Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s execrable taste and generating substantial ticket receipts for Mr. Tarachkotelyk and his men.More money comes in from food stalls and tour operators, but how much exactly, and where it goes, are unclear, as Mr. Tarachkotelyk sees no need for outside auditors. The government, he said, has no right to inspect his accounts. \u201cWe account for ourselves before society,\u201d he said.He dismissed as lies a swarm of allegations surrounding his management. These include reports in the Ukrainian news media that he or his supporters stole a big loaf-shaped bar of gold left by Mr. Yanukovych in his study and pocketed money that should have gone to buy food for hungry animals in the former president\u2019s zoo.The animals now all look well fed, and Mr. Tarachkotelyk says he is the victim of a defamation campaign by those who want to seize the presidential estate for their own purposes. The gold bar, he added, never existed.While getting a glimpse of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s over-the-top extravagance, visitors to his villa are also told of how his successors are squandering the fruits of the revolution. \u201cOld bandits have been replaced by new bandits,\u201d said Petro Oleinik, a tour guide there.The struggle for control of Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s estate, however, shows just how hard that will be in a country where who really owns what is often hidden in an opaque fog. Mr. Yanukovych and his cronies are gone, but government bureaucracies remain stacked with underpaid officials shaped by their corrupt ways.When Parliament first passed the law demanding that the state take over Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s property, recalled Mr. Syrotiuk, the lawmaker who drafted it, it seemed an easy way to strike a symbolic and real blow against the corruption of the old government. \u201cEveryone agreed we had to take it away, that this was not clean property,\u201d he said.Doing this legally, however, quickly ran into problems as most of the estate was not technically owned by Mr. Yanukovych but by a private company that, on paper, had nothing to do with him. All Mr. Yanukovych formally owned was his palatial residence, a grotesque Finnish-built folly whose jumble of Italian, Gothic, Slavic and other styles is now mockingly known as \u201cDonetsk Rococo,\u201d a reference to the former president\u2019s war-ravaged home city.A court finally ruled in June that the state had a right to take the whole property, declaring that a series of murky deals transferring the Soviet-era compound to private ownership were all illegal. But efforts to oust Mr. Tarachkotelyk have all come to nothing.The prosecutor general meanwhile has declared the entire property \u201cmaterial evidence\u201d in a criminal investigation into Mr. Yanukovych, which means that nobody is supposed to touch it until Mr. Yanukovych comes to trial, an unlikely prospect as he has been hiding in Russia since late February.\u201cThis is all just a political game by people who want to take away Mezhyhirya for themselves,\u201d Mr. Tarachkotelyk said. \u201cWe are protecting it for the people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Fashion Week Guide: Whom and What to Know", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnbuttonedShowtimeWhile you can\u2019t blame fashion\u2019s ever-increasing move into entertainment on Ari Emanuel, the fact that the Hollywood agency William Morris Endeavor, which Mr. Emanuel co-runs, bought IMG last December, and along with it ownership of New York, London and Milan fashion weeks (among others), is surely speeding along the transformation. As it happens, Mr. Emanuel will be in the New York Fashion Week audience this season (the William Morris folks tell me he is very excited to come to shows) in part because fashion week\u2019s contract with Lincoln Center ends after next February, and the powers that be are beginning to think about what shape it will take next. In the meantime Mr. Emanuel should not feel too much like a fish out of water, as this season a number of collections are taking an alternative approach to their presentations that may seem more familiar to him than to the fashion pack. (Maybe they are thinking of it as an audition?)The London designer Gareth Pugh, for example, who normally shows in Paris, is coming to New York as part of the Lexus Design Disrupted program, and promising \u201can immersive live performance\u201d to open the week on Thursday. It\u2019s unclear exactly what that means (you have to see it to understand, I guess), but according to the designer, it will involve dancers and video.Then, on Sunday, a mere few days after Mr. Pugh\u2019s happening, Opening Ceremony will debut a 30-minute one-act play directed and co-written by Spike Jonze, featuring their costumes \u2014 sorry, collection. And on Monday, there\u2019s a double bill. First, Olivier Saillard, the curator of the Palais Galliera in Paris, the city\u2019s fashion museum, is putting on a piece of performance art in conjunction with the Alliance Francaise and MADE Fashion Week. Entitled \u201cModels Never Talk,\u201d it will feature seven French supermodels telling stories about extraordinary dress they have worn \u2014 giving voice to fashion\u2019s normally voiceless. Next, a few hours later, Polo Ralph Lauren will hold an unspecified \u201cfashion event\u201d (note: not show) in Central Park.Forget the often complained about reality-TV-ification of fashion week courtesy of the street style craze; this takes the concept to a whole different level. It\u2019s like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d versus \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201dNames to KnowIn New York, Michael Herz will debut his first runway collection as artistic director for Diane von Furstenberg. Mr. Herz was formerly co-creative director of Bally, and he met Ms. von Furstenberg when he curated her 40th anniversary \u201cJourney of a Dress\u201d exhibition in Los Angeles. This is something of a watershed moment for her \u2014 post-anniversary, she has an autobiography being released this autumn, and a reality TV show on E! \u2014 and one of the questions hovering over the brand is what happens next. The show, to be held Sunday, may provide some answers.Also bowing behind-a-brand in New York this season is Anthony Vaccarello at Versus Versace, the latest hipster name to collaborate with the brand, a.k.a. be crowned as a hot-up-and-comer by Donatella Versace. In this, the 30-something Belgian-Italian designer, who shows his namesake line, known for its \u201880s-edged micro-hemlines and slick tailoring, in Paris, follows J.W. Anderson and Christopher Kane, both of whom have now hooked up with luxury conglomerates (LVMH and Kering respectively). Draw your own conclusions.Meanwhile, industry watchers will also be looking for answers at Proenza Schouler, thanks to recent rumors \u2014 thus far unsubstantiated \u2014 that LVMH is interested in buying a stake in the brand. If one of the group\u2019s well-known executives were to show up in the audience, it would likely set off a firestorm of renewed speculation.In London, eyes will be on Christopher Bailey, making his debut as both chief executive and chief creative officer at Burberry. At issue: whether the added pressures of being a chief executive have had any effect on the aesthetic direction of the brand. In the game of Who\u2019s Wooing Who? Simone Rocha, known to be a designer atop the wish list of many a large group, will likewise have an audience to watch (ooh ... is that a Kering talent spotter I see? An LVMH executive?). And it will be interesting to parse the difference LVMH mentorship and money (300,000 euros) has made for Thomas Tait, recipient of the Group\u2019s first Young Designers Prize.As for Milan, the new name on the schedule, or behind an old name on the schedule, is Jil Sander\u2019s Rodolfo Paglialunga, who has the unenviable task of reviving a house that became something of a fashion punch line when its founder left last October for the third time (an anonymous team designed the collection for autumn/winter). His only competition for buzzy-generating brand of the week is, perhaps surprisingly, Roberto Cavalli, whose long journey toward selling a minority stake appears to finally be coming to fruition. Will some new investors be in the front row? This is the question.Which brings us to the last leg of the marathon (phew!) otherwise known as Paris. There the debuts to watch will be Jonathan Anderson at Loewe, where a wholesale revamp and up-tiering of the brand seems to be underway; David Koma at Thierry Mugler; and Julie de Libran at Sonia Rykiel. All three are tasked with breathing new life into floundering names whose to-ing-and-fro-ing under various designers for the last few seasons has been meaningfully eroding their brand equity.Finally, a farewell of sorts will take place at Herm\u00e8s, where Christophe Lemaire will reveal his swan song for the brand (he is leaving to concentrate on his own line). He hasn\u2019t been there that long \u2014 only four years \u2014 and he never really rocked the aesthetic Birkin boat, so audience tears will probably not be forthcoming \u00e0 la Tom Ford departure from Gucci, but they will be watching the faces of the family members Axel Dumas (chief executive) and Pierre-Alexis Dumas (artistic director) to try to understand whether Mr. Lemaire left on the best, or slightly less salubrious, terms. Fittingly, it is the last big show of not only Paris, but the whole season.

The Atlantic Club closed in January. Showboat\u2019s turn came on Sunday. Revel will be dark by sunrise Tuesday. And on Sept. 16, Trump Plaza will close.Local and state leaders, their rescue attempts in tatters, are now wondering whether the city\u2019s future lies in a return to its roots as a traditional seaside resort.\u201cMy mother and father used to bring my sister and I on the boardwalk back in the \u201940s,\u201d said Sue Dell, a bartender who lost her job at Showboat\u2019s House of Blues restaurant after 12 years. \u201cWe would get dressed up, and it was different. It isn\u2019t like it is today.\u201dMs. Dell, 66, cried as she recalled selling her house in nearby Egg Harbor Township after receiving a layoff notice in June.\u201cI thought, well, if I don\u2019t have a job I won\u2019t be able to afford my mortgage, so I hired a real estate agent and I put my house up for sale and it sold in one day,\u201d she said. \u201cI lived there for 11 years.\u201dSince then, Ms. Dell has been living with her 91-year-old mother in Ocean City, N.J. But on Wednesday she is flying to Florida for a week to look for a job as a bartender. She loves her work and does not want to retire, she said.Despite the pain of uprooting, she is glad she sold her house when she did. These days, her neighborhood is full of \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs at properties owned by other laid-off casino workers, she said.Ms. Dell said she had been coping with her job loss.

But he had no specific plans for what to do next.\u201cI opened this place, and now I\u2019m going to close it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling too good about it.\u201dDespite the bad economic news, some see the reduction in casino capacity as an opportunity to strengthen the city\u2019s remaining businesses.\u201cThis I call a shakeout.

It could be the beginning of a better day.

{"Headline": "Number of Children Living in Poverty Drops Sharply, Census Bureau Reports", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The poverty rate declined last year for the first time since 2006, the Census Bureau reported on Tuesday. But at the same time, it said, there was no statistically significant change in the number of poor people or in income for the typical American household.The report showed significant improvements for children. The poverty rate for children under 18 declined last year for the first time since 2000, the bureau said, and the number of children in poverty fell by 1.4 million, to 14.7 million.Over all, the bureau said, 14.5 percent of Americans were living in poverty last year, down from 15 percent in 2012. Charles T. Nelson, a Census Bureau official, said the decline in the poverty rate resulted partly from an increase in the number of people working full time year-round. In particular, he said, the numbers show an increase in employment and earnings for parents with dependent children.Poverty thresholds vary with the size and composition of a family. A family of four was classified as poor if its income was less than $23,830 last year; for one person, the threshold was $11,890.The official poverty levels are updated each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The income figures do not reflect the value of noncash benefits like food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare and public housing. Nor do they include capital gains or the effects of taxes and tax credits.The official poverty rate indicates the number of poor people as a share of the total population. The rate can decline without a significant change in the number of poor people if the total population has grown.Median household income in the United States was $51,940 last year, the bureau said. This was not statistically different from median income in 2012, after adjustment for inflation. The number of households with income above the median is the same as the number below it.Many households have not regained the purchasing power they had before the recession that began in December 2007. Median household income was 8 percent lower last year than in 2007, and the poverty rate was two percentage points higher.\u201cThe typical family has still not seen its income recover from the deep recession, which came on top of a decade in which incomes stagnated for the middle class, itself part of a longer-term trend of increasing income inequality,\u201d said Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.The poverty rate is much lower than the 19 percent of 50 years ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson declared \u201cunconditional war on poverty.\u201d But it is higher than it was in the 1970s, when the rate dropped as low as 11.1 percent.\u201cIf this report tells us anything, it\u2019s that we can do better,\u201d said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee. \u201cThe status quo simply isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, said congressional Republicans were partly responsible because, he said, they were \u201cblocking legislation that would raise the minimum wage, ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work and help Americans repay college loans.\u201dOne-fifth of all American households had incomes of $105,910 or more last year, the Census Bureau said, and the top 5 percent had incomes of $196,000 or more. But median household income was still 8.7 percent below its peak in 1999.The Census Bureau adopted a new set of questions in an effort to measure health insurance coverage more accurately. Using the new method, the bureau estimated that 42 million people, accounting for 13.4 percent of the population, were uninsured for all of 2013. These figures are not directly comparable with prior years\u2019 data on health insurance, or with estimates in surveys by other federal agencies. The National Center for Health Statistics, for example, said the number of Americans without health insurance had declined substantially in the first quarter of this year, in part because of the expansion of coverage under the Affordable Care Act.The center said that the number of uninsured Americans had fallen by about 8 percent, to 41 million people, in the first quarter of this year compared with 2013, a drop that represented about 3.8 million people.The Census Bureau report was based on interviews with 68,000 households chosen to be representative of the country. It also included these findings:\u25a0 The number of men working full time year-round increased by 1.8 million last year, and the number of women working full time throughout the year increased by one million.\u25a0 Households headed by women with no husband present had less than half the income of married couples\u2019 households: $35,150 versus $76,500.\u25a0 For Hispanic households, median income increased 3.5 percent, to $40,960. This was the first increase for Hispanics since 2000. However, for non-Hispanic white, black and Asian households, income showed no significant change in 2013.\u25a0 Among major racial and ethnic groups, only Hispanics experienced a significant change in their poverty rate (down two percentage points, to 23.5 percent last year). The number of Hispanics in poverty fell to 12.7 million, a reduction of 870,000.\u25a0 Median income for households headed by noncitizens rose 6 percent last year, to $40,580. There was no significant change in income for households headed by United States citizens, whether native-born ($52,780) or naturalized ($54,970).In addition, the bureau said, nearly 20 million people lived in families with incomes below half the poverty level. One-third of them were children.Data in the report showed the powerful effects of government benefit programs. In the absence of Social Security, it said, the number of people 65 and older in poverty would have been nearly 15 million higher last year. If food stamps had been counted as income, 3.7 million fewer people would have been classified as poor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fed Signals No Hurry to Raise Interest Rates", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve is in no hurry to raise interest rates. The economic recovery has stayed on course in recent months, and the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee said on Wednesday that it saw no reason to change its own plans, rejecting calls for a faster retreat from its long-running stimulus campaign.\u201cThere are still too many people who want jobs but cannot find them, too many who are working part time but would prefer full-time work, and too many who are not searching for a job but would be if the labor market were stronger,\u201d the central bank\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said at a news conference.The Fed also on Wednesday published a description of the plans for the next phase in its slow retreat from its policy to encourage economic growth, including some expected changes in the mechanics of monetary policy.But it added that it planned to continue the mainstay of its campaign, holding short-term interest rates near zero, for a \u201cconsiderable time.\u201d The phrase is generally understood to mean that the Fed does not intend to raise rates before the middle of next year. Walking a tightrope, Ms. Yellen emphasized both that a rate increase was not imminent and that the Fed could act sooner. The timing, she said repeatedly, would be determined by data on the actual course of the economy in the coming months.\u201cThat really is so important for market participants to keep in mind,\u201d she said.Bond investors, the Fed\u2019s primary audience, drove up yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond to 2.6 percent. Stock markets fell sharply in the moments after the Fed released its various statements, then rose sharply, then called the whole thing off. The S.&P. 500-stock index ended the day up 0.13 percent at 2,001.57. The Fed appeared to be playing for time, delaying decisions about its next steps for as long as possible as it grapples with the limits of its ability to improve economic conditions. Fed officials downgraded their expectations for growth in 2015 in forecasts published at the same time as the policy statement, suggesting that they had once again overestimated the strength of the recovery.Officials now expect the economy to grow from 2.6 to 3 percent next year, compared with June forecasts for growth of 3 to 3.2 percent.Despite the disappointing results, officials have generally concluded this is not a reason for the Fed to increase its efforts, but instead evidence that the potential output of the American economy has been permanently reduced by the Great Recession and by long-term problems like an aging population and reduced innovation.If the Fed pushes too hard, unsustainable growth could eventually generate faster inflation. If it stops pushing too soon, however, damage that could have been repaired by additional stimulus may last indefinitely: Many people who could have found jobs might never return to the work force.Ms. Yellen spent much of her news conference on Wednesday avoiding questions about this balance, often taking considerable time to say very little.Still, simply by holding steady, the Fed is prolonging its effort to improve economic conditions, and supporters of the campaign applauded. Critics warned \u2014 as they have for several years \u2014 that the Fed was doing too much, with potential consequences including inflation and financial instability. The House on Wednesday passed a Republican bill intended to limit the Fed\u2019s flexibility by requiring it to adopt a rule for making monetary policy, and to explain its deviations. The measure was not expected to progress in the Democrat-controlled Senate.The Fed committee acted by a vote of 8 to 2. Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, argued that economic conditions had improved sufficiently for the Fed to signal it could begin to retreat more quickly.\u201cThe growing dissent in voting reflects the increasing disagreement amongst the F.O.M.C. that the Fed chair has been trying to iron out, regarding how much more accommodation the economy still needs to a sustain a robust recovery,\u201d said Michael Dolega, senior economist at the TD Bank Group.Yet the dissent also obscures the extent of broad agreement within the committee about the course of monetary policy. Of the 17 officials who participate in the policy-making meetings (some of whom do not hold votes this year), all but two predicted that the Fed would raise rates before the end of 2015.The forecasts also showed relatively little change in the level officials expect interest rates to reach by the end of 2015, although comparisons were muddled by a change in methodology and in the committee\u2019s membership.A series of long meetings led by Ms. Yellen has produced an agreement on the mechanics of the eventual retreat.The Fed in recent decades has influenced economic conditions primarily by raising and lowering an interest rate called the federal funds rate. Banks must hold reserves in proportion to their loans, and they sometimes must borrow reserves to remain in compliance. By adjusting the supply of reserves, the Fed controls the price of these loans \u2014 and influences a broad range of other interest rates.But the Fed has flooded the banking system with excess reserves as it buys bonds from banks and credits their reserve accounts. The Fed said on Wednesday that when it came time to tighten financial conditions, it would continue to describe its actions in terms of the familiar funds rate. It will primarily seek to discourage lending, however, by raising the interest rate that banks are paid on excess reserves. In effect, instead of punishing lending, it will reward abstinence.The Fed said that it also would seek to suppress economic activity when the time came by borrowing money from other kinds of financial companies under a new program it has been testing for the last several years. Some Fed officials have concerns about broadening the Fed\u2019s role in financial markets, however, and the Fed said it would keep the use of the new program to a minimum.The central bank also affirmed that it planned to maintain its bond holdings, by replacing matured bonds, until after it starts to raise interest rates. It said that it then planned to allow its holdings to dwindle naturally, without asset sales.The Fed issued a similar exit plan in 2011, only to find that the economy disappointed its expectations. A government report on Wednesday offered a reminder that the economy remains weak. The Fed regards 2 percent annual inflation as the healthiest pace for the economy, but inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index rose just 1.7 percent in the 12 months ended in August \u2014 and the Fed prefers a separate measure that shows even less inflation than the price index.Moreover, the forecasts of Fed officials published on Wednesday showed that most now expect inflation to remain below 2 percent during 2015. Nonetheless, Ms. Yellen suggested the Fed had done what it could.\u201cWe have been at zero for a very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cIn a general sense I think we have been lower for longer than many standard policy rules would suggest.\u201dThe internal debate is now between officials, led by Ms. Yellen, still willing to wait a considerable time before raising interest rates, and those who want to move sooner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Financial Schemes Against the Elderly Are Increasing", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringWHEN a longtime friend asked for a loan to help get her boyfriend back on his feet, Maria Voltl, 84, decided to help. Ms. Voltl had lent money to her friend before, and it had always been paid back. So without consulting a professional, she handed over $500,000.Now Ms. Voltl is regretting her generosity. None of the money, which was her retirement nest egg, has been repaid \u2014 even after a judgment against the couple.\u201cI treated my friend like a daughter,\u201d said Ms. Voltl, of Sparks, Nev. \u201cShe said she\u2019d take care of me. Then she sold me out.\u201dAs a result, Ms. Voltl lives near the poverty line. She shops at Goodwill, no longer travels and bought a cheaper car with better gas mileage. \u201cMy last nice years are ruined,\u201d she said.Financial crimes against elders are taking a toll on lives and pocketbooks. And trusted caregivers \u2014 the friends and relatives who offer support and guidance \u2014 are often the ones at fault, according to legal and financial specialists. The over-65 segment is expected to grow to 20 percent of the total United States population by 2050 from 13 percent today, according to the Census Bureau, and financial abuse is expected to rise in tandem, draining hard-won retirement money.In New York, which has the third-highest population of seniors in the United States, the number of financial abuse cases is expected to surge by 2030, according to the New York State Office of Children and Family Services estimates.Older adults are appealing \u2014 and vulnerable \u2014 targets. \u201cThey have a lot of money that was saved over the years,\u201d says Tiffany Couch, the founder of Acuity Forensics, a forensic accounting firm in Vancouver, Wash. They are also usually debt-free and own their homes. As dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s rates climb, the elderly may also be increasingly incapable of protecting themselves from fraud.Their caregivers may be dealing with a lot of debt and pressure, and suffering through a bad economy, Ms. Couch said. So they may decide to use an elder\u2019s money to shore up their own finances.\u201cThe people stealing from us are never the ones we think will do it,\u201d said Ms. Couch, whose own financial abuse cases have been increasing. \u201cThey could be a trusted friend, family member or caretaker. And their typical defense is that \u2018They were going to die anyway, so I thought I\u2019d get my inheritance.\u2019 \u201d Financial abuse of the elderly has no income boundaries, said Leslie Rice-Albrecht, a retired detective with the San Diego Police Department. \u201cThe abused elder can be someone on a fixed income or someone worth millions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut money is always at the root, one way or another.\u201dThe Brooke Astor case is an all-too-familiar example of financial elder abuse in which one person was given control of assets, Ms. Couch said. Mrs. Astor\u2019s son, Anthony Marshall, was convicted in 2009 of defrauding his socialite mother of tens of millions of dollars, using some of it to buy a yacht and other luxuries. Mr. Marshall had also been given power of attorney, in which a caretaker has control over another person\u2019s financial transactions, and where financial abuse can occur unseen.\u201cPower of attorney gives 100 percent access of an elder\u2019s bank accounts to a single person with no oversight,\u201d Ms. Couch said. \u201cWhen that happens, there isn\u2019t much that you can do.\u201dThose all-important keys to the financial kingdom can allow a caretaker to steal money easily. The crimes often begin with the theft of smaller items like jewelry and blank checks. Later, larger items are stolen, according to a MetLife Mature Market Institute study. Caretakers or guardians might sign over a house deed to themselves or liquidate assets. If the smaller crimes are not detected, they increase over time, Ms. Couch said.\u201cThese financial ruses can be called pre-grave robbing,\u201d said Gary Altman, founder of the estate planning law firm Altman & Associates. \u201cThe will may be changed at the last moment or power of attorney used to take someone\u2019s assets.\u201dThe actor Mickey Rooney was also said to be the victim of pre-grave robbing by his stepson, who had been given power of attorney. The stepson had taken over Mr. Rooney\u2019s finances, said Bruce Ross, a Los Angeles-based trial lawyer at Holland & Knight. He then began draining millions of dollars from Mr. Rooney\u2019s accounts, according to published reports. When the actor died in April, he was broke and in debt, Mr. Ross said.In testimony to Congress, Mr. Rooney urged abused elderly people not to stay silent as he had. Victims should speak out and get help, specialists say. Adam Fried, a partner at Reminger law firm in Cleveland, urged people to contact their lawyer and a state Adult Protective Services agency. \u201cIt\u2019s their job to protect the elderly population,\u201d he said.In the end, prevention is crucial.Practice good oversight of anyone who has power of attorney, Ms. Couch said, since the problem can be discovered just by regularly checking bank statements. \u201cDon\u2019t give away the keys to the kingdom,\u201d she added. \u201cOnce people have access to your accounts, not much can be done.\u201dMs. Couch advised older adults to have one other person look at bank statements and canceled checks. \u201cYou can have your kids, accountants or financial advisers do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many cases, someone writes a check to themselves, and that can be flagged.\u201dHave checks and balances in place, Mr. Altman said. Examples include having co-trustees for irrevocable trusts that hold assets and co-agents under the power of attorney \u2014 both of which give added protection. \u201cAlso, having a guardian or conservator appointed can be useful,\u201d he said.Once financial abuse happens, though, cases are rarely punished, specialists said. The defrauded person may be afraid of looking foolish or causing anguish in the family. \u201cSeniors are afraid that they\u2019ll lose their independence,\u201d said Janet Carruthers, an accountant at Sterling Money Management in Virginia. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to call the police.\u201dAs Ms. Voltl, who still has not told one of her sons about losing her nest egg, said: \u201cI was embarrassed about doing such a stupid thing. Even my friends don\u2019t know about the swindle.\u201dAbuse is underreported and many cases do not come to light, Mr. Ross said. But enough do that courts are overwhelmed with cases, which can slow resolution.California is one of the few states with strong elder abuse laws, Ms. Rice-Albrecht said. Offenders can be fined or sent to prison for defrauding older adults.Many other states require the elderly to cooperate in prosecuting fraud, including making a statement, Ms. Rice-Albrecht said. \u201cSo the elderly person has to leave home and go to court,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if there\u2019s a conviction, the person usually doesn\u2019t even get a harsh sentence, even though the elder\u2019s entire life savings can be wiped out.\u201d\u201cYet when the money is gone, it\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAn elderly person can\u2019t go back to work.\u201d Often, she added, the defrauded person doesn\u2019t live much longer after the financial loss.The red flags signaling financial abuse can include abrupt changes in bank accounts, unexplained withdrawals or altered legal documents, specialists said. \u201cWatch for sudden changes in finances,\u201d said Jim Ian, a financial planner at Barnum Financial Group in Connecticut. \u201cThey can include selling large blocks of stocks or taking an unnecessary tax liability.\u201dAlso, watch for caregivers who want to isolate the elderly person from others, Mr. Ross said.Ms. Voltl is less trusting than before. Her motto now is, \u201cGod, please protect me from my friends.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Revisiting the Lehman Brothers Bailout That Never Was", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, time was running out to answer a question that would change Wall Street forever.At issue that September, six years ago, was whether the Fed could save a major investment bank whose failure might threaten the entire economy.The firm was Lehman Brothers. And the answer for some inside the Fed was yes, the government could bail out Lehman, according to new accounts by Fed officials who were there at the time.But as the world now knows, no one rescued Lehman. Instead, the firm was allowed to collapse overnight, a decision that, in cool hindsight, let problems at one bank snowball into a full-blown panic. By the time it was over, nearly every other major bank had to be saved.Why, given all that happened, was Lehman the only bank that was not too big to fail? For the first time, Fed officials have offered an account that differs significantly from the versions that, for many, have hardened into history.Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman at the time, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury Secretary, and Timothy F. Geithner, who was then president of the New York Fed, have all argued that Lehman Brothers was in such a deep hole from its risky real estate investments that Fed did not have the legal authority to rescue it.But now, interviews with current and former Fed officials show that a group inside New York Fed was leaning toward the opposite conclusion \u2014 that Lehman was narrowly solvent and therefore might qualify for a bailout. In the frenetic events of what has become known as the Lehman weekend, that preliminary analysis never reached senior officials before they decided to let Lehman fail.Understanding why Lehman was allowed to die goes beyond apportioning responsibility for the financial crisis and the recession that cost millions of ordinary Americans jobs and savings. Today, long after the bailouts, the debate rages over the Fed\u2019s authority to bail out failing firms. Some Fed officials worry that when the next financial crisis comes, the Fed will have less power to shield the financial system from the failure of a single large bank. After the Lehman debacle, Congress curbed the Fed\u2019s ability to rescue a bank in trouble.Whether to save Lehman came down to a crucial question: Did Lehman have enough solid assets to back a loan from the Fed? Finding the answer fell to two teams of financial experts at the New York Fed. Those teams had provisionally concluded that Lehman might, in fact, be a candidate for rescue, but members of those teams said they never briefed Mr. Geithner, who said he did not know of the results.\u201cMy colleagues at the New York Fed were careful and creative, and as demonstrated through the crisis that fall, we were willing to go to extraordinary lengths to try to protect the economy from the unfolding financial disaster,\u201d Mr. Geithner said Monday in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cWe explored all available alternatives to avoid a collapse of Lehman, but the size of its losses were so great that they were unable to attract a buyer, and we were unable to lend on a scale that would save them.\u201dMr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson said in recent interviews with The Times that they did not know about the Fed analysis or its conclusions.Interviews with half a dozen Fed officials, who spoke on the condition they not be named, so as not to breach the Fed\u2019s unofficial vow of silence, suggest some Fed insiders believed that the government had the authority to throw Lehman Brothers a lifeline, even if the bank was nearly broke. The Fed earlier came to the rescue of Bear Stearns, after doing little analysis, and only days later saved the American International Group. The government subsequently saved the likes of Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Ultimately, whether Lehman should have gotten Fed support was a judgment call, not a matter of strict statute, these people said.\u201cWe had lawyers joined at our hips,\u201d said one participant. \u201cAnd they were very helpful at framing the issues. But they never said we couldn\u2019t do it.\u201dAs another participant put it, \u201cIt was a policy and political decision, not a legal decision.\u201dThe account from the New York Fed officials provides new insight into a dangerous moment in Wall Street history. Countless financial figures \u2014 from Wall Street chiefs to government policy makers \u2014 have said that allowing Lehman to die the way it did was a misjudgment that inflicted unnecessary pain.\u201cThere is close to universal agreement that the demise of Lehman Brothers was the watershed event of the entire financial crisis and that the decision to allow it to fail was the watershed decision,\u201d Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Fed, wrote in his history of the financial crisis, \u201cAfter the Music Stopped.\u201d\u201cThe Fed has explained the decision as a legal issue,\u201d Mr. Blinder said in an interview. \u201cBut is that true or valid? Is it enough? Those are important questions.\u201dWhether the Fed should have tried to save Lehman is still a subject of heated debate. And it is unclear whether the firm could have been rescued at all.What happened that September was the culmination of circumstances reaching back years \u2014 of ordinary people too eager to borrow, of banks too eager to lend and of Wall Street financial engineers reaping multimillion-dollar bonuses. Even so, saving Lehman from complete collapse might have shielded the economy from what turned out to be a crippling blow. And as the subsequent rescue of A.I.G., the insurance giant, demonstrated, a rescue could have included substantial protections for taxpayers.Back in 2008, the Fed possessed broad authority to lend to banks in trouble. Section 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act provided that \u201cin unusual and exigent circumstances\u201d the Fed could lend to any institution, as long as the loan was \u201csecured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve Bank.\u201d In the eyes of the Fed, that means a firm must be solvent and have adequate collateral to lend against, and making that determination was the responsibility of the New York Fed, the regional Fed bank that had begun to assume responsibility for Lehman. On that September weekend, teams from the New York Fed were told to assess Lehman\u2019s solvency and collateral.Whether and how much the Fed could lend Lehman depended on those teams\u2019 findings, although the final decision rested with Mr. Geithner, Mr. Bernanke and the Federal Reserve Board.In recent interviews, members of the teams said that Lehman had considerable assets that were liquid and easy to value, like United States Treasury securities. The question was Lehman\u2019s illiquid assets \u2014 primarily a real estate portfolio that Lehman had recently valued at $50 billion. By Lehman\u2019s account, the firm had a surplus of assets over liabilities of $28.4 billion.Others had already taken a stab at valuing Lehman\u2019s troubled assets. Kenneth D. Lewis, then the chief executive of Bank of America \u2014 who, with the government\u2019s encouragement, was considering a bid for Lehman \u2014 asserted that Lehman had a \u201c$66 billion hole\u201d in its balance sheet.A group of bankers summoned to the Fed by Mr. Paulson, who was hoping they would mount a private rescue, did not accept Lehman\u2019s $50 billion valuation for its real estate and could not decide whether Lehman was solvent. But potential private rescuers had a motive to lowball Lehman\u2019s value. Fed officials involved in the valuation stressed that the Fed could hold distressed assets for much longer than private parties, allowing time for those assets to recover in value. Also, because the Fed sets monetary policy, it exerts enormous influence over the assets\u2019 ultimate value.\u201cThere can\u2019t be any reasonable doubt that had the Fed rescued Lehman, that very act would have pushed up the value of its assets,\u201d Mr. Blinder said.While the Fed team did not come up with a precise value for Lehman\u2019s illiquid assets, it provided a range that was far more generous in its valuations than the private sector had been.\u201cIt was close,\u201d a member of the Fed team that evaluated the collateral said. \u201cFolks were aware of how ambiguous these values are, especially at a time of crisis. So it becomes a policy question: Do you want to take a chance or not?\u201dArgument continues today over the value of Lehman\u2019s assets. A report compiled by Anton R. Valukas, a Chicago lawyer, at the behest of the bankruptcy court overseeing Lehman concluded in 2010 that nearly all of the firm\u2019s real estate valuations were reasonable. It also suggested that Lehman\u2019s chaotic bankruptcy caused many of the losses later borne by the firm\u2019s creditors. Other analysts have argued that Lehman was deeply insolvent.Ultimately, the appraisals of the New York Fed teams did not matter. Their preliminary finding was that Lehman was solvent and that what it faced was essentially a bank run, according to members of the group. Researchers working on the value of Lehman\u2019s collateral said they thought they would be delivering those findings to Mr. Geithner that September weekend.But Mr. Geithner had already been diverted to A.I.G., which was facing its own crisis. In the end, the team members said, they delivered their findings orally to other New York Fed officials, including Michael F. Silva, Mr. Geithner\u2019s chief of staff.On Sunday, Mr. Bernanke was in Washington awaiting the New York Fed\u2019s verdict. In a phone call, Mr. Geithner said Lehman could not be saved.On Feb. 22, the Federal Reserve released the transcripts of the 2008 meetings of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. The transcripts provide a detailed account of some of the Fed\u2019s key decisions during that crisis year.The Fed would be lending into a run, Mr. Geithner told Mr. Bernanke, according to both men\u2019s accounts. In a recent interview, Mr. Bernanke said, \u201cKnowing the potential consequences of Lehman\u2019s failure, I was 100 percent committed to doing whatever could possibly and legally be done to save the company, as were Tim and Hank.\u201d Mr. Paulson has concurred, saying, \u201cAlthough it was Ben and Tim\u2019s decision to make, I shared their view that Lehman was insolvent, and I know the marketplace did.\u201dThose at the Fed who have contended that Lehman was insolvent have never provided any basis for that conclusion, other than references to the estimates of Wall Street firms and other anecdotal evidence. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked for such evidence several times, but the Fed never provided it. The members of the New York Fed teams said that they did not prepare a formal, written report, and that no one asked them for any notes or work papers or asked them to elaborate on their findings. Scott G. Alvarez, the Fed\u2019s general counsel, told the commission that there was \u201cno time\u201d that weekend for a written analysis.Phil Angelides, the crisis commission\u2019s chairman, said no one ever mentioned the New York Fed analysis during his hearings. \u201cIf in fact the analysis existed and was independent, it would have been in everyone\u2019s interest to have that out, even if it were in the form of notes,\u201d Mr. Angelides said in an interview. He added, \u201cIf you look at the record, there is no legal stopper,\u201d meaning a legal barrier.So why, then, was Lehman allowed to die?Mr. Paulson has said that politics did not enter into the decision. But he had endured months of criticism for bailing out Bear Stearns in March 2008, and the outcry only intensified after the Treasury provided support to the mortgage finance giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in the first week of September. During a conference call on the Thursday before Lehman\u2019s collapse, Mr. Paulson declared to Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner and other regulators that he would not use public money to rescue Lehman, saying he did not want to be known as \u201cMr. Bailout.\u201dIn written testimony before Congress that September, Mr. Bernanke made no mention of any legal constraint. Instead, he said, \u201cWe judged that investors and counterparties had had time to take precautionary measures.\u201dIt was only on Oct. 7, after early praise for the decision to let Lehman fail had turned into a wave of criticism, that anyone mentioned the legal argument. In a speech that day, Mr. Bernanke said, \u201cNeither the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve had the authority to commit public money in that way.\u201d Mr. Paulson first mentioned the claim a week later. In an interview, Mr. Bernanke said, \u201cWe made a deliberative decision to be very cautious about publicizing our inability to save Lehman out of concern that it would further worsen the market panic.\u201d Mr. Paulson made the same point. Mr. Bernanke was emphatic before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2009: \u201cI will maintain to my deathbed that we made every effort to save Lehman, but we were just unable to do so because of a lack of legal authority.\u201dMr. Bernanke and others have said that a Fed lifeline to Lehman might not have stopped the run on the firm. But others have said the point of Rule 13-3 was exactly that \u2014 to stop such panics.\u201cOf course the Fed can stop a run,\u201d said Mr. Blinder, the economist. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201dScholars are still struggling with the claim that the Fed could not rescue Lehman but was nonetheless able to save Bear Stearns and A.I.G.What is clear to Mr. Blinder, he says, is that the decision was a formula for panic.\u201cThe inconsistency was the biggest problem,\u201d Mr. Blinder said. \u201cThe Lehman decision abruptly and surprisingly tore the perceived rule book into pieces and tossed it out the window.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Under Pressure, Ukraine Leader to Seek Aid on U.S. Visit", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Seeking elusive military and economic aid from the United States, President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine headed to North America on Tuesday, while also facing increasingly skeptical questions both here and abroad about the slow pace of change.A White House meeting with President Obama and an address to a joint session of Congress on Thursday are likely to generate fresh moral support, if little else, for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.\u201cIt is a clear sign of solidarity and support from the United States,\u201d Pavlo Klimkin, the foreign minister, said in a brief interview before leaving.Photo opportunities alone are enough to help Mr. Poroshenko domestically, although given its raft of problems, Ukraine would like more. Winter looms with gas supplies from Russia cut off; it is unclear that limited self-rule for Russian-backed separatists regions is enough to satisfy the Kremlin; and the country is spending itself toward bankruptcy.Ukraine\u2019s leaders tried to put a celebratory face on new laws pushed through Parliament on Tuesday, even if they were mostly symbolic at this stage. One ratified closer economic and political ties with Europe, while the second tried to cement a recent truce with the separatists by supporting temporary self-rule for the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. \u201cWe are fixing the 350-year-old mistake: Ukraine is Europe,\u201d Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, the prime minister, told Parliament, known as the Rada. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that this agreement is sealed with blood. But that was the choice. That was the price of independence.\u201d\u201cThere are too many signs of politics as usual, Ukrainian style,\u201d Thomas O. Melia, the deputy assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Law, said at a weekend conference here.The February overthrow of Viktor F. Yanukovych, the previous president, and the May presidential election were expected to usher in a transition period to address significant issues of corruption and economic reform, he noted.\u201cSo that is where we are after six months? We almost have our first major law through the Rada, but not yet,\u201d Mr. Melia said.\u201cIn order to keep the coalition intact to defend Ukraine from military aggression, you have to make progress on the domestic reforms,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not two different battles; it is the same battle. If the domestic institutions and habits don\u2019t get fixed now, then the consensus and support for defending Ukraine against Russian aggression will disappear.\u201dMr. Poroshenko sought to portray the laws passed Tuesday as triumphs for Ukraine. But in reality Russia holds the keys to both. Because of Kremlin opposition, the measure on forging closer economic ties with Europe will be delayed for at least 15 months. The autonomy measures will be meaningless without Russian approval, since Ukraine does not actually control the territory addressed by the law. Separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk reacted by stressing that they would still seek independence.Political critics accused the government of abandoning the southeast in the face of Russian aggression, with the death toll above 3,000 people. Russia denies direct involvement, but President Vladimir V. Putin seems bent on keeping Ukraine destabilized to prevent it from moving out of Moscow\u2019s orbit.In an embarrassing blow to the Ukrainian president, Parliament failed to pass what Mr. Poroshenko had advertised as the cornerstone of his anti-corruption campaign: laws meant to establish an anticorruption bureau.\u201cThe bribes start with payments to the local doctor and end with bribes to the president,\u201d said Tamara Trafenchuk, a retiree who was touring the opulent estate built by the former president, Mr. Yanukovych, on Kiev\u2019s outskirts. \u201cWe want more decisive steps on corruption and economic reforms.\u201dIn their own defense, government officials have said they are trying to carry out a herculean task: delivering radical reforms while fighting a war, even as the economy collapses. A gas dispute with Russia and lack of coal from the separatist areas means winter fuel supplies are uncertain.The International Monetary Fund, which has agreed to lend Ukraine about $18 billion over two years, estimates that the economy will shrink by more than 6.5 percent this year.The top Democratic and Republican senators on the Foreign Relations Committee introduced a proposal to increase aid to Ukraine and impose more sanctions on Russia. The bill will be voted on by the committee within hours of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s speech to Congress, according to its sponsors, Senators Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee.But Mr. Obama is not expected to go beyond the $70 million in training and nonlethal aid like night vision goggles that has already been pledged. Given the deepening crisis, Ukrainian political leaders issue frequent calls for national unity. But each key leader is running a separate slate for Parliament. Some analysts have suggested that the war might actually abet the reform process, because military veterans will insist on reforms so that their fellow soldiers will not have died in vain. \u201cIf you want to die for this country, you will work honestly in Parliament,\u201d said Capt. Pavlo Kyshkar, a candidate on the slate of an independent party.Advertisement"}

But her case also underscores a vexing problem facing New York State as it forges ahead with its ambitious plan to roll out Las Vegas-style casinos.The Newburgh plan is one of six casino sites proposed in Orange County, a tantalizing location because it is 40 to 60 miles northwest of New York City with its thick, rich vein of tourists and residents.But building casinos in Orange County would likely doom, or severely undercut, any proposals in counties farther north in the Catskills, where elected officials have long sought the economic boost from jobs and tourism that state officials argue a casino would produce.On the one hand, he said, the state wants to help distressed communities and promote tourism.But then there is a cold economic reality: A casino close to New York City, which could draw on its 8.4 million residents and 50 million tourists, is likely to be the most successful in an increasingly competitive environment, especially with New Jersey now considering allowing casinos just across the Hudson River, in Jersey City and the Meadowlands.\u201cWe can\u2019t make a decision in a vacuum,\u201d Mr. Law said. \u201cWe need to take into consideration what\u2019s happening in other states.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you the facts,\u201d said Mr. Etess, who is a partner in a proposed $500 million casino resort on the grounds of an old Catskill resort outside Monticello in Sullivan County. \u201cIf you put a casino in Orange County, there will not be a casino in Sullivan County that will be able to provide the stimulus for the type of growth that the region needs.\u201dDevelopers of two other casinos in Sullivan County have already dropped out of the licensing contest, complaining that the Orange County proposals have made it hard to get financing. That left Mr. Etess, and two other development groups with Catskill proposals.But Empire Resorts said it would slash its own investment from $450 million to $277 million if the state grants a license in Newburgh or to either of two other sites in northern Orange County, and cut it even more, to $172 million, if a license is granted to any of the three sites proposed for southern Orange County.The bitter competition between casino proponents in the Catskills and Orange County has set up a peculiar dynamic. The typical scenario when a community is hoping to lure a new business is to promote its best features: an educated work force, a good transportation network, beautiful scenery.But the battle for casinos, jobs and tax revenues has become like a beauty pageant in reverse: communities are jockeying to put their worst foot forward to show just how badly they need a casino.Proponents in Sullivan County say they have the highest unemployment rate of any surrounding county, 8.9 percent, a low per capita income level of $24,462 \u2014 compared to $30,397 in Orange County \u2014 and a declining number of businesses. The unemployment rates put forward do not always correspond to current state Department of Labor data, but it\u2019s clear that both areas are in need.For decades, the Catskills were a haven for vacationers, many of them Jewish, who sought a summertime refuge from their sweltering New York City neighborhoods. But beginning in the 1970s, the area fell out of favor and many of the hotels and bungalow colonies of the borscht belt collapsed.Residents in the Catskills like to point out that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo all but promised a casino there last November, when he flew to Sullivan County shortly after voters approved the state\u2019s plan for full-scale casinos. \u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d he told a cheering crowd, adding: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to fundamentally change the economy of the Catskills.\u201dStill, if a central argument for a casino is economic need, then a strong case could be made that no place in New York State is worse off than Newburgh, this bedraggled riverside city.\u201cIt\u2019s been 50 years of downhill,\u201d Mayor Kennedy said. \u201cWe are in as desperate shape as Sullivan County ever dared to be.\u201dAfter the manufacturers moved out and the factories closed, Newburgh took on a hollow feel. Hundreds of buildings were leveled in the 1960s and 1970s, but promised urban renewal projects failed to materialize. A nearby mall sucked much of the life out of the city\u2019s downtown shops.More than one in four of the city\u2019s 28,500 residents live below the poverty line. The unemployment rate is 8.7 percent.Four years ago, Newburgh garnered national headlines as a tiny city overrun by gangs and violence after heavily armed law enforcement officers swept through Newburgh in a series of synchronized raids, arresting members of the Bloods on charges of murder, robbery, possession of firearms and conspiracy to distribute drugs.Newburgh is still trying to live down its crime-ridden image. The city\u2019s homicide rate is down, according to the police chief, Michael D. Ferrara, but there were still 30 shootings in the first six months of the year.\u201cWe purposely selected the site because of the economic demographics and its geographic location,\u201d said James D. Featherstonehaugh, an owner of the Saratoga Casino and Raceway.Mr. Featherstonehaugh and others bidding in northern Orange County also make an argument calibrated to address the fears of elected officials in the Catskills: Their sites are less likely to have an impact on the fortunes of a Catskills casino than those in southern Orange County, they say.The Newburgh location, which is off Interstate 87 well north of the Route 17 turnoff for the Catskills, is therefore much less likely to siphon off customers, Mr. Featherstonehaugh said.While the bidders and local officials make their arguments, and state officials weigh them, people who have already invested in Newburgh try to manage their own expectations.The Hudson Valley project would be \u201ca shot in the arm for the city, something even a factory couldn\u2019t do,\u201d said Vincent Cappelletti, a developer who started buying property in Newburgh 10 years ago. A building on Broadway that he bought when it was nearly empty is full now, but with social services agencies. \u201cThere are so many different jobs that a casino could provide, from entry level to hotel management,\u201d he said.Benny Papaleo, who owns a number of apartment buildings and an auto body shop, moved to Newburgh 25 years ago from Brooklyn because property prices were so low. He has been awaiting its revival ever since. He said a casino \u201cwould push us in the right direction.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen developers come and go,\u201d said Amber Zachary, who grew up here. \u201cThe big thing is jobs \u2014 jobs for natives of the city of Newburgh.\u201dAsked about a casino, Ms. Zachary shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re always fed a dollar and a dream,\u201d she said.The Buy-In: Articles in this series are examining\nthe ramifications of New York\nState\u2019s embrace of casino gambling.Advertisement"}

As a child, she endured mercury poisoning, malaria, hepatitis and leishmaniasis, a flesh-eating disease caused by sand-fly bites, creating health problems that she still deals with today.As a teenager, she entered a Roman Catholic convent to become a nun, but left to work as a maid in the home of civil servants in Rio Branco, Acre\u2019s capital. After completing a high school equivalency program, she went to a public university in Acre, participating in a radical theater troupe with ties to Trotskyist groups.As a politician, Ms. Rousseff is often referred to in Brazil as a \u201cdevelopmentalist,\u201d a nod to policies aggressively seeking to harness Brazil\u2019s natural resources, from iron ore to offshore oil, to expand the economy under the sway of huge state companies.Ms. Silva, who was environment minister when Ms. Rousseff was chief of staff in the Lula government, supports a far bigger role for renewable energy sources like solar, wind and biomass, while prioritizing the protection of the Amazon rain forest.The fact that Brazil\u2019s presidential race has been narrowing to two women from the Lula government who opposed military rule reflects the consolidation of Brazil\u2019s democracy since the 1980s. But each has also had to make significant compromises, showing how that democracy tends to moderate leaders with radical origins.Ms. Silva has distanced herself from the Workers Party\u2019s handling of the economy, which went into recession this year, by luring advisers with more market-friendly policies, like relaxing controls on energy prices. She chose a politician with close ties to agribusiness groups as her running mate.Ms. Silva also differs considerably from much of the leftist establishment in her religious faith. She stunned her own family in 1997 when she converted to evangelical Christianity, undergoing what she called a \u201cmystical experience\u201d while dealing with severe health problems related to her mercury poisoning.\u201cThe hardened Communist militant became a religious believer,\u201d the journalist Mar\u00edlia de Camargo C\u00e9sar wrote in Ms. Silva\u2019s authorized biography. \u201cMarina\u2019s friends, even her own husband, turned up their nose when they learned the news.\u201dIn this year\u2019s election, Ms. Silva has reached out to Brazil\u2019s surging number of evangelicals, who account for about 22 percent of the population. But she has also come under criticism from opponents who say she would alter the secular underpinnings of government.Some have seized on reports that Ms. Silva practices \u201cbiblical roulette,\u201d essentially opening the Bible to a random passage for inspiration during difficult decisions.Close associates of Ms. Silva have rushed to her defense.\u201cIt is absurd to think that Marina could put Brazil on a fundamentalist path,\u201d said Valnice Milhomens, an evangelical leader. \u201cMarina never even joined the evangelical bloc,\u201d she added, referring to evangelical legislators in Congress who often veer to the right on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage.Ms. Silva has not emphasized her ethnicity or humble origins much during the campaign. Instead, she has opted for a diffuse message of \u201cnew politics\u201d needed to thwart the Workers Party and the centrist Brazilian Social Democracy Party, organizations that have dominated national politics for two decades.The strategy reflects the huge protests that shook Brazilian cities in 2013 and revealed broad loathing for a political system that lifted millions from poverty this century but also neglected festering problems like corruption and inadequate schools and hospitals.\u201cSome things they got right, but they got a lot of other things wrong,\u201d said William Souza, 42, an air-conditioning technician, referring to the Workers Party, in power since 2003. \u201cTheir time is up.\u201dHer moderation goes beyond politics. Ms. Silva, the mother of four children, abstains from red meat, seafood, milk products and alcohol. She is known to abhor iced drinks and air-conditioning, literally making some people sweat when they meet with her.Big challenges to Ms. Silva\u2019s candidacy persist. Ms. Rousseff\u2019s campaign has a $55 million war chest, about five times what Ms. Silva has. Attack ads have already sowed some doubts about Ms. Silva, halting her rise in the polls.Ms. Silva has revealed little about how she would handle Brazil\u2019s prominent diplomatic profile, largely avoiding issues like the close ties Ms. Rousseff\u2019s government has maintained with Cuba and Venezuela. \u201cServants always remember the life of their masters,\u201d Ms. Silva said. \u201cThe opposite is rarer to occur.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Get It Wrong", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt seems to me, however, that it\u2019s important to realize that the enormous intellectual failure of recent years took place at several levels. Clearly, economics as a discipline went badly astray in the years \u2014 actually decades \u2014 leading up to the crisis. But the failings of economics were greatly aggravated by the sins of economists, who far too often let partisanship or personal self-aggrandizement trump their professionalism. Last but not least, economic policy makers systematically chose to hear only what they wanted to hear. And it is this multilevel failure \u2014 not the inadequacy of economics alone \u2014 that accounts for the terrible performance of Western economies since 2008.Still, many applied economists retained a more realistic vision of the world, and textbook macroeconomics, while it didn\u2019t predict the crisis, did a pretty good job of predicting how things would play out in the aftermath. Low interest rates in the face of big budget deficits, low inflation in the face of a rapidly growing money supply, and sharp economic contraction in countries imposing fiscal austerity came as surprises to the talking heads on TV, but they were just what the basic models predicted under the conditions that prevailed postcrisis.You might say that this is just human nature, and it\u2019s true that while the most shocking intellectual malfeasance has come from conservative economists, some economists on the left have also seemed more interested in defending their turf and sniping at professional rivals than in getting it right. Still, this bad behavior has come as a shock, especially to those who thought we were having a real conversation.But would it have mattered if economists had behaved better? Or would people in power have done the same thing regardless?If you imagine that policy makers have spent the past five or six years in thrall to economic orthodoxy, you\u2019ve been misled. On the contrary, key decision makers have been highly receptive to innovative, unorthodox economic ideas \u2014 ideas that also happen to be wrong but which offered excuses to do what these decision makers wanted to do anyway. I\u2019m not saying either that economics is in good shape or that its flaws don\u2019t matter. It isn\u2019t, they do, and I\u2019m all for rethinking and reforming a field. The big problem with economic policy is not, however, that conventional economics doesn\u2019t tell us what to do. In fact, the world would be in much better shape than it is if real-world policy had reflected the lessons of Econ 101. If we\u2019ve made a hash of things \u2014 and we have \u2014 the fault lies not in our textbooks, but in ourselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Obama Calls for Minimum Wage Rise and Equal Pay as Elections Approach", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILWAUKEE \u2014 President Obama on Monday renewed his call to raise the federal minimum wage and to protect the right to equal pay for women as the midterm elections come into sight.In spite of opposition from Republicans, Mr. Obama said, addressing a crowd of about 6,000 people gathered in Milwaukee at a festival hosted by the local A.F.L.-C.I.O., his goal is to make sure all Americans can meet simple goals, like being able to pay their bills and send their children to school.\u201cThere is no denying the simple truth: America deserves a raise,\u201d he said.Hailing examples set by employers like Kentucky State University, whose president took a pay cut to give raises to his lowest-paid workers, Mr. Obama said Congress needed to catch up to the businesses and other institutions \u2014 as well as 13 states and the District of Columbia \u2014 that have already acted to raise their minimum wage.Countering arguments that raising the minimum wage would reduce jobs, Mr. Obama said states that had not waited for the federal government to raise their wages had seen more job growth than those that had not raised their wages.During his brief stop \u2014 he was in Milwaukee for about two hours \u2014 Mr. Obama expressed optimism about the nation\u2019s economic recovery, emphasizing the progress made since the 2008 collapse, which happened about two weeks after he first spoke at this labor festival as a presidential candidate. He highlighted that nearly 10 million jobs have been added in the last four and a half years, and that the unemployment rate has been improving.\u201cBy almost every measure, the American economy and American workers are better off than when I took office,\u201d Mr. Obama said.The president urged Americans not to listen to those who would have them believe that voting would not do them any good.\u201cDon\u2019t buy it, because despite the cynics, America\u2019s on the move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s making progress.\u201dAccompanied by Thomas E.

{"Headline": "Versace Helps a Restoration", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis Friday, Versace is opening a new boutique in Milan\u2019s more-than-a-century-old landmark, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the latest example of luxury houses helping to refurbish historic sites throughout Italy. Versace is calling it a major event, and not just because the store opens the same day that its spring 2015 collection hits the runway. The boutique\u2019s opening is part of a renovation project of the entire Galleria that Versace is helping to underwrite.The fashion house will spend 1.5 million euros, or $1.94 million, to refurbish the Galleria, a four-story double arcade that was constructed in the mid-19th century near the famous Duomo. Prada has contributed \u20ac1.5 million as well. The project is to include restoring more than 14,000 square meters, or about 150,000 square feet, of the Galleria\u2019s internal facade. In its own boutique, Versace has already refurbished the original ornamentation. The renovation is expected to be finished by April 2015. And why are the two fashion houses contributing money to the Galleria, known mostly for its shopping and restaurant options?\u201cWe feel responsible culturally,\u201d said Gian Giacomo Ferraris, the chief executive of Versace. \u201cWe feel socially responsible. This is the right moment.\u201dWith the Italian economy sputtering, luxury houses have taken it upon themselves to invest and help refurbish historic sites throughout the country. And this effort has not been without some skepticism among preservationists and historians. There is a fear of rampant commercialism, especially in a country where it has only recently become common for companies to contribute to public projects. Tod\u2019s is giving \u20ac25 million toward the restoration and renovation of the Colosseum in Rome. It previously pledged more than \u20ac5 million to the La Scala opera house in Milan. Fendi provided more than \u20ac2 million to restore the Trevi Fountain in Rome, where Bulgari has given \u20ac1.5 million to refurbish the Spanish Steps. And Salvatore Ferragamo is providing \u20ac600,000 to aid a renovation at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Versace is just the latest to contribute, and it is in good position to do so. The company had revenue of \u20ac479 million last year, an increase of 17 percent from the previous year. The fashion house also has some additional money to play with. Earlier this year, the Blackstone Group purchased a 20 percent stake in the fashion house, for about \u20ac210 million. Part of that investment involves opening more stores. Blackstone valued the house at about $1.4 billion. Mr. Ferraris said that 40 percent of the house\u2019s revenue now came from accessories, up from just 20 percent five years ago. And with Versace\u2019s recent good fortune (the company became profitable again in 2011), it can spend.\u201cFive years ago the company was not in this state economically,\u201d Mr. Ferraris said. \u201cNow we can invest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "World Events Muffle Democrats\u2019 Economic Rallying Cry", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongressional MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Just outside the Capitol, two Democratic senators running for re-election stood last week before a few dozen labor-aligned supporters and local high school students with posters declaring \u201cAmerica Needs a Raise\u201d to make another pitch for increasing the minimum wage \u2014 a cornerstone of the party\u2019s midterm economic message.The event generated little momentum for the issue and little coverage for Senators Al Franken of Minnesota and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. But it did emphasize a larger, unintended point: The Democrats\u2019 strategy of making an increase in the minimum wage a midterm election rallying cry has been drowned out by world events. The party continues to talk about it, but it appears that few are listening.\u201cIt is because of what is happening in the Middle East,\u201d conceded Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a third Democrat present and a longtime leader on progressive labor issues.Events overseas have undermined Democrats\u2019 strategy to tie their midterm prospects to an economic theme that includes calls for a higher minimum wage, reducing income inequality, pay equity for women and help with college tuition. Instead, the public and Congress have been overwhelmed this summer by a border crisis, an Ebola outbreak in Africa and, most notably, the terrorist threat from the Islamic State, also known by the acronym ISIS.Democrats, pointing to President Obama\u2019s effectiveness in drawing an economic contrast with the Republican Mitt Romney in 2012 and to the 2006 midterm races in which they took over the House and the Senate, still believe the strategy is sound. \u201cI think the Democrats\u2019 economic message has a lot of resonance, but it has been difficult to break through the focus on foreign policy issues,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee and a former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.While Democratic candidates in some contested states are still seen as making headway with the economic argument, its diminishing punch nationally is threatening to make the final two months of the campaign more about Mr. Obama\u2019s droopy approval ratings \u2014 a risky proposition, particularly for Democrats defending seats in red states where the president\u2019s standing is abysmal.\u201cHis ability to project those issues in these races has been limited by the competing realities,\u201d Mark Mellman, a top Democratic pollster, said of Mr. Obama\u2019s faltering focus on economic issues. \u201cThe press is much more interested in what he\u2019s saying about ISIS than what he is saying about the minimum wage.\u201dDan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president, agreed that the urgent need to deal with the terrorist threat this summer had largely derailed the president\u2019s push, which began in earnest last spring, to help Democrats define the election as a choice between two competing economic visions. He said the president\u2019s Democratic allies in the Senate had also struggled to stick to their game plan.\u201cThere is no question that the national conversation has been around issues other than the national economic condition,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said. \u201cIt makes it harder to get the debate on the economic issue.\u201dSix months ago, strategists in the West Wing and their counterparts on Capitol Hill had high hopes for a coordinated, poll-tested plan to use the president\u2019s national megaphone and the Democrat-controlled Senate to repeatedly put Republicans on the defensive on what Mr. Obama and his allies call pocketbook issues. They saw few other options given controversy over the health care law and little movement on other big proposals.The idea was to schedule a series of economic-themed speeches by the president, closely timed with Senate votes on the same subject. On April 30, Mr. Obama gathered an audience in the East Room of the White House to deliver an aggressive attack on Republican opposition to increasing the minimum wage. At the same time, the Senate forced a vote on an increase to $10.10 per hour \u2014 a proposal that was immediately blocked by Republicans.\u201cEither you\u2019re in favor of raising wages for hardworking Americans, or you\u2019re not,\u201d the president declared in April, taking aim at Republicans in his event. \u201cThey won\u2019t raise wages for millions of working families when three-quarters of Americans support it? That makes no sense.\u201dBut Democrats also saw signs that the issue lacked potency back in March when a major internal research project for House Democrats found that the push on the minimum wage was not by itself a sufficient contrast with Republicans.Yet even now, Democrats say economic issues are working in some races, though not on the national stage. Embattled candidates in Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina have pushed the pay equity message particularly strongly in an effort to build on their advantage with female voters. And in Iowa, Democrats have successfully used ads about the minimum wage to blunt a surge by Joni Ernst, the Republican Senate candidate, according to Democratic strategists.But the Democratic candidates are largely on their own, weighed down by an increasingly unpopular president who is now mired in questions of war and terrorism. Instead of helping to create a national environment that plays to Democratic strengths on the economy, Mr. Obama is the focal point of a serious and uncertain political topic.Mr. Pfeiffer said it remained unclear how the president\u2019s call to wage a new war against militants in Iraq and Syria would affect Democratic candidates this fall. He said that Mr. Obama had little choice but to shift his focus away from the elections.\u201cWhen you\u2019re president, challenges come and you have to meet them,\u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to pick the cards you are dealt.\u201dRepublicans say they see no evidence that the economic push by individual Democratic candidates is delivering the results that Mr. Obama needs to make sure that his party hangs on to the Senate this November.\u201cI think it has pretty much fallen flat,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. \u201cPeople see it as an election-year stunt, and it is.\u201dOfficials still maintain there will be plenty of time for Mr. Obama to make the economic arguments, and they said he had never been scheduled to campaign aggressively for individual Democratic candidates until October.Democrats say they will push ahead with the themes, and Mr. Harkin, who is retiring this year, said he hoped the Senate would hold at least one more minimum wage vote.\u201cI think the voters have the right to know as they go into the election on this vital issue who is for raising the minimum wage and who is not,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Does Scotland Want Independence? It\u2019s Culture vs. Economics", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Question of IdentityIf you had told someone in 2012 that in just two years the eurozone would remain bonded together but the United Kingdom might not, they would have thought you insane. But here we are.It\u2019s been a good three centuries, but now Scotland may want out of the United Kingdom.The latest polling on the referendum, to be held Sept. 18, points to a narrow edge for Scots who wish to pull out of the state that they have been part of since 1707 and go it as a nation of their own. Previous polls, by contrast, had given the edge to those who wish for Scotland to remain part of Britain. Both betting markets and forecasting groups are now putting the odds that Scotland will pull away and form its own state at something like 30 percent.What\u2019s all the more remarkable about this possible secession is that major, specific grievances over public policy between Scotland and the rest of Britain are hard to identify. This isn\u2019t like the Southern chunk of the United States seceding in 1860 because it was committed to slavery and the North was against it.Sure, the pro-independence leaders make some promises about improving social welfare benefits like improved public child care for young children. But that doesn\u2019t square particularly well with the fact that Scotland has been a net drain on the rest of British taxpayers for the last generation; it has received greater benefits than it has paid in taxes. And whatever long-term arrangements are reached over thorny issues like oil rights, divvying up public debt and currency arrangements between the Independent Scotland and the \u201crump U.K.,\u201d as British commentators have been calling the possible post-secession nation, there is sure to be a heavy transition cost and damage to commerce in the near term.One could point out that Britain as it exists today is the very model of a liberal democracy, that Scots are amply represented in Parliament, and that they have a great deal of control over day-to-day governance within their borders. The government has offered to expand those rights of local control over taxes and public administration if Scotland sticks with Britain. But it may not be enough.That\u2019s where these bigger questions of what makes a modern state come into play.If you start with Thomas Hobbes\u2019s philosophy enunciated in \u201cLeviathan\u201d that governments exist to bring order to the chaotic state of nature that would prevail in their absence \u2014 \u201cthe life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d \u2014 then the size of the state is ultimately a practical question. By definition, to have a government at all is to relinquish some of the freedom we might have as individuals to some larger purpose, in hopes that with rule of law we will have a peaceful, more prosperous society. Give up some autonomy, but gain wealth and longevity. Not a bad trade.But it\u2019s a lot easier to give up that autonomy when you are giving it to people who look like you and talk like you. And yet, it\u2019s hard for a democratic institution to channel the collective wishes of hundreds of millions of people into one coherent set of policies without making any subset of those people so angry they want to scrap the whole thing.The idea of government started small, with essentially extended families, then villages ruled by a local strongman. But over time, the overwhelming trajectory of history is toward larger and larger government entities.In the 18th century, it was the creation of what is now the United Kingdom out of England, Scotland and Wales (and, presently, Northern Ireland). In the 19th century, it was the expansion of the United States to span a continent and the centralization of smaller states into what are now the nations of Germany and Italy. In the 20th century, it was the creation of the European Union, in which people from Finland to Portugal share a common market and common currency.There are examples that cut the other way, like the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, but those are examples of countries held together by authoritarian force proving unable to hold together when that force weakens. Among democracies, the march has been toward greater scale and reach, at the cost of less distinct national identity. There have been flare-ups of resentment in these large democracies, from the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois of Canada to anti-E.U. parties in France to modern-day secessionists in the United States. But none have come as close to getting their wish as the Scots will in just over a week.The economic and geopolitical advantages of being a larger country offer some advantages that a small country cannot match. It\u2019s no accident that the United States is the richest country in the world, creator of some of the most meaningful technological advances of the last century; it is not for nothing that Europeans who speak different languages and have different cultures have tried to emulate it with the E.U.In big countries, businesses can get all the benefits of scale, selling within giant markets that all use the same currency with the same legal system. In geopolitics, large countries can strike hard bargains to get access to one another\u2019s markets, while trouncing smaller rivals at the negotiating table.And big countries tend to be more resilient to shocks. Imagine how much economic trouble the Republic of Louisiana would have been in after Hurricane Katrina or the Independent Nation of New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.If Scotland chooses to go independent, it will shed the advantages that come from being part of a relatively large global power (Britain\u2019s population: about 64 million. Scotland\u2019s population: about 5 million) for the chance to be governed by people with whom they share a deeper cultural affinity.Paradoxically, pro-independence Scots have argued that they will recapture some of the advantages of size by joining the European Union. It seems slightly bonkers for Scots to get so frustrated about ceding power to bureaucrats in London and turn immediately to bureaucrats in Brussels, but there it is.They may find challenges. Scots may want to be able to sell Lagavulin 16 Scotch in Germany without tariffs, or take a vacation to Italy without having to go through passport control. But as a small country they will have less negotiating leverage in sorting out the terms of E.U. membership than Britain had.The Scottish referendum isn\u2019t just about whether a few million Scots will govern themselves. It is a fight over the world of multicultural modernity that makes today\u2019s global economy possible, but also leaves many people with a deep hunger for the sense of national identity it obliterates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How a Lopsided Recovery Fueled the Dollar-Store Wars", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyMatthew Guzman has been shopping at the FamilyDollar store in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, since he was a kid, but lately something feels different. The service has gotten worse, the lines have grown longer and shoppers have responded accordingly. \u201cIt used to be packed here,\u201d Guzman told me on a recent Saturday. \u201cBut it died out.\u201d Guzman, who finished high school this year and makes $9.50 an hour as an assistant manager at an outsourcing company, ought to be right in Family Dollar\u2019s core customer group. But that day, he opted out. Cringing at the $4.25 price tag on a broom, he walked across the street to a local 99-cent store instead.Small decisions like Guzman\u2019s have piled up of late, saddling Family Dollar with a string of disappointing quarters, declining sales and shrinking profits. Facing pressure from shareholders, the company sought to sell itself, leading to a war between bidders that has riveted Wall Street.The retailer agreed this summer to be acquired by another discount chain, Dollar Tree, for $8.5 billion. But less than a month after that deal was signed, the industry leader, Dollar General, offered to pay $8.9 billion. Dollar General was rebuffed; Family Dollar\u2019s board argued that a merger would draw the ire of antitrust regulators \u2014 the businesses, it said, are too similar. (Unlike Dollar General and Family Dollar, Dollar Tree is a \u201ctrue\u201d dollar store, which sells almost everything for $1.) In response, Dollar General raised its offer to $9.1 billion. When that bid was rejected, Dollar General went hostile, taking its offer directly to Family Dollar shareholders, who have until Oct. 8 to decide whether to tender their shares.Shoppers have plenty of complaints about Family Dollar these days, but corporate America seems desperate to buy it. This apparent paradox starkly illustrates how lopsided and puttering our economic recovery has been.There are two secrets to running a successful discount chain: manage costs by bargaining with suppliers, and keep prices low by watching the competition and selling off-brand products. Since its founding in 1959, Family Dollar tried to position itself just below Walmart on price. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to us whether miniskirts are in or out,\u201d Howard R. Levine, the current chief executive and the son of the founder, told Fortune magazine in 1985. \u201cIt is our competition that keeps going upscale, and all they have done is left us a bigger gap to fill.\u201d The company was conservative and sensitive to its customers\u2019 finances; it did not start accepting credit cards until 2006.For chains with super-low prices, downturns actually help increase sales. The economic recessions of the early \u201990s and early \u201900s were a boon for Family Dollar and other discount retailers. The most recent recession was particularly bountiful for Family Dollar, delivering still more affluent shoppers to its stores. But in the years since the recession ended, the company faced a choice: Should it continue to seek the lowest possible prices? Or should it abandon its frugal past and court its new, modestly wealthier clientele?It opted for change. In 2012, using a technique more often found in supermarkets, Family Dollar sent out waves of print circulars to promote temporary discounts, while raising other prices to offset them. It also added more national brands and introduced tobacco products. As the stores became more like supermarkets, they began to lose their identity as places for a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d style of shopping. \u201cYou become more like a Walmart,\u201d said Willy C. Shih, a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. \u201cDo you want to play in that field?\u201dIf Family Dollar did, it was a mistake. The company\u2019s operating profit margin fell to 6.6 percent in 2013 from 7.3 percent in 2011. Its core customers did not like the back and forth of the discount game. Late last year, the company reversed course, putting up signs to emphasize its \u201ceveryday low prices,\u201d but it was too late. Come summer, Family Dollar was for sale. \u201cWe lost our way,\u201d Levine acknowledged at a conference in April this year.It\u2019s as much a tale of corporate hubris as it is of a recovery that has yet to arrive for many. In recent years, a soaring stock market and the rise in home prices have helped the rich regain their footing, but these trends have been useless to low-income Americans who don\u2019t own such assets. Between 2010 and 2013, the bottom 20 percent of American households by net worth experienced a 7 percent decline in median income, according to the Federal Reserve. As its shoppers fell on harder times, Family Dollar aimed higher \u2014 and is now paying the price.Now the three major dollar stores are playing a game of musical chairs in their efforts to merge, and all are seeking the same outcome: increased scale, and with that the ability to cut costs, pressure suppliers and drive prices even lower. Emerging from the recession has also been tough for Family Dollar\u2019s competition, raising the stakes of the merger war substantially. According to Anthony Chukumba, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, this merger is a \u201cmust have\u201d for Dollar General.\u201cIt\u2019s like the worst of both worlds for the dollar stores,\u201d Chukumba said. \u201cThey\u2019d much rather have a really good economy or a really bad economy. The economy\u2019s good enough that your middle-income consumers have traded back up, but it\u2019s not so good that your lower-income consumers are feeling better.\u201dWilliam Alden is a writer for The New York Times\u2019s\nDealBook.Advertisement"}

For more than three millenniums, human civilization has reorganized nature to suit its tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s as if aliens appeared with megamallets and laser chisels and started resculpting every continent,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve turned the landscape into another form of architecture; we\u2019ve made the planet our sandbox.\u201dMs. Ackerman leads us on a brisk tour of this sandbox and its crumbling sand structures. There are pr\u00e9cis on transcontinental green belts, de-extinction, mariculture, nanotechnology, robotics and epigenetics, written in vivid, exuberantly figurative prose.

It is telling that Ms. Ackerman\u2019s central image, of a young orangutan at the Toronto Zoo playing on an iPad, is seen as cute, rather than a perversion of nature. She describes the rapid rise in global temperatures as merely a \u201clow-grade fever\u201d that \u201cwon\u2019t be tragic everywhere and for every species.\u201d\u201cA warmer world won\u2019t be terrible for everyone,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s bound to inspire new technologies and good surprises, not just tragedy.\u201d Greenland, for instance, \u201cwill have nice farmland,\u201d and milder winters will \u201crequire less heating, which saves on energy.\u201d Elsewhere Ms. Ackerman writes that \u201cthere\u2019s often little harm done by nudging plants and animals to new locales,\u201d adding that she finds \u201chorses a wonderful addition to the North American landscape.\u201dShe\u2019s right: There will be some cool new technologies. Horses are a nice addition to our continent, and I do look forward to lower heating bills.The essay is written from the vantage point of 2093, and the simple act of writing about the present in the past tense makes their account of our current situation even more chilling than their imagined future. \u201cThe consequences of [our] actions were not only predictable but predicted,\u201d they write. \u201cThe people of Western civilization knew what was happening to them but were unable to stop it.

{"Headline": "Roosevelts to the Rescue", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Obama presidency is mired in mediocrity, his and ours. Foreign policy is cribbed and cautious, moving along with a deliberative pace our do-it-now society doesn\u2019t tolerate. At home, Obama\u2019s greatest achievements \u2014 health care for millions, and raising an economy from the dead while Europe couldn\u2019t get out of the grave \u2014 are almost unknown.He can blame a nut-job Congress, about to get even nuttier and more intransigent with the November elections. He can blame poor communications from his shop, and carnivorous right-wing media that would devour Mother\u2019s Day were Obama to propose it now. But really, how tough does the 44th president have it?For the answer, Obama should join the rest of the nation in time-traveling later this month when PBS airs a seven-part series on the Roosevelts \u2014 Theodore, Franklin, and his distant cousin and wife, Eleanor.What do we know about the Roosevelts? That we have national parks and Social Security because of two patricians with voices and vocabularies that would not pass the average-guy test of today. That historians rank both men among the top five presidents of all time. That the rights of African-Americans and women would not have advanced much at midcentury without a first lady who worried most that she wasn\u2019t loved by anyone.Panama Canal, dug. Trusts, busted. Great Depression, ended. Nazi Germany and imperial Japan, defeated. Child labor, banished. The tag lines of success are familiar. Less well known, perhaps, is how much both Roosevelt men had to overcome. Their personal hardships would be career-ending for lesser men. And in the face of howling political opposition, the two presidents took a reluctant country to places where it wasn\u2019t yet ready to go.The lessons for Obama and the rest us pop from the screen in the Ken Burns film \u201cThe Roosevelts: An Intimate History,\u201d his most ambitious and deeply moving documentary since \u201cThe Civil War.\u201d (Disclosure: I was featured in a Burns film on the Dust Bowl.)Barack Obama has written about his own struggles to find his place, after being abandoned by a father he never knew, and missing his peripatetic mother. Consider the Roosevelts, from a family haunted by bouts of \u201cmelancholy.\u201d Asthmatic, frail and sickly as a boy, Teddy lost his young wife and his mother on the same day. Franklin was stricken with polio before his 40th birthday. He would never walk again without the aid of others. Steel braces that locked at the knees, and the terror of navigating around a podium, would be routine and painful parts of his days from then on.Eleanor faced a lifetime of ridicule about her looks, most pointedly from her domineering mother-in-law Sara, who once told her, \u201cIf you\u2019d just run a comb through your hair you\u2019d look so much nicer.\u201d Living at the emotional border of her own marriage, she was a presidential nag with a conscience.The black hole of grief felt by Teddy was filled with new purpose after he left New York for a ranch in the West. Franklin, a sunny-sider and backslapper, developed a deep empathy for people down on their luck after realizing he could not live life without help from others. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve spent two years trying to wiggle one toe, everything is in proportion,\u201d he said.Tragedy, humiliation and loss are the building blocks of these giants, as the Burns story shows. A lifetime of comfort, more often than not, is no path to greatness.Don\u2019t expect Obama to be a Roosevelt. He doesn\u2019t seem comfortable around strangers or fellow politicians. Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, John F. Kennedy, T.R. and F.D.R. were naturals. Obama can deliver a terrific speech and has a first-rate intellect. But making music from the messy notes of politics is not in his character. He\u2019s never learned to use his personal narrative to advance his policies.But he can learn something from the Roosevelts about the mechanics of politics. The bully pulpit (a term T.R. basically invented) has been in the closet, gathering dust, for most of Obama\u2019s presidency. Teddy loved to call out his enemies. A political pugilist, he sometimes gave 20 speeches a day on behalf of his progressive agenda. When a man fired a shot at him in 1912, he continued to speak for nearly an hour, even with a bullet lodged between his ribs and his shirt bloodied. It was an occupational hazard of the trade, he remarked.Beyond the outsize personality, T.R. advanced great notions \u2014 public land, a right to clean air, water and food, protections for workers, restraints on big business. As a Republican, Teddy was well ahead of his time, and faced strenuous opposition by a reactive coalition that is the modern equivalent of today\u2019s Republican Party.His Democratic cousin did the same thing with a minimum wage and Social Security (socialism!), and moved an isolationist nation along, gradually, to see that the Nazi war machine had to be stopped. He also never shied from a fight. \u201cThey are unanimous in their hate for me,\u201d he said of his opponents in 1936, \u201cand I welcome their hatred.\u201dObama\u2019s opponents hate him as well, with the added strain of racism, which makes it hard for him to confront them directly without stirring up things that have nothing to do with his policies.No moment in politics is frozen. Just in the last few days, Obama has shown that he\u2019s trying to find his way out of a rudderless summer. Thursday\u2019s call with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain to press NATO to confront the Islamic State psychopaths was a small echo of the old Roosevelt-Churchill two-step that helped save the world. ISIS is not Nazi Germany. But it must be crushed.On Russia, Obama had strong words in Estonia on Wednesday, pledging to back the Baltic States. He should carry these initiatives through the NATO. summit meeting in Wales, and emerge with a long-term strategy. \u201cThis is a moment of testing,\u201d he said.As president, you get only a few real moments of testing \u2014 times when the right judgment can make a difference in history. If Obama needs more prodding from the evanescent Roosevelt ghosts, he should remember that both of them died relatively young \u2014 T.R. at the age of 60, F.D.R. at 63.\u201cDeath had to take him sleeping,\u201d one politician said of Teddy\u2019s passing, \u201cfor if Roosevelt had been awake there would have been a fight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo and Rob Astorino came face to face here on Friday.Mr. Astorino, a Republican who is the Westchester County executive, showed up unannounced for a speech by Mr. Cuomo to a statewide business group, staking out the entrance of a hotel ballroom in an effort to force a handshake upon the governor.The governor, a Democrat, returned the favor during his remarks, denouncing the high property taxes in Westchester, as Mr. Astorino stood at the side of the room, an impassive look on his face.The uneven playing field between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Astorino was palpable here as the Business Council of New York State convened for its annual meeting. Business leaders, a natural constituency for an aspiring Republican politician, showered Mr. Cuomo with approval. Mr. Astorino spoke to the group on Thursday night, pleading with attendees to rethink their fondness for the governor.Mr. Astorino called his speech a \u201creality check.\u201d The crowd cheered longer for Mr. Cuomo.The race for governor hinges in large part on how voters perceive New York\u2019s economic fortunes. Mr. Astorino is spending his time railing against oppressive taxes that he says are driving businesses and residents to flee; Mr. Cuomo, seeking a second term, is showcasing his record of turning an imposing deficit into an impressive surplus, and cutting taxes along the way.In a pair of speeches that offered a comparison of their economic views, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Astorino sounded as if they were discussing different states.Flipping through a slide presentation filled with numbers and charts, Mr. Cuomo pointed to the private-sector jobs created during his time in office and upgrades to the state\u2019s credit rating. He offered plans for dividing up billions of dollars in surplus revenue, suggesting it go toward areas like aid for upstate economic development and incentives to encourage local governments to consolidate. He highlighted some of his marquee programs, including regional councils to help dole out economic development grants around the state, as well as the creation of tax-free zones at college campuses that are meant to attract new businesses. He predicted the tax-free program, Start-Up NY, would be \u201cthe greatest economic savior for upstate New York.\u201d\u201cOver all,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, \u201cthe state economy is night and day from where we started.\u201dThe governor, whom some liberal activists have accused of favoring the state\u2019s corporate class, proudly invoked what he called \u201cthe battle I\u2019ve had with the teachers\u2019 union over the past four years,\u201d and bragged that he had reduced the state work force to its smallest size in more than 50 years.Mr. Astorino has spent months bemoaning the state\u2019s economic climate. In his speech, he cited rankings showing New York at the bottom of the heap compared with other states, and questioned why business executives were not complaining as loudly as he was.\u201cYou have the clout \u2014 the power \u2014 to demand better, yet you reward leaders who, at best, are managing the steady decline of New York,\u201d Mr. Astorino said.\u201cWhoever gets elected gets the business community\u2019s support in New York, and rarely your criticism,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone is afraid to offend the governor\u2019s office, state legislative leaders, City Hall. In elections, as soon as it looks like a winner is emerging from the pack, the money pours in to that candidate \u2014 regardless of the candidate\u2019s economic views.\u201dMr. Astorino, grinning, positioned himself inside the entrance to the ballroom where Mr. Cuomo was set to speak, ensuring the governor would run into him.About 10 minutes passed as Mr. Astorino waited, along with a crowd of journalists.When Mr. Cuomo finally entered, he shook hands with Mr. Astorino, who asked, \u201cYou ready to debate?\u201dMr. Cuomo responded affirmatively, patted him on the shoulder and continued walking.\u201cTell me when,\u201d Mr. Astorino said.Afterward, Mr. Cuomo was asked about Mr. Astorino\u2019s decision to show up to his speech.\u201cI hope he enjoyed it,\u201d the governor said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Benefits of Economic Expansions Are Increasingly Going to the Richest Americans", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUneven GainsEconomic expansions are supposed to be the good times, the periods in which incomes and living standards improve. And that\u2019s still true, at least for some of us.Back in the 1940s, '50s and '60s, most of the income gains experienced during expansions \u2014 the periods from the trough of one recession until the onset of another \u2014 accrued to most of the people. That is to say, the bottom 90 percent of earners captured at least a majority of the rise in income.With each expansion in sequence, however, the bottom 90 percent captured a smaller share of income gains and the top 10 percent captured more.Which brings us to the current expansion. Ms. Tcherneva\u2019s data goes only through 2012, so perhaps in the two years since then things have gotten a bit better for most workers. But in the first three years of the current expansion, incomes actually fell for the bottom 90 percent of earners, even as they rose nicely for the top 10 percent. The result: The top 10 percent captured an impossible-seeming 116 percent of income gains during that span.But one consistent finding of research into inequality is that merely cutting things off at the top 5 or 10 percent of earners doesn\u2019t capture all of what is changing in patterns of wealth and earnings. So Ms. Tcherneva also compiled the same data for those in the top 1 percent. (The cutoff there, according to the I.R.S., is $388,905 in 2011 adjusted gross income).This pattern is, in its way, all the more striking. One percent of the population, in the first three years of the current expansion, took home 95 percent of the income gains.In the paper containing the chart, published this month in the Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics, Ms. Tcherneva argues that this shift indicates a failure of the approach that governments take to stabilizing the economy. The postwar consensus has been that central bank action to cut interest rates should be the key tool to fight economic slumps, and to the degree fiscal policy ought be used at all, it should be tax and spending policies that boost the economy in the aggregate, such as cutting taxes temporarily.She argues that this approach isn\u2019t flowing through to broad-based wage gains because it is so untargeted. \u201cConventional fiscal fine-tuning measures ensure that when government increases its total demand for goods and services, it first improves the conditions of the skilled, employable, highly educated, and relatively highly-paid wage and salary workers,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is hoped that after those workers increase their own demand for products and services, the fiscal stimulus would trickle down to the less skilled and low-wage workers.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cthis trickle-down mechanism never quite trickles down far enough to create job opportunities for all individuals willing and able to work.\u201dShe would prefer forms of fiscal stimulus that focus more directly on employing workers, especially at the lower end of the economic ladder. \u201cThe manpower of the poor and the unemployed can be mobilized for the public purpose irrespective of their skill level, which in turn will be upgraded by the very work experience and educational programs that the program would offer,\u201d she writes.Not everyone would agree with that prescription. But this much is clear: Recessions are bad enough; everyone understands that they will tend to be times of stagnant or falling incomes. What is remarkable about the patterns of the last half-century is the steady march toward expansions that also do less and less to build up the incomes of most Americans.An earlier version of this article misstated the given name of one of the academics on whose work Ms. Tcherneva based her analysis. It is Emmanuel Saez, not Emanuel.The Upshot provides news, analysis\nand graphics about politics,\npolicy and everyday life.Advertisement"}

Who\u2019s going to join me? I then started calling people all over the country, and we garnered the support for that engagement within a week.\u201dRon Antinori, a relatively new board member, said that he had held an informal meeting to try to end the lockout, in which he asked other board members to write unsigned pledges on sheets of folded-up paper of how much they were willing to contribute. He said that the pledges topped $800,000 but that when he met with board leaders, they declined to end the lockout. He resigned. The orchestra\u2019s management said that while it was thrilled to have donors and would be happy to accept $800,000 in gifts, such a donation would not resolve the short- or long-term problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying short-term fixes for more than a decade without success,\u201d said Randy Donaldson, a spokesman for the orchestra\u2019s management. \u201cWe need a long-term solution that will allow the A.S.O. to balance its artistic and financial goals.\u201dHow to wade through the crush of culture coming your way this season?

Mr. Spano said he was troubled by a provision in the latest management proposal that would give it discretion over whether to fill positions, which could further shrink the ensemble.Mr. Spano said that reducing the orchestra\u2019s size made it rely more on hiring substitute players. \u201cAnd no aspersion to their gifts, but that means that the orchestra\u2019s quality suffers,\u201d he said. He said the size of an orchestra matters in ways that may not be immediately obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as, well, in Mahler, you need a big orchestra, but in Mozart, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, for the health of an orchestra on an ongoing basis, you need those numbers not only for repertoire reasons but for health reasons and workload reasons and for engagement reasons \u2014 what you\u2019re able to do outside of the hall, in the community.\u201d \u201cWould you want the Falcons playing with one quarterback?\u201d he asked. Now the orchestra\u2019s management has canceled Thursday night\u2019s season-opening concert, which was to have featured the pianist Jeremy Denk, and all concerts through Nov. 8. The orchestra\u2019s musicians plan to play free concerts on their own, beginning Friday at\u00a0Kennesaw State University in Georgia.\u201cThat\u2019s been an important part of our identity as an orchestra,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Those Lazy Jobless", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s hardly the first time a prominent conservative has said something along these lines. Ever since a financial crisis plunged us into recession it has been a nonstop refrain on the right that the unemployed aren\u2019t trying hard enough, that they are taking it easy thanks to generous unemployment benefits, which are constantly characterized as \u201cpaying people not to work.\u201d And the urge to blame the victims of a depressed economy has proved impervious to logic and evidence.But it\u2019s still amazing \u2014 and revealing \u2014 to hear this line being repeated now. For the blame-the-victim crowd has gotten everything it wanted: Benefits, especially for the long-term unemployed, have been slashed or eliminated. So now we have rants against the bums on welfare when they aren\u2019t bums \u2014 they never were \u2014 and there\u2019s no welfare. Why?That is, however, a topic for another column. My question for today is instead one of psychology and politics: Why is there so much animus against the unemployed, such a strong conviction that they\u2019re getting away with something, at a time when they\u2019re actually being treated with unprecedented harshness?My guess, however, is that it\u2019s mainly about the closed information loop of the modern right. In a nation where the Republican base gets what it thinks are facts from Fox News and Rush Limbaugh, where the party\u2019s elite gets what it imagines to be policy analysis from the American Enterprise Institute or the Heritage Foundation, the right lives in its own intellectual universe, aware of neither the reality of unemployment nor what life is like for the jobless. You might think that personal experience \u2014 almost everyone has acquaintances or relatives who can\u2019t find work \u2014 would still break through, but apparently not.Whatever the explanation, Mr. Boehner was clearly saying what he and everyone around him really thinks, what they say to each other when they don\u2019t expect others to hear. Some conservatives have been trying to reinvent their image, professing sympathy for the less fortunate. But what their party really believes is that if you\u2019re poor or unemployed, it\u2019s your own fault. Charles M. Blow is off today. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Can Save the Caribbean\u2019s Coral Reefs", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorsPARROTFISH eat algae and seaweed. These brightly colored fish with beaklike mouths inhabit coral reefs, the wellsprings of ocean life. Without them and other herbivores, algae and seaweed would overgrow the reefs, suppress coral growth and threaten the incredible array of life that depends on these reefs for shelter and food.This was happening in Bermuda, until the government in 1990 banned fish traps that were decimating the parrotfish population. Today, Bermuda\u2019s coral reefs are relatively healthy, a bright spot in the wider Caribbean, where total coral cover has declined by half since 1970.But climate change is only half the story. Up to now, the impacts of climate change on reefs have been much less destructive than the localized effects of overfishing, runoff pollution from the land and the destruction of habitats from coastal development. Those problems have exploded in intensity over the past century and will continue to increase sharply with population growth.Proof of the destructive power of those impacts is evident in the central Pacific where, in spite of rising temperatures, coral cover is many times higher around islands unaffected by fishing and pollution, compared with heavily fished and polluted reefs of nearby islands.But in Florida, banning fish traps \u2014 which should result in more parrotfish, less algae and more coral \u2014 has not stemmed coral decline. That\u2019s because of extreme local pressures from millions of residents and tourists and insufficient controls on development. Similar problems plague the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, which is being damaged by agricultural runoff and the development of huge ports for exporting coal. Fishing is carefully regulated there, but those other threats must be equally well managed.The few remaining places in the wider Caribbean with relatively healthy reefs have one thing in common: a greater abundance of parrotfish and other herbivores. They also benefit by being adjacent to islands with comparatively small populations, more modest development and less pollution. You find this in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northern Gulf of Mexico, on reefs around Cura\u00e7ao and Bonaire and in protected marine areas in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.Stories about coral reefs commonly focus on doom and gloom. But these new findings indicate that there is actually something we can do right now to help reefs recover: prevent overfishing, overdevelopment and pollution from the land.None of this lessens our concerns about climate change as humanity burns more coal and oil instead of less. But there is increasing evidence that protection from local stresses promotes the resilience of reef corals to climate change.Several Caribbean islands are moving to control overfishing and pollution. Barbuda just enacted legislation to protect parrotfish, stop overfishing and establish marine sanctuaries. And the Bahamas, Belize, Bonaire, Cuba and Cura\u00e7ao are working to enhance protections.In contrast, the condition of the coral reefs of the Florida Keys, the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico is among the worst in the wider Caribbean, despite vast sums invested in the monitoring of reefs and research on the effects of climate change. This monitoring and research are vitally important, but collecting information without strong corrective action is like a doctor analyzing a patient\u2019s decline without doing everything possible to save her life.We need to move immediately beyond listings of species as threatened and research about climate change and take rigorous action against the local and global stresses killing corals.Coral reefs are vital to the economies of the 38 Caribbean countries and territories and their millions of people. These reefs generate roughly $3 billion annually in tourism and fishing and provide protection from storms.To save coral reefs, we need to follow the lead of Barbuda and our other proactive neighbors. We need to stop all forms of overfishing, establish large and effectively enforced marine protected areas and impose strict regulations on coastal development and pollution while at the same time working to reduce fossil fuel emissions driving climate change. It\u2019s not either/or. It\u2019s all of the above.Jeremy Jackson is scientific director of\nthe Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network\nand emeritus senior scientist at the\nSmithsonian Institution and the Scripps\nInstitution of Oceanography.

{"Headline": "Fixes for Japan\u2019s Economy", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe news that the Japanese economy had shrunk by 7.1 percent in the second quarter this year from the previous three-month period suggests that the country\u2019s hard-earned recovery is in danger of stalling unless the government changes its flawed policies. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who entered office at the end of 2012, has made reviving the economy a top priority. His plan for doing so, known as \u201cAbenomics,\u201d included fiscal and monetary stimulus combined with a promise of big structural reforms that would draw more women into the work force and get corporations to spend more on higher wages and new investments. His policies produced impressive results early on but have lost much of their oomph in recent months \u2014 partly because the government raised tax rates prematurely and partly because the promised structural reforms have not gone far enough. In April, the government raised the sales tax from 5 percent to 8 percent. The move was meant to signal to investors that Mr. Abe is serious about reducing the country\u2019s large debt. But it also caused a sharp drop in consumer spending, which was no good for a fragile economy. Japan has to reduce its debt, but the tax should have been phased in gradually to avoid jolting consumers. The government should postpone a second planned increase of the tax rate, to 10 percent, scheduled for next year. Instead of raising taxes, Mr. Abe and the government need to press forward with structural reforms and changes to longstanding practices that have stifled the economy. One important change would be to require Japanese corporations to include more independent directors on their boards. This would encourage fresh thinking, more risk-taking and more aggressive investments. A recent paper by two International Monetary Fund economists found that Japanese companies had far fewer independent directors than companies elsewhere \u2014 9 percent for the companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2013 compared with 70 percent in the United States and more than 50 percent in Britain. A lack of independent directors reinforces conservative attitudes toward investing found in many Japanese boardrooms, as well as the accumulation of cash that is substantially larger than that in businesses in other Group of 7 countries. Another way to help the economy would be to get more women into the work force and into higher-paying jobs, creating a new source of consumer spending. An I.M.F. economist estimated that raising the participation of women in the labor force from 62 percent to the 70 percent level that exists in other large developed economies would raise per capita gross domestic product by 5 percent. The government has tried to encourage more women to seek employment by making it easier to find child care, but it could do a lot more. It needs to push businesses to hire more women, and it should enforce anti-discrimination laws more strictly.Mr. Abe promised to jolt Japan\u2019s moribund economy. He now needs to inject some energy into his own policies. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Emissions From India Will Increase, Official Says", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a blow to American hopes of reaching an international deal to fight global warming, India\u2019s new environment minister said Wednesday that his country would not offer a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions ahead of a climate summit next year in Paris.The minister, Prakash Javadekar, said in an interview that his government\u2019s first priority was to alleviate poverty and improve the nation\u2019s economy, which he said would necessarily involve an increase in emissions through new coal-powered electricity and transportation. He placed responsibility for what scientists call a coming climate crisis on the United States, the world\u2019s largest historic greenhouse gas polluter, and dismissed the idea that India would make cuts to carbon emissions.\u201cWhat cuts?\u201d Mr. Javadekar said. \u201cThat\u2019s for more developed countries. The moral principle of historic responsibility cannot be washed away.\u201d Mr. Javadekar was referring to an argument frequently made by developing economies \u2014 that developed economies, chiefly the United States, which spent the last century building their economies while pumping warming emissions into the atmosphere \u2014 bear the greatest responsibility for cutting pollution.Mr. Javadekar said that government agencies in New Delhi were preparing plans for India\u2019s domestic actions on climate change, but he said they would lead only to a lower rate of increase in carbon emissions. It would be at least 30 years, he said, before India would likely see a downturn.India is the world\u2019s third-largest carbon polluter, behind China and the United States, and Mr. Javadekar\u2019s comments are a first indication of the direction of the environmental policies of the new prime minister, Narendra Modi, the author of a 2011 e-book, \u201cA Convenient Action.\u201d Although the book, a response to the movie \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d presents the moral case for action on climate change, Mr. Javadekar said that coal, the world\u2019s top source of carbon pollution, would provide more than half of India\u2019s power for the foreseeable future. As President Obama and Chinese leaders have signaled that they intend to enact policies to decrease their emissions levels in the coming years, cooperation from India on a global climate treaty is crucial. Without India, it will be more difficult to reach a lasting agreement.As demand for electricity surges in India, Mr. Modi has said he plans to tackle climate change by increasing renewable power sources like wind and solar \u2014 an effort that has won applause from international environmental groups. Mr. Javadekar said his government was also focusing on increasing investment in railways and public transport, in order to slow the growth in demand for cars. In addition, he said the Modi administration was working on efforts to replant forests and create new wildlife refuge areas to protect tigers. \u201cThe new motto is, development without destruction,\u201d Mr. Javadekar said. A number of recent scientific reports have concluded that carbon emissions must peak within the next few years, and then decline, if the global atmosphere is to avoid an average temperature increase of 2 degrees Celsius, a tipping point at which scientists project an unavoidable future of rising sea levels, increased droughts and flooding and other catastrophic impacts. Mr. Obama has pushed for policies to lower emissions in the United States, and on Tuesday, the vice prime minister of China, Zhang Gaoli, said his country would try to reach a peak level of emissions \u201cas soon as possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Taking a Call for Climate Change to the Streets ", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byParticipants carried a giant sunflower during the march in New York City on Sunday.Legions of demonstrators frustrated by international inaction on global warming descended on New York City on Sunday, marching through the heart of Manhattan with a message of alarm for world leaders set to gather this week at the United Nations for a summit meeting on climate change.Coursing through Midtown, from Columbus Circle to Times Square and the Far West Side, the People\u2019s Climate March was a spectacle even for a city known for doing things big, and it was joined, in solidarity, by demonstrations on Sunday across the globe, from Paris to Papua New Guinea.\u201cI\u2019m here because I really feel that every major social movement in this country has come when people get together,\u201d said Carol Sutton of Norwalk, Conn., the president of a teachers\u2019 union. \u201cIt begins in the streets.\u201dFrom the scientists holding an oversize chalkboard to the Hurricane Sandy victims toting life preservers, the march was a self-consciously inclusive affair, with the organizers intent on creating a very big tent, which they hoped would hammer home the relevance of climate change and its effects.But it was mostly an event for concerned ordinary people, many of them veterans of climate change efforts, others relative newcomers.From as close as the Bronx and as far as at least Rome, the demonstrators came in vast numbers. At one point early in the afternoon, the march came to a halt because the entire 2.2-mile route was full, and more than two hours into the procession, people were still setting out from the starting point near Columbus Circle. Organizers, using data provided by 35 crowd spotters and analyzed by a mathematician from Carnegie Mellon University, estimated that 311,000 people marched the route.The signs that marchers held were as varied as the movement: \u201cThere Is No Planet B,\u201d \u201cForests Not for Sale\u201d and \u201cJobs, Justice, Clean Energy.\u201dThe diversity of the demonstrators made for some odd juxtapositions. On West 58th Street, the minaret of an inflatable mosque bobbed next to a wooden replica of Noah\u2019s Ark the size of a school bus. Nearby, Capuchin Franciscan monks in flowing brown robes, who were in town from Rome for the march, mingled with nuns, while a group flying a pagan flag beat a drum.The climax of the march came in the early afternoon. All along the route, crowds had been quieted for a moment of silence. On Avenue of the Americas at 57th Street, there was an eerie silence as marchers raised their arms and looked down.Then at exactly 1 p.m., a whistle pierced the silence, setting off a minute-long cacophony intended as a collective alarm on climate change. There were the beats of the drums and the blaring of horns, but mostly it was whoops and cries of the marchers.Like the march, the summit meeting on Tuesday at the United Nations will be flush with speeches intended to build support for addressing climate change. But the gathering of world leaders is not meant to be a formal negotiating session for a potential 2015 agreement.Behind the scenes, though, the real work toward forging a global deal was underway. A few blocks from the march, in a hotel conference room on Lexington Avenue, Secretary of State John Kerry convened a meeting of foreign ministers of the 17-member Major Economies Forum, focused on climate change, and Todd Stern, the chief United States climate change negotiator, held back-to-back meetings throughout the day.Mr. Kerry said he intended to keep a focus on climate change throughout the week, despite the pressure of other crises, including insurgent terrorists in Iraq and the Ebola outbreak in Africa. \u201cThe grave threat that climate change poses warrants a prominent position on that list,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThose are immediate. But this has even greater, longer-term consequences that can cost hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars, and lives, and the security of the world.\u201dIt was concern about the consequences of that warming that drew people to the march, organized by a dozen environmental, labor and social justice groups, and that inspired some of the event\u2019s most sober and most outrageous expressions, some of them not even on the route.In front of the Flatiron Building, on Fifth Avenue, a 3,000-pound ice sculpture spelled out \u201cThe Future.\u201d Dripping onto the sidewalk, it had been carved over two days in Queens by a group of Japanese ice sculptors. \u201cI would say we are melting down the future,\u201d said Nora Ligorano, one of the artists who conceived the work. \u201cIt\u2019s a comment on what we are doing to the planet.\u201dAt Columbus Circle, there were bare-breasted women and people with dreadlocks and homespun clothing. There were Muslim women wearing hijabs and groups of older women with signs proclaiming they were \u201cGrandmas Against Global Warming.\u201d and that \u201cGray Is Green.\u201dTwo high school seniors from Long Island, Kirsten Cunha and Alexandra Dos Santos, both 17, marched with dust masks over their mouths. \u201cWearing masks like this could quite possibly be our children\u2019s future,\u201d Ms. Dos Santos said.An earlier version of a photo caption with this article misspelled the surname of a girl examining an ice sculpture near the Flatiron Building.

The damage becomes that much worse as sea level rises. Warming temperatures have also multiplied the acreage destroyed by wildfires in the Western United States many times over. These costs eventually hit everyone, in the form of higher taxes (or loss of other services) and higher insurance premiums.The costs of moving away from fossil fuels can be minimized even further for average citizens by implementing a carbon fee and dividend plan: Tax carbon emissions at the source and return all revenue to households in the form of dividend checks. This way, the rising price of fuel oil and gasoline is offset. People can continue life as usual, or put their dividends to good use by reducing their gas and oil consumption.An added benefit: a boost to the Main Street economy and the creation of new jobs in the wind and solar industries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Spending Is Up 0.5% as Economy Stabilizes", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Americans increased their spending by a significant amount in August, offering welcome evidence that the economy is on solid footing heading into the final quarter of the year.Consumer spending in August rose 0.5 percent from the previous month after showing no gain in July, the Commerce Department reported on Monday. It was the best result since spending also expanded 0.5 percent in June.Helped by higher wages and salaries, personal income rose a modest 0.3 percent in August, slightly faster than a 0.2 percent July increase.The acceleration in consumer spending added to signs that the economy is sustaining strength in the current July-September quarter. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 percent of economic activity, and the lackluster showing in July had raised concerns about whether the economy would retain the momentum it built in the spring after a harsh winter. Still, analysts noted that the growth in consumer spending was the strongest in six months after the effects of inflation were removed.\u201cThe August rebound on the spending front was broad based and driven by better-than-expected back-to-school spending and surging auto sales,\u201d said Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. The housing market, however, showed a bit of weakness in August, suggesting that real estate sales may remain sluggish over the next few months.Inflation was well contained during August, with an inflation measure tracked closely by the Federal Reserve showing no change after a 0.1 percent July increase. Over the past 12 months, this measure of inflation is up just 1.5 percent, well below the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target.About half of the spending growth came from a big jump in August car sales.

For now, the compact crossover is built on the same chassis it was born with in 2007. Tiguan (the name is the unlikely combination of tiger and iguana) has admirable qualities. The structure is solid as a steel girder. Everything from the steering to the turn signals has a pleasant heft. The vehicle deftly balances comfort and sport. Riding higher than the Golf, the Tiguan is a tall-boy GTI.Built in Germany, the Tiguan carries a price more befitting an Audi more than a VW. The upmarket 2014 SEL model that I tested carried a sticker price of $34,905. The test car came with a giant glass roof that rear passengers adore, a punchy Fender sound system and a navigation unit. Oddly, though, it lacked power seats, automatic headlamps and 4Motion all-wheel drive. (You have to spend another $2,000 to send power to all the tires.) In size and soul, the Tiguan\u2019s closest competitor is the Mazda CX-5, which you can have fully loaded, with all-wheel drive, for less than $32,000.That Mazda comes with a larger LCD screen, leather seating rather than VW\u2019s synthetic hides, a blind spot alert and auto braking that slams on the binders if it senses a lapse of attention at speeds under 18 miles per hour. Oh, and the Tiguan has no USB port, something you\u2019ll find in nearly every car made today. It\u2019s a cool technology \u2014 VW might want to check into it.VW\u2019s turbocharged, direct-injected 2-liter 4-cylinder engine makes 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque when burning premium fuel.

The Environmental Protection Agency rates Tiguan\u2019s fuel economy at 21 miles per gallon in the city and 26 on the highway with front-wheel drive. This is thirstier than others in the class.From a numbers perspective, the Tiguan doesn\u2019t add up. But jump in the saddle and hit the curves and this small ute entertains in a big way.

{"Headline": "Jobs Report: Not Good, but Not Terrible Either", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmployment PictureFirst, the good news, if it can be called that: The new numbers on how the United States job market fared in August aren\u2019t cover-your-eyes terrible. Nothing in this report should send anyone running to the hills in fear.It shouldn\u2019t even prompt any major rethinking of where things stand, or change the basic economic narrative of the last few months that the economy is mending more strongly than it has previously in this five years of disappointing recovery. Enough other evidence points in that direction that one month of shaky jobs numbers, which will be revised significantly from here, shouldn\u2019t cause anyone to do any radical reassessments.This report is like a sitcom showed on the in-flight screen on a flight to Chicago: It is certainly not good, but it is far from offensive. It just is.How can we capture the sheer scope of the mediocrity? Start with the most widely tracked number, the number of jobs that the nation\u2019s employers added to their payrolls in August. It was indeed a disappointment, coming in at only 142,000, well below the 230,000 economists had forecast and the revised 212,000 of July.August was the weakest month of job gains yet this year, but if you look back just a little further, you get more context.Turns out, down months like this occur pretty regularly even when the basic trend of job creation is solid, most recently in December, when only 84,000 jobs were added.This may be statistical noise and may be just the usual ups and downs of employers\u2019 behavior, but either way, it suggests things remain on track. Take a look, for example, at the six-month average job gains, and while it ticked down in August, it remains higher than at any time in 2013.The good news in the report, if it can be called that, is that the unemployment rate fell a tick to 6.1 percent, from 6.2 percent. Unfortunately, the details of why it fell also point to a murky picture, with not much to celebrate.Only 16,000 additional people reported having a job, in the survey of households that underlies the unemployment rate. (The payroll numbers mentioned above are based on a survey of employers, and the two can diverge, particularly in any given month.)The biggest driver of the lower unemployment rate was people leaving the labor force entirely, neither working nor looking for a job. Those ranks rose by 268,000.As such, in August the trend of the last five years of a shrinking pool of labor resumed, after several months of stabilizing. It is a small blip in the scheme of things, but it bears watching. Many analysts have been watching for evidence that an improving job market will coax workers back into the labor force, and that may yet happen, but the opposite occurred in August.So where did the weakness in the August numbers come from? One way to look at the question is to compare the number of jobs each sector gained in August with its average over the last 12 months.Looked at that way, there was underperformance in eight of the 13 categories of employment. But the biggest underperformance was in one: retail. Retail employment has been a bright spot over the last year, adding an average of more than 20,000 jobs a month.The 8,400 positions the sector shed in August thus makes it a major culprit in the weak overall numbers.There is a silver lining to that fact, though: The vagaries of back-to-school schedules frequently create weird blips in retail employment in August and September (also around the Christmas holidays), and this could well be one of those.Considering that most measures of consumer spending have held up well recently, it would be unsurprising if retail employment rebounded in September or later in the fall.That\u2019s a fitting metaphor for how to view the report overall: Acknowledge its mediocrity, and hope that other signals about the economy are more reliable and that it is more aberration than trend.Advertisement"}

In February, Mr. Beeck, who was born in Peru and fled to the United States after his country\u2019s 1968 military coup, and his Cuban-born wife, Olga Maria, gave Georgetown University $10 million to start the Beeck Center for Social Impact and Innovation.After years of serving on the board of Lumni, a Mexican organization that gives students in five countries education grants in return for a portion of their future earnings, Mr. Beeck is now the chairman of the board and plans to expand Lumni\u2019s mission further.And after three years of work, he is about to see the fruits of a fairly unusual philanthropic investment: a reality television show airing for 15 Sunday nights in Colombia focused on little-known do-gooders.\u201cYou think about celebrities getting behind causes,\u201d Mr. Beeck said from Lima. \u201cThe idea with the reality show is to highlight the work of the supersocial entrepreneurs.\u201dWhile most of the protagonists this season are addressing the effects of Colombia\u2019s notorious drug trade, Mr. Beeck hopes to begin the show in other Latin countries next year by focusing on a different set of social ills.Yet for a Latin American philanthropist, Mr. Beeck\u2019s year has been notable. Historically, wealthy Latin Americans have had little interest in philanthropic giving aimed at solving social problems.But that record is slowly changing. Today, the attitude has shifted to something that could be deemed enlightened self-interest: So great are the social problems in many Latin American countries and so strapped or ineffective are the resources on the ground, that many Latins \u2014 especially those living abroad \u2014 feel compelled to help make the situation better for fear that if they don\u2019t, no one will.While the rate of giving is still small by most standards, the trend toward what is known as \u201cimpact philanthropy\u201d or giving intended to bring about specific social change, tracks with a similar trend in the United States, particularly among the entrepreneurial set. Its emergence among the Latin diaspora has the potential to change the philanthropic agenda throughout the region.To understand the shift, it helps to start with a brief history of social aid in the region. Traditionally, governments and the Catholic Church were seen as primarily responsible for helping the poor.\u201cIf you had the private sector take on something that the state saw as its province, it would almost be like you were trying to undermine the government,\u201d Ms. Lagomasino said. \u201cUnlike the U.S., most people in Latin America grew up in a culture where people didn\u2019t know a lot about philanthropy.\u201dEven now, writing a check to a charity is a lot less popular in Latin America than in the United States, added Julia Chu, head of philanthropy at Credit Suisse Private Banking, North America. \u201cThere is this notion of wanting to see a discernible return. There isn\u2019t a value of funding an institution just for the sake of funding it. There is a bit of skepticism.\u201dAnd Latin American countries have offered no tax incentives to encourage philanthropy \u2014 unlike the United States. Luis Stuhlberger, a Brazilian hedge fund manager, philanthropist and president of the Instituto Credit Suisse Hedging-Griffo, a corporate philanthropy, calculated that even Brazil\u2019s small tax incentive for charitable giving often goes unused by individuals, even though the money then goes to the government as a tax. (Corporations, he said, use it all, to pay less tax and to burnish their reputations.)But most of all, the hesitancy was related to decades of political, economic and social upheaval.\u201cWhen I look at my generation, it was a fairly selfish generation,\u201d said Mr. Beeck, 58, whose philanthropic plan began in 2008 when he sold his stake in Hochschild Mining, a mining group with operations in Latin America and Canada. The relative stability in Peru helped make the notion of philanthropic work seem possible.\u201cWhen we have a stable economy, stable political system, you can think about other things rather than just protecting your family and your assets and your needs,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see it in Peru in part after the difficult times we\u2019ve had with military coups.\u201dAngela Maria Tafur started Give to Colombia in 2004 after moving her family to Miami because of safety concerns. Her father was a senator in Colombia before he was assassinated in the early 1990s. \u201cI was brought up to understand that not all of us have the same opportunity,\u201d she said.One of the areas her foundation focuses on is educating members of the \u201cdemobilized\u201d \u2014 young people who left the guerrilla movement \u2014 and reintegrating them into society. For her, though, showing individuals, family foundations and corporations that her organization is accountable and effective is paramount.\u201cWe\u2019re very successful because of our transparency, our accountability and how closely we monitor the use of the funds,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the model is transparency, people trust you, and they trust you to give you more and more each time.\u201dFor Rosario Perez, a former private banker at JPMorgan Chase who is now the president and chief executive of Pro Mujer, which focuses on microlending, health and job training for women, the challenge is expanding the funding base.\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a fund-raising team before I came here,\u201d said Ms. Perez, a Mexican immigrant who gives to her own organization. \u201cMost of our money comes from the generation of our own equity. Eight percent is from grants and donations. It really should be more like 35 percent.\u201dThis shows a limit of the impact philanthropy model: While organizations can generate returns to keep the programs going, they need donations to expand what they\u2019re doing. Ms. Perez\u2019s goal is to tap the diaspora for more money, with a focus on entrepreneurs in the United States.For many of the smaller countries, that diaspora can be an even bigger force \u2014 and one that can take advantage of United States tax incentives to be charitable by setting up in the United States as tax-exempt organizations.\u201cWhat these organizations are doing in funding local organizations is making people living abroad more comfortable,\u201d said Ignacio Pakciarz, chief executive of Big Sur Partners, an investment firm, and a board member of Reaching U, a charity focused on education in his native Uruguay. \u201cThey\u2019re getting guidelines. They\u2019re measuring this.\u201dYet the dollar amounts remain small. Give to Colombia has raised $19.4 million in the last 10 years to educate people displaced by the guerrilla war in the country. That money has financed 175 projects that have directly helped 277,000 individuals. But getting that money from a few family foundations and corporations \u2014 along with thousands of small donors \u2014 has been time-consuming.For Reaching U, the numbers are smaller still. In 2014, it has a goal of raising $350,000 to help 2,220 children get after-school care. And that money is coming only after a difficult courting process.\u201cIf you want people to donate, you\u2019re going to have to call them twice,\u201d Mr. Pakciarz said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to send them an invitation. You\u2019re going to have to push. It\u2019s not natural. They\u2019re not going to call you and say, \u2018I want to make a donation.\u2019 \u201dBut he is betting that with nearly as many Uruguayans living outside the country as in Uruguay, he will be able to marshal change. \u201cThe wealthy people in my country are the older generation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m focusing on fund-raising here.\u201dThe Wealth Matters column on Saturday, about philanthropic efforts by Hispanic-Americans, described incompletely the mission of the organization Give to Colombia. The group serves vulnerable populations; it does not focus solely on educating young people who left the guerrilla movement. The column also misstated the amount of money the organization has raised in the last 10 years and how many projects it finances. It has raised $19.4 million \u2014 not $22 million, which is its estimate for what it will have raised by the close of this year. And it has financed 175 projects, not 157.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in ... Hong Kong", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational Real EstateThe apartment is on the 17th floor of Hoi Kung Court, the salmon-colored building at center.A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH HARBOR VIEWS IN HONG KONG$1.94 MILLION (15 MILLION HONG KONG DOLLARS)This one-bedroom apartment is on the 17th floor of Hoi Kung Court, a residential building dating to 1966 in the vibrant Causeway Bay section of Hong Kong. The unit, about 625 square feet, has been completely updated within the last three years, with special attention paid to maximizing storage space. The combined living and dining room is at the front of the apartment, facing panoramic views of Victoria Harbor; the apartment has a narrow balcony. The compact kitchen fits along one wall at the back of the living/dining room. It includes Miele appliances hidden behind white lacquer cabinets as well as black marble counters and a wine fridge. Above the kitchen, a deep storage space next to the ceiling is hidden behind a wall panel. A door beside the kitchen opens to reveal a compartment that can fit all the equipment needed for a home office. The floors are African black hardwood, and air-conditioning units are mounted near the ceilings. The bedroom has an entire wall of closets and two windows overlooking the building next door. In the bathroom, a glass panel swings open to shield the rest of the room from the shower, and the black stone floor, grooved to keep it from being slippery, is angled slightly toward a drain. The toilet is in a separate alcove with its own small sink; the main bathroom sink is large and rectangular. A laundry area next to the bathroom has a built-in ironing board that can be folded away.Heavy-duty soundproof glass protects the apartment from traffic noise on Gloucester Road, a major artery. During holidays and festivals, the apartment has a front-row view of the spectacular fireworks displays over the harbor. The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club is across the street, and the neighborhood is famous for its shopping. Nightclubs and other attractions are about a 10-minute walk. The airport is a 30-minute taxi ride from Causeway Bay.MARKET OVERVIEWTwo years ago, the government of Hong Kong began phasing in \u201ccooling measures,\u201d to check price growth in the residential real estate market. Simon Smith, the head of research for Savills Hong Kong, said the measures were aimed at foreign buyers. \u201cThe measures have definitely had a dampening impact on the market, but mainly at the top end, where foreign buyers were most active,\u201d he added. He said prices in the luxury sector have continued to climb since the measures were put in place, but more slowly. In the market as a whole, prices have fallen nearly 8 percent from their 2013 peak.\"Even without the foreign buyers, the local buyers are still able to support the market,\u201d said David Ji, the head of research for Greater China at Knight Frank in Hong Kong. Prices in Hong Kong are buoyed by limited supply, and by low interest rates, Mr. Smith said. Mr. Ji added that the unexpected strength of the American economy has also been a factor, since Hong Kong\u2019s currency is pegged to the dollar. Prices are highest on Hong Kong Island. Mr. Ji said the Mid-Levels and Victoria Peak neighborhoods command upward of 40,000 to 50,000 Hong Kong dollars per square foot ($5,161 to $6,451 per square foot at 7.75 Hong Kong dollars to the dollar.) Farther east in Taikoo Shing, prices are lower, 12,000 to 15,000 Hong Kong dollars, or around $1,550 to $1,935, per square foot. Mr. Ji said residential units like this one in Causeway Bay are very rare, because the area is mostly a shopping district. This apartment is priced at about 24,000 Hong Kong dollars, or about $3,100, per square foot.WHO BUYS IN HONG KONGIn spite of the government\u2019s cooling measures, Hong Kong still sees some foreign buyers from mainland China, the United Kingdom and Russia, said Binoche Chan, a real estate agent with Hong Kong Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, who has the listing. But the number of foreign buyers has been dramatically reduced. In the past, nearly a third of luxury buyers were foreign, Mr. Ji said, but \u201cat the moment most of the buyers are local middle-class people.\u201dBUYING BASICSBecause of the government\u2019s cooling measures, all buyers are now required to pay a double stamp duty of 7.5 percent for a property similar to this one, Ms. Chan said. The only exception is for first-time buyers who are also Hong Kong residents. They pay half as much \u2014 3.75 percent for a property like this one. In addition, buyers who are not residents also have to pay a second stamp duty of 15 percent. Other transaction costs include legal fees of about 0.1 percent and real estate agent commissions. Ms. Chan said agent commissions are not regulated, but are usually 1 percent for the buyer and 1 percent for the seller.WEBSITESLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYChinese, English; Hong Kong dollar (1 Hong Kong dollar = $0.13)TAXES AND FEESProperties in Hong Kong are almost all leasehold, with long-term leases of 999 years, according to the listing agent. Owners pay a small amount of rent for the land, rather than property taxes. The rent and other municipal fees for this apartment come to about 1,000 Hong Kong dollars, or about $130, per month, and the building maintenance fees are around 1,300 Hong Kong dollars, or about $168, per month.CONTACTAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghan Runner-Up, in Tone of Compromise, Confirms He Will Join Government ", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The runner-up in Afghanistan\u2019s bitterly disputed presidential election, Abdullah Abdullah, struck a conciliatory note toward President-elect Ashraf Ghani in a speech on Thursday in which he confirmed that he would join the government as its chief executive officer.Mr. Abdullah\u2019s public address, his first since signing an American-brokered deal on Sunday to end months of political deadlock, cleared up the ambiguity about his future role. And it was an open attempt to bring his supporters on board with a unity government amid worries that they might rebel against an administration led by Mr. Ghani.The political deal gave Mr. Abdullah the power to nominate the new chief executive officer \u2014 a post with powers roughly equivalent to a prime minister \u2014 but did not specify who would fill the position. There had been some speculation that Mr. Abdullah might name one of his supporters to the post so he could remain free to operate as a political opposition leader. But on Thursday, he was introduced as \u201cthe chief executive.\u201dIn his speech, Mr. Abdullah offered congratulations to Mr. Ghani as Afghanistan\u2019s \u201cfuture president.\u201d But the words drew a silent response from thousands of supporters who had gathered at a large hall in Kabul.In answer to a question, Mr. Abdullah asserted that he had little choice but to sign a deal with Mr. Ghani. \u201cRemember that it\u2019s very easy to resort to violence, but it has bad consequences,\u201d he said.His supporters, many of whom waved Afghan flags, were more cheered by his promises for the incoming government, which he said would be \u201ckeenly at the service of all Afghan people.\u201dBut while Mr. Abdullah promised to revitalize the ailing economy, which has been further weakened by the political crisis, he made no mention of possible peace talks with the Taliban, exposing a point of contention with Mr. Ghani.As the winter draws near, the Taliban can celebrate one of their best fighting seasons in a decade. Mr. Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, favors ending the conflict through peace talks, but Mr. Abdullah, who draws his support from largely non-Pashtun areas, has been more skeptical about negotiations with the insurgents.Outside the hall, Mr. Abdullah\u2019s supporters appeared to be torn between indignation that their candidate had lost and relief that a destabilizing political battle had reached a peaceful resolution \u2014 at least for now.\u201cHe is not a legitimate president,\u201d said Muhammad Yousaf, a 20-year-old student, referring to Mr. Ghani. But, he added, \u201cthere was no other solution. Otherwise, the country would have fallen into crisis.\u201dMr. Abdullah acknowledged that the crisis had battered Afghans\u2019 faith in their nascent democracy.\u201cI have not forgotten those people who lost their lives, their fingers, when they voted,\u201d he said, in reference to voters who had a finger cut off by the Taliban because it was stained with ink that indicated they had voted. \u201cI hold the pain and sorrow of those families in my heart.\u201dMr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani face a stark array of challenges after the inauguration ceremony, which is scheduled for Monday. The economy has taken a pounding as a result of the political deadlock, and the government says that it lacks almost $900 million to pay civil servants in Kabul next month \u2014 a gap that is likely to be filled by reluctant Western donors.First, though, the new government is set to sign a bilateral security agreement to determine the shape and size of the American military presence. After protracted and tense negotiations with American officials last year, the departing president, Hamid Karzai, refused to sign the deal, saying it would be left to his successor.Both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah support the troop agreement, and a senior State Department official told reporters that the deal would most likely be signed within days of the inauguration.Security has been tightened in the capital in anticipation of possible Taliban attacks on the inauguration ceremony. In a reminder of growing insecurity in the north of the country, an explosion near a police checkpoint in Faryab Province on Thursday killed one civilian and wounded 10 others, the local police said.Jawad Sukhanyar contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Commitments on Three Fronts Test Obama\u2019s Foreign Policy", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 In vowing in Estonia on Wednesday to defend vulnerable NATO nations from Russia \u201cfor as long as necessary,\u201d President Obama has now committed the United States to three major projections of its power: a \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, a more muscular presence in Europe and a new battle against Islamic extremists that seems very likely to accelerate.American officials acknowledge that these three commitments are bound to upend Mr. Obama\u2019s plans for shrinking the Pentagon\u2019s budget before he leaves office in 2017. They also challenge a crucial doctrine of his first term: that a reliance on high technology and minimal use of a \u201clight footprint\u201d of military forces can deter ambitious powers and counter terrorists. And the commitments may well reverse one of the critical tenets of his two presidential campaigns, that the money once spent in Iraq and Afghanistan would be turned to \u201cnation-building at home.\u201dBut the accumulation of new defensive initiatives leaves open the question of how forcefully Mr. Obama is committed to reversing the suspicion, from Europe to the Middle East to Asia, that the United States is in an era of retrenchment. In his travels in Europe this week and a lengthy tour of Asia planned this fall, the president faces a dual challenge: convincing American allies and partners that he has no intention to leave power vacuums around the globe for adversaries to fill, while convincing Americans that he can face each of these brewing conflicts without plunging them back into another decade of large military commitments and heavy casualties.\u201cThere is a growing mismatch between the rhetoric and the policy,\u201d said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior national security official as the war with Iraq loomed a dozen years ago. \u201cIf you add up the resources needed to implement the Asian pivot, recommit to the Middle East and increase our presence in Europe, you can\u2019t do it without additional money and capacity. The world has proved to be a far more demanding place than it looked to this White House a few years ago.\u201dIt is not a world that requires, at least for now, the kind of deployments that marked the Cold War, when the United States kept roughly 100,000 troops in Europe and only slightly fewer in Asia. But the prospect of drastically shrinking the military after the post-9/11 era, in which total national security spending more than doubled, now seems highly unlikely. And at a moment when Mr. Obama is still answering critics for saying last week that, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a strategy yet,\u201d to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, he now needs to articulate several strategies, each tailored to problems that in the last year have taken on surprising complexities.In facing the more than 10,000 ISIS fighters, he must find a way to confront a different kind of terrorist group, one determined to use the most brutal techniques to take territory that the backwash from the Arab Spring has now put up for grabs. The American bombing campaign against ISIS targets in Iraq does not approach the costs of invading and occupying that country, but Pentagon officials say the weapons, fuel and other expenses of taking on the Islamic extremists are running up bills of about $225 million a month, a figure that will rise if Mr. Obama has to take that fight into Syria. ISIS \u201cis not invincible,\u201d Matthew G. Olsen, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said in a talk at the Brookings Institution on Wednesday, and ISIS does not yet pose the kind of direct threat to the United States that Al Qaeda did before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But it is \u201cbrutal and lethal,\u201d he said, and defeating it will require a long-term commitment of a kind Mr. Obama clearly did not anticipate earlier this year.In the Russia of President Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Obama faces a declining power, afflicted by a shrinking population, a strident nationalism and an economy vulnerable because of its extraordinary dependency on oil exports. Washington is betting that while sanctions are having little effect now, over time they will hollow out Mr. Putin\u2019s poll ratings. But the short term is more complex. For months now, arguments inside the administration have been over how directly and where to draw the line. In Tallinn, Estonia\u2019s capital, on Wednesday Mr. Obama drew it at NATO\u2019s own boundaries. The question is whether Mr. Putin believes him.In China, the president faces the opposite challenge: a rising power with growing resources and a sense that this is China\u2019s moment to reassert influence in Asia in a way it has not in hundreds of years. Here, the surprise to Mr. Obama has been the aggressiveness shown by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, in embracing efforts to press territorial claims against Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and the Philippines, rather than focusing on the domestic economy.\u201cWe didn\u2019t see this coming,\u201d one former member of Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team said this summer, \u201cand there\u2019s a lot of debate about how to counter it.\u201dThe statement could be true for each of the challenges confronting Mr. Obama. It explains why the administration is having difficulty explaining how this combination will affect its future plans.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was put in his job in part to find ways to shrink the military, on the assumption that America\u2019s Iraq commitments were over and as the official combat mission in Afghanistan ends this year. But Mr. Hagel has been either unable or unwilling to articulate the long-term implications of the new commitments. \u201cThere is a chronic disconnect, not just in this administration, between the policy, the budget guidance, and the classified strategies,\u201d said Shawn Brimley, the director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, who served as the director of strategic planning at the National Security Council during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term. That is what Mr. Obama needs to do for a \u201clasting legacy\u201d of rethinking America\u2019s defenses, Mr. Brimley said, but \u201cif you don\u2019t do it in the next six months, it\u2019s too late.\u201dSo far, the administration has twice delayed the publication of its second term report, \u201cNational Security Strategy of the United States\u201d \u2014 events have overwhelmed it. There are still plans afoot to shift the American presence to the Pacific over the next six years, aiming toward the moment when 60 percent of America\u2019s forces abroad are in the region. But many Asian leaders question whether Mr. Obama and his successor will carry through. Many Europeans and Middle Eastern leaders see those efforts and shudder.Mr. Obama floated several American-led efforts to deter Russia in his speech in Tallinn, from NATO\u2019s impending \u201crapid response\u201d forces, to increased training missions, to \u201cinvesting in capabilities like intelligence and surveillance and reconnaissance and missile defense.\u201d The last was an interesting allusion, because in the past he was always careful to say that missile defense was aimed at deterring outlier states \u2014 clearly meaning Iran \u2014 rather than nuclear powers like Russia. This time, he made no such disclaimer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Human Toll of Offshoring", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe subtitle of Beth Macy\u2019s new book, \u201cFactory Man\u201d \u2014 \u201cHow One Furniture Maker Battled Offshoring, Stayed Local, and Helped Save an American Town\u201d \u2014 gives every impression that it is going to be an upbeat read, a capitalistic feel-good story.And, indeed, Macy, a former longtime reporter for The Roanoke Times in Virginia, doesn\u2019t skimp on the story of a furniture baron named John Bassett III, her colorful main character, a Southern charmer with a fondness for quoting General Patton. After being pushed out of his family\u2019s furniture company in (where else?) Bassett, Va., JBIII, as Macy calls him, buys into another, smaller company, Vaughan-Bassett, in the nearby town of Galax, right around the time that Chinese furniture manufacturers began to move seriously into the American furniture market with low-priced knockoffs of American furniture designs.As furniture manufacturers all around him \u2014 including his family\u2019s company \u2014 begin shuttering plants and start marketing and selling the Chinese imports, Bassett decides to fight back. Although he, too, has had to shrink his work force, he refuses to shut down his company, and he mobilizes others in the industry to charge the Chinese with dumping their goods on the market \u2014 that is, selling them below the cost of manufacturing them.In 2005, the government did indeed conclude that the Chinese had been dumping furniture, and it put tariffs on Chinese furniture that helped make the Americans a little more competitive. Thanks to something called the Byrd amendment, some of the money from the Chinese went directly to Bassett\u2019s company, which \u201cinvested $23 million in new plant equipment, put some in the employee profit-sharing plan, and used some of it to start a companywide free health clinic for families,\u201d writes Macy. \u201cThe money saved upwards of 700 jobs in Galax, which, in turn, as some have argued, have saved the town.\u201d Vaughan-Bassett has since become the largest wooden bedroom furniture maker in the country.Surely, if they make a movie out of \u201cFactory Man\u201d \u2014 and I think there is a pretty decent chance they will \u2014 that will be the story line.What is striking about Macy\u2019s first book, though, is how little she does to make that made-for-the-movies plot stand out. Her wonderful central character notwithstanding, she\u2019s really after something else: the effects of globalization on her little corner of the world, that is, the regions of North Carolina and Virginia where furniture making was once king. From her point of view, that story is anything but upbeat.Nor does she miss the historic twist in her tale: as she notes early on, in the years after the Civil War, Southern entrepreneurs like Bassett\u2019s grandfather capitalized on \u201ccheap, hungry labor and all those tree-stocked hills\u201d to shift furniture manufacturing from places like Grand Rapids, Mich., to the South, where it thrived for a century or more before the Chinese began doing the same thing to them.But again and again, she comes back to the factories that have been closed, the jobs that have been lost. \u201cBetween 2002 and 2012, 63,300 American factories closed their doors and five million factory jobs went away,\u201d she notes. She finds people who, having been laid off, do exactly what you would hope they might do: go to college and become well-paid knowledge workers.But far more often she introduces us to people who have been displaced by the Chinese furniture manufacturers and can\u2019t see a better future. It is especially difficult for people who have lost their jobs in what amount to company towns \u2014 where there really isn\u2019t any other work to be had. She asks, \u201cWhat good did it do to have access to cheap consumer goods if you had no money to buy them?\u201dShe quotes the University of Oregon economist Bruce Blonigen, who tells her, \u201cIn reality, we shouldn\u2019t be making bedroom furniture anymore in the United States. Shouldn\u2019t we instead be trying to educate these workers\u2019 kids to get them into high-skilled jobs and away from what\u2019s basically an archaic industry?\u201dI happen to think Blonigen is right \u2014 that is exactly what we should be doing to make globalization work for us instead of against us. But I also find myself deeply sympathetic to Macy\u2019s essential point, which is that globalization inflicts a great deal of suffering on millions of people, something the news media should do a better job of acknowledging and the government should do a better job of mitigating.Toward the end of her book, Macy travels to Indonesia, where she talks to a factory executive. \u201cWhat I do worry about every year is the future of the factory,\u201d he tells her. \u201cI worry that someone somewhere else, somewhere cheaper, will start to make furniture, and that will be that for us.\u201dIt never ends.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Runs the Girls?", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOpinionA FEW years ago, I attended a party at a nightclub in the meatpacking district of Manhattan with about 10 young women, most of them models, and two club promoters, men whose job was to bring beautiful women to exclusive parties. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s hit single \u201cRun the World (Girls)\u201d boomed, and the girls danced to the beat, singing, \u201cWho run the world? Girls! Girls!\u201d One promoter joined in, with his own twist on the chorus: \u201cWho run the girls? Boys! Boys!\u201d The men high-fived, and everyone laughed.Many of the models who walked the Fashion Week runways this month in New York, London, Milan and, starting this week, Paris, are the same women who pass through these clubs. The fashion shows and the international circuit of V.I.P. parties \u2014 Miami in March, Cannes and St.-Tropez in May and July, August weekends in the Hamptons \u2014 serve as case studies in an old debate. Does the celebrated display of female beauty and sexuality empower or exploit women? V.I.P. night life is an industry run by men, for men, and on women, who are ubiquitously called \u201cgirls.\u201d The girls are brought in to attract big-spending clients from among the young global elite, willing to spend thousands of dollars on alcohol. Hence the V.I.P. party is sometimes half-jokingly described as \u201cmodels and bottles.\u201d The girls are seen as interchangeable; one club owner calls them \u201cbuffers\u201d because rows of them frame his Instagram party pictures. They are recruited through friends of friends, scouted on the streets of SoHo, with its clusters of fashion agencies, or tracked down at model castings.During the week I was a sociology professor. But during my weekends and summer vacations, I became one of these girls. In exchange for showing up at their parties, the promoters let me study them. I was what they call a \u201cgood civilian\u201d \u2014 close enough in physique but not as valuable as a fashion model. Girls rarely pay to be in V.I.P. nightclubs, but neither are they typically paid to be there, accepting instead gifts and perks like free drinks and even housing \u2014 no small thing for fashion\u2019s underpaid work force. Clubs and promoters will pay to fly girls from New York to Miami, or from Prague to Cannes. Most girls don\u2019t see promoters as exploitative, but as friends, something the promoters foster by treating them to lunch or games of bowling.As anthropologists remind us, there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. Gifts are given with expectations of reciprocity. Friendships mask what would otherwise look ugly: the exchange of women\u2019s bodies for money. The promoters are handsomely paid, upward of $1,000 per night for those who regularly recruit high-fashion models. Girls also give the promoters access to powerful men, whom they often see as potential investors in their entrepreneurial dreams, which range from opening their own nightclubs to brokering business deals. This is a system of trafficking in women. It is, of course, consensual, and a far cry from anything like sexual slavery. But, in an anthropological sense, it is not so different from the tribal kinship systems studied by Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, in which men exchanged women in order to forge alliances with other men, while women were cut out from the value that their own circulation generated. Why do women consent to their own exploitation? Flattered egos, of course, play a role. When I interviewed a 21-year-old fashion merchandising student, she explained: \u201cI love the whole aura in New York. I love the vibes. I love like, the exclusivity.\u201d She was keenly aware of her value to her male friends in the night-life scene: \u201cBut I always wonder, if I wasn\u2019t, you know, skinny, if I wasn\u2019t attractive, would they really be friends with me? Probably not.\u201dIn 2013, I spent a weekend in the Hamptons at a nine-bedroom mansion shared by a few Manhattan businessmen who aimed to host at least 20 models each weekend during the summer season. They called it \u201cmodel camp.\u201d That weekend, I attended a nightclub, a pool party and a house party hosted by the chief executive of a private equity firm. One of the men explained to me that girls were \u201ccurrency,\u201d assuring him a steady stream of invitations to exclusive parties and visits from important businesspeople. I did meet some exceptional women who joined the party in search of opportunities, such as a 24-year-old model who was looking for an internship in finance through the connections she made in nightclubs. \u201cIf you have a head on your shoulders,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s a great way to meet people who work a lot and have money.\u201d Similarly, a 28-year-old marketing professional with an Ivy League education loved having the \u201cmost interesting, amazing conversations in the world\u201d with politicians and venture capitalists at V.I.P. dinners. But while girls can certainly meet important people at these events, they are generally in a weaker position to leverage these connections. The unequal ability of one person to capitalize on another is a classic case of exploitation. Imagine that the Hamptons businessmen hold meetings with the private equity C.E.O., in part because I softened their introduction. In two years, perhaps their investment fund will be cranking out profits, while I\u2019ll be turning 36, and no longer welcome at the party. What may seem like an agreeable quid pro quo looks different in the long run, when women age out of the system without any returns on the time they invested. What\u2019s really troubling is that no one even sees it as a lost investment, in part because it feels so good.When it comes to women, popular culture confuses pleasure and power. Sure, girls may run the world, but men run the girls. And the girls don\u2019t seem to mind all that much. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would Ryanair Deal Make Economy Class Even More Crowded?", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIs economy class about to get even more crowded?The European budget carrier Ryanair on Monday became the first airline to embrace a new variant of Boeing\u2019s 737 that will enable Ryanair to squeeze an additional eight seats into the American plane maker\u2019s popular single-aisle airframe.Ryanair, which is based in Dublin, said it had signed an agreement with Boeing to buy 100 of the planes, with an option to buy up to 100 more, in a deal valued at more than $22 billion at current list prices. The sale is subject to approval by Ryanair shareholders in a vote set for November.In a statement, Michael O\u2019Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, called the new high-density 737 a \u201cgame changer\u201d that would allow further reductions in fares and operating cost per passenger. Ryanair said it planned to fit the planes with 197 seats, up from the maximum 189 seats on its current fleet of around 300 planes, all of which are Boeing aircraft.Perhaps in a nod to the increasingly contentious public discussion of airline legroom, Mr. O\u2019Leary said Ryanair would accommodate the addition of eight seats by fitting the new planes with seats that are less bulky and eliminating the forward and rear galleys. The airline said the new configuration would provide passengers with somewhat more legroom than the average of 30 inches on its current fleet; it declined to say how much more legroom would be available, though.Like most no-frills carriers, Ryanair\u2019s cabins are all economy and its seats do not recline. Eliminating the galleys will have no effect on cabin service, because the airline\u2019s flights average less than 90 minutes and it does not serve meals.Boeing announced plans for the new single-aisle variant \u2014 dubbed the 737 Max 200 because it can seat up to 200 passengers \u2014 at the Farnborough International Airshow in July. Raymond L. Conner, chief executive of Boeing\u2019s commercial aircraft business, said at the time that the 200-seat version, which would include an additional exit door to meet safety requirements, would reduce airlines\u2019 operating costs by up to 5 percent.At a news conference in New York on Monday, Mr. Conner said Boeing was talking with other low-cost airlines about the plane, but declined to identify them.Ryanair is Europe\u2019s largest airline by number of passengers, with more than 81 million people traveling on its flights each year. It is one of the few airlines with an all-Boeing fleet.The order announced on Monday comes nine months after Ryanair announced a deal for 175 of the American plane maker\u2019s 189-seat 737-800s \u2014 a transaction valued at more than $15 billion at list prices. The first of those planes are expected to be shipped to Ryanair this week, while the remaining deliveries will stretch through 2018.The first of Ryanair\u2019s high-density 737s will be delivered in 2019. The airline said some of those jets would be used to replace older 737-800s in its fleet.By 2024, Ryanair said it expected to have a total fleet of 520 Boeing aircraft.Over the next five years, Ryanair forecasts that its share of the European air travel market will grow to around 20 percent, from around 12 percent today. By 2024, it expects to carry 150 million passengers per year, which analysts estimate would give Ryanair about one-fourth of the projected European market.In 2011, Boeing announced plans for the 737 Max \u2014 a version of its best-selling single-aisle plane, the 737, fitted with the next generation in fuel-efficient engines. The company has since received more than 2,200 orders for that model, which seats 189 passengers and is expected to enter service in 2017.The 737 Max competes directly with the A320neo, built by Boeing\u2019s European rival, Airbus. The A320neo, due out in 2016, has secured just over 3,200 orders.In July, Boeing announced plans for a version of the 737 Max that could be configured to seat up to 200 passengers. The A320neo seats 189.The carrier said it expected the additional seats, combined with the more fuel-efficient engines, to lower its fuel costs by up to 18 percent per flight, and that it expected to pass on the savings to customers in the form of lower fares.\u201cThis is going to mark a step-change in improving Ryanair\u2019s efficiency,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Leary said. \u201cMy hope is that it will hasten an era of a new price war in Europe, which, like all the old price wars, Ryanair will win.\u201dRyanair has continued a rapid expansion throughout the economic downturn, adding new routes even as higher-cost rivals have retrenched by shedding employees and reducing capacity.Flagging European economic growth and high fuel costs slowed Ryanair\u2019s earnings growth over the past year, but the airline remains the region\u2019s most profitable. Profit more than doubled in the three months to June 30 from the same period a year earlier, to 197 million euros, or $255 million. This prompted the company to raise its annual earnings forecast to \u00a4620 million to \u00a4650 million, up from \u00a4523 million in 2013.Late last year, the 29-year-old carrier \u2014 whose brand once drew criticisms for gruff service and other indignities of budget air travel \u2014 embarked on an aggressive charm offensive on social media and invested in a raft of improvements, including a revamped website, a new mobile booking application and reductions in certain charges like baggage fees.This month, Ryanair said it would introduce services in October aimed at luring more business travelers, including flexible fares, fast-track security and reserved seating.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Cameron, Tory Convention Gets Off to Rocky Start", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain faced a double embarrassment on Sunday, as his Conservative Party opened its final convention before May\u2019s general election trailing the opposition Labour Party in the polls.Mr. Cameron lost one member of Parliament as a defector to the nationalist U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, and a junior minister to an Anthony Weiner-style scandal involving photographs of normally private parts.The minister, Brooks Newmark, was \u2014 in a long British tradition \u2014 caught by The Sunday Mirror in a sting when Mr. Newmark sent sexually explicit photographs of himself to a male reporter posing on social media as Sophie, a young woman working for the Conservatives.But Mr. Cameron\u2019s other embarrassment \u2014 coming just before the opening of the Conservative conference in Birmingham \u2014 is more politically damaging. The legislator who defected to the UKIP, Mark Reckless, resigned his seat, setting up a by-election before the general election for his southern England constituency of Rochester and Strood.Mr. Reckless, who wants Britain to withdraw from the European Union, is considered likely to win the by-election, bolstering the Independence Party\u2019s credibility and possibly becoming its second member of Parliament. Another Tory legislator, Douglas Carswell, a friend of Mr. Reckless\u2019s, defected to the UKIP last month and is expected to win his by-election in Clacton on Oct. 9.Mr. Cameron can afford to lose both seats, but the rise of the Independence Party, which also wants severe restrictions on immigration, has created problems for the Conservatives next May. The UKIP is unlikely to win more than a handful of seats, if that, but it may take away voters the Tories need to win marginal seats, especially as many Liberal Democratic voters, unhappy with that party\u2019s junior coalition role in government, are leaning toward voting Labour.Mr. Reckless, explaining his defection on Saturday, said that \u201cpeople feel ignored, taken for granted, overtaxed, overregulated, ripped off and lied to.\u201d He said Mr. Cameron had not kept his promises to reduce immigration sharply and added: \u201cI do feel that the leadership of the Conservative Party is part of the problem that is holding our country back.\u201dIn television interviews on Sunday, Mr. Cameron said the defection of Mr. Reckless was \u201csenseless and counterproductive.\u201d Since the UKIP cannot win power, Mr. Cameron argued, the only way that those opposed to European Union membership can get a referendum on the matter is for the Conservatives to win. Mr. Cameron, who has a large anti-European Union bloc in his party, has vowed that if he remains prime minister, he will authorize an \u201cin or out\u201d referendum in 2017.The defection was \u201cfrustrating,\u201d Mr. Cameron told the BBC. \u201cTo act in a way that makes the Conservative government less likely is senseless and counterproductive.\u201d But he admitted that it had \u201cnot been an ideal start\u201d to the conference.Mr. Cameron wants to use the party conference, where he will speak on Wednesday, to rally the troops ahead of a difficult election on May 7. He has managed to keep the United Kingdom together, as Scottish voters rejected independence in a referendum, and on Friday, he won a vote in Parliament authorizing British airstrikes against the Islamic State.More important, the British economy is turning around, growing faster than that of any country in the eurozone, and unemployment is falling. But the British deficit remains high, despite cuts to public spending, and real wages are not rising, since many of the new jobs are low paying.Still, the economic revival has pushed the Labour Party, in its conference last week, to concentrate on strengthening the National Health Service and on the issue of social inequality, arguing that Mr. Cameron governs \u201cfor the privileged few.\u201dThe Conservatives fare far better than Labour in public opinion polls on questions of managing the economy, but far worse than Labour on the issue of protecting the National Health Service, said Patrick Dunleavy, a professor at the London School of Economics.The Conservatives are also hurt by the rise of the UKIP and by the demographics of Britain\u2019s constituencies, which favor Labour. Mr. Cameron, in a struggle with his coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, failed to get a redrawing of constituency lines, and Labour is thought to be able to win a parliamentary majority with some 34 or 35 percent of the vote, while the Conservatives will need nearly 40 percent, Mr. Dunleavy said.Still, Labour\u2019s advantage now is small for an opposition party and is expected to shrink as the election approaches. The party\u2019s leader, Ed Miliband, is viewed as uncharismatic, his approval rating is lower than Mr. Cameron\u2019s and many do not consider him a potential prime minister. And while it is considered more likely now that Labour will emerge as the largest party in Parliament in May and form a government, no one is ruling out another coalition government led by the Conservatives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "NATO Plans a Special Force to Reassure Eastern Europe and Deter Russia", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWPORT, Wales \u2014 NATO struggled to find responses to new challenges as it concluded its summit meeting here on Friday, announcing limited steps to deter Russia in Eastern Europe and starting to marshal broader international support to confront radical Islamists in the Middle East.The alliance said it would establish a rapid-reaction force with an essentially permanent presence in Eastern Europe and would enhance military cooperation with Ukraine.But the limits of the alliance were visible, too. The United States and Britain used the meeting to try to advance their own emerging policies, especially toward the spread of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, while most members shied away from specific commitments to increase military spending.The combination of crises \u2014 one on NATO\u2019s borders with a resurgent Russia and the other involving a possible new terrorism threat from radical Islam \u2014 represents the first major challenge to NATO in a quarter of a century. Though many words were said about the need to \u201creinvigorate and refocus\u201d the alliance, as the host, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain put it, the summit meeting made only a small step toward doing so.There must be \u201cfollow-through on the ground,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe are hopeful, but based on past experience also skeptical that, in fact, the separatists will follow through and the Russians will stop violating Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. So it has to be tested.\u201dIt was clear from the start that NATO would neither deploy military force against Russia in Ukraine nor offer Ukraine any credible path toward membership in the alliance. Despite the harsh language about Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, accusations against Mr. Putin of duplicity and statements of support for Ukraine and its president, Petro O. Poroshenko, the real effort of NATO here was to reassure those of its own members geographically closest to Russia that the alliance would come to their defense, if necessary.Those Eastern European members said they came away from Wales reassured, but for Ukraine, a NATO partner but not a member, there was mostly moral support. No NATO country, let alone the alliance itself, is prepared to provide Ukraine with lethal military equipment to fight Russia and the rebels, and Mr. Poroshenko was being urged essentially to make the best deal he could with Russia\u2019s proxies while working for a more inclusive Ukrainian constitution and new parliamentary elections.There were pledges of about $20 million for trust funds to help Ukraine\u2019s military, and different countries were urged to help in various ways with nonlethal equipment and intelligence. And the United States and the European Union tried to put more pressure on Moscow by threatening to put new economic sanctions in place, probably early next week, a move that has nothing to do with NATO, which is a military organization. But sanctions have a longer-term effect while troops move quickly on the ground.And Mr. Poroshenko, with his forces at risk of losing a major port, Mariupol, in the end has endorsed a truce that seems to leave the status of eastern Ukraine uncertain and will probably be sharply criticized at home. NATO, rather than strongly bolstering Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s position, in some sense encouraged him to negotiate with the very rebels, \u201cthe terrorists,\u201d as the Kiev government calls them, with whom he had said he would never negotiate.If Ukraine fell into a security no man\u2019s land, this NATO meeting more directly addressed important issues of deterrence and reassurance, making it clear to Moscow that any interference or \u201chybrid\u201d attack on a NATO member, even one with a large Russian minority, would produce a strong collective military response. It was also because of NATO that France decided to suspend its delivery of Mistral amphibious assault ships to Russia, a contract that had been signed years ago but became a large embarrassment for the current government because of Russian actions in Ukraine.As advertised, NATO on Friday approved plans for a 4,000-member rapid-reaction force, based in Eastern Europe and initially led by the British, to reassure existing members near Russia that the principle of collective defense remains sacrosanct.NATO\u2019s secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said the upgraded force, a spearhead for a larger reaction force, would send a clear message to potential aggressors, namely Russia, and represent \u201ca continuous presence.\u201d\u201cShould you even think of attacking one ally, you will be facing the whole alliance,\u201d he declared as a two-day summit meeting in southern Wales drew to a close.Earlier Friday, the Obama administration said it had formed a coalition of countries to oppose Sunni militants with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, unveiling a military and political campaign that officials said could eventually be a model for fighting extremist groups around the world.But some diplomats said they were uncomfortable using a summit meeting of the 28-nation alliance as a backdrop for a smaller group with no NATO imprimatur and, except for Turkey, no named Muslim partners.Ukraine remained the prime issue for the alliance, with peace talks in Minsk, Belarus, where Ukraine, Russia and pro-Russian rebels produced what appeared to be an agreement for a cease-fire. Western leaders remain skeptical about whether the truce will last. They intend to go ahead with new sanctions on Russia, leaders at the meeting in Wales said. The European Union can suspend the new sanctions later, if Moscow withdraws its troops from Ukraine and observes the cease-fire, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said.A cease-fire declaration is not enough, Ms. Merkel said. Verification is needed to determine whether the cease-fire is being carried out, whether Russian troops are being withdrawn and whether a buffer zone is established. \u201cEverything is in flux,\u201d she said. \u201cTherefore we should expect that these sanctions could indeed be put into force, but with the proviso that they can be suspended again if this process really takes place.\u201dBritain\u2019s foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, told the BBC he favored immediately imposing the sanctions and then lifting them if the cease-fire held.NATO also grappled with the unwillingness of most of its members to meet their commitments to spend an amount equivalent to 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, an issue on which the United States, which bears most of the alliance\u2019s costs, has become increasingly outspoken. The meeting yielded no new binding commitments for individual nations to move quickly to meet the defense spending target. But the alliance did agree to stop cutting defense spending, to spend more in real terms as their economies grew and to reach the 2 percent target within a decade. Members were also encouraged to spend at least 20 percent of their defense spending on equipment and research, not just on salaries and benefits.\u201cRussia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine is a wake-up call,\u201d Mr. Rasmussen said. The crisis had led the governments of NATO-allied nations \u201cto reconsider defense investment because it\u2019s now obvious that we cannot take our security for granted,\u201d he said.On Russia, the NATO communiqu\u00e9 condemned Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and military incursion into eastern Ukraine and continued the suspension of \u201call practical civilian and military cooperation\u201d with Russia, although diplomatic conversations would continue.\u201cWe continue to believe that a partnership between NATO and Russia based on respect for international law would be of strategic value. We continue to aspire to a cooperative, constructive relationship with Russia,\u201d the alliance said, but \u201cin a Europe where each country freely chooses its future.\u201dBritain also said it would supply 1,000 personnel, including a brigade headquarters, for the new rapid-reaction force. In addition, 3,500 British troops will take part in NATO exercises in Eastern Europe through 2015, though there may be some overlap between the two commitments.NATO announced that its next summit meeting, in 2016, would be in Warsaw.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "If 2 New Yorkers Shared a Cab ...", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt may be anathema to New Yorkers. But a team of mathematicians and engineers has calculated that if taxi riders were willing to share a cab, New York City could reduce the current fleet of 13,500 taxis up to 40 percent, in that way unclogging traffic, conserving fuel and fighting air pollution.The researchers wanted to know whether the principles of the \u201csharing economy\u201d typified by services like Airbnb, in which people rent out their apartments like hotel rooms, could be applied to taxis.To study ride-sharing scenarios, the researchers delved into a database compiled by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission that included information about each of the 172 million taxi rides in the city in 2011: where the passenger was picked up and dropped off, time of pickup and time of drop-off.Then, applying a computational technique known as shareability networks, they combined trips that were headed in the same direction at the same time without taking the passengers too far out of their way.They found that sharing would reduce the number of trips, and the number of taxis, by 40 percent and that passengers would still arrive in the same amount of time, give or take a few minutes. (The analysis did not look at how many people were riding in each cab. Newer data does include the number of passengers.)\u201cYou can think about the matching of two trips as a chemical reaction between two molecules, which is a function of their concentration,\u201d Dr. Ratti saidThe team acknowledged that such a system could not be implemented without changes in the way people hail taxis.Much of the inefficiency in the current system results from a driver\u2019s not knowing the destination until after the pickup. The same inefficiency occurs with elevators in office buildings, where some end up stopping at every floor while others speed to a single floor without interruption.In some newer buildings, riders press the floor button in the lobby, and the elevator system can use computer algorithms to allocate the rides more efficiently. Similarly, if a taxi passenger specified a destination before being picked up, a sophisticated dispatching system could begin figuring out which rides could be shared.Smartphone apps, already used by taxi services like Uber and Lyft, could make that possible. Indeed, both companies recently announced shared-ride services, named Uberpool and Lyft Line. Chelsea Wilson, a communications manager at Lyft, said its service was started after data showed that 90 percent of Lyft rides in San Francisco had someone else taking the same trip within five minutes.\u201cWhen you look at this on a map, it starts to look like a transit line,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are creating with Lyft Line: shared, personal transit.\u201dDr. Ratti said that if self-driving cars ever came to pass, the transformation of cities could be \u201cquite astonishing.\u201dIn preliminary research not reported in the current paper, the scientists looked at what would happen if most people combined self-driving cars with shared ridership. They concluded that four out of five cars in the city today could become superfluous.The team also looked at a subset of the New York database and determined that ride sharing would provide environmental and cost benefits even in smaller cities.Mason A. Porter, a professor of nonlinear and complex systems at the University of Oxford who was not involved with the research, praised the study, saying, \u201cIt definitely looks promising to use this perspective as one of the ways to examine the issue of transportation and ride-sharing.\u201dOthers were more skeptical, noting that the researchers had not fine-tuned their calculations for some real-world complications. Luis M. A. Bettencourt, a professor at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, said the study made sense \u201ctechnically,\u201d but he wondered about unintended consequences.If ride sharing induced people to abandon subways and buses, it could actually worsen traffic and pollution, he said, adding that there would be debates about the potential of putting thousands of taxi drivers out of work.\u201cThis is not to say that it should not be done,\u201d Dr. Bettencourt said, \u201cbut one would have to think these through some more and try them out in practice, I think.\u201dOn the streets of New York City, the skepticism sounded more like a Bronx cheer.\u201cThe whole thing strikes me as silly, and it will be ignored,\u201d said Gene Salomon, the author of the 2013 book \u201cConfessions of a New York Taxi Driver.\u201dIn his 36 years as a cabby, Mr. Salomon said he had watched many ride-sharing programs come and go. The problem, he went on, is that passengers would rather pay extra for a private ride than split a fare with someone they\u2019ve never met.\u201cNew Yorkers do not like to share cabs,\u201d he said.The Taxi and Limousine Commission has expressed concern that commercial ride-sharing programs, especially those that crowdsource to recruit vehicles and drivers, may lack rigorous oversight.\u201cWe have made our position quite clear. You must use T.L.C.-licensed drivers, in T.L.C.-licensed vehicles dispatched by licensed bases,\u201d Allan Fromberg, the agency\u2019s deputy commissioner for public affairs, wrote in an email.The researchers acknowledge that many people have a visceral reluctance to hop into a taxi with strangers, but they said their work provided a numerical foundation for future debates. \u201cPeople would need to know what the payoff would be,\u201d Dr. Ratti said. \u201cThen society could decide if it wants to go that way or not.\u201dDr. Strogatz agreed. \u201cThese are tricky problems to think about,\u201d he said, \u201cand they\u2019re not math problems, exactly.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about a study on the effects of taxi-ride sharing in New York City referred incorrectly at one point to an expert who commented on the findings. As the article noted elsewhere, the expert, Luis M. A. Bettencourt of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, is a man \u2014 not \u201cshe.\u201d And the caption for a map with the article, showing taxi pickups and drop-offs in the city, misstated the year the data was collected. It was 2011, not 2001.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Rhine Valley, Clamoring for Relief From Ramped-Up Rail", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLinz Am Rhein JournalTrain tracks still run through the towns up and down the flat banks of the mighty Rhine River, but their load has changed. Instead of passengers, nearly two-thirds of all trains today carry chemical tanks, bins filled with coal, or flatbeds laden with rolls of steel.There are also a lot more of them these days, stirring up resentment in riverside towns like this one of half-timbered houses, whose view of the water, just beyond the 14th century Rheintor tower, is cut by elevated train tracks.From beside the fountain in the cobbled square of Linz am Rhein on a recent afternoon, a low grumble could be heard in the distance. Within seconds it had grown to a roar as a freight train clattered along the tracks.The Rhine Valley has become a vital stretch along Europe\u2019s most important north-south rail route amid a European Union-wide effort to move more freight away from the Continent\u2019s congested roads. The Rhine-Alpine Corridor, put into service in 2007, links two of Europe\u2019s most important industrial regions, the North Sea ports of Antwerp, Rotterdam and Amsterdam with the port in Genoa, Italy.But many in Linz and neighboring towns fear these measures will not do enough to limit noise to tolerable levels.On Saturday, more than 600 people from up and down the valley gathered outside the main train station in Bonn to demand their right to peace and quiet. Norbert R\u00f6ttgen, a senior member of Ms. Merkel\u2019s party and native of the region, pledged to mobilize lawmakers in Berlin.Karen Schmitz, whose home is less than a block off the railway tracks in nearby Leubsdorf, was recently awakened in the middle of the night by the bone-rattling screech of metal on metal as a freight train ground to a halt. Several minutes later it rattled into action again. No sooner had it cleared the tracks, she said, than the clatter of the next one made its approach known.\u201cWe can\u2019t think of sleep, although we have to wake up again for work at 6 a.m.,\u201d she wrote in a letter to Against Train Noise. \u201cHow can it be that everyone in the country is beholden to keep the peace at night, but not the trains?\u201dIn fact, dozens of laws in Germany regulate noise. Owners of loud dogs can be held liable for late-night barking, and many municipalities prohibit car alarms\u2019 blaring during sleeping hours. Other localities order drivers to reduce their speed on city streets after 10 p.m., and most airports are barred from allowing commercial flights to take off and land for several hours between midnight and dawn.But from the days when they were a public monopoly, trains have enjoyed special status. A decades-old law granting trains the right to make more noise than other vehicles was scrapped only last year. And in environment-sensitive Germany, rail traffic is embraced, as it emits fewer greenhouse gases than other modes of transport.Opponents argue that there is a limit to how much priority should be given to environmental benefits over the welfare of residents and the local economy.The Rhine Valley is, after all, an attraction for tourists from around the world, who hope to catch a strain of the mythical siren\u2019s song from the Lorelei Cliff that soars above the swirling green-gray waters at the narrowest point of the river.

{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Migration Crisis ", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialUnusually calm seas in the Mediterranean and stagnant European economies are contributing to a perfect storm over migration. Another problem is a treaty between Britain and France that allows British border guards to check passports in France. With Britain a prime destination for many migrants, Calais, the French port city, has found itself overwhelmed with new arrivals, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea. Violent turmoil in Libya, a major departure point for migrants attempting to reach Europe across the Mediterranean, is causing panic, and traffickers are overloading boats. On Friday, 19 migrants were rescued from a boat that sank off the coast of Libya and had been carrying 270 people. Meanwhile, Spain is blaming Morocco for a surge of some 1,000 migrants that made it across the Strait of Gibraltar on calm seas within a single 48-hour period last month. Morocco is reeling from its role as a staging ground for people attempting to reach Europe, many by climbing the razor-wire topped fences that surround Spain\u2019s North African territories of Ceuta and Melilla. Italy is at the breaking point. More than 100,000 people have arrived in Italy from North Africa since the beginning of this year. Italy says it has rescued 4,000 migrants over one weekend in August alone. Only an end to terror and conflict in Syria, Iraq and Libya and a significant improvement in African living standards would stem the flow of desperate people from Africa and the Middle East who are reaching Europe. That, unfortunately, is not likely to happen in the immediate future. Europe has a crisis on its hands that is feeding the rise of populist anti-immigration parties and ugly xenophobia across the Continent. The European Union needs to reform a migration policy that clearly is not working. Besides more and faster search-and-rescue operations at sea, Europe must provide legal avenues to safety, lest more migrants lose their lives on deadly journeys. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Poverty Rate Tells Us About the Overall Economy", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRecovery in Need of a RecoveryOn Tuesday, the Census Bureau will tell us whether the share of population that\u2019s officially in poverty went up, down or stayed the same in 2013. There\u2019s tons of other data in the release, like the change in the real income for the median household and information on health insurance coverage.Because the data is a year old, financial markets ignore it. But political markets pay a lot of attention, as do policy analysts and advocates who work on poverty and middle-class economics. And, of course, these being the early days of the Affordable Care Act, the health coverage data will doubtless also get a close look. My own interest is that of the policy wonk who focuses on the nexus between the overall, or macro, economy and living standards of middle- and low-income families.It\u2019s an important set of numbers. Although one must always be careful not to read too much into one year\u2019s data, 2013 represents the fourth full year of an economic recovery that officially began in the second half of 2009. Yet this recovery has been uniquely unforthcoming for the poor, the unemployed and even many people in the middle class.Poverty, as officially measured, has held steady at about 15 percent of the population since 2010, and unfortunately, I expect it to do so again this year. I expect the real median household income to do a little better, up by maybe 1 percent.Why, if I\u2019m right, should the poor and middle class have gained so little by Year 4 of the recovery? That relates to the answer I tend to give when someone asks me how the economy is doing: Whose economy are you talking about?Yes, various indicators improved in 2013. Real G.D.P. was up, but no faster than the year before (a bit above 2 percent); same with payrolls. And while the unemployment rate fell seven-tenths of a percentage point in 2013, from 8.1 percent to 7.4 percent, more than half of that was from people dropping out of the labor force. That\u2019s not exactly a sign of strength. In fact, the share of the working-age population with a job barely budged last year.The real wages of low-wage workers were generally as torpid in 2013. For example, if we look at the hourly wage of those in the bottom third of the pay scale, it averaged a bit above $10 per hour over both 2012 and 2013. However, a stagnant low wage is actually an improvement, because real low wages fell sharply earlier in the recovery. And the real median hourly wage went up 1 percent last year, providing a slight bump to the middle class.Government policy didn\u2019t help much in 2013, though the official poverty rate captures only some of the antipoverty spending by federal and state governments. For example, unemployment insurance benefits are counted, but the value of nutritional support or the earned- income tax credit (a wage subsidy for low-wage earners) is not.Fiscal drag \u2014 fiscal policy that slows economic growth \u2014 was actually a big negative last year, taking 1.5 percentage points off economic growth by most estimates. The relevant parts of that policy for low- and middle-income households would include the ending of a tax break for wage earners (the payroll tax holiday) and less in unemployment insurance benefits.I used statistical models that forecast the 2013 poverty rate based on the movements of the variables discussed above. Because it\u2019s hard to make a case that the rising tide lifted too many rowboats last year, the models I run predict no statistically significant change in the poverty rate. (The rate could tick down a tenth or two, but that would be statistically indistinguishable from no change at all).That said, there\u2019s some chance the poverty rate will come down more than I expect. First, there\u2019s just the momentum of a cyclical variable: Eventually the recovery sprinkles at least some of its benefits on low-income households and poverty falls a bit.Also, there were some changes in the composition of the population last year relative to earlier years that could push the rate down. There was slower growth in immigration and a smaller share of the population in mother-only households (both groups have higher-than-average poverty rates).Finally, inflation was low in 2013, only 1.5 percent, and that means a smaller nominal gain in income becomes a larger real gain. That\u2019s one reason I predict that nominal median household income grew a bit faster than 2 percent last year. So it is possible they eked out a small real gain thanks in part to such minimal price growth. I expect real growth in the median household income in the 0.5 to 1 percent range.It\u2019s important to put these results in historical context. I expect poverty to still be 2.4 percentage points above its rate of 12.5 percent in 2007; that\u2019s an additional 7.5 million poor. And even if I\u2019m right about the bump in the real median income, it will still be 7.6 percent below the 2007 level, representing a loss of over $4,000.In other words, if I\u2019m in the ballpark, Tuesday\u2019s release will be another reminder of why many Americans still feel pretty gloomy about the recovery: It hasn\u2019t much reached them.Advertisement"}

We are No. 1 in poverty.\u201d\u201cHe likes to make the construct that we\u2019re not making progress,\u201d Mr. Brown said of his opponent. \u201cWell, we are making progress. A lot of people forget the mess California was in just four years ago.\u201d\u201cI love this state, and I know it works,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I can tell you in the last four years, we haven\u2019t solved all the problems, but boy, what momentum we have.\u201dBy the end of the hour, the men had painted such different portraits of California that it was hard to believe they were seeking to lead the same state, as Mr. Brown noted.\u201cSome of this makes you wonder if this is California, or are we in Arkansas or Mississippi?\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThis is the eighth-largest economy in the world. Before I became governor it was the ninth largest.\u201dAt 76, Mr. Brown is seeking his second consecutive term as governor; the state\u2019s term limits bar him from serving a third. (He was also governor during the late 1970s.)By any measure, the debate Thursday was spirited, and it often verged out of control as the two men talked over each other. Mr. Kashkari, in particular, spoke over the panelists, often pivoting off their questions to attack his opponent.Mr. Kashkari said Mr. Brown\u2019s response to a court order to reduce the state\u2019s prison population \u2014 he ordered lower-risk offenders moved to county jails \u2014 was a failure and was leading to increased crime. When Mr. Brown said he would sign a bill just passed by the Legislature that would impose a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags, Mr. Kashkari said he would veto it if he were governor and cited it as an example of Sacramento wasting time while the state was in trouble.Again and again, Mr. Kashkari criticized the ambitious high-speed rail project from San Francisco to Los Angeles that Mr. Brown has pushed even as it has lost popularity with voters and some lawmakers, and even as Republicans in Washington have said they would refuse to fund it. Mr. Kashkari said he would cancel the project if elected and cast it as Mr. Brown\u2019s personal crusade.\u201cMake no mistake about it: He is raising your gas prices, you at home, he\u2019s raising your gas prices to create the vanity project, what I call the crazy train,\u201d he said.In a moment that captured both his tactics and his choice of issue, Mr. Kashkari ignored a question about his political vulnerability and used his answer to attack the train project. \u201cI think the question was, \u2018Neel, how do you expect to win?\u2019 \u201d Mr. Brown said when it was his turn to speak. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Neel, you don\u2019t have much expectation to win, because things have been accomplished in Sacramento.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Brown said Mr. Kashkari had offered no programs to help the poor or the middle class. He also repeatedly invoked Mr. Kashkari\u2019s years on Wall Street and his tenure overseeing the bank bailout program under President George W. Bush.When asked about his opponent\u2019s \u201ccrazy train\u201d reference, Mr. Brown responded by invoking the banking crisis, using the kind of populist rhetoric for which he was known earlier in his career. \u201cI think he\u2019s more familiar with the gravy train back in Washington that paid out $30 billion in bonuses, and he sat back while it happened,\u201d Mr. Brown said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Years Later, Chrysler\u2019s Gamble on Ram Trucks Is Paying Off ", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARREN, Mich. \u2014 In December, the sprawling, four million-square-foot factory here where workers assemble Ram pickup trucks, along conveyors that weave for more than 30 miles, suddenly went quiet.Thousands of workers looked on where a makeshift stage, draped in black, had been assembled. Sergio Marchionne, Chrysler Group\u2019s chairman and chief executive, stepped up to address the crowd.Mr. Marchionne was there to acknowledge an industry award for the truck, but, more important, to convey a simple message to the workers: well done.\u201cToday I wanted to come to Warren to personally thank all of you,\u201d he said, and in his signature style joked about the criticism that followed his decision in 2009 to create the stand-alone Ram division. \u201cThe skeptics, who were already predicting our company was going down the tubes, thought for sure that we\u2019d been smoking something funny.\u201dFive years later, the verdict is in: The gamble paid off. Ram trucks have captured an ever-greater share of the full-size pickup market dominated in the past by General Motors and Ford, and are on track to seize even more. By adding innovative features not found in other pickups, and aggressive pricing to lure truck buyers, who are among the most loyal in the automotive business, Chrysler\u2019s Ram has managed to go from also-ran to a threat in only a few years.Here in Warren, the plant is now churning out Ram pickups 20 hours a day, six days a week, with occasional Sundays \u2014 barely able to keep up with demand.In the fourth quarter of 2009, when the new Ram division\u2019s trucks were hitting the streets, the company eked out a paltry 11 percent of the market share for full-size trucks. The two other Detroit automakers were lapping Chrysler around the track, with shares of 42 percent for G.M. and 37 percent for Ford. Since then Ram has conquered more and more of the market every year. In August, when sales surged 33 percent over a year earlier, Ram commanded 21 percent of full-size pickup purchases in the United States.Reid Bigland, Chrysler\u2019s head of United States sales and head of the Ram division from April 2013 to last month, said that what made the new division different was an intense focus on pickups, which under the Dodge umbrella and its muscle-car heritage had never quite received their due.\u201cSelling trucks is just a different business than cars,\u201d Mr. Bigland said, \u201cand we had a group of people who could come to work and do nothing but think about pickup trucks.\u201dOne result was features competitors did not have, like air suspensions, cargo cameras, eight-speed transmissions and, last year, a diesel engine that gets 28 miles a gallon on the highway.On the factory floor itself, new, lean manufacturing methods transplanted from Fiat began revolutionizing the Warren plant\u2019s operations \u2014 not only creating more efficient ways of building vehicles and increasing quality but also giving workers a stake in decision-making.\u201cThe floor has a voice now,\u201d said Tracie Fern, a Warren worker who helps find ways to make jobs on the assembly line more efficient. \u201cWhen someone has a suggestion, they listen to us.\u201dGo back to the 1980s, and the Dodge Ram was not even an also-ran. \u201cIt was just a blip on the radar back then,\u201d said Karl Brauer, senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. \u201cFord and Chevy didn\u2019t think about, or care about, what Ram was doing.\u201dThe first real attention-grabber was the 1994 Ram, which featured the aggressive, curved \u201cbig rig\u201d look the Ram still incorporates today. But while the muscular design change drew attention and increased sales, the truck languished in a distant third.When the stand-alone experiment began in 2009, the near-death experience of the bankruptcy and taxpayer bailout had left its mark on Chrysler. Ram executives said they knew they would have to deliver results, and quickly.\u201cYou either come out swinging or you roll over,\u201d said Robert Hegbloom, a Ram executive who last month became head of the brand. (Mr. Bigland was tapped to lead Fiat\u2019s Alfa Romeo unit in North America.)A conference room in the basement of Chrysler\u2019s headquarters was turned into a makeshift \u201cRam war room.\u201d The new team members gathered regularly to brainstorm ideas, figure out ways for the trucks to distinguish themselves, and perhaps most important, zero in on what truck buyers wanted.Mr. Marchionne, well known for his blunt style and attention to detail, held monthly meetings with the Ram executives, where he expected updates.For light-duty pickups, the team decided to hone in on a priority they were hearing from truck customers. \u201cIt was all about fuel economy,\u201d Mr. Hegbloom said, explaining that buyers used to willingly sacrifice gas mileage for hauling capability. Now they wanted both.Ram engineers went to work, and by adding a host of features \u2014 shutters that close the front grille at high speeds to reduce drag, an eight-speed transmission and ultimately a new turbodiesel engine \u2014 they managed to increase the trucks\u2019 hauling performance while also topping the charts on fuel economy.Designers also focused on upgrading the interiors. That was because the nature of pickup trucks was changing. A pickup used to be a bare-bones affair: Bench seats were common, back seats generally nonexistent. Now, so-called crew cabs are ubiquitous, and the comfort and technology match those of any sport utility vehicle.\u201cThey\u2019re really a lot like luxury vehicles these days,\u201d said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst with Edmunds.com. Jeff Jagoda, a fourth-generation autoworker, now at the Ram factory in Warren, has seen the evolution firsthand. He bought his first truck in 1975, and with its crank windows, bench seat and exposed steel inside, he said the last word to describe it would be luxury. \u201cWhen I brought it home my mother said: \u2018What are you doing with this thing? You\u2019re not a farmer,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what trucks used to be, something people bought to get work done, nothing more. Today, they\u2019re something else entirely; you\u2019ve got all the comforts of home if you want.\u201dSean Kilmain, who lives on Cape Cod in Massachusetts, bought his new Ram 1500 in July after test-driving Ford and G.M. trucks. He said he wanted something that could be comfortable for family skiing trips to Vermont but also capable of towing his boat or hauling gear.\u201cWhen you\u2019re looking to take two dogs and your nephews along for the ride, space becomes an issue,\u201d Mr. Kilmain said. \u201cThis will be the truck that we take places.\u201d What sold him on the Ram, he said, was that he felt the truck offered more features for less money than the competition, and that the fuel economy was also impressive.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to get a gas guzzler, but also wanted something that could do pretty much anything I wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cHaul some stuff, carry some people.\u201dMr. Brauer, the Kelley Blue Book analyst, predicted that Ram might give G.M. a run for its money, and could possibly seize the No. 2 spot in coming years \u2014 something that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.\u201cFord is just a monster in the pickup category, and always will be. But what we could see is a Ford main show, with G.M. and Ram left to fight it out,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then Ram is winning.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Looking Beyond China, Some Companies Shift Personnel", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySINGAPORE \u2014 General Motors moved the headquarters of its international division here from Shanghai last month. Archer Daniels Midland, the agribusiness giant, is gradually doing the same with its Asia and Pacific operations. Other multinationals, like IBM, have shifted staff members here from China for a few functions, like treasury operations.\u201cI\u2019m going to spend a lot of time going back and forth \u2014 the five-hour flight is going to be my monthly bus trip,\u201d said Ismael Roig, the president of Archer Daniels Midland\u2019s Asia and Pacific operations.The moves reflect the broader evolution of China, now the world\u2019s largest market for cars, flat-panel televisions and scores of other products. The Chinese economy has become so large and affluent that companies increasingly treat it like Europe, with reports going directly to head offices in home countries and no longer lumped in with those from developing countries.\u201cWe are big in China, and we want to be,\u201d said Stefan Jacoby, the president of General Motors International. His division, which officially moved here on Aug. 5, no longer includes the company\u2019s China operations, but encompasses G.M. subsidiaries in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Australia and South Korea.The many frustrations of doing business in China have made some difference in the plans to move executives here \u2014 choking air pollution, countless regulations that favor local competitors and weak protection for intellectual property. A rising wave of economic nationalism has also manifested itself in large-scale raids on the Chinese offices of multinationals in the automotive, pharmaceutical and technology sectors. Police officials are copying large numbers of computer hard drives and interrogating employees without allowing access to legal advice.More important, many multinationals are starting to pay renewed attention to Southeast Asia, which is showing signs of revival 17 years after the Asian financial crisis. They have found it hard to do that from Shanghai or Beijing. Each major city has no more than one flight a day to Jakarta, Indonesia, for example. And China\u2019s diplomatic and trade ties to Southeast Asia have been strained by its increasingly assertive claims to control over practically all of the South China Sea.The reasons for companies to shift headquarters to Singapore, \u201crelate to the growth opportunities in Asia Pacific beyond just China,\u201d said Keat Chuan Yeoh, the managing director of the Economic Development Board, Singapore\u2019s investment promotion agency.Philipp R\u00f6sler, a former vice chancellor of Germany who is now a managing director of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said the forum had been surprised by the number of its member companies that had said in the last several months that they were considering moving their local or regional headquarters out of mainland China.But so far, it has not translated into a mass exodus. Two of the largest corporate leasing brokers in Singapore \u2014 the New York-based Cushman & Wakefield and the Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle \u2014 each say they see no sign of large-scale moves by multinationals from mainland China or Hong Kong to Singapore.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a huge long list of people moving out of China; that isn\u2019t what we see at all,\u201d said Chris Archibold, the head of Singapore leasing for Jones Lang LaSalle.Many American companies that rushed to open Asia headquarters in Shanghai a decade ago now regret it but are leery of antagonizing the Chinese government by moving out, said the chief executive of a Western company who spoke on the condition of anonymity.History looms large. Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong\u2019s leading British company for more than a century, moved its incorporation to Bermuda in the 1980s and delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1994, before the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty. Those decisions prompted retaliation by Beijing, which hindered the company\u2019s ability to make large investments in mainland China for more than a decade.For now, the operations being moved here remain tiny, even microscopic, compared with those remaining in China.Archer Daniels Midland has built a large team in Shanghai that can negotiate acquisitions of agribusiness factories in China, do due diligence and conduct audits, Mr. Roig said. So the top priority now for the company in Asia is to develop the same capability in the growing Indonesian and Vietnamese markets.Singapore is a two-hour flight from Jakarta and from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Singapore also has tax laws that favor commodities trading operations and agreements with other countries that make it relatively easy to resolve trading disputes with companies elsewhere.But most of Mr. Roig\u2019s subordinates remain in Shanghai. Similarly, only 40 G.M. managers and executives have moved from Shanghai to Singapore, and the entire international operations headquarters occupies a single floor of a downtown office building.Companies are finding it easier to persuade talented managers to move to Singapore, with its fairly clean air, than to Shanghai. Zhang Xin, the chief executive of SOHO China, the leading developer of top-end office buildings in Beijing and Shanghai, said she was stunned when three-fifths of the mostly European teenagers and the coach at her son\u2019s soccer club in Beijing all moved out of China this summer, a shift that she attributed to air pollution.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in its wide-ranging annual position paper, released in Beijing on Tuesday, that eight of its member companies had reported rising difficulties in persuading talented staff to move to China, particularly because of air pollution.Shortages of spaces at English-language schools have also been an issue elsewhere. Singapore has prevented local families from enrolling their children in the elementary school and junior high grades at the city\u2019s international schools, avoiding the overcrowding that has afflicted many such schools in mainland China and, particularly, Hong Kong.Chip Kimball, the superintendent of the highly regarded Singapore American School, said that more expatriates were moving to Singapore. But he noted that his school had experienced only a slight increase in demand because the government had arranged for a series of other international schools to open in the last five years.By contrast, \u201cthe bottleneck in Hong Kong right now is schooling,\u201d said May Tung, the head of the Hong Kong financial services practice of DHR International, a Chicago-based executive recruitment firm.While few headquarters are moving, and even fewer factories, multinationals do appear more cautious in adding further to their already numerous research centers in China.Companies like Procter & Gamble and Baxter Pharmaceuticals have been opening or expanding research and development centers and high-tech factories here in Singapore, although they also retain large operations in China.Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said the growth of Chinese technology companies like Baidu and Huawei meant that a constituency was growing in China for eventual improvements in intellectual property protection.The chief executive for Asia at another Western multinational, who insisted on anonymity because of the legal dangers in criticizing China openly, said that at many companies now, \u201cThey\u2019re just convinced if they open that R.&D. center in China, every technical secret they\u2019ve got will be copied, every patent will be exploited.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then, during an hour on the treadmill, Gates, a self-described nerd, would pass the time by watching DVDs from the Teaching Company\u2019s \u201cGreat Courses\u201d series. On some mornings, he would learn about geology or meteorology; on others, it would be oceanography or U.S. history.As Gates was working his way through the series, he stumbled upon a set of DVDs titled \u201cBig History\u201d \u2014 an unusual college course taught by a jovial, gesticulating professor from Australia named David Christian. Unlike the previous DVDs, \u201cBig History\u201d did not confine itself to any particular topic, or even to a single academic discipline. Instead, it put forward a synthesis of history, biology, chemistry, astronomy and other disparate fields, which Christian wove together into nothing less than a unifying narrative of life on earth. Standing inside a small \u201cMr. Rogers\"-style set, flanked by an imitation ivy-covered brick wall, Christian explained to the camera that he was influenced by the Annales School, a group of early-20th-century French historians who insisted that history be explored on multiple scales of time and space. Christian had subsequently divided the history of the world into eight separate \u201cthresholds,\u201d beginning with the Big Bang, 13 billion years ago (Threshold 1), moving through to the origin of Homo sapiens (Threshold 6), the appearance of agriculture (Threshold 7) and, finally, the forces that gave birth to our modern world (Threshold 8).Christian\u2019s aim was not to offer discrete accounts of each period so much as to integrate them all into vertiginous conceptual narratives, sweeping through billions of years in the span of a single semester. A lecture on the Big Bang, for instance, offered a complete history of cosmology, starting with the ancient God-centered view of the universe and proceeding through Ptolemy\u2019s Earth-based model, through the heliocentric versions advanced by thinkers from Copernicus to Galileo and eventually arriving at Hubble\u2019s idea of an expanding universe. In the worldview of \u201cBig History,\u201d a discussion about the formation of stars cannot help including Einstein and the hydrogen bomb; a lesson on the rise of life will find its way to Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey. \u201cI hope by the end of this course, you will also have a much better sense of the underlying unity of modern knowledge,\u201d Christian said at the close of the first lecture. \u201cThere is a unified account.\u201dAs Gates sweated away on his treadmill, he found himself marveling at the class\u2019s ability to connect complex concepts. \u201cI just loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very clarifying for me. I thought, God, everybody should watch this thing!\u201d At the time, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation had donated hundreds of millions of dollars to educational initiatives, but many of these were high-level policy projects, like the Common Core Standards Initiative, which the foundation was instrumental in pushing through. And Gates, who had recently decided to become a full-time philanthropist, seemed to pine for a project that was a little more tangible. He was frustrated with the state of interactive coursework and classroom technology since before he dropped out of Harvard in the mid-1970s; he yearned to experiment with entirely new approaches. \u201cI wanted to explore how you did digital things,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat was a big issue for me in terms of where education was going \u2014 taking my previous skills and applying them to education.\u201d Soon after getting off the treadmill, he asked an assistant to set a meeting with Christian.A few days later, the professor, who was lecturing at San Diego State University, found himself in the lobby of a hotel, waiting to meet with the billionaire. \u201cI was scared,\u201d Christian recalled. \u201cSomeone took me along the corridor, knocks on a door, Bill opens it, invites me in. All I remember is that within five minutes, he had so put me at my ease. I thought, I\u2019m a nerd, he\u2019s a nerd and this is fun!\u201d After a bit of small talk, Gates got down to business. He told Christian that he wanted to introduce \u201cBig History\u201d as a course in high schools all across America. He was prepared to fund the project personally, outside his foundation, and he wanted to be personally involved. \u201cHe actually gave me his email address and said, \u2018Just think about it,\u2019 \u201d Christian continued. \" \u2018Email me if you think this is a good idea.\u2019 \u201dChristian emailed to say that he thought it was a pretty good idea. The two men began tinkering, adapting Christian\u2019s college course into a high-school curriculum, with modules flexible enough to teach to freshmen and seniors alike. Gates, who insisted that the course include a strong digital component, hired a team of engineers and designers to develop a website that would serve as an electronic textbook, brimming with interactive graphics and videos. Gates was particularly insistent on the idea of digital timelines, which may have been vestige of an earlier passion project, Microsoft Encarta, the electronic encyclopedia that was eventually overtaken by the growth of Wikipedia. Now he wanted to offer a multifaceted historical account of any given subject through a friendly user interface. The site, which is open to the public, would also feature a password-protected forum for teachers to trade notes and update and, in some cases, rewrite lesson plans based on their experiences in the classroom.Gates, who had already learned about the limitations of large bureaucracies through his foundation, insisted that the course be pitched to individual schools, rather than to entire districts; that way, he reasoned, it could grow organically and improve as it did so, just like a start-up company. In 2011, the Big History Project debuted in five high schools, but in the three years since, Gates and Christian \u2014 along with a team of educational consultants, executives and teachers, mostly based in Seattle \u2014 have quietly accelerated its growth. This fall, the project will be offered free to more than 15,000 students in some 1,200 schools, from the Brooklyn School for Collaborative Studies in New York to Greenhills School in Ann Arbor, Mich., to Gates\u2019s alma mater, Lakeside Upper School in Seattle. And if all goes well, the Big History Project will be introduced in hundreds of more classrooms by next year and hundreds, if not thousands, more the year after that, scaling along toward the vision Gates first experienced on that treadmill. Last month, the University of California system announced that a version of the Big History Project course could be counted in place of a more traditional World History class, paving the way for the state\u2019s 1,300 high schools to offer it.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know when the last time was that somebody introduced a new course into high school,\u201d Gates told me. \u201cHow does one go about it? What did the guy who liked biology \u2014 who did he call and say, \u2018Hey, we should have biology in high school?\u2019 It was pretty uncharted territory. But it was pretty cool.\u201dBut by the early \u201870s, as the Vietnam War heightened interest in nations outside Europe, Western Civ was on the decline. In pedagogical circles, a book called \u201cThe Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community,\u201d by William Hardy McNeill, a historian at the University of Chicago, persuasively argued that Western Civ was not merely biased against other cultures but also failed to account for the enormous influence that cultures had on one another over the millenniums. In 1976, McNeill told a roomful of teachers at an American Historical Association meeting, \u201cI find the apathy truly amazing; suicidal; absurd.\u201dIn the wake of McNeill\u2019s rebuke, Western Civ was slowly replaced by World History, a more comparative class that stressed broad themes across cultures and disciplines. Over the past 30 years, World History has produced its own formidable academic institutions and journals; these days, three-quarters of all American students take World History. The course was just beginning its ascent as David Christian, then a young professor at Macquarie University in Sydney, was incubating his own form of cross-disciplinary scholarship. Christian, who was teaching a course on Russian history, liked to examine his subjects from a number of unconventional angles. In the 19th century, \u201con average, 40 percent of Russia\u2019s revenues came from vodka sales, so what I realized is that if Russians stopped drinking vodka, you can\u2019t pay for the army, and the superpower collapses,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo I thought, Here\u2019s a modern government building its power by selling a mind-altering substance. I was looking at it at the fiscal level, at the treasury level \u2014 but also in the village and also in the tavern.\u201dChristian began wondering if he could apply this everything-is-connected idea to a larger scale: \u201cI began thinking, Could I teach a course not of Russia but of humanity?\u201d He soon became infatuated with the concept. \u201cI remember the chain of thought,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to do prehistory, so I have to do some archaeology. But to do it seriously, I\u2019m going to talk about how humans evolved, so, yikes, I\u2019m in biology now. I thought: To do it seriously, I have to talk about how mammals evolved, how primates evolved. I have to go back to multicelled organisms, I have to go back to primeval slime. And then I thought: I have to talk about how life was created, how life appeared on earth! I have to talk geology, the history of the planet. And so you can see, this is pushing me back and back and back, until I realized there\u2019s a stopping point \u2014 which is the Big Bang.\u201d He paused. \u201cI thought, Boy, would that be exciting to teach a course like this!\u201dThe Macquarie course quickly became oversubscribed, and within a few years, Christian was receiving calls from other universities, asking for advice on how they might offer something similar. In 2005, he received an invitation to speak at a conference in Boothbay Harbor, Me., where he was spotted by a scout for the Teaching Company, who asked him to tape the class in their studios just outside Washington. The 48-lecture DVD set was released in early 2008. Gates was one of his first viewers.Christian, who is 67, now travels the world as something of an evangelist for the spread of the Big History Project. (His TED Talk, \u201cThe History of Our World in 18 Minutes,\u201d has been viewed more than four million times online.) Since introducing the course to high-school students, he and Gates realized that they needed to make a few adjustments to help it catch on. They have monitored teacher feedback closely and decreased the course in size, from 20 units to 10. True to Christian\u2019s original style, however, the high-school course links insights across subjects into wildly ambitious narratives. The units begin with the Big Bang and shift to lesson plans on the solar system, trade and communications, globalization and, finally, the future. A class on the emergence of life might start with photosynthesis before moving on to eukaryotes and multicellular organisms and the genius of Charles Darwin and James Watson. A lecture on the slave trade might include the history of coffee beans in Ethiopia.\u201cMost kids experience school as one damn course after another; there\u2019s nothing to build connections between the courses that they take,\u201d says Bob Bain, a professor of history and education at the University of Michigan and an adviser to the Big History Project, who has helped devise much of the curriculum. \u201cThe average kid has no way to make sense between what happens with their first-period World History class and their second-period algebra class, third-period gym class, fourth-period literature \u2014 it\u2019s all disconnected. It\u2019s like if I were to give you a jigsaw puzzle and throw 500 pieces on the table and say, \u2018Oh, by the way, I\u2019m not going to show you the box top as to how they fit together.\u2019 \u201dGates, who is 58, was wearing a rumpled blue monogrammed shirt. He is slim and speaks in a sort of nasal staccato, often adding exclamation to sentences that might not seem to require them. But his curiosity about education is innate and at times obsessive. Without prompting, he recounted getting a bad grade in an eighth-grade geography course (\u201cThey paired me up with a moron, and I realized these people thought I was stupid, and it really pissed me off!\u201d) and the only C-plus he ever received, in organic chemistry, at Harvard (\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure. I\u2019d have to double-check my transcript. I think I never ever got a B ever at Harvard. I got a C-plus, and I got A\u2019s!\u201d).Since starting his foundation in 2000, Gates has donated about $30 billion to organizations focusing largely on global health and development. The Gates Foundation has spent more than half a billion on educational causes, which provides some context for the comparatively modest $10 million that he has personally invested in the Big History Project. Nevertheless, Gates has insisted on tracking this venture as he would any Microsoft product or foundation project. The Big History Project produces reams of data \u2014 students and teachers are regularly surveyed, and teachers submit the results from classes, all of which allows his team to track what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t as the course grows. \u201cOur priority,\u201d he told me from across the table, \u201cwas to get it into a form where ambitious teachers could latch onto it.\u201dIn our conversation, Gates was forthright about the challenges the project has faced, particularly early on. Few schools had teachers who were willing or able to instruct a hybrid course; some schools wound up requiring that two teachers lead the class together. Gates, who had hoped to avoid bureaucracy, found himself mired in it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get a teacher in the history department and the science department \u2014 they have to be very serious about it, and they have to get their administrative staff to agree. And then you have to get it on the course schedule so kids can sign up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they have to decide, kind of in the spring or earlier, and those teachers have to spend a lot of that summer getting themselves ready for the thing.\u201d He sighed.Perhaps the largest challenge facing the Big History Project, however, is Gates himself, or at least the specter of him. To his bafflement and frustration, he has become a remarkably polarizing figure in the education world. This owes largely to the fact that Gates, through his foundation, has spent more than $200 million to advocate for the Common Core, something of a third rail in education circles. He has financed an army of policy groups, think tanks and teachers\u2019 unions to marshal support for the new rules and performance measurements that have been adopted by 44 states. Many education experts, while generally supportive of the new goals for reading and math skills, have been critical of the seemingly unilateral way in which the policy appeared to be rolled out. The standards have engendered public anger on both the right and left, and some states, including Indiana and Oklahoma, have decided to repeal the Common Core altogether.In March, the American Federation of Teachers announced that it would no longer accept grants from the Gates Foundation for its innovation fund, which had already received more than $5 million from the organization. As Randi Weingarten, the A.F.T. president, told Politico, \u201cI got convinced by the level of distrust I was seeing \u2014 not simply on Twitter, but in listening to members and local leaders \u2014 that it was important to find a way to replace Gates\u2019s funding.\u201d When I spoke with Weingarten last month, she elaborated on her union members\u2019 problem with Gates. \u201cInstead of actually working with teachers and listening to what teachers needed to make public eduction better,\u201d she said, Gates\u2019s team \u201cwould work around teachers, and that created tremendous distrust.\u201dBeginning with the Carnegies and the Rockefellers, billionaires have long seen the nation\u2019s education as a willing cause for their philanthropy \u2014 and, with it, their own ideas about how students should learn. The latest crop of billionaires, however, has tended to take the line that fixing our broken educational system is the key to unlocking our stagnant economy. Whether it\u2019s hedge-fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones (who has given tens of millions to support charter schools) or industrialists like Eli Broad (who has backed \u201cblended learning\u201d programs that feature enhanced technology), these philanthropists have generally espoused the idea that education should operate more like a business. (The Walton Foundation, backed by the family that founded Walmart, has taken this idea to new heights: It has spent more than $1 billion supporting various charter schools and voucher programs that seek to establish alternatives to the current public-school system.) Often these patrons want to restructure the system to make it more efficient, utilizing the latest technology and management philosophies to turn out a new generation of employable students.For many teachers, Weingarten explained, this outside influence has become off-putting, if not downright scary. \u201cWe have a really polarized environment in terms of education, which we didn\u2019t have 10 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cPublic education was a bipartisan or multipartisan enterprise \u2014 it didn\u2019t matter if you were a Republican or Democrat or elite or not elite. People viewed public education as an anchor of democracy and a propeller of the economy in the country.\u201d Now, she said, \u201cthere are people that have been far away from classrooms who have an outsize influence on what happens inside classrooms. Beforehand, the philanthropies were viewed as one of many voices in education. Now they are viewed \u2014 and the market reformers and the tech folks \u2014 as the dominant forces, and as dissonant to those who work in schools every day. She took a deep breath and softened her tone: \u201cIn some ways, I give Bill Gates huge credit. Bill Gates took a risk to get engaged. The fact that he was willing to step up and say, \u2018Public education is important,\u2019 is very different than foundations like the Walton Foundation, who basically try to undermine public education at every opportunity.\u201dGates appears to have been chastened by his experience with the A.F.T. When he speaks about his broader educational initiatives, he is careful to mention that the change he supports comes from the teachers, too. \u201cWhen Melinda and I go on the road and talk to teachers, it\u2019s just so clear there is a real hunger for this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can take a teacher and give him or her the help to become a great teacher, everyone benefits: the kids, the teacher, the community, the unions. Everyone.\u201dGates resists any suggestion that Big History is some sort of curio or vanity project. But some of this earlier antipathy has raised skepticism about his support of the Big History Project. \u201cI just finished reading William Easterly\u2019s \u2018The Tyranny of Experts,\u2019 \u201d says Scott L. Thomas, dean of the School of Educational Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California. \u201cIt\u2019s about philanthropists and their effect on the poor globally. It\u2019s this exact idea that here you have this \u2018expert\u2019 in the middle\u201d \u2014 that is, Gates \u2014 \u201cenabling the pursuit of this project. And frankly, in the eyes of the critics, he\u2019s really not an expert. He just happens to be a guy that watched a DVD and thought it was a good idea and had a bunch of money to fund it.\u201dDiane Ravitch, an education historian at New York University who has been a vocal critic of Gates, put even it more starkly: \u201cWhen I think about history, I think about different perspectives, clashing points of view. I wonder how Bill Gates would treat the robber barons. I wonder how Bill Gates would deal with issues of extremes of wealth and poverty.\u201d (The Big History Project doesn\u2019t mention robber barons, but it does briefly address unequal distribution of resources.) Ravitch continued: \u201cIt begins to be a question of: Is this Bill Gates\u2019s history? And should it be labeled \u2018Bill Gates\u2019s History\u2019? Because Bill Gates\u2019s history would be very different from somebody else\u2019s who wasn\u2019t worth $50-60 billion.\u201d (Gates\u2019s estimated net worth is approximately $80 billion.)On some level, Gates\u2019s experience in pushing through the Common Core seems to be a large part of what so excites him about the Big History Project: This small initiative, largely unburdened by bureaucracy, relies on technology and teachers who are willingly submitting to all matter of data analytics. He is pleased, he said, that the course has more than doubled in each of its first three years, and he expects that growth to follow in the future. One day, perhaps, Big History might even become a successor to Western Civ and World History. \u201cThe current thought is that in another three years, the quality of the material, the tools that let people add in new chapters and things, the broad awareness will be such that the community takes it over, and it achieves whatever natural level it\u2019s going to get to,\u201d he said. But he also noted that Big History \u2014 which is already being offered in South Korea, the Netherlands and, of course, Australia \u2014 had significant global potential. \u201cIt would be nice to find both educators and philanthropists[in foreign countries] that want to carry the torch \u2014 which actually, in some countries, I can think of people who would do it.\u201dAs class came to order and 30 or so teenagers scurried to drop their bags and take their seats, Henstrand introduced the day\u2019s topic: \u201cextinction events,\u201d or why and how various life-forms have died out. He asked his students to contemplate their own extinction event \u2014 a somewhat heady question for the teenage mind. As they pondered their eventual nonbeing, Henstrand put on a short video lecture by Christian and took a seat among the students, whom he had clustered in groups of four. Afterward, they were handed iPads with which to generate facts to support their various arguments about human extinction, based on how other species had expired. \u201cI felt that it was great to be able to have your own opinions and then share it with everyone and take in other people\u2019s opinions and use everything that you compile to create new theories and new ideas, and in a way create your own sense of your own belief system,\u201d said Benjamin Campbell, a senior. One of his classmates, a junior, overheard him and chimed in: \u201cAt first I hated it, because I was like, \u2018I hate science.\u2019 But it actually just opened my perspective that I never knew about. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it at all, and then I grew to love the class.\u201dNot all educators are so enthusiastic. Sam Wineburg, a professor of education and history at Stanford, told me that although he sees Big History as \u201can important intellectual movement,\u201d he did not consider the class to be a suitable replacement for an actual history course. \u201cAt certain points, it becomes less history and more of a kind of evolutionary biology or quantum physics. It loses the compelling aspect that is at the heart of the word \u2018history.\u2019 \u201dWineburg\u2019s deepest concern about the approach was its failure to impart a methodology to students. \u201cWhat is most pressing for American high-school students right now, in the history-social-studies curriculum, is: How do we read a text? How do we connect our ability to sharpen our intellectual capabilities when we\u2019re evaluating sources and trying to understand human motivation?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhen we think about history, what are the primary sources of Big History? The original scientific reports of the Big Bang?\u201d Wineburg, who also has developed an electronic history curriculum, scoffed.At the end of class, after Henstrand announced the homework assignment, he chatted for a few minutes about the future of the course. He was cautiously optimistic that it would catch on, but he also seemed to recognize how hard it is to innovate in the educational system. \u201cI think many are driven by it, but there are also some that are like: \u2018Oh, God, how do we fit this into the requirements of the day? How do we fit this and that?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThis course is a fundamental shift in how you deliver something. But there\u2019s so many factors in American education that work against it.\u201dIn many ways, education is a lousy business. Teachers are not normal economic actors; almost all of them work for less money than they might fetch in some other industry, given their skills and advanced degrees. Students are even weirder economic animals: Most of them would rather do something else with their time than sit in a room and learn algebra, even though the investment is well documented to pay off. By the same token, attempts to paint Bill Gates as a self-interested actor in his education projects don\u2019t make much sense. Joel Klein, the former chancellor of the New York City Department of Education, who charged Microsoft with being a monopoly while a lawyer at the Justice Department, laughed off the idea that Gates had an ulterior fiscal motive. \u201cThe notion that he has an agenda other than trying to improve education is just embarrassing,\u201d said Klein, describing how Gates continued to contribute \u2014 and even increased his contributions \u2014 to New York City public schools during Klein\u2019s tenure. \u201cI can\u2019t think there is a malevolent bone in his body.\u201dAs I walked to the subway, I thought back to my conversations with Gates. Big History may one day become an heir to Western Civ or World History, but that didn\u2019t seem to be Gates\u2019s goal; it was more personal. Really, Big History just seems like a class that he wished he could have taken in high school. But he wasn\u2019t a billionaire then. Now, a flash of inspiration on the treadmill might just lead to something very big.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Global Role, German Military Stumbles", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 In a spectacle that a leading weekly likened to a slapstick movie, Germany\u2019s military, especially its air force, has repeatedly stumbled in recent days as it tried to ratchet up its international involvement by delivering personnel and mat\u00e9riel to forces battling Islamic extremists in Iraq and aid supplies to Africa to ease the Ebola crisis.By Monday, when the latest failure of Germany\u2019s limited air capabilities became known, politicians were demanding explanations from Ursula von der Leyen, the country\u2019s defense minister, and pondering aloud the possible revision of what has long been a political no-go: raising the budget for defense spending.Ms. von der Leyen is among German leaders who in recent months have championed a more active role for the country in international crises. One striking example was the decision this month to send arms to Kurdish and Iraqi security forces, which broke a longstanding taboo on Germany\u2019s dispatching of weapons to a conflict zone.But weaknesses began to emerge last week, when a plane that was taking six German paratroopers to Iraq \u2014 to help train Kurdish security forces on nearly $900 million worth of weaponry \u2014 ended up stuck in Bulgaria for two days without authorization to enter Iraq.A day after that problem became public, a Dutch plane set to deliver the first weapons from Germany \u2014 50 bazookas, 520 rifles and 20 machine guns \u2014 was grounded, prompting a scramble to find alternative transport. That effort drew extra attention to the dozens of military planes and helicopters grounded for repairs or lack of spare parts.On Monday, it emerged that a German military plane involved in transporting aid to West Africa needed to make an emergency landing in the Canary Islands.As the limitations were exposed, the Defense Ministry last week delivered a report on battle readiness to the Defense Committee of Parliament, where committee members contended that ministry officials had misled them about how quickly or well Germany could meet NATO and other commitments.The Defense Ministry has traditionally been in a difficult position in Germany, where most people \u2014 reared after the Nazi dictatorship \u2014 shy away from the use of military force. For decades, Germany, now the world\u2019s third-largest exporter with the fourth-biggest economy, has also been reuniting its east and west and more preoccupied at home than abroad.This year, however, Germans have felt insecurities mounting, particularly over Ukraine and across the Middle East.For the first time in many years, those crises and the state of the armed forces have prompted discussions about defense spending, said Thomas Wiegold, a defense specialist who reports on security.For this year, Germany has a military budget of 32.8 billion euros, about $41.6 billion and 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, far below the NATO target of 2 percent. The United States has long complained that many European countries, notably Germany, have fallen short.Until recently, those complaints were ignored, \u201cbut it now seems to be becoming a debate,\u201d Mr. Wiegold said. \u201cI do a lot of radio interviews, particularly in the last week. Now I am being asked whether we should spend more money. That has never happened before.\u201dHe and other experts traced many of the current problems to a 2010 reform that encouraged the military to keep as many systems deployed as possible, at the same time that there was reduced ordering of spare parts. That has left the air force, for instance, reliant on Transall transport planes that entered service 50 years ago. The first new transport planes are scheduled to enter service this fall.In addition, Mr. Wiegold noted, Ms. von der Leyen has found promising air transport \u2014 for Mali, the Central African Republic or the Ebola crisis \u2014 a more politically acceptable contribution to international efforts than, say, sending paratroopers. \u201cIt has something to do with the basic political mood in Germany, that if we have to take part internationally, then better a \u2018peaceful\u2019 participation,\u201d Mr. Wiegold added.Ms. von der Leyen has also come under criticism from some politicians, who say she is overly eager to publicize Germany\u2019s new missions through photo opportunities \u2014 such as those last week in Iraq \u2014 instead of tackling her ministry\u2019s problems from her desk in Berlin. But the defense minister, sometimes seen as a rival and possibly a successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel, received robust backing on Monday from Ms. Merkel\u2019s spokesman.\u201cShe puts things on the table and gives an overview of things as they are,\u201d said the spokesman, Steffen Seibert. \u201cThat is the first step toward solving problems which have built up over years.\u201dAn article on Sept. 30 about missteps by the German military as it tries to assume a role in international crises misstated Germany\u2019s place among the world\u2019s exporters. It ranks third, according to the World Trade Organization; it is not the \u201cleading exporter.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Last week, the government unexpectedly granted 3G and 4G licenses to the Islamic republic\u2019s two principal mobile operators, which are rushing to roll out high-speed connections to their tens of millions of subscribers.While Iranians willing to flout the law have long used illegal software to gain access to banned Internet sites like YouTube and Twitter, until now, Iran\u2019s main cellphone operators had been ordered to reduce Internet speeds to a sub-snail\u2019s pace, effectively making it impossible to use the sites, make video calls or send images.Mr. Rouhani has long called for relaxing Iran\u2019s tight grip on the Internet, but has had only limited success in the face of stern opposition from a conservative coalition of clerics, military commanders and lawmakers who have argued that any relaxation of strictures will spread immorality and unwanted ideas.There is also a political dimension to the conservatives\u2019 resistance. Since antigovernment protests rocked the streets of Tehran in 2009, the Iranian authorities have directed tireless efforts to ensure that activists cannot use the Internet to organize protests or distribute images and videos of demonstrations.In a speech to clerics on Monday, however, Mr. Rouhani warned that the days of blunt methods of control were fast ending and urged them to be more tolerant of new technologies.\u201cWe cannot shut the gates of the world to our young generation,\u201d he said, according to the state Islamic Republic News Agency. \u201cOnce, there was a time that someone would hide his radio at home, if he had one, to use it just for listening to the news. We have passed that era.\u201dOver the past few months, the government has allowed service providers to increase bandwidth for home connections, offering data traffic up to 10 megabits per second \u2014 still slow compared with the West, where users typically choose plans offering 20 to 30 megabits per second.Nevertheless, while Iran\u2019s Internet access is still slow compared with that in many countries, it does now allow users to watch and send videos, something that previously was possible only for those with nearly infinite patience and determination.The president\u2019s message is trust, his supporters say. Iranians are wise enough to make their own decisions, says Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government. \u201cOur educated people use the Internet in a healthy way,\u201d he said, \u201cand have the right to fast Internet like all other people in the world.\u201dThroughout his first year in office, Mr. Rouhani has fought the hard-liners on multiple fronts, usually backing down. His adversaries, who control most of Iran\u2019s levers of power, such as the judiciary and several important councils, want the president to fix the economy and cut a nuclear deal with the West on Iran\u2019s terms, but have blocked all social changes.Since the earliest years of their faith, Shiite clerics have dedicated themselves to preventing believers from committing vice and to promoting virtue. Over the years, they have banned the VCR, declared satellite television illegal and blacked out millions of websites, including Facebook and Twitter, in a not terribly successful effort to protect their flock from modern communications technologies.But the information age has left them divided. While most clerics agree that the Internet is good for science, they also say there must be oversight and control for almost everything else.The obsession with control even extended to search terms. Until recently, anyone who typed \u201cwomen\u201d in Google would be directed to a site saying, \u201cAccording to computer crime regulations, access to this website is denied.\u201dNot surprisingly, in that atmosphere, the current changes met with stiff opposition in some quarters. Iran\u2019s Parliament, always eager to strike down the Rouhani government\u2019s plans, called in the minister of communication last week and demanded that he \u201clower the speed of the Internet.\u201dA leading ayatollah, Naser Makarem Shirazi, called on the government to revoke the mobile Internet licenses before young minds could be poisoned by \u201cdirty pictures and clips,\u201d a post on his website read.To some extent, the government\u2019s decision to allow high-speed Internet systems is a recognition of reality. Before now, millions of tech-savvy Iranians lived a forced life of crime, buying illegal software that enabled them to visit blocked sites. Nevertheless, even those who bypassed the state filters were stymied by the excruciatingly slow Internet speeds.In his speech on Monday, Mr. Rouhani did not address the issue of the filtering and blocking of websites, which will remain in place, analysts said. On Saturday at a news conference, he said he remained committed to a nationwide intranet, like those maintained by companies, with only selected websites allowed.Iran is notoriously inconsistent in its social policies, and there is no guarantee the new Internet speeds are here to stay. But there was one encouraging sign.Ayatollah Shirazi on Sunday issued a statement saying his demand to revoke the 3G licenses had been distorted. \u201cWe are not against technology,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we feel the new technology must be purified before it is given to the people.\u201dWhile gratified by the changes, many Iranians remain frustrated with the government\u2019s continuing limits on Internet use.\u201cWe just have to find ways to come to terms with all the restrictions,\u201d said Movarid, 28, who refused to give her family name so she could speak freely. \u201cOnce they declared the VCR illegal, and look how ridiculous that sounds now. That shows how we will feel about this period in the future.\u201dA previous version of this article misstated the size of the bandwidth that the Iranian government has allowed service providers to offer, and the size of the bandwidth typically offered in the West. Iranians can now get home connections at 10 megabits \u2014 not megabytes \u2014 per second, and service providers in the West typically offer 20 to 30 megabits \u2014 not megabytes \u2014 per second.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Our Invisible Rich", "Date": "2014-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut wait \u2014 isn\u2019t half our TV programming devoted to breathless portrayal of the real or imagined lifestyles of the rich and fatuous? Yes, but that\u2019s celebrity culture, and it doesn\u2019t mean that the public has a good sense either of who the rich are or of how much money they make. In fact, most Americans have no idea just how unequal our society has become.And even the 1 percent is too broad a category; the really big gains have gone to an even tinier elite. For example, recent estimates indicate not only that the wealth of the top percent has surged relative to everyone else \u2014 rising from 25 percent of total wealth in 1973 to 40 percent now \u2014 but that the great bulk of that rise has taken place among the top 0.1 percent, the richest one-thousandth of Americans.So how can people be unaware of this development, or at least unaware of its scale? The main answer, I\u2019d suggest, is that the truly rich are so removed from ordinary people\u2019s lives that we never see what they have. We may notice, and feel aggrieved about, college kids driving luxury cars; but we don\u2019t see private equity managers commuting by helicopter to their immense mansions in the Hamptons.

{"Headline": "What Makes People Poor?", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that there are no political pressures distorting our discussion of poverty and that we can look at it as a technical problem, not a moral one.Maybe we would find that most explanations \u2013 left, right and center \u2013 are not mutually exclusive but mutually reinforcing.Before we take this thought experiment further, we should consider the ramifications of new research that provides insight into urban social disorder, worklessness, the rising salience of education and the shortcomings of government policy.David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. best known for exploring the costs to American workers of automation and trade with China, has recently expanded the scope of his research on unemployment to look at the consequences for men who grow up in a fatherless household.For the non-college educated, Cherlin wrote to me by email, \u201cthe majority of their births will occur outside of marriage, often in fragile cohabiting unions that have high break-up rates.\u201d Conversely, the overwhelming majority of men and women with college degrees marry before they have children, have experienced a drop in their divorce rate and have seen their incomes rise as both husband and wife work.The result, Cherlin points out, is that a \u201cbachelor\u2019s degree is the closest thing to a class boundary that exists today.\u201dAt the other end of the political spectrum, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, makes a very different case: that our government\u2019s policies have weakened the bargaining position of the working class while enriching the wealthy.In a series of emails to me, Baker argues that the Federal Reserve\u2019s determination to limit inflation has boosted unemployment, that policies that keep the value of the dollar high hurt employees who face foreign competition, and that trade agreements pit American labor against workers in low-wage developing countries.Despite the conflicting nature of these left and right analyses, there is a strong case to be made that they are, in fact, complementary and that they reinforce each other. What if we put it together this way? Automation, foreign competition and outsourcing lead to a decline in well-paying manufacturing jobs, which, in turn, leads to higher levels of unemployment and diminished upward mobility, which then leads to fewer marriages, a rise in the proportion of nonmarital births, increased withdrawal from the labor force, impermanent cohabitation and a consequent increase in dependence on government support.The major roadblock to synthesizing competing explanations has been \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 political polarization. Vested interests on the left and right have delayed, and in some cases prevented, recognition of the overlap between liberal and conservative hypotheses, and have pointedly ignored evidence that contradicts their preconceived partisan positions.All of these sociologists have produced nuanced fieldwork that describes the pressures on the poor, their level of desperation, and the improvised adaptations that now characterize life in poverty.Just as there has emerged a progressive movement into terrain once colonized by the right, there is now a nascent, if still modest, reform movement within conservatism and the Republican Party.Gerson and Wehner\u2019s views are in close alignment with analyses found on the contemporary left and center.Ideological convergence could produce a more empirically grounded understanding of the causes of poverty and of social and economic inequality as well.Still, there are forces impossible for a single nation operating in a global economy to harness, let alone control: the continuing downward pressure on wages from both domestic and international competition, the offshoring and robotization of jobs, the reluctance of corporations to hire poorly educated and untrained employees, and the continuing improvement of overseas production in developing nations.Globalization limits the ability of the United States to intervene effectively on behalf of its most needy. Action taken to shield domestic labor from foreign competition threatens to place constraints on economic growth; protectionist trade policies, in turn, drive up consumer costs.Scientific and technological progress are likely to drive us toward a solution to the problem of poverty only if they take the form of innovations that have a deep impact on economic growth and employment opportunities. To really change things, this impact would have to be comparable to developments spurred by the Industrial Revolution or, more recently, the information revolution. Progress, if it comes, will inevitably bring its own distributive dilemmas.At the current moment, breakthroughs in innovation \u2013 as well as breakthroughs in managing the human costs of innovation \u2014 are as likely to occur abroad as in the United States. When it comes to the persistence of poverty and of inequality, it will take all of our resources and capacity for cooperation, along with a more sophisticated, comprehensive understanding of human capital formation, to overcome our domestic squabbling and mount a concerted offensive.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rebound Takes Root in Michigan, but Voters\u2019 Gloom Is Hard to Shake", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2014 Another blustery Midwestern winter approaches, but along a blue-collar stretch of Leonard Street in this conservative, famously button-down city, an economic springtime has arrived.The Mitten Brewing Company, less than three years old, has grown to 40 employees from 10, and is expanding across the street with gleaming new fermentation tanks. Next door, Kyle Van Strien and Jon O\u2019Connor have gutted an 1890s dry-goods store to build Long Road Distillers. Down the block, A-1 Small Engine Repair is stirring with traffic at last, said Randy Wodarek, a co-owner, after years of \u201ca lot of peanut butter and jelly, for sure.\u201dYet the economic recovery taking root in Michigan \u2014 among the states hit hardest by the 2008 recession \u2014 has not translated into an improved political environment for officials in either party. Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican and a computer executive who was elected four years ago as an economic Mr. Fix-It, is neck-and-neck with his Democratic challenger. Representative Gary Peters, the Detroit-area Democrat who was handpicked to succeed Senator Carl Levin, who is retiring, is struggling to maintain a lead over his Republican opponent.The growing set of up arrows among many economic indicators has proved to be more of an abstraction to voters struggling to get by.Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration economist now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said economic growth was up 12 percent since the recession\u2019s end, stock prices had doubled and corporate profits were up nearly 50 percent. But median household income, adjusted for inflation, is down 3 percent. Incomes have just started ticking up, but that is because people are working longer hours, not because of rising wages.\u201cA lot of political scientists will tell you it\u2019s the trend that matters,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said. \u201cPeople can take a whole lot of whacking around as long as they feel things are improving. But that\u2019s not how it\u2019s playing out.\u201dEven as employers in Michigan have added 310,000 jobs and unemployment has dropped to 7.5 percent from 14.2 percent \u2014 the best improvement in the country since the recession \u2014 voters here seem to view the glass as half empty, largely because of stagnant wages, rising living costs and diminished opportunities.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d said Jim Chase, a local Teamsters union organizer, over beer and pizza at the Mitten. \u201cBecause most of those jobs don\u2019t pay nothing.\u201dThe number of unemployed in Michigan, 357,408, is down from 686,199 in August 2009, and back to the level of March 2008. But people dropping out of the work force account for some of that change. Today, 4.4 million Michiganders have jobs, up from 4.1 million in December 2009, but that number trails the 4.7 million who had jobs in the state in February 2006.Manufacturing has come back, with payrolls rising to 567,900 this June from 440,600 in June 2009, bringing manufacturing payrolls back to July 2008 levels, but short of the peak of 906,900 in September 1999.The auto industry has revived, owing largely to the bailout that President Obama pushed and Republicans opposed. But a leaner, more efficient Big Three \u2014 General Motors, Ford and Chrysler \u2014 may never employ as many in the state as they once did, Mr. Peters said, nor will their suppliers.\u201cMy gut tells me things are getting better,\u201d said Bobby J. Hopewell, the mayor of nearby Kalamazoo, \u201cbut there are just too many people out of work.\u201dFor more affluent business owners and executives, robust profits have meant rapidly rising wealth \u2014 and some disbelief at all the grumbling.\u201cPeople are very negative,\u201d said Heather Johnson of Comstock Park, just north of Grand Rapids, a Republican whose husband\u2019s industrial vacuum equipment business has been \u201cblessed\u201d with recent good fortune. \u201cNo matter how good people are doing, they find the few things that are wrong.\u201dFor the vast middle, however, there is a pervasive gloom. Incomes have stagnated. Many Americans have given up trying to find work.\u201cMy generation is trying to figure out how to buy a house, how to afford that second child. We\u2019re not feeling it,\u201d said Jon Hoadley, a 31-year-old running as a Democrat for state representative in Kalamazoo.In Arkansas, where Senator Mark Pryor, a Democrat, has lost a once-healthy lead over Representative Tom Cotton, his Republican challenger, the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.2 percent from a 2011 peak of 8.1 percent. But the number of employed Arkansans, 1.2 million, is lower than at any point in the recession and recovery.In North Carolina and Louisiana, where two other Senate Democrats are struggling, the numbers are far better, but the fortunes of the incumbent senators are in no way assured. North Carolina\u2019s unemployment rate of 11.3 percent in the winter of 2010 is down to 6.5 percent, and the number of employed North Carolinians is above prerecession levels. Louisiana saw its unemployment rate peak at 7.8 percent in the fall of 2010 and drop to 5.4 percent this month. Employment is more than two million, the highest level on record.Republican governors struggling to be re-elected in Kansas, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia are facing the same economic headwinds, regardless of their party.To Jason Spaulding, co-owner of the thriving Brewery Vivant on the fancier side of Grand Rapids, the pessimism is baffling. Four years ago he took over a funeral home, kept the stained glass of the chapel for his restaurant and set up brewing equipment in stables that once housed horse-drawn hearses.Business has exceeded expectations. He expects to hit 5,000 barrels a year soon, and spends evenings arguing with relatives that the state owes much to Mr. Obama \u2014 to little avail.\u201cNo one wants to give credit for doing good. They just want to talk about the bad,\u201d he said, after a private chat with Mr. Peters. \u201cBut slowly things are getting better.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name, age and location of a brewery in Grand Rapids, Mich. It is the Mitten Brewing Company, not the Mitten Brewery Company. It was established in February 2012, not 18 months ago.

{"Headline": "Scots, What the Heck?", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWell, I have a message for the Scots: Be afraid, be very afraid. The risks of going it alone are huge. You may think that Scotland can become another Canada, but it\u2019s all too likely that it would end up becoming Spain without the sunshine. But Canada has its own currency, which means that its government can\u2019t run out of money, that it can bail out its own banks if necessary, and more. An independent Scotland wouldn\u2019t. And that makes a huge difference.Could Scotland have its own currency? Maybe, although Scotland\u2019s economy is even more tightly integrated with that of the rest of Britain than Canada\u2019s is with the United States, so that trying to maintain a separate currency would be hard. It\u2019s a moot point, however: The Scottish independence movement has been very clear that it intends to keep the pound as the national currency. And the combination of political independence with a shared currency is a recipe for disaster. Which is where the cautionary tale of Spain comes in.And it wasn\u2019t just Spain, it was all of southern Europe and more. Even euro-area countries with sound finances, like Finland and the Netherlands, have suffered deep and prolonged slumps.In short, everything that has happened in Europe since 2009 or so has demonstrated that sharing a currency without sharing a government is very dangerous. In economics jargon, fiscal and banking integration are essential elements of an optimum currency area. And an independent Scotland using Britain\u2019s pound would be in even worse shape than euro countries, which at least have some say in how the European Central Bank is run.I find it mind-boggling that Scotland would consider going down this path after all that has happened in the last few years. If Scottish voters really believe that it\u2019s safe to become a country without a currency, they have been badly misled. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Gas Cut Off, Ukraine Looks West", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUZHGOROD, Ukraine \u2014 Keeping Ukraine warm keeps Andriy Kobolev up at night.That means Ukraine will have to cut its energy use sharply or risk running dry, which could lead to more civilian deaths when the weather turns cold, and could further batter the country\u2019s economy.\u201cThe situation is very difficult,\u201d Mr. Kobolev said in a recent interview. \u201cSince we have no choice, no other solution, we\u2019ll find a solution and have to live with the amount of gas we will have.\u201dHe spoke at a hotel in this city near Slovakia, just a few hours after he took part in a news conference on the other side of the border. The Slovak and Ukrainian prime ministers had held a ceremonial \u201cswitching on\u201d of a gas pipeline that will allow the Slovaks to provide some capacity to Ukraine, but far less than the Ukrainians wanted.Afterward, Mr. Kobolev and other company officials got in a line of three black cars \u2014 a BMW and two Hyundais \u2014 and drove a winding path through tiny border villages, zipping past a field with brown spotted cows, a shirtless man in red shorts holding a hedge trimmer, a group of boys hanging from a tree, an elderly woman wearing a kerchief.While it was hard for an outsider to tell the two sides of the border apart, they are hardly in lock step. Mr. Kobolev and other Ukrainian officials had hoped for the so-called big reverse. In that situation, Slovakia would have been able to reverse the flow of 30 billion cubic meters or 1.06 trillion cubic feet of Russian gas annually and solve Ukraine\u2019s looming energy crisis.Slovakia, a major thoroughfare for Russian gas heading to Italy and other points west, balked at the idea of a big reverse. Like Ukraine and much of Europe, Slovakia depends on Russia\u2019s natural gas, so the Slovaks have been treading carefully, seeking to appease both the Russians and fellow members of the European Union.What happens if Russia\u2019s gas stays off?That is the challenge facing Mr. Kobolev. At 36, he looks like a boyish junior executive, and he has been on the job only a few months, but he is resolved not to be rolled over by Gazprom.Like many Ukrainians, his mind is preoccupied with the toll of his country\u2019s war and anger at how it has come about. Books are one of his refuges.\u201cI just finished Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, \u2018One Hundred Years of Loneliness,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said, referring to \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude\u201d by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. \u201cCrazy book, rocked my mind.\u201dHe was once a lower-level executive at Naftogaz, but quit in 2010 in disgust at the government of the Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. After the revolution in February that ousted Mr. Yanukovych, Mr. Kobolev returned to the company in the top role.\u201cI couldn\u2019t work with the Yanukovych team, because they are corrupt guys,\u201d he said, adding that the Naftogaz of that era never seemed to push back on the price demands of Gazprom. \u201cMaybe they were just altruists, I don\u2019t know.\u201dNow negotiations between the two companies are less cordial, and they no longer take place in Moscow, as they once always did, or in Ukraine for that matter.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go to Moscow. They don\u2019t want to go to Kiev,\u201d Mr. Kobolev said.European officials are trying to schedule talks between the sides for later this month.Barring an end to the dispute with Gazprom, the winter is likely to be bitter. Last year Ukraine consumed about 49 billion cubic meters of gas, or 1.73 trillion cubic feet, a little more than half of which came from Gazprom.How much gas Ukraine will use this year remains to be seen. Last year, about two billion cubic meters were consumed by Crimea, which has since been annexed by Russia, so that can be subtracted from Ukraine\u2019s demand. The rebel-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk regions account for roughly eight billion cubic meters.Over all, the Ukrainians believe they can get about 15 billion cubic meters from Europe annually \u2014 though about 10 billion of that would come from the Slovak pipeline, and the rest from Hungary and Poland.\u201cIs that enough? Probably not,\u201d said Laurent Ruseckas, senior adviser for global gas with IHS Energy, a research and consulting firm. \u201cBy the beginning of 2015, you could start running into trouble.\u201dThe Ukrainians had hoped to have the gas come from larger pipelines, but instead the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline, which was not being used, was retrofitted to send gas east. When the pipeline was opened last week, Klaus-Dieter Borchardt, the European Commission\u2019s director of internal energy markets, acknowledged, \u201cIt is not a highway we are opening today, but it is more than a bike lane.\u201dSince gas is still flowing through Ukraine bound for Europe, Russia has already warned about the potential for siphoning. Russia, of course, can simply send less gas to Europe.Robert Fico, the Slovak prime minister, has opposed sanctions on Russia, putting him at odds with many other European leaders. But Mr. Fico suggested the Slovaks struck a deal that the Russians can live with. Mr. Fico, in remarks at the news conference, called the Vojany-Uzhgorod pipeline \u201cthe only possible solution.\u201dEven with the new Slovak capacity, Mr. Kobolev says he believes Ukraine will have to cut its gas use by about a fifth, no small amount. That will require a 30 percent cut from industry, which he said would come from reduction of business activity in the east, switching fuels and energy savings programs. Households will have to cut their use by about 10 percent. It is another blow for a country whose gross domestic product fell 4.7 percent in the second quarter from the same period in 2013.Part of Ukraine\u2019s problem has been that people and businesses have been paying artificially low prices, a vestige of Soviet-era policies.Mr. Kobolev wants to change that, and so does the International Monetary Fund, which pressured Ukrainian officials into raising gas prices as part of the aid package the country received this year. Those increases, however, do not fully phase in until 2018. The market price for gas now is still six times as high as what consumers pay, Naftogaz said.Mr. Kobolev wants to make his country less dependent on Russia in the future.\u201cAs long as there\u2019s no competition, there\u2019s guys who will squeeze all the juice from you. When there\u2019s competition, they are very likely to come with fair market proposals,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil there\u2019s competition, you will never make them do that, and that\u2019s true for Gazprom.\u201dThat sounds good in theory, but it\u2019s not clear how Ukraine will replace Russian gas, and Mr. Kobolev did not show his cards. Ukraine could perhaps switch some of its energy use from gas to coal, encourage more investment to increase domestic production or look to liquid natural gas. But all of that takes time.\u201cI have many friends who are currently out east, they are currently in military operations,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell myself that I\u2019m not having the most difficult job in the world, and you should stop whining and get yourself to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But as investment portfolios shrank, so did wristwear. \u201cDesign follows the economic situation,\u201d says Fabrizio Buonamassa, the head watch designer at Bulgari.A bad economy \u201cmakes it difficult to show off. You need something small and intimate, only for your private taste,\u201d Mr. Buonamassa said in an interview. Though the recession may be past, the trend toward smaller watches, especially for women, has not reversed. Consequently, Mr. Buonamassa is following a new direction. \u201cWe are going very clean and elegant, without Star Wars complications,\u201d he said.That is true for male as well as female customers. But for women in particular Mr. Buonamassa sees a \u201cnew strong trend for small watches,\u201d which is why Bulgari is including small dial options in its collections, whether it\u2019s this year\u2019s new Bulgari Bulgari Bronze watch with the choice of a 26-millimeter, or 1.02-inch, dial or next year\u2019s Lucea with a 28-millimeter dial option. At Chaumet, too, the trend is toward what its Paris watch manager, B\u00e9atrice Rouhier, calls a \u201cbijoux watch, very small, more of a bracelet. \u201cWe can see a small trend for smaller sizes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are less in the bling bling attitude, but focused more on luxury which is more discreet, more subtle.\u201d In June the company introduced its Liens watch in a new, smaller 27-millimeter dial.Ms. Rouhier sees another reason for women\u2019s turn to smaller watches. \u201cTen years ago women were more in search of being the equivalent of men,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, women are more at ease with being a woman. \u2018Yes,\u2019 this woman says, \u2018I can wear a small watch.\u201d\u2019\u201cWomen wanting to assert their independence and stand out, or wanting to show off their social success in a man\u2019s world, will appropriate their codes by wearing masculine watches,\u201d he said. But \u201cmodern and stylish women will opt for models that are discreet and more elegant.\u201dCertainly, Laura Barrow, a design teacher in Tasmania on sabbatical in Edinburgh, says she thinks that \u201ca smaller watch adds a degree of elegance.\u201d She owns two small watches, both of which she has had for years. \u201cI like that they are understated,\u201d she said.Like many watch-wearers, she may be hoping that some of her watches\u2019 qualities will rub off on her, because, she added, \u201cI\u2019m not a very elegant person.\u201dAnother fan of small watches is Caroline Mennetrier, who recently opened her own communications firm, White Alpaga, in Rome. \u201cI always look for a watch that goes with my personality,\u201d she said. \u201cI am somewhat discreet. I try to look elegant and chic but understated in everything I choose as an accessory, be it shoes or bags or my watch.\u201d  Ms. Mennetrier\u2019s husband bought her a Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso as a surprise for her 40th birthday. \u201cIt\u2019s the simple one,\u201d she explained, \u201ca silver square with a black alligator band. I can wear it as a watch or reverse it and wear it as a bracelet. It looks like a jewel.\u201dNatalie Rucellai, an executive in a public relations agency based in Milan who lives in Florence, owns a Ballon Bleu by Cartier, a gift from her husband, Simone. She loves it because \u201cit doesn\u2019t look like a watch. It looks like jewelry.\u201d She says she wears the watch all the time, because it can go with anything, from evening wear to jeans, thanks to its small size. The trend toward smaller watches may have been brewing for a few years, but it really picked up momentum this year. Starting around 2010, \u201cbrands started to think of the women\u2019s watches as pieces only for women and not as men\u2019s watches with some stones and a smaller case,\u201d Mr. Gardinetti said. \u201cIn 2014 this development explodes.\u201d Most brands have recently introduced new models specifically conceived for women, he said: \u201cThe women\u2019s watch is now for women from A to Z and not a customized men\u2019s watch.\u201dThat suits Holly Radunz just fine. Ms. Radunz, an administrative assistant in Sydney, Australia, owns a \u201cFelicia watch, which I\u2019m told was a very common brand in Australia up until about 30 years ago.\u201d The watches had a reputation for being well priced and well made, she said, \u201cwhich certainly is true, as mine still runs perfectly well after many decades.\u201d Her watch is small, gold and so discreet that \u201cI wear it most days,\u201d she added. \u201cIt isn\u2019t waterproof or shockproof, but I\u2019m not in the habit of climbing mountains or traversing rivers, so that\u2019s fine with me.\u201dMs. Radunz, like Ms. Mennetrier, has another reason for preferring a small watch: slender wrists. That resonates with many women, particularly in Asia. \u201cIf we look at this rebirth of small watches,\u201d said Mr. Gardinetti, \u201cmost of the pieces are sold in Asia, where people are, in general, smaller-boned.\u201dHe said the brand\u2019s iconic flipover Reverso model was one of the most popular in China, partly because of its versatility but also because \u201cit comes in many sizes that give the option to choose the one that fits the wrist. The smaller version represents the majority of our sales in China.\u201dLast year Chanel offered its Premi\u00e8re watch in a 22-millimeter version. \u201cThe trend for crazy big watches is over,\u201d Mr. Beau said: \u201cThey are totally uncomfortable. They are very heavy. You can suffer to a certain extent, but there\u2019s a limit.\u201d Ms. Radunz has other reasons for preferring a small watch. \u201cBecause the piece is rather discreet I feel more comfortable wearing it with different outfits,\u201d she said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t automatically dictate my jewelry or clothing choice for the day.\u201d Moreover, \u201cit\u2019s handy to be able to glance at a small watch and keep on schedule without advertising to everyone that you need to be somewhere else shortly,\u201d she added.For all the advantages of a small watch, there is one growing demographic that is likely to give them a pass: the aging population.Lourdes Nadon, a graphic designerwho divides her time between New Jersey and Portugal\u2019s Algarve, used to wear a little Chanel Matelass\u00e9 watch that her husband bought her. She wore it for years, but, despite her sentimental attachment to it, \u201cI stopped wearing it,\u201d she said: \u201cAs my eyesight has become not as good as it was once, a larger watch is easier for me to see.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Caution Until the End: Last-Minute Surprises", "Date": "2014-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas TribuneBefore every election, whoever is trailing starts talking about campaigns of the past \u2014 from Abraham Lincoln to Ann Richards \u2014 that were behind at this point and surged to victory. The candidate in front has the opposite view: Those turnarounds are nightmare material.This recurrent idea \u2014 that something is going to save or ruin a campaign in its final weeks \u2014 has a kernel of truth at its center: What the voters are talking about in September is not always what is on their minds when it is time to vote.It is sometimes the result of late news that changes the tenor of a race \u2014 the so-called October Surprise. Remember the stories about the 1976 drunken driving arrest of George W. Bush? Those landed just before the neck-and-neck 2000 election for president \u2014 an election that ultimately was decided by the United States Supreme Court and put Mr. Bush in office. Whatever else you can say about that one, you have to admit that it was a close race.President George Bush lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton in 1992. The late-breaker that time was the indictment of former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. Maybe it made a difference and maybe it did not, but the timing raised Republican eyebrows \u2014 and tempers.Ms. Richards won her nomination for Texas governor in 1990 after a brawl of a Democratic primary that reached one of several low spots in the days before her runoff against Jim Mattox, the attorney general. Mr. Mattox accused her, on national TV, of using cocaine in the bathroom of an Austin hotel years before. Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, refused to talk about the particulars of her substance abuse throughout that campaign, and Mr. Mattox\u2019s late charge fell short.But late news sealed the electoral fate of her Republican opponent in that year\u2019s general election.A campaign train that took the Republican nominee, Clayton W. Williams Jr., and a pack of supporters and reporters on a ride from San Antonio to Houston made a stop at the Texas A&M graduate\u2019s beloved College Station, a staged whistle-stop that conveniently put a building named for Mr. Williams right in the picture.It was the Friday before the election, and Mr. Williams planned to ride the train to Houston, fly to Laredo for some Saturday campaigning and then end back in Houston going to church and then to a phone bank with President Bush. It was supposed to be a safe close to a wobbly campaign that had frittered away a large lead over Ms. Richards and turned what appeared to be an easy win into a real contest.A gaggle of traveling reporters formed around Mr. Williams at the College Station stop, and one asked him whether he had paid income taxes \u2014 a subject Ms. Richards had been pressing as the campaign drew to a close. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve paid lots of income tax, lots, lots,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I didn\u2019t pay any income tax was 1986, when our whole economy collapsed.\u201dIn a funny piece of timing, the Williams campaign and the Richards campaign happened to arrive at the same airport terminal at the same time that evening, and news of that gaffe traveled from one campaign to the other in those pre-mobile phone days. It gave Ms. Richards a rallying point for that final weekend, and she won the race on the following Tuesday.Sudden and unexpected things can change the political environment in a hurry. But they are called surprises for a reason, and if it was easy to plan something like this, voters would get a fresh thrill every two years.Texas Republicans have been relatively successful in their attempts to make the 2014 election a referendum on the Obama administration and its policies \u2014 particularly on the Texas-Mexico border. That has created a headwind for Democrats in a state where they have not put together a statewide win since 1994.Perhaps they can find some comfort in the federal election of 1864. The South had been winning battles in the Civil War. Voters were then in a habit of giving presidents one term. And the Democrats had George B. McClellan, former commander of the Army, as their candidate. Even Lincoln expected to lose.But in September, Atlanta fell. And in November, voters chose Lincoln.rramsey@texastribune.orgAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading From Within", "Date": "2014-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe most effective leadership abroad starts with respect earned from others seeing us commit to doing great and difficult things\u00a0at home that summon the energy of the whole country \u2014 and not just from our military families. That is how America inspires others to action. And the necessary impactful thing that America should do at home now is for the president and Congress to lift our self-imposed ban on U.S. oil exports, which would significantly dent the global high price of crude oil. And combine that with long overdue comprehensive tax reform that finally values our environment and security. That would be a carbon tax that is completely offset by lowering personal income, payroll and corporate taxes. Nothing would make us stronger and Putin and ISIS weaker \u2014 all at the same time. How so? First you need to understand how much Putin and ISIS have in common. For starters, they each like to do their dirtiest work wearing a mask, because deep down, somewhere, they know that what they\u2019re doing is shameful. The ISIS executioner actually wears a hood. Putin lies through his poker face.Both seem to know that their ideas or influence are unsellable on their\u00a0merits, so they have to impose them with intimidating force \u2014 \u201cconvert to puritanical Islam or I will chop your head off,\u201d says ISIS, and \u201csubmit to Russia\u2019s sphere of influence or I will invade you and wipe out your regime,\u201d says Putin. Both are clearly motivated to use force by an intense desire to overcome past humiliations. For Putin, it is the humiliation over Russian weakness that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, which he once described as \u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe\u201d of the 20th century, which left millions of Russian speakers outside the Russian state. And for ISIS, it is how modernity has left so many Arab/Muslim nations behind in the 21st century by all the critical indices of human development: education, economic growth, scientific discoveries, literacy, freedom and women\u2019s empowerment. Preventing Ukrainians from exercising their free will is Putin\u2019s way of showing Russia\u2019s only real strength left: brute force. Beheading defenseless American journalists is ISIS\u2019s way of saying it is as strong as the United States. Both are looking for respect in all the wrong places. Both Putin and ISIS are also intent on recreating states from an overglorified past to distract their peoples from their inability to build real economies \u2014 ISIS calls its recreation the \u201ccaliphate\u201d and Putin calls his \u201cNovorossiya,\u201d or New Russia (or Ukraine\u2019s Russian-speaking southeast). Both are also intent on rewriting the prevailing rules of the international system, which they see as having been drawn up by America or the West to advantage themselves and disadvantage Arabs or Russians. And, very significantly, they both are totally dependent on exploiting high-priced oil or gas to finance their madness.The way you defeat such an enemy is by being \u201ccrazy like a fox,\u201d says Andy Karsner, the former assistant energy secretary in the last Bush administration and now the C.E.O. of Manifest Energy. \u201cWe have one bullet that hits both of them: bring down the price of oil. It\u2019s not like they can suddenly shift to making iWatches.\u201d We are generating more oil and gas than ever, added Karsner, and it\u2019s a global market. Absurdly, he said, the U.S. government bans the export of our crude oil. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we own the world\u2019s biggest bank vault but misplaced the key,\u201d added Karsner. \u201cLet\u2019s lift that export ban and have America shaping the market price in our own interest.\u201dBut that must be accompanied by tax reform that puts a predictable premium on carbon, ensuring that we unite to consistently invest in clean energies that take us beyond fossil fuels, increase efficiency and address climate change. Draining our enemies\u2019 coffers, enhancing security, taxing environmental degradation \u2014 what\u2019s not to like? And if we shift tax revenue to money collected from a carbon tax, we can slash income, payroll and corporate taxes, incentivize investment and hiring and unleash our economic competitiveness. That is a strategy hawks and doves, greens and big oil could all support.If the price of oil plummets to just $75 to $85 a barrel from $100 by lifting the ban, and we have implemented tax reform that signals our commitment to clean growth, we inevitably weaken Putin and ISIS, strengthen America and show the world that we deserve to lead because we\u2019re back to doing big, hard things at home that once again differentiate us \u2014 not just bombing in distant lands and pretending that\u2019s getting the job done.\u00a0Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Foreign Powers Buy Influence at Think Tanks", "Date": "2014-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The agreement signed last year by the Norway Ministry of Foreign Affairs was explicit: For $5 million, Norway\u2019s partner in Washington would push top officials at the White House, at the Treasury Department and in Congress to double spending on a United States foreign aid program.But the recipient of the cash was not one of the many Beltway lobbying firms that work every year on behalf of foreign governments.More than a dozen prominent Washington research groups have received tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments in recent years while pushing United States government officials to adopt policies that often reflect the donors\u2019 priorities, an investigation by The New York Times has found. The money is increasingly transforming the once-staid think-tank world into a muscular arm of foreign governments\u2019 lobbying in Washington. And it has set off troubling questions about intellectual freedom: Some scholars say they have been pressured to reach conclusions friendly to the government financing the research.The think tanks do not disclose the terms of the agreements they have reached with foreign governments. And they have not registered with the United States government as representatives of the donor countries, an omission that appears, in some cases, to be a violation of federal law, according to several legal specialists who examined the agreements at the request of The Times.As a result, policy makers who rely on think tanks are often unaware of the role of foreign governments in funding the research.\u201cIt is particularly egregious because with a law firm or lobbying firm, you expect them to be an advocate,\u201d Mr. Sandler added. \u201cThink tanks have this patina of academic neutrality and objectivity, and that is being compromised.\u201dMost of the money comes from countries in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia, particularly the oil-producing nations of the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Norway, and takes many forms. The United Arab Emirates, a major supporter of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, quietly provided a donation of more than $1 million to help build the center\u2019s gleaming new glass and steel headquarters not far from the White House. Qatar, the small but wealthy Middle East nation, agreed last year to make a $14.8 million, four-year donation to Brookings, which has helped fund a Brookings affiliate in Qatar and a project on United States relations with the Islamic world. Some scholars say the donations have led to implicit agreements that the research groups would refrain from criticizing the donor governments. In interviews, top executives at the think tanks strongly defended the arrangements, saying the money never compromised the integrity of their organizations\u2019 research. Where their scholars\u2019 views overlapped with those of donors, they said, was coincidence.\u201cOur business is to influence policy with scholarly, independent research, based on objective criteria, and to be policy-relevant, we need to engage policy makers,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, vice president and director of the Foreign Policy Program at Brookings, one of the oldest and most prestigious think tanks in Washington. In their contracts and internal documents, however, foreign governments are often explicit about what they expect from the research groups they finance.The think tanks\u2019 reliance on funds from overseas is driven, in part, by intensifying competition within the field: The number of policy groups has multiplied in recent years, while research grants from the United States government have dwindled. Foreign officials describe these relationships as pivotal to winning influence on the cluttered Washington stage, where hundreds of nations jockey for attention from the United States government. The arrangements vary: Some countries work directly with think tanks, drawing contracts that define the scope and direction of research. Others donate money to the think tanks, and then pay teams of lobbyists and public relations consultants to push the think tanks to promote the country\u2019s agenda.\u201cJapan is not necessarily the most interesting subject around the world,\u201d said Masato Otaka, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, when asked why Japan donates heavily to American research groups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been experiencing some slower growth in the economy. I think our presence is less felt than before.\u201dThe scope of foreign financing for American think tanks is difficult to determine. But since 2011, at least 64 foreign governments, state-controlled entities or government officials have contributed to a group of 28 major United States-based research organizations, according to disclosures by the institutions and government documents. What little information the organizations volunteer about their donors, along with public records and lobbying reports filed with American officials by foreign representatives, indicates a minimum of $92 million in contributions or commitments from overseas government interests over the last four years. The total is certainly more.In an interview, John J. Hamre, president and chief executive of the center, acknowledged that the organization\u2019s scholars at times advocate causes with the Obama administration and Congress on the topics that donor governments have funded them to study. But Mr. Hamre stressed that he did not view it as lobbying \u2014 and said his group is most certainly not a foreign agent.\u201cI don\u2019t represent anybody,\u201d Mr. Hamre, a former deputy secretary of defense, said. \u201cI never go into the government to say, \u2018I really want to talk to you about Morocco or about United Arab Emirates or Japan.\u2019 I have conversations about these places all the time with everybody, and I am never there representing them as a lobbyist to their interests.\u201d\u201cI am surprised, quite frankly, at how explicit the relationship is between money paid, papers published and policy makers and politicians influenced,\u201d said Amos Jones, a Washington lawyer who has specialized in the foreign agents act, after reviewing transactions between the Norway government and Brookings, the Center for Global Development and other groups. At least one of the research groups conceded that it may in fact be violating the federal law.\u201cYikes,\u201d said Todd Moss, the chief operating officer at the Center for Global Development, after being shown dozens of pages of emails between his organization and the government of Norway, which detail how his group would lobby the White House and Congress on behalf of the Norway government. \u201cWe will absolutely seek counsel on this.\u201dParallels With LobbyingThe line between scholarly research and lobbying can sometimes be hard to discern.To bolster the new group\u2019s credibility, Japanese officials sought validation from outside the halls of Congress. Within weeks, they received it from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, to which Japan has been a longtime donor. The center will not say how much money the government has given \u2014 or for what exactly \u2014 but an examination of its relationship with a state-funded entity called the Japan External Trade Organization provides a glimpse. Mr. Hamre, the center\u2019s president, acknowledged that his organization\u2019s researchers were pushing for the trade deal (it remains pending). But he said their advocacy was rooted in a belief that the agreement was good for the United States economy and the country\u2019s standing in Asia. Andrew Schwartz, a spokesman for the center, said that language in the agreements the organization signs with foreign governments gives its scholars final say over the policy positions they take \u2014 although he acknowledged those provisions have not been included in all such documents.\u201cWe have to respect their academic and intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Otaka, the Japanese Embassy spokesman, said in a separate interview. But one Japanese diplomat, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to discuss the matter, said the country expected favorable treatment in return for donations to think tanks.\u201cIf we put actual money in, we want to have a good result for that money \u2014 as it is an investment,\u201d he said.Foreign governments and state-controlled or state-financed entities have paid tens of millions of dollars to dozens of American think tanks in recent years, according to a New York Times investigation.Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 two nations that host large United States military bases and view a continued American military presence as central to their own national security \u2014 have been especially aggressive in their giving to think tanks. The two Persian Gulf monarchies are also engaged in a battle with each other to shape Western opinion, with Qatar arguing that Muslim Brotherhood-style political Islam is the Arab world\u2019s best hope for democracy, and the United Arab Emirates seeking to persuade United States policy makers that the Brotherhood is a dangerous threat to the region\u2019s stability.The nation paid the research organization to sponsor a lecture series \u201cto examine the strategic importance\u201d of the gulf region and \u201cidentify opportunities for constructive U.S. engagement.\u201d It also paid the center to organize annual trips to the gulf region during which dozens of national security experts from the United States would get private briefings from government officials there. Access to PowerSmall countries are finding that they can gain big clout by teaming up with American research organizations. Perhaps the best example is Norway. As one of the world\u2019s top oil producers, a member of NATO and a player in peace negotiations in spots around the globe, Norway has an interest in a broad range of United States policies.Norway is a major funder of forest protection efforts around the world. But while many environmentalists applaud the country\u2019s lobbying for forest protection, some have attacked the programs as self-interested: Slowing deforestation could buy more time for Norway\u2019s oil companies to continue selling fossil fuels on the global market even as Norway and other countries push for new carbon reduction policies. Oilwatch International, an environmental advocacy group, calls forest protection a \u201cscheme whereby polluters use forests and land as supposed sponges for their pollution.\u201dKare R. Aas, Norway\u2019s ambassador to the United States, rejected this criticism as ridiculous. As a country whose territory extends into the Arctic, he said, Norway would be among the nations most affected by global warming.\u201cWe want to maintain sustainable living conditions in the North,\u201d Mr. Aas said.But Norway\u2019s agreement imposed very specific demands on the Center for Global Development. The research organization, in return for Norway\u2019s money, was not simply asked to publish reports on combating climate change. The project documents ask the think tank to persuade Washington officials to double United States spending on global forest protection efforts to $500 million a year.\u201cTarget group: U.S. policy makers,\u201d a progress report reads.Norway has also funded Arctic research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, at a time when the country was seeking to expand its oil drilling in the Arctic region. Mr. Hamre, of the center, said he was invited to Norway about five years ago and given a presentation on the Arctic Circle, known in Norway as the \u201cHigh North.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is the High North?\u201d he said in an interview, recalling that he was not familiar with the topic until then.In a March 2013 report, scholars from the center urged the Obama administration to increase its military presence in the Arctic Circle, to protect energy exploration efforts there and to increase the passage of cargo ships through the region \u2014 the exact moves Norway has been advocating.William J. Antholis, the managing director at Brookings, said that if his scholars help Norway pursue its foreign policy agenda in Washington, it is only because their rigorous, independent research led them to this position. \u201cThe scholars are their own agents,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not agents of these foreign governments.\u201dBut three lawyers who specialize in the law governing Americans\u2019 activities on behalf of foreign governments said that the Center for Global Development and Brookings, in particular, appeared to have taken actions that merited registration as foreign agents of Norway. The activities by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Atlantic Council, they added, at least raised questions.\u201cThe Department of Justice needs to be looking at this,\u201d said Joshua Rosenstein, a lawyer at Sandler Reiff.Ona Dosunmu, Brookings\u2019s general counsel, examining the same documents, said she remained convinced that was a misreading of the law. Norway, at least, is grateful for the work Brookings has done. During a speech at Brookings in June, Norway\u2019s foreign minister, Borge Brende, noted that his country\u2019s relationship with the think tank \u201chas been mutually beneficial for moving a lot of important topics.\u201d Just before the speech, in fact, Norway signed an agreement to contribute an additional $4 million to the group.Limits on ScholarsThe tens of millions in donations from foreign interests come with certain expectations, researchers at the organizations said in interviews. Sometimes the foreign donors move aggressively to stifle views contrary to their own.But by the summer of 2013, when Egypt\u2019s military forcibly removed the country\u2019s democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, Ms. Dunne soon realized there were limits to her independence. After she signed a petition and testified before a Senate Foreign Relations Committee urging the United States to suspend military aid to Egypt, calling Mr. Morsi\u2019s ouster a \u201cmilitary coup,\u201d Bahaa Hariri called the Atlantic Council to complain, executives with direct knowledge of the events said.Ms. Dunne declined to comment on the matter. But four months after the call, Ms. Dunne left the Atlantic Council.In an interview, Mr. Kempe said he had never taken any action on behalf of Mr. Hariri to try to modify positions that Ms. Dunne or her colleagues took. Ms. Dunne left, he said, in part because she wanted to focus on research, not managing others, as she was doing at the Atlantic Council.\u201cDifferences she may have had with colleagues, management or donors on Middle Eastern issues \u2014 inevitable in such a fraught environment where opinions vary widely \u2014 don\u2019t touch our fierce defense of individual experts\u2019 intellectual independence,\u201d Mr. Kempe said.Scholars at other Washington think tanks, who were granted anonymity to detail confidential internal discussions, described similar experiences that had a chilling effect on their research and ability to make public statements that might offend current or future foreign sponsors. At Brookings, for example, a donor with apparent ties to the Turkish government suspended its support after a scholar there made critical statements about the country, sending a message, one scholar there said. \u201cIt is the self-censorship that really affects us over time,\u201d the scholar said. \u201cBut the fund-raising environment is very difficult at the moment, and Brookings keeps growing and it has to support itself.\u201d The sensitivities are especially important when it comes to the Qatari government \u2014 the single biggest foreign donor to Brookings. Mr. Ali, who served as one of the first visiting fellows at the Brookings Doha Center after it opened in 2009, said such a policy, though unwritten, was clear.\u201cThere was a no-go zone when it came to criticizing the Qatari government,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who is now a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia. \u201cIt was unsettling for the academics there. But it was the price we had to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Are American Families Doing? A Guided Tour of Our Financial Well-Being", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Recovery in Need of a RecoveryHow are we doing?That is the question that reverberates in every report of the latest economic data. It\u2019s the one that nags Americans as they head to the voting booth. It\u2019s the question that sets our national mood. A new report provides the most exhaustive look at how Americans\u2019 personal finances are faring \u2014 and sheds light on why the soaring stock market and occasionally giddy headlines have rarely translated into mass contentment with the economy.So how are we doing?No recovery in incomes for most groupsThe most basic measure of financial well-being is how much money people make and how much that money can buy. Many measures, such as per capita personal income, have risen in recent years, even after adjusting for inflation.But this survey gives us a richer view of how incomes of people in different groups were affected. It is rather depressing.Incomes rose nicely in the 2010 to 2013 time frame for the top 10 percent of earners (who had a median income of $230,000 last year). They rose slightly, by 0.7 percent, for the 80th to 90th percentile of earners (median of $122,000). But real incomes fell for every other group of earners.Separate people by age or education, and the same basic pattern applies. Those with a college degree have done fine, but anything less than that and incomes have fallen. Both young adult households (those headed by someone under 35) and those households headed by someone over 75 have seen steep income declines in that same period.This is the simplest yet most important fact to understand about the current economic recovery: It has not resulted in higher incomes for anyone other than those who were already doing well. And very large groups of Americans have experienced falling incomes.Wages have fallen as a proportion of incomeThe survey\u2019s breakdown of where household income is coming from helps explain why this is happening.Most Americans, particularly those in the middle- and lower-income brackets, derive most of their income from wages and salaries, not from investment income. In the wealthiest 25 percent of households, only 47 percent of their income comes from wages, compared with 70 to 80 percent for the lower three brackets.Wages have been under pressure for the last several years, as high unemployment has held back the ability of workers to demand raises. Meanwhile, a rise in asset prices for everything from stocks to real estate has meant that those with investments have greater opportunities to sell those assets for capital gains. And while the wealthiest 25 percent receive a meaningful chunk of their income from capital gains, the bottom 75 percent receive a trivial amount.It isn\u2019t a huge surprise that wages and salaries have fallen as a share of total household income, to 62 percent in 2013 from 68 percent in 2010. Capital gains income rose from 1 percent to 5 percent.And that goes a long way to explaining the disparate trends in total income among different groups.Wealth has been stagnant despite markets\u2019 recoveryIncome matters, but so does wealth. And here you would expect most everybody to be better off in 2013 than they were three years earlier. After all, the stock market and housing prices both experienced strong increases.Not quite. The gains in the stock market did not translate into greater wealth for most American families. The median American household was worth $81,200 in 2013, down from $82,800 in 2010 and way down from the $135,400 of 2007. (Those numbers are all inflation-adjusted, using 2013 dollars).Unlike incomes, a falling net worth is something that the wealthy and the rest of us can complain about together: The top 10 percent, as measured by either income or wealth, also had a slightly lower inflation-adjusted net worth in 2013 than in 2010, and both were still far below 2007 levels.The housing crash and financial crisis walloped the American household\u2019s finances, in other words, and as of last year there had been no recovery despite surging financial markets.The data contain answers as to why. The sell-off in the stock market in 2008 and 2009 was truly jaw-dropping. And it appears that many Americans \u2014 particularly middle-income Americans \u2014 decided investing in stocks just wasn\u2019t for them.Among people in the middle 20 percent of the income distribution, only 9.2 percent owned stocks in 2013, down from 14 percent in 2007. They also have eschewed retirement accounts, the most common vehicle for long-term investment; only 51 percent of middle-income families had a 401(k) or similar account in 2013, down from 56 percent in 2007.Among all Americans, the proportion owning stocks in some form, either directly or indirectly (via mutual funds or retirement accounts) has fallen from 53 percent before the crisis in 2007 to 49 percent in 2013. The financial crisis appears to have scared Americans, especially middle-income Americans, away from financial investments, which means they have benefited less from the recovery than they otherwise would have.But there\u2019s been progress reducing debtNet worth has two components: assets and liabilities. While the news is gloomy on the asset side of Americans\u2019 household balance sheets, things look rather better on the liabilities side. There has been major progress in reducing both the size of Americans\u2019 debts and how much they must pay relative to their incomes to service them.Among middle-income families, the proportion with mortgage debt on their primary residences fell from 50.5 percent in 2007 to under 40 percent in 2013. Of those in that income bracket who had a home mortgage, the median balance fell 15 percent to $84,800 from $99,600.Other forms of debt were also paid down. The proportion of families with credit card balances fell from 46 percent in 2007 to 38 percent in 2013.Meanwhile, the combination of low interest rate policies from the Fed and Americans\u2019 work to reduce debts is having major benefits in terms of decreasing the share of incomes that goes into paying debt. For all families, debt service payment is the lowest share of income it has been in any survey going back to 1989.For those key middle-income consumers, debt service isn\u2019t the lowest on record, but it has still fallen from nearly 20 percent of income in 2007 to 16 percent today. It may not sound like much, but spending 4 percent less of income to service mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and other debts leaves noticeably more for everything else.Progress, but frustrationAdd it all up, and how are Americans doing? The progress in reducing debt burdens is good news, and it leaves Americans less vulnerable to shocks. But as long as incomes are not rising for most Americans and the booming market is not widely enjoyed, there\u2019s little reason to expect people to be happy with the results they\u2019re getting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Miners, Increasing Risk on a Mountain at the Heart of Bolivia\u2019s Identity", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPotosi JournalPOTOS\u00cd, Bolivia \u2014 The silver in this mountain helped finance the Spanish empire. It created vast fortunes for some and misery for many more. It fueled the early growth of European capitalism, setting the stage for the modern era.But now, after centuries of hauling out its riches, miners working near the peak have clawed away so much of the interior of the mountain that it is caving in from the top down.At the peak of this historic mountain \u2014 known as Cerro Rico, or Rich Hill, standing at more than 15,600 feet \u2014 a giant sinkhole has opened, a jagged mouth in the blood-red rock.In June, Unesco warned that the mountain, depicted at the center of Bolivia\u2019s flag, faced a critical risk of collapse at its summit. \u201cSince the internal structure of the upper part of the Cerro Rico is severely weakened due to continuous exploitation,\u201d it said, \u201cthere is a significant risk that miners could die from collapses inside the tunnels.\u201dIn July, the government said that it planned to shut down mines above 14,435 feet, where about 1,500 miners work in conditions that can range from rudimentary to brutal. Many thousands of miners work in mines farther down the mountain.\u201cIt is an emergency where we have to act quickly,\u201d said Marcelino Quispe, the president of the government-run Bolivian Mining Corporation, known as Comibol. It grants concessions to the private companies known as cooperatives that work on the mountain, and it helped pay for a failed effort last year to stabilize and cap the sinkhole.But many miners do not want to leave, saying that the government has offered to move them to new mines far away, with no guarantee that the sites will be as lucrative as the ones they are leaving.The miners have developed strong ties to the mines. Some believe that each mine has a god or a spirit, called a T\u00edo, that protects them. The miners give the T\u00edo, usually represented in the mine by a clay figure in the shape of a man, offerings of cigarettes and alcohol, coca leaves and other items.On a recent day at the Milagro Mine, which is among those the government plans to close, miners shrugged off the suggestion that they could be at risk, saying that their mine was far enough from the area of the collapse at the peak to avoid any danger.\u201cWhat worries us is leaving here, going far away, leaving our families behind,\u201d said Gregorio Alave, 45. \u201cWe will have to fight with the government to get a good mine.\u201dMr. Alave has an ownership stake in the cooperative that owns the mining concession, but he employs a younger man to do much of the heavier work. A doctor recently told him that he had advanced silicosis, an incurable lung disease common to miners who breathe in rock dust, and that he should stop working underground. But he said that he must keep working to support his family, despite the bad cough he has developed.Inside the mine, lit only by the battery-powered lamps on miners\u2019 helmets, the smell of dynamite hung in the chill air. Miners used shovels to load rock into carts with rubber tires, which they pushed to the surface along a narrow tunnel, ducking down in sections where the ceiling dropped as low as four feet high.Deep inside, on a small ledge, sat the T\u00edo, with a tiny bottle of alcohol and a pile of coca leaves, like the ones many miners chew as a stimulant to propel them through a day of hard work at high altitude. Throughout the mine were small brightly colored flags and paper ribbons left from a recent festival, which the miners call the T\u00edo\u2019s birthday.The collapse at the top of the mountain started in 2010. Gradually, the sinkhole grew larger, appearing as a bite carved out of what had been the triangular peak of the Cerro Rico. That caused alarm among Potosinos who worried that the icon of their city was damaged.\u201cIt\u2019s like the Statue of Liberty for you,\u201d said Joel Vera, 40, a computer technician. \u201cEveryone recognizes New York for the Statue of Liberty. Everyone recognizes Potos\u00ed for its mountain.\u201dThe Cerro Rico is intimately tied to the history of Potos\u00ed and Bolivia. Many Bolivians see it as a potent national symbol. Historians say that indigenous groups like the Inca mined the mountain for silver, but intensive mining began in 1545 after the Spanish conquest.Potos\u00ed, a World Heritage site, is considered one of the richest silver deposits ever mined. In combination with silver from other mines in the Americas, it helped change the global economy, vastly increasing the amount of silver in circulation worldwide and creating the conditions for a money-based economy in Europe.According to the historian Jack Weatherford, \u201cPotos\u00ed was the first city of capitalism, for it supplied the primary ingredient of capitalism: money.\u201dDespite its high altitude (about 13,353 feet above sea level), Potos\u00ed became one of the world\u2019s largest and wealthiest cities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The city center is still full of colonial buildings, such as the mint where the Spanish created silver bars and coins.It is a mining town to its core. Neighborhood stores sell mining helmets, shovels and dynamite, along with soft drinks and soap. In one shop, a glass case on the counter held a neat stack of dozens of sticks of dynamite.For all the wealth the mountain generated, the misery outpaced it a hundredfold. The Spanish used Indians, or slaves brought from Africa, to work in the mines in brutal conditions. The death toll was high.Nonetheless, it may be the mountain\u2019s recent history that doomed it. For many years, Comibol mined the mountain. But silver prices plummeted in the 1980s and Comibol pulled out, handing the mountain over to the small private mining cooperatives.Despite the name, the cooperatives are often owned or controlled by families or small groups, and the majority of miners laboring on the Cerro Rico are employees, with no ownership stake in the companies. The workers often include children, generally in their mid to late teens.The national ombudsman\u2019s office said in a recent report that it had identified 145 children working in mines on the Cerro Rico, most of them 15 to 17.Mining cooperatives here and elsewhere in Bolivia have tremendous political power, and they tend to operate with little effective oversight. The result, critics say, has been deteriorating conditions in the Cerro Rico for miners and the mountain.Ren\u00e9 Vacaflores, 66, a mining engineer who has worked on the Cerro Rico for decades, called the mountain an anthill, saying that it is crisscrossed with tunnels and vertical shafts called chimneys that have proliferated in the years since the cooperatives took over, with little or no regulatory supervision. He said that mining companies no longer kept accurate maps of their tunnels and that in some mines, basic safety measures were crude or absent. He said that in some mines, workers were lowered on ropes down vertical shafts.\u201cIt is hell,\u201d Mr. Vacaflores said.Mr. Vacaflores said that the collapse at the top was partly because of miners pulling rock from vertical shafts that had been filled in after previous periods of mining.\u201cIf the government had run the mountain rationally, with technicians, this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have gotten rich. They have plundered and plundered.\u201dHe said that accidents were frequent and often fatal and that the bodies of dead miners, frequently migrants from the countryside, were often taken straight to their villages for burial so the deaths did not come to the attention of local officials or mining regulators.Mr. Quispe, the Comibol president, said that his company did not keep track of deaths in the mines, which he said was the responsibility of the individual cooperatives.\u201cWhen there is a bigger collapse here, more than 1,000 could die,\u201d Mr. Vacaflores said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t understand that could happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A decision would be made within three months, the Taiwan government said.Some Xiaomi phones automatically send user data to the firm\u2019s servers in Beijing, where the company is based, potentially leading to security breaches, according to the statement posted Tuesday on the website of Taiwan\u2019s executive branch.The inquiry is a reminder of the scrutiny Chinese technology firms are subject to abroad, as governments become increasingly wary of potential cybersecurity threats from China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. China\u2019s government and companies are frequently accused of industrial espionage and cyberespionage.Concerns are also mounting that Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province, is overreliant on the mainland. Critics of Beijing argue that expanding economic ties allow China to influence Taiwan\u2019s fiercely democratic politics.The statement added that the popular Japanese instant messaging service Line, owned by Naver of South Korea, would be banned from use on government work-related computers, also because of security concerns.A Line spokeswoman based in Tokyo said the company was investigating the matter, but would not provide more details.Xiaomi declined to comment.The smartphone maker recently came under fire for unauthorized data access, spurring the company to upgrade its operating system and let users refuse to allow it to collect information from their address books.Although the vast majority of the company\u2019s sales are in China, Xiaomi has set up shop elsewhere in Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and India. It is also weighing expansion into countries such as Thailand, Brazil and Mexico.Trade ties between China and Taiwan have skyrocketed in recent years, though Taiwan still often views Chinese firms with suspicion.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan Nears a Nuclear Reboot", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorial ObserverAll of Japan\u2019s 48 operable nuclear reactors \u2014 the source of about one-third of the country\u2019s electricity \u2014 were shut down after the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011. Three years later, Japan\u2019s Nuclear Regulation Authority has certified two reactors at the Sendai power plant on the southern island of Kyushu meet the safety standards imposed after the accident.It could be months before either reactor is turned on. The company that owns the reactors will make that decision after getting local consent. Even so, the authority\u2019s certification is a major step in the government\u2019s effort to restart the nuclear industry. The authority was created two years ago to restore public confidence in nuclear oversight. The government gave it responsibility to set stricter safety standards and to determine whether reactors met them. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is eager to restore nuclear power as part of his plan to revive the country\u2019s sputtering economy. The public is divided. There is enthusiasm among some locals who see the plants as a source of jobs, but skepticism, according to polls, in the population as a whole. Fukushima showed that absolute safety of nuclear power is a dangerous myth, especially in earthquake-prone Japan. The Sendai plant might have cleared stricter earthquake and tsunami standards, but it is also located in an active volcanic area, about which the new safety standards say little.In addition, the authority\u2019s assessment did not address the issue of evacuation in case of an accident, which is the responsibility of local governments. A simulation conducted found that it could take as long as 28 hours to evacuate 90 percent of the residents from within a 30 kilometer radius of the Sendai power plant. Local governments lack the capacity and expertise to conduct a major evacuation, and local leaders have asked the national government to take a more active role in forging evacuation plans. The chaos that ensued from the Fukushima accident should be an obvious reminder of the need for such plans in the event of a major accident. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Indexes Suffer Worst Day Since July", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA stumble by Apple helped set off a rout in the stock market on Thursday, its worst day in nearly two months.The selling started early and picked up strength in the afternoon. By the close of trading, all 30 of the big companies in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 10 industry sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index lost ground.Some market analysts said the drop was not a sign of trouble, as all the forces behind the market\u2019s long rally remained in place. It was only a week ago that the S.&P. 500 touched a record high, and strong runs are usually followed by short breaks. The index has lost 2 percent this week, but is still up 6 percent for the year.\u201cThere\u2019s just an absence of real news to chew on,\u201d said Mark Luschini, the chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at a peak, markets need more and more good news to keep climbing.\u201dThe S.&P. 500 index lost 32.31 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 1,965.99. The Dow slumped 264.26 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 16,945.80. The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by technology companies, dropped 88.47 points, or 1.9 percent, to 4,466.75. It was the worst day for all three indexes since July 31.Technology companies were hit hardest. Apple dropped nearly 4 percent after its announcement late Wednesday that it had withdrawn a software update that prevented users from making phone calls. Others complained that they bent their new iPhones by sitting on them. Apple fell $3.88 to close at $97.87 in heavy trading.Two economic reports released Thursday were little help. Claims for unemployment benefits crept up last week. But the less volatile four-week average fell. A separate report said business orders for equipment plunged last month, mainly a result of falling orders for commercial aircraft.\u201cThe economic numbers were negative, but not alarming and don\u2019t change the direction of the economy at this time,\u201d said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Financial.Henry Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, said there was no fundamental reason behind the drop on Thursday. A sudden turn might seem alarming because it\u2019s so unusual.\u201cWe\u2019ve really had such little volatility for the past couple of years,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cNow when we have a 200-point drop in the Dow, it feels like something is really wrong.\u201dTrading this week has turned increasingly turbulent, an abrupt break from a sleepy summer. On Monday, concerns about slowing growth in China and falling home sales knocked the market back, giving the S.&P. 500 its worst daily drop in more than a month. On Wednesday, the S.&P. 500 had its best gain in more than a month.Some investment professionals have been warning that the market has been calm for too long and say a 10 percent drop, or correction, is overdue. Since World War II, the stock market typically undergoes a correction every 18 months, according to S&P Capital IQ. The last one hit in August 2011.\u201cBig pullbacks are normal in a bull market,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cWhat\u2019s abnormal is that we\u2019ve gone three years without one.\u201dBut Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at research firm Bell Curve Trading, thinks stocks could fall further as the S.&P. 500 slips toward 1,950. He said the money that investors poured into stocks when the index crossed above that mark could be pulled out.\u201cYou could get people wanting to liquidate,\u201d Mr. Strazzullo said. \u201cIf you go below 1,950, the market can easily correct 10 percent, maybe more.\u201dIn the bond market, interest rates dropped.

Money alone wouldn\u2019t have helped.A friend of mine has been based in Kenema, Sierra Leone, for the last few weeks. She says things have continued to deteriorate there, despite the millions pledged by the United States, the Gates Foundation and others. Why? Because the money is not getting there yet.The nurses are not getting paid regularly and are afraid, so most have quit or have gone on strike. It\u2019s hard to blame them when more than 40 workers at the Kenema hospital have succumbed to Ebola infection.With trained personnel like the American troops being sent, the hospitals will not just be a place people go to perish. The writer is an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.To the Editor:Our military and veterans hospitals aren\u2019t doing the best job taking care of our wounded warriors. And now we are putting up to 3,000 troops at risk of getting Ebola?Since when did dealing with communicable diseases in Africa become part of the job description for signing up? What part of boot camp covers warding off diseases and building hospitals in Africa? This seems a bit over the edge to expect of our military men and women, some of whom have already served numerous deployments. If we really \u201csupport our troops,\u201d would we be concocting more ways to send them into harm\u2019s way?To the Editor:Because the number of reported cases of most diseases often grossly underestimates the actual number of cases, the estimates and even the future projections of Ebola cases may be far too low.Given that Ebola is spreading rapidly and that hospitals and funerals are places where intense Ebola transmission often occurs, control measures should focus on upgrading the capabilities and resources of hospital workers to contain the disease and improving the abilities of funeral workers to prevent Ebola transmission. The writer, a physician, is a former medical epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.To the Editor:Africa has experienced many public health crises over the last century. During the colonial era, exploitative economic policies and poor investment in social services magnified the effect of disease. In the post-colonial period, Western-imposed structural adjustment policies dramatically cut government spending and slashed the medical capacities of African countries.Ebola\u2019s devastating course today reflects these continuing legacies, which are man-made rather than consequences of Mother Nature\u2019s arbitrary whims.Without recognizing this, we cannot begin to understand how to remedy the present crisis. Situating the epidemic in its historical and political context need not entail minimizing Ebola\u2019s very real risks. On the contrary, it sharpens our ability to address them more effectively. The writer is an assistant professor of African history at Boston College.To the Editor:African countries have just begun to tally the economic toll of the Ebola epidemic. Although we don\u2019t yet know the final number, we can be certain that it will be frighteningly high.Governments and aid agencies are struggling to reverse the emergency. It is important for immediate relief to be carried out in ways that also build local capacity to address future threats, including by aiding struggling local health leaders with skills that help now and in the future.But once the immediate threat has passed, they must also mobilize to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again. Investments in strong health systems will yield a resilience dividend against a future Ebola epidemic and against other health crises. In times of hardship, robust health systems alleviate casualties and save lives, and in times of calm they boost social cohesion and productivity.As Ebola\u2019s economic toll mounts, countries must avoid the temptation to conclude that investments in health systems aren\u2019t affordable. What African countries cannot afford is to be unprepared for another emergency like Ebola. The writer is a managing director at the Rockefeller Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Vital Center for a Bronx Community Closes", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySide StreetMariana Lopez came to this country from Cuba in 2008, possessing few things besides one: an intense desire to get ahead. With no friends or family, she settled into an apartment near Yankee Stadium, waitressed in a restaurant at night and wondered how to fit into this fabled land.After discovering free English classes in her neighborhood at the Highbridge Community Life Center, she went on to get her high school equivalency diploma and, later, enrolled in courses that would lead to work in patient care. All this cost her nothing but her effort.Last June, right before a test about blood pressure, she learned something that sent hers skyrocketing. After 35 years, serving thousands of poor but ambitious residents, the Highbridge Center was closing.She took the test anyway.\u201cThe teacher gave us the test because they did not want us to fall behind,\u201d Ms. Lopez said. \u201cI\u2019m just knocking on doors now, trying to find a place to take free classes. My goal was to work in a hospital by year\u2019s end. Now I don\u2019t know. I suffer every day. I feel like maybe I\u2019m stupid.\u201dIn a few years, Highbridge went from an esteemed and vital local institution to one where grants were cut or reassigned to other organizations, dedicated staff members forsook pay until they were laid off and clients \u2014 some 3,000 annually \u2014 were left in the cold. There is not a single villain in this, former staff members said, but rather a series of unexpected events, a bad economy and poor planning by management.Heartbreak, more than anger, prevails among the staff and its neighbors, who had made Highbridge \u2014 which ran educational, citizenship and family and youth programs \u2014 one of the few beacons for waves of immigrants who settled in the High Bridge neighborhood in the west Bronx.\u201cWe were started by two nuns in a storefront and grew into a major social service agency in this neighborhood that was kind of off by itself,\u201d said Brother Bill Fecteau, who taught at the center for 30 years. \u201cWe became a vital part of High Bridge.\u201dPart of the problem lay in the center\u2019s success, a familiar hazard for many organizations with grass-roots origins. As it added programs and staff members, it also took on expenses: salaries, benefits, rent and equipment. With a budget of around $5 million in recent years \u2014 mostly from government and foundation grants \u2014 Highbridge seemed flush, but the reality of how city and state contracts work did not help.Gary Calnek, the center\u2019s board chairman, said the organization had to first spend money on its programs, waiting months before being reimbursed through its government contracts. The loss of several major contracts a few years ago \u2014 one because of differences with the city over performance measures, and another because of a citywide cut in a program for young people \u2014 put the organization in the hole, and led it to rely on a line of credit to meet expenses. Private donations, which would have had few if any restrictions on use, accounted for maybe 10 percent of the center\u2019s budget.Things got worse last year when the executive director retired with no replacement. Then, money from a $500,000 state education contract was delayed, an unexpected ripple effect, Mr. Calnek said, of the federal government\u2019s shutdown. Paydays were delayed, then paychecks cut, and by June, stopped. Health care insurance, several former staff members said, was also cut.Merger talks failed because Highbridge had too much debt and managerial uncertainty. No options remained.\u201cCash flow, not program performance, painted us into a corner,\u201d Mr. Calnek said. \u201cWe had to bite the bullet, which was not something we wanted to do.\u201dHighbridge\u2019s Ogden Avenue offices are padlocked. Inside its silent classrooms, walls are decorated with copies of diplomas and citizenship certificates from past clients. Teachers who watched in disbelief as the center shut down still have their students texting them photos of their equivalency diplomas, asking when there might be a celebration of their accomplishments.Staff members, who are still owed about six weeks\u2019 pay on average, had hoped something would have worked out by September. Instead, Mr. Calnek just hopes to get some foundation money to pay what is owed to the staff, about $350,000 by some estimates. Last week, he was in court to face a lawsuit filed by Valley National Bank, which is demanding repayment of $600,000 the center owes on its line of credit. Neither the bank nor Mr. Calnek would comment on the litigation.\u201cI thought this agency was too big to fail in High Bridge,\u201d Brother Bill said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not getting any bailout like the banks did. All that is left is a hole in our community.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His older brother was killed in World War II, and when his father died in 1950, he became the 11th Duke, inheriting vast wealth, including a castle in Ireland and Chatsworth, a 35,000-acre Derbyshire estate that had been in his family for generations.Surrounded by 105 acres of gardens designed by Capability Brown and miles of meadows and wooded hills, Chatsworth\u2019s magnificent 16th-century mansion, with ceilings painted by Antonio Verrio, had 297 rooms, 112 fireplaces, 68 lavatories, 26 baths, 32 kitchens and workshops, 17 staircases, and 1.3 acres of roof.But it came with a catch: inheritance taxes of nearly $20 million, not to mention huge maintenance costs. Like many of Britain\u2019s great country houses fallen on hard times, Chatsworth, outmoded and rundown, had long been open to the public, but its trickle of visitors and income left the duke and duchess in the red. They sold artworks and acreage to pay taxes totaling 80 percent of the estate\u2019s value: $285 million in today\u2019s money.Transforming Chatsworth from a museumlike relic into a self-sustaining family business, however, was a more ambitious long-term project that, because of the duke\u2019s alcoholism and other problems, fell largely to the duchess. She made it the core of her life\u2019s work.She put in central heating, phones, new wiring and plumbing for 17 new bathrooms; opened gift shops and a market that employed 100 people and sold meat and produce, including the Duchess\u2019s Marmalade and the Duke\u2019s Favorite Sausages. She began lecturing on farming, drawing 200,000 people a year. Later came restaurants, catering services, boutiques and other moneymakers, including two hotels near Chatsworth.Recognizing the commercial value of her involvement, she took a hands-on approach to running the house, greeting and leading tourists through the public rooms, teaching classes and feeding her chickens: Leghorns, Rhode Island Reds, Buff Cochins, Welsummers and less notable types that ran loose on the grounds like marauding gangs.In 2002, Chatsworth became self-sufficient for the first time, covering its $6.5 million annual costs with income from the Chatsworth House Trust and proceeds from visitors, country fairs and the restaurants and shops she had started. Some 600,000 people a year visit Chatsworth, making it one of Britain\u2019s most popular rural tourist sites.She was born Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford on March 31, 1920, at Asthall Manor, the Oxfordshire estate of her parents, David Freeman-Mitford, the 2nd Baron Redesdale, and the former Sydney Bowles. Denied formal educations, she and her sisters developed a rich fantasy life, creating a secret \u201cSociety of Hons,\u201d which met in the warm linen cupboard at Swinbrook, another stone-cold family mansion. There, they divided the world into \u201cHons\u201d \u2014 or honorables, as barons\u2019 daughters are known, and others they liked \u2014 and \u201cCounter-Hons,\u201d everybody else. They invented secret languages, Honnish and Boudledidge, which mimicked rural Oxfordshire accents, with distorted vowels and softened consonants, all pronounced in tones of hopeless yearning. A governess taught them the joys of village shoplifting.They went their ways: Nancy (1904-73) wrote \u201cThe Pursuit of Love\u201d and \u201cLove in a Cold Climate.\u201d Pamela (1907-94), married a horseman who became a physicist. Thomas (1909-45) was killed in the war. Diana (1910-2003) married Britain\u2019s fascist leader, Oswald Mosley, and was imprisoned with him for most of the war. Unity (1914-48), who was Eva Braun\u2019s rival for Hitler\u2019s affections, died a decade after her attempted suicide with the bullet still in her head. Jessica (1917-96) eloped with Churchill\u2019s nephew, and they moved to the United States. He was killed in the war, and she remained in America, writing \u201cThe American Way of Death\u201d and other books. Unlike her siblings, Deborah knew little of politics growing up. But her marriage to Lord Cavendish brought her into political circles. His uncle by marriage was the future prime minister Harold Macmillan, who found government jobs for him, and they had long been friends of the Kennedy clan (the families were related by marriage) and attended the inauguration and funeral of President John F. Kennedy.Three of the couple\u2019s six children died shortly after birth.Besides her son, who holds the title Duke of Devonshire, her survivors include two daughters, Lady Emma Tennant and Lady Sophia Topley; eight grandchildren; and 18 great-grandchildren.In 1999, Queen Elizabeth II named the duchess a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order for her services to preserving Britain\u2019s residential heritage.An earlier version of this obituary referred incorrectly to Andrew Cavendish, whom the duchess married at 21. He was the second son of the 10th Duke of Devonshire, not of the 10th Duke of Cavendish.Daniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina vs. The Vultures", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina has defaulted on its debt three times in the last 32 years, most recently last month, making it somewhat of an expert on the subject.After failing to satisfy a judgment ordering the country to pay $1.3 billion to American hedge funds, closing it out of international credit markets, the hashtag \u201cArgentina vs. the Vultures\u201d no longer makes its citizens anxious. They see it as business as usual.Argentina is disputing the ruling, by Judge Thomas P. Griesa of New York, which forbids the country to pay the restructured debt from 2002 without paying the investment funds that have held out for full payment. The country has divided its bond holders into two groups: the good ones, who settled their debt for 30 cents on the dollar; and the evil ones, who refused to settle, taking their case to the courts and winning.But the so-called vultures have helped President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner ease back into the spotlight. In fighting the angry birds of capitalism, she is raising her profile at home, where her grip on power was waning. She has been rising in the polls.In July, Mrs. Kirchner was facing the most difficult moment in her administration. After six years in office, her policies had resulted in an annual inflation rate that may be as high as 40 percent (official statistics peg it at 10.9 percent), a stubborn recession and little hope for economic growth. Mrs. Kirchner and her husband, N\u00e9stor, who preceded her as president and who died in 2010, ascended to power after the crisis and debt default in 2002. Between then and the current crisis, isolation from the international credit markets set Argentina apart from other left-leaning but more market-friendly South American governments, such as Brazil and Chile. With her vice president, Amado Boudou, put on trial on corruption charges earlier this year for his involvement with the company that prints Argentina\u2019s currency, Mrs. Kirchner was running out of options. In May, she sought to raise her profile by creating an agency with the Orwellian name of Secretariat for Strategic Coordination of National Thought. But the hedge funds proved a more successful foil for coordinating the nation\u2019s thinking. Most Argentines think it\u2019s fair to defy Judge Griesa and defer payment, even if it means that credit markets consider the country an outlaw, because the system itself is flawed. Argentines have a weakness for defiant characters. The writer Jorge Luis Borges said the country sympathized with \u201cgood outlaws,\u201d those who fought unjust laws. Mrs. Kirchner has assumed the role with aplomb: Like the Argentine literary character Mart\u00edn Fierro, she\u2019s the outlaw with good intentions, the heroine who never betrayed the people and was willing to defy the capitalists.  Argentines have become skeptics about the usefulness of world markets. \u201cHere, there\u2019s never been a market god,\u201d says Mauricio Corbal\u00e1n, 46, an urban planner who lives in Buenos Aires. \u201cThey no longer trust the neoliberal expert that says you have to pay, no matter what.\u201d In mid-August, Mrs. Kirchner made an emotional appearance on national television. \u201cI know I\u2019m taking a big decision here; I\u2019m nervous about it,\u201d she said, almost in tears. She explained that the country was trying to make good on its debt payments, but was prevented from doing so by Judge Griesa\u2019s ruling. China, Argentina\u2019s latest power partner, is eager to see the dispute resolved. Argentina began paying debts earlier this year to the Paris Club and others in a failed attempt to re-enter the credit markets. But Judge Griesa\u2019s ruling interrupted the path to normalization, denying the country the boost that foreign investment could bring. Argentina\u2019s leaders have reacted by promoting new laws that will grant more power to the state in regulating the economy. To curb inflation, there\u2019s a smartphone app, Cared-for Prices, that allows citizens to \u201ccontrol\u201d prices. Both Argentina and Venezuela share the belief that new technologies can perfect the growing presence of the government in people\u2019s lives, a neo-Socialist approach that has created two of Latin America\u2019s most fragile economies. Inside the presidential mansion, known as the Casa Rosada, the minister of economy, Axel Kicilloff, has two nicknames: \u201cExcel\u201d and \u201cthe Soviet.\u201d  The political gain from the dispute with the vultures is likely to be short-lived, as inflation and stagnation persist. But it cements Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s style as a bejeweled, Ferragamo-carrying committed Socialist: \u201cTo my left, there\u2019s only the wall,\u201d she said recently. Not quite. Between that wall and Mrs. Kirchner, the Argentines stand trapped. Advertisement"}

But lately, the company has been forced to think outside the bottle, as Americans continue to spend more cautiously than they did before the economic collapse of 2008, and are always on the hunt for the next best thing.Johnson & Johnson has tripled its varieties of Listerine in the United States to nine since 2006, when it bought the brand from Pfizer as part of an acquisition of its consumer health care unit, according to a spokeswoman, Carol Goodrich. The company has also steadily increased the different kinds of mouthwash it offers overseas, adjusting its original formula to add benefits like whitening or gingivitis defense.The recession, tepid spending and slow population increases have helped flatten sales growth in the United States, according to James Russo, the senior vice president for global consumer insights at Nielsen. Consumer products manufacturers are increasingly looking to bring in dollars from overseas, from developing economies with growing middle classes in areas like Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.The need to rethink old brands reflects a new reality, as companies like Johnson & Johnson are increasingly aiming for the local cultures, appetites and customs of these new markets.\u201cThe bigger and more penetrated that they are in the U.S. and in developed Western markets, the more important it is for them to push on these developing markets and emerging markets for growth,\u201d said Matt Miksic, an analyst with Piper Jaffray.In the stink lab in New Jersey, it takes a team of scientists to create new flavors and varieties that will \u201ckill germs that cause bad breath,\u201d as its longtime slogan goes. The team collects 20 to 30 milliliters of saliva \u2014 about two full bottles of nail polish worth \u2014 twice a week from employees who work in the building. (Ms. Goodrich said that the employees were paid for their fluids, but declined to say how much).The lab is kept between 91 and 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit to resemble a real human mouth where bacteria can flourish. Linger inside, and the smell can stay on one\u2019s clothes for hours.\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t consider it gross anymore,\u201d said Tara Fourre, Listerine\u2019s principal scientist, who has worked at the lab for more than a decade. \u201cBut when I go home, my family thinks it\u2019s gross because they can smell it on me.\u201dNamed after Joseph Lister, a 19th-century British surgeon and the founder of antiseptic medicine, Listerine has always been promoted for its antibacterial uses, some of them outside of the mouth.Early ads suggested customers apply Listerine to their scalp to clear up dandruff, or to put the antiseptic in their \u201ccuts, scratches and small wounds.\u201dIf Listerine has more recently localized its uses, so, too, has it widened its audience. No longer do its ads try to scare women into buying mouthwash, lest their bad breath ward off potential suitors (\u201calways a bridesmaid\u201d was a popular early ad slogan) or even their families (\u201cIt makes you unpopular with your own children\u201d).While sales of the company\u2019s original antiseptic rinse remain strong in the United States, most of the other variations have slumped, according to data from IRI, a market research firm based in Chicago.Listerine as a whole still dominates the $1.5 billion United States mouthwash market, but it has lost some ground to retail brands and competitors like Crest from Procter & Gamble. Sales have declined since 2006, according to data from Euromonitor. Last year, Listerine represented 44.4 percent of the total mouthwash market, down from 58.7 percent in 2006.Listerine also dominates the market globally, although it also faces stiffer competition overseas. Worldwide, Listerine\u2019s market share slipped to 36.1 percent in 2013, from 40.2 percent in 2006, while brands like Colgate Plax from Colgate Palmolive and Crest gained more of a foothold.Jessica Spano, a spokeswoman for Crest, said the company had also expanded in Latin America, Asia and Europe. Sales of Crest doubled worldwide from 2006 to $234 million in 2013. Last year, global mouthwash sales increased to $4.8 billion, from $2.7 billion in 2004, according to data from Euromonitor.Johnson & Johnson hopes that a push into developing markets can help offset those declines, and international markets have helped push the company to come up with new variations of its mouth rinse.While some of its overseas customers may be buying mouthwash for the first time, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s task is trickier in mature markets where consumers are more demanding. In Europe, for example, consumers want their mouthwash to solve more complicated problems than just bad breath. To meet that demand, Johnson & Johnson released an advanced gum treatment rinse in Britain and Ireland last year.\u201cThe biggest problem is if you don\u2019t understand consumer needs,\u201d said Alison Lewis, chief marketing officer for Johnson & Johnson. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do that well, you don\u2019t win.\u201dAccording to Nielsen data, the middle-class population is projected to double in Africa and the Middle East by 2030. In North America, 49 percent of consumers \u201clive comfortably or spend freely,\u201d according to Nielsen\u2019s data, compared with 64 percent in Asia Pacific. Consumers in developing markets are also generally more willing to spend a premium for new, innovative products.Johnson & Johnson is not the only manufacturer to increase its bet on its major brands in response to sputtering sales in the United States, still one of the world\u2019s most important markets.In August, Procter & Gamble announced it would dispense with about half of its more obscure product lines, potentially including things like Zooth, a children\u2019s oral care brand, and Trojan, a Southeast Asian laundry detergent, and focus on its most lucrative brands, like Tide.Kimberly-Clark, a major global manufacturer of diapers, announced last year that it would pursue a spinoff of its health care business, and has recently led a marketing push to destigmatize Depend, its adult undergarment line for incontinence.In its 2013 annual report, Johnson & Johnson listed Listerine among a dozen major brands that would help propel the company\u2019s growth.Mr. Lister\u2019s original mouthwash promises to clear up bad breath by killing almost every germ in your mouth. Ms. Fourre says that Listerine\u2019s widening group of cosmetic variations should kill at least 99 percent of germs, and the lab performs a \u201ccritical kill time\u201d test on new formulas. The test exposes bacteria to Listerine for 30 or 60 seconds, depending on how long one must swish it around.That means the lab needs a constant stream of fresh mouth germs, where the foul smell lets staff members know that the growth process is working.\u201cWe need to keep them happy before we\u2019re ready to kill them,\u201d Ms. Fourre said.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Still, the four-week average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure, rose just 750 to 304,000. The average is 7.1 percent lower than it was a year ago.Jobless claims are a proxy for layoffs. The four-week average fell to an eight-year low of 293,750 last month. Generally, fewer jobless claims indicate employers are holding onto their staffs.The data covers the week ended Sept. 6, which included the Labor Day holiday. Unemployment benefits data can be more volatile around holidays. As a result, the modest increase is unlikely to raise alarms about the health of the job market.\u201cThis is nothing to worry about,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201dThe seasonal adjustment is tricky in the week of the Labor Day holiday. Next week should see a clear drop.\u201dThe last time new jobless claims touched 315,000, in late June, employers were adding more than 200,000 jobs a month.Still, the rise in applications comes after employers added just 142,000 jobs in August, the fewest in eight months. The unemployment rate fell to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent, but only because some of those out of work gave up looking for jobs.Other recent data indicates that the August hiring dip may be temporary. The number of open jobs remained near a 13-year high in July, a government report on Tuesday showed. That points to healthier hiring. Employers also filled more of their open jobs in July.Despite a sluggish August, hiring has picked up this year. The economy has generated an average of 215,000 jobs a month so far in 2014, up from 194,000 in 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Germany Keeps Its Economic Engine Idling", "Date": "2014-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInside EuropePARIS \u2014 Europe\u2019s engine of economic growth is idling.With the eurozone economy stuck in a rut, despite European Central Bank efforts to pump money into the system, pressure is mounting for Germany to use its healthy budget position to increase public investment, stimulate demand and spur growth.The answer from Chancellor Angela Merkel so far is an adamant no, which was spelled out firmly to Prime Minister Manuel Valls of France during his visit to Berlin last week.If her refusal is final, rather than a tactic to extract more reforms from European partners, it could dash the prospects of a grand bargain to revive the European economy that was sketched out by the E.C.B. president, Mario Draghi. That could tip the eurozone back into another recession, worsen unemployment and fuel political radicalism.The International Monetary Fund, the E.C.B., the European Commission, the United States and Germany\u2019s eurozone partners are pleading with Berlin to stimulate its economy through tax cuts and investment in aging road, rail, energy and telecommunications networks.German officials acknowledge privately that the country has an investment gap, both public and private. It spends less than half as much of its economic output on public investment as France or Sweden, less even than Greece. Yet the government is determined to stick to its balanced budget strategy, even though its own economy shows signs of slipping into the stagnation already gripping France and Italy.There are political, cultural and economic reasons for the refusal. Berlin makes three main arguments:\u2022Germany is determined to set an example by meeting its fiscal targets and running the first balanced federal budget since 1969 with no borrowing. The credibility of the eurozone depends on governments\u2019 sticking to their commitments.\u2022Germany has less fiscal space than outsiders understand because it has an aging, shrinking population and needs to run surpluses to meet future pension and health care liabilities.\u2022The eurozone\u2019s economic problem is largely one of supply rather than demand. Structural reforms of labor markets, legal systems, pensions and welfare to improve competitiveness are the only way to achieve a sustainable recovery. More public spending financed by debt would ease the pressure to make those changes.The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, said in presenting the 2015 budget to Parliament on Sept. 9: \u201cWe must not allow ourselves to entertain the illusion that we can solve our problems using more and more public funds and ever higher deficits.\u201dBehind such public arguments, Ms. Merkel has a strong political motive for sticking to her course. The balanced budget is written into her conservatives\u2019 coalition pact with the Social Democrats. Any departure from it could fuel support for the Alliance for Germany, a rightist, anti-euro party that made big gains in state elections this month.As has been so often the case since the start of the eurozone crisis in 2010, domestic politics is tugging Ms. Merkel in one direction and European responsibility in another. Her usual tactic is to hang tough until others have made as many concessions as possible, then give as little ground as necessary at the last minute, when Europe is on the brink.It\u2019s easy to imagine a trade-off involving more French and Italian reform, German fiscal stimulus, more European public investment with new European Union financial instruments leveraging joint borrowing with private sector money, and an expansion of the E.C.B.\u2019s easy-money policies.Olli Rehn, who was vice president for economic and monetary affairs of the European Commission until July, calls for just such a pact to avert deflation. He writes in an article to be published in the policy journal Europe\u2019s World in October: \u201cIf Germany can lift domestic demand and investment while France and Italy are embracing reforms to their labor markets, business environments and pension systems in support of their economic and industrial competitiveness, they will together do a great service to the entire eurozone.\u201dA German stimulus could also help bring down the euro\u2019s real exchange rate and make southern eurozone countries\u2019 exports more competitive, argued Mr. Rehn, who is now a member of the European Parliament.\u201cThe key actors \u2014 Italy and France, the E.C.B. and Germany \u2014 need to work out the details of such a pact this autumn and then agree on it at the European Council in December,\u201d he writes.German leaders are not monolithic in rejecting the notion. The deputy labor minister, J\u00f6rg Asmussen, a Social Democrat, signed an article this month with a member of the E.C.B. executive board, Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9, urging Berlin to use its \u201cbudgetary room for maneuver\u201d to support investment and cut taxes on workers\u2019 pay.French politicians believe the German vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, the economy minister and Social Democrats leader, is broadly sympathetic to their cause, despite his commitment to a balanced budget.\u201cThis debate exists within the German government because Gabriel is a supporter of this new European investment policy,\u201d said Philip Cordery, national secretary for European affairs in the governing Socialist Party in France.But German officials fear President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is too weak politically to push through far-reaching reforms to France\u2019s protective labor laws and generous social benefits, or to take a serious ax to bloated public spending. A strike by Air France pilots that forced the airline to backpedal on plans to expand a low-cost European subsidiary highlights resistance to change.They are only slightly more optimistic about Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s drive to loosen Italian labor law, shake up the judicial system and streamline politics and state administration despite resistance from unions and politicians.If Germany won\u2019t fire up its investment engine and France won\u2019t risk major reforms, it will be left to the E.C.B. to carry the whole burden of refloating the economy. Even if Mr. Draghi were able to overcome German opposition to the central bank\u2019s printing money to buy government bonds, he told European Union lawmakers last week that monetary policy alone could not have a meaningful effect without structural reforms.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Women Hold Vital Votes in Senate Races", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From WashingtonWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats know that keeping control of the Senate this election year isn\u2019t a man\u2019s job. Success will depend on the votes of women.A gender gap has long been evident in American politics: Men more often vote Republican, and women are more likely to back Democrats. Both of these trends have accelerated in recent years.This year, the Democrats are on the defensive. In the 10 most competitive Senate races, they are counting on different assets in different states: solid turnouts of black voters in the South, Hispanics in Colorado and Alaskan natives.But almost everywhere, Democrats need a big margin \u2014 at least in the double digits \u2014 with female voters.The commercials and campaigns reflect this priority. In addition to the economy, Medicare and Social Security, the emphasis is on ending pay discrimination based on gender, making contraception readily available and covered by insurance, and, in some states, the right to abortion or stressing issues that seem more important to women: education in North Carolina, for example. Some Democratic campaigns are conducting focus groups only with women to gauge intensity and nuances.Democratic strategists, citing polls, insist that these issues are resonating in many tight Senate contests.Republicans counter that the larger gender gap is the one Democrats have with men, and that the women\u2019s vote is more complex. Married white women are more likely to be Republican, as are older women. In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, a plurality of women age 50 or older gave higher marks to Republicans on dealing with the economy. The Democrats\u2019 advantage on gender is focused on younger singles and women of color.A look at several key states underscores the centrality of gender in November:\u2022 In Colorado, Senator Mark Udall, the incumbent Democrat, is being challenged by Representative Cory Gardner, a Republican. In the Senate race four years ago, Michael Bennet, a Democrat, eked out a victory over a right-wing challenger by winning the women\u2019s vote, 56 percent to 39 percent. Most polls show Mr. Udall with a small lead thanks to a similar advantage with women. But a Quinnipiac survey last week showed Mr. Gardner ahead, as Mr. Udall only had a three-point advantage with women. Mr. Gardner, who recently supported a \u201cpersonhood\u201d measure that would have banned all abortions and some contraceptives, is trying to strike a more moderate posture, such as embracing the sale of over-the-counter contraceptives.Democrats say they relish this debate \u2014 other Republicans are adopting the same tack \u2014 as these Republicans would no longer require insurance companies to cover contraceptives, which would become very expensive for some women. The Udall campaign will hammer this and other appeals to women in the closing six weeks.\u2022 In Iowa, where a woman has never been elected a United States senator or governor, Republicans think their female candidate, Joni Ernst, a state senator, will enable them to reduce the gender gap. In the last presidential election, President Obama carried this swing state by six points, running up a 19-point margin with female voters.The two parties disagree on whether Republican female candidates generally do better with female voters; Democrats are reasonably confident that their candidate, Representative Bruce Braley, will prevail in November. Iowa is a good laboratory for the debate in 2014.\u2022 Georgia may be the Democrats\u2019 best chance of taking over a Republican-held seat, though it\u2019s an uphill battle. The Democratic candidate is Michelle Nunn, the daughter of the popular former senator Sam Nunn. She is running against David Perdue, a businessman. And a centerpiece of her campaign is a women\u2019s issue: She is attacking Mr. Perdue\u2019s record as a chief executive, including his tenure at the Dollar General Corporation, which faced pay-discrimination suits brought by several thousand female employees.The tagline on Ms. Nunn\u2019s commercial: \u201cCan the women of Georgia trust David Perdue?\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jack Ma Way", "Date": "2014-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the resplendent China World Hotel in Beijing, scores of cameras snapped as colorful confetti floated down from the ceiling. It was Aug. 11, 2005, and this was the global coming-out party for Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce upstart. After months of frantic negotiations, the American Internet giant Yahoo had agreed to invest $1 billion in cash and create deeper business ties, in exchange for a 40 percent stake in Alibaba.Alibaba\u2019s founder, Jack Ma, thin, energetic and standing just over five feet tall, was beaming. He gushed that it was China\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day and this was a beautiful match: \u201cYou\u2019d be foolish if you said no.\u201d It was his coming-out party too; the partnership would pave the way for Alibaba to become an international juggernaut.For days, Mr. Ma was almost giddy about a deal that provided his company with a huge infusion of money and unfettered access to Yahoo\u2019s search technology. He was particularly effusive that eBay and Meg Whitman, who was then its chief executive, had enticed Yahoo to make a competing offer by bidding so aggressively for Alibaba. \u201cThank you, Meg Whitman,\u201d Mr. Ma joked at the time. \u201cThank you for making all of this possible.\u201dBut Mr. Ma soon started having second thoughts about the partnership. He worried that he had sold the stake too cheaply and given up too much control.Trying to buy back most, if not all, of Alibaba\u2019s shares, Mr. Ma started talks that dragged on for several years. With the relationship souring, Mr. Ma transferred ownership of Alibaba\u2019s fast-growing online payment service, Alipay, to an entity that he controlled. He didn\u2019t get the permission of Alibaba\u2019s board. He just went ahead and did it.While Yahoo complained, Mr. Ma seemed to get everything he wanted, eventually. In 2011, he negotiated an agreement giving him and a handful of key lieutenants a majority stake in Alipay, one of the company\u2019s crown jewels. A year later, Mr. Ma secured a plan for Yahoo to reduce its stake in Alibaba.When the Alibaba Group goes public later this month in an offering that could value the company at about $160 billion, investors will have little doubt about who is in control of the company. Mr. Ma, 49, is the public face. He is the chief negotiator. He is the top strategist. He is the biggest individual investor, with a 9 percent stake.Alibaba, a company started out of Mr. Ma\u2019s apartment in 1999, is now a technology colossus worth more than American stalwarts like eBay and Hewlett-Packard. Under his leadership, Alibaba has become not just the dominant force in China\u2019s e-commerce but also a symbol of the country\u2019s breathtaking economic rise. The company has 250 million active buyers in China, and its orders account for more than 60 percent of all package deliveries in China.That success has helped make Jack Ma a kind of celebrity C.E.O., an executive comfortable hobnobbing with business moguls in Davos, leading tours of his company for China\u2019s political elite and promoting the \u201cWisdom of Jack Ma\u201d in books and on DVDs. The initial public offering could make Mr. Ma, already one of China\u2019s richest men, worth more than $15 billion. He has already pledged to give away much of that wealth, which would instantly make him one of the world\u2019s major philanthropists. (Mr. Ma and Alibaba declined to comment for this article, citing regulatory restrictions on public statements ahead of an I.P.O.)Mr. Ma has grown accustomed to doing things his way. He regularly strikes deals with close friends and buys companies in seemingly unrelated industries. At times, it is hard to determine whether an investment is personal or professional, because the boundaries between Mr. Ma\u2019s portfolio and Alibaba\u2019s holdings can blur.Such activities are not always transparent, a potential red flag for new shareholders in a public company. Like many Chinese companies, Alibaba also operates behind a cloak of complicated ownership structures, which may limit dissenting shareholders\u2019 objections.Rebellious and PrecociousMr. Ma grew up in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, the middle of three children born to a pair of performers of pingtan, a traditional musical storytelling technique. Neighbors called him a troublesome and often rebellious young boy, but he may have just been precocious.At 10, Ma Yun, as he is known in Chinese, took a liking to English and would ride his bicycle to the Hangzhou Hotel to practice with foreign tourists, an experience he said opened his mind to the outside world.His poor math skills almost prevented him from attending college. But after passing the national college entrance exam on the third try, Mr. Ma gained admission to a local teachers\u2019 college, where he excelled and was elected president of the student union. When he graduated in 1988, he took a $14-a-month job teaching English at the Hangzhou Institute of Electronic Engineering and quickly became one of its most popular instructors.With China\u2019s economy beginning to take flight, Mr. Ma saw opportunity in entrepreneurship. In his spare time, friends say, he co-founded a translation agency, sold medicine and dabbled in stocks. \u201cIf I\u2019m not a millionaire by the time I\u2019m 35,\u201d he joked with his friend Qi Xiaoning, \u201cplease kill me!\u201dHe visited the United States for the first time in 1995. Mr. Ma had befriended Bill Aho, an American who taught English in Hangzhou, and stayed with Mr. Aho\u2019s relatives in Seattle. There, he was introduced to the World Wide Web by Mr. Aho\u2019s son-in-law, Stuart Trusty, who ran one of America\u2019s first Internet service providers, VBN.\u201cAt that time, I had an office in the U.S. Bank tower, and Jack came and I showed him what the Internet was,\u201d Mr. Trusty says. \u201cBack then, the Internet was largely a directory for governments and businesses, but he seemed excited.\u201dMr. Ma returned home and set up one of the country\u2019s first web companies, China Pages, an online directory for domestic businesses looking for customers overseas. Former colleagues say Mr. Ma worked tirelessly, knocking on doors, taking photos, collecting information and translating it into English. When done, he mailed the listings to VBN in Seattle to post on the web.\u201cAt that time, the concept of the Internet was foreign to the Chinese people \u2014 people had no idea and no reaction when we introduced them to the idea,\u201d said Yu Xiaohong, one of Mr. Ma\u2019s partners at China Pages.China Pages struggled at first, but Mr. Ma was optimistic. During a 1996 trip to Seattle to meet his partners at VBN, he seemed confident he would strike it rich, says Mr. Aho, who traveled with him.\u201cI remember him looking at the expensive houses in the Queen Anne Hill area,\u201d Mr. Aho recalls. \u201cHe\u2019d point at houses and say, \u2018When I get rich, I\u2019m going to buy that house there, and that house. ...\u2019 And at that time, he didn\u2019t have a nickel.\u201dThen Mr. Ma lost control of his company. In 1996, China Pages was pressured into forming a joint venture with Hangzhou Telecom. The deal put the government firmly in charge.Discouraged, Mr. Ma went to Beijing to work at Infoshare, an Internet advertising agency set up under China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce. Mr. Ma lasted just 14 months at Infoshare. Itching to run his own company, he returned to Hangzhou. \u201cAt that time, I felt it was too tiring doing e-commerce in the government,\u201d Mr. Ma said in a 2005 interview. \u201cE-commerce should start with private enterprises.\u201d\u2018With or Without You\u2019 When Mr. Ma started Alibaba on Feb. 21, 1999, he asked 17 friends to gather in his second-floor apartment at the Lakeside Gardens in Hangzhou. In the makeshift headquarters, he gave a long talk about his ambitions and how much China needed a great start-up. He picked the name, he later explained, because \u201ceveryone knows the story of Alibaba. He\u2019s a young man who is willing to help others.\u201dThe company was built on a similar premise: to help businesses find overseas customers. If an American retailer was looking for a supplier of cotton slippers in China, it might turn to Alibaba.com. If a Chinese producer of buttons wanted to export to South Korea, it could advertise on the site. Alibaba, as he saw it, would be a virtual meeting room for small and medium-size businesses engaged in global trade.Early on, Shirley Lin, a Goldman Sachs banker, visited Mr. Ma\u2019s apartment. She had heard about the company from a friend, Joseph Tsai, a Yale-educated former lawyer who had recently joined Alibaba.\u201cI went up to the apartment, where they were all working 24/7,\u201d says Ms. Lin, who now teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cThe whole place stank \u2014 all those instant noodles. Jack\u2019s ideas were not entirely original \u2014 they had been tried in other countries. But he was completely dedicated to making them work in China. I was moved by what I saw.\u201dAlibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, along with a group of top Chinese entrepreneurs, are part of complicated web of deals and ventures, made for both personal benefit and corporate gain.\u201cThis was really unusual, his willingness to share,\u201d says Chauncey Shey, who works for SoftBank and helped make the initial investment. \u201cMost founders aren\u2019t willing to do that, and so that gave us more confidence in him.\u201dBut power was still largely concentrated in Mr. Ma\u2019s hands. He and his top deputy, Mr. Tsai, held two of the company\u2019s four board seats. Mr. Ma also controlled the underlying companies that Alibaba used to operate in China.China restricts foreign investment in industries considered sensitive, like the Internet. To avoid running into a problem, Mr. Ma set up an offshore holding company in the Cayman Islands. Foreign investors buy shares in the offshore entity and are contractually entitled to the profit. But most of Alibaba\u2019s assets are actually owned by Mr. Ma and another co-founder, Simon Xie.The ownership structure \u2014 known as the variable interest entity \u2014 is common among Chinese Internet companies. But it holds risks for shareholders, because it may leave them without the usual protections. (In June a United States government commission warned Americans about investing in Chinese companies using the complex V.I.E. structure, saying in a report to Congress that \u201ca major risk is that the Chinese shareholder of the V.I.E. will steal the entity, ignoring the legal arrangements on which the system is based.\u201d)Mr. Ma often had the final say in strategy. Just as Alibaba was beginning to earn money in 2002, Mr. Ma proposed setting up a consumer-oriented site to compete with eBay. Most of his top executives opposed the idea, since eBay was a formidable company and its Chinese partner already had a huge share of the China market.\u201cMost managers were against it,\u201d says John Wu, who was then the chief technology officer at Alibaba. \u201cI said: \u2018We\u2019re barely breaking even. And besides, every business school textbook says focus on what you do best. How can we create a second site?' \u201dSavio Kwan, who was then Alibaba\u2019s president, remembers a fierce debate one evening at a restaurant in Hangzhou. After Mr. Ma prevailed, he telephoned Mr. Son of SoftBank.\u201cHe said: \u201cMasa, we\u2019re thinking of doing this. We\u2019re going to let you know, but we\u2019re going to do it with or without you,' \u201d Mr. Kwan recalls. \u201cMasa called back in five minutes and said, \u2018I want in.\u2019 \u201dWith financing from SoftBank, Alibaba set up a secret task force to develop the consumer site, which they called Taobao, Chinese for \u201csearching for treasure.\u201d When it was introduced in July 2003, Alibaba used it to wage guerrilla warfare on eBay and its Chinese partner, EachNet. EachNet was more of an auction site and took a commission. Taobao allowed more direct selling and was initially free.When Mr. Ma vowed that it would remain free for years, eBay shot back in a release, \u201cFree is not a business model.\u201d (Taobao now makes money through fees.)Mr. Ma predicted that eBay\u2019s China operation would soon collapse because of pressure to deliver quick profit. He was right.In China, \u201ceBay really underestimated Jack\u2019s tenacity and Alibaba\u2019s ability to follow through on a strategy,\u201d says Duncan Clark, founder of BDA China, a Beijing-based consulting firm.With Taobao growing quickly, eBay moved to make a deal, according to people involved in the discussions. In mid-2005, Ms. Whitman held secret talks with Mr. Ma in China to discuss cooperating with Alibaba, or buying Taobao outright. Mr. Ma was invited to eBay\u2019s campus in San Jose, Calif.But Mr. Ma wanted to maintain control and opened talks with Jerry Yang, a co-founder of Yahoo, who was searching for new opportunities in China, according to people involved in the negotiations. The deal was a good fit. Mr. Ma received a $1 billion cash infusion to buy out some shareholders and invest. He also had a collection of sites like Yahoo China that he thought would transform Alibaba into a powerhouse.At the 2005 news conference in the China World Hotel, Yahoo\u2019s chief operating officer, Daniel Rosensweig, leaned over and whispered in Mr. Ma\u2019s ear. \u201cJerry Yang had warned me that whatever you do, don\u2019t let Jack Ma say he acquired Yahoo,\u201d recalled Mr. Rosensweig. Mr. Ma leaned back and laughed heartily.Consolidating Power The honeymoon didn\u2019t last long.More important, Yahoo rebuffed Alibaba\u2019s request to buy back shares.\u201cAfter Jerry Yang left, everything changed,\u201d said David Wei, who until 2011 was one of Alibaba\u2019s top executives. \u201cWe had become their most valuable asset and there was no communication.\u201dThe simmering resentments boiled over. Between mid-2009 and early 2011, Mr. Ma transferred ownership of his company\u2019s online payment service, Alipay, to a private company he controlled, effectively removing it from the Alibaba Group.The unilateral move angered Yahoo, which said it was done without board approval. Yahoo also said it had only been informed of the transfer in March 2011, when its accountant had received a letter from Alibaba simply saying the payment service had been \u201cdeconsolidated.\u201dMr. Ma later said that he had informed the board. But when the directors had failed to decide, Mr. Ma said he was forced to transfer ownership of the company to comply with new regulations on online payment services.\u201cIf Alipay were illegal and didn\u2019t get a license, Taobao would have been paralyzed,\u201d Mr. Ma told the media in 2011.After intense negotiations, Yahoo, SoftBank and Alibaba hashed out an agreement, one that seemed to favor Mr. Ma. Yahoo and SoftBank \u2014 which between them owned 70 percent of the Alibaba Group \u2014 would receive 49 percent of the profit from Alipay. Mr. Ma and a group of unnamed employees would get the rest.As part of the deal, Mr. Ma also won control over a holding company for the financial services affiliates, including Alipay, the main payment processor for Alibaba\u2019s various sites. The holding company, now known as the Zhejiang Small and Micro Financial Services Company, has expanded to include wealth management products, small-business lending and China\u2019s biggest money market fund. With its ability to profit from Alibaba\u2019s customers, the group is worth an estimated $25 billion, according to analysts.\u201cHe\u2019s essentially formed a huge company within the company that\u2019s tied into absolutely everything that Alibaba does,\u201d says Fredrik Oqvist, an independent financial analyst in Beijing.Around the same time, Mr. Ma started aggressively making deals with a small circle of businessmen with whom he socialized. The group includes some of China\u2019s most successful entrepreneurs, like Guo Guangchang of the Fosun Group, a Shanghai-based conglomerate; Shen Guojun of China Yintai Holdings, a retail property developer; and Shi Yuzhu, chairman of the online gaming company Giant Interactive.Together, they have worked on a web of interconnected deals, both for personal benefit and for corporate profit.The business group, known as the Zhejiang Gang because many of the members grew up in Zhejiang Province, helped Mr. Ma set up his private equity firm, Yunfeng Capital, in 2010. That private equity firm has since been a conduit for other Alibaba-related deals. For example, Giant Interactive, run by Mr. Shi, bought $50 million worth of Alibaba stock through Yunfeng Capital, according to public filings. Less than three years later, the shares were sold for $200 million.The businessmen have also formed joint ventures together. Last year, Alibaba started a company called Cainiao with plans to spend $16 billion to build out China\u2019s logistics network. Alibaba owns 48 percent. Fosun is an investor. Yintai too. And Mr. Shen of Yintai is Cainiao\u2019s executive chairman.Analysts and corporate ethics experts say there is nothing wrong with such activities. But they caution that regulators may look askance if interparty deals aren\u2019t properly disclosed.\u201cWhy do they allow Yunfeng to get in on it?\u201d says Jeff Dorr, a Hong Kong-based analyst at J Capital Research, an investment advisory firm. \u201cWhat value do they bring?\u201dMost members of the group declined to comment. In an interview, Mr. Shen defended such deals, explaining that Mr. Ma had formed a circle of trust, something common in Chinese business. Mr. Shen insisted that the group follows rules regarding conflicts of interest.\u201cPublic companies have very strict supervision regulations that we have to comply with,\u201d Mr. Shen says. \u201cWe just cooperate.\u201dThe deal structures can be complex. For example, Alibaba said in April that it agreed to lend about $1 billion to Mr. Xie, one of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders and a top executive, to acquire 20 percent of Wasu Media, an Internet TV company. Mr. Ma and Mr. Shi of Giant Interactive were partners in the deal. The same day Alibaba announced it planned to cooperate with Wasu.The fast pace of deal-making also makes it more difficult to assess a company properly. This year, Alibaba acquired ChinaVision, a film producer that has since changed its name to Alibaba Pictures. Just weeks ago, Alibaba said it had discovered suspicious accounting at the company.Nurturing TiesAs Alibaba grows, the company is not shaking up just bricks-and-mortar retailers, but also venturing into state-dominated industries like media, finance and telecommunications. To help quell any government opposition, friends say Mr. Ma has increasingly cultivated ties to Beijing.Alibaba, for example, was one of the main sponsors of the Youth Business Council, a state-backed charity set up by Gu Liping, the wife of Ling Jihua, at the time an aide to the country\u2019s president who was considered one of China\u2019s most powerful officials. Mr. Ma also serves as vice president of the China Cultural Industry Association, a nonprofit that operates under the Ministry of Culture.Alibaba has also done multiple deals with the Citic Group, one of the country\u2019s biggest state-owned conglomerates. Earlier this year, Alibaba and Mr. Ma\u2019s private equity firm, Yunfeng Capital, bought a controlling stake in a Citic-backed software and logistics provider, Citic 21cn, for $171 million. After the Alibaba deal was announced, shares of the company rose by as much as 500 percent.Analysts say that forging alliances with the government is a vital part of doing business in China. Companies see it as a way to improve their chances of securing approvals and licenses. In a sense, it is insurance against overly aggressive government intervention.Mr. Ma\u2019s decision to list shares overseas in the United States was also about maintaining its position.Alibaba considered listing its shares in Hong Kong. The company asked the Hong Kong Stock Exchange to allow a listing despite rules that permit only one shareholder vote per share; Alibaba has an unusual partnership structure that gives more sway to top executives, including Mr. Ma. After Hong Kong regulators refused to make an exception, Alibaba pursued a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which allows more diverse ownership structures.When Alibaba goes public later this month, investors can decide whether Mr. Ma\u2019s tight grip is a selling point or a stumbling block. Yahoo and SoftBank have made their peace, if for no other reason than profit.Quarter after quarter, year after year, Alibaba has delivered blockbuster growth. And the company, which in 2004 had revenue of about $50 million, may have revenue this year of close to $10 billion.Said Mr. Rosensweig, the former Yahoo executive who was one of the chief negotiators in the 2005 deal: \u201cThe story of Alibaba turned out to be a great one.\u201dA picture caption last Sunday with an article about Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company, misidentified two people standing with him during a visit to Seattle in the 1990s.

{"Headline": "U.N. Sees Need for $1 Billion to Fight Ebola", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa risks ballooning into a humanitarian catastrophe without a major surge in international efforts to contain it, senior United Nations officials said Tuesday, estimating the cost of this effort at $1 billion.The number of people affected by the disease is still rising at an \u201calmost exponential\u201d rate, Bruce Aylward, an assistant director general of the World Health Organization, said at a news conference in Geneva. He said the number of reported cases had climbed to 4,985, including 2,461 deaths. Half of the infections and deaths occurred in the past 21 days, he said, underscoring the acceleration of the outbreak. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know where the numbers are going with this,\u201d Mr. Aylward said.\u201cThe numbers can be kept in the tens of thousands,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is going to require a much faster escalation of the response if we are to beat the escalation of the virus.\u201dMr. Aylward appeared with Valerie Amos, the United Nations\u2019 emergency relief coordinator, and Dr. David Nabarro, the United Nations\u2019 senior system coordinator for Ebola, spelling out the devastating impact of the outbreak on the fragile economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the countries at the center of the crisis.\u201cLooking forward,\u201d Mr. Aylward said, \u201cwe risk a humanitarian catastrophe if we do not see a rapid scale-up not just of the Ebola response but also the provision of essential services.\u201dThe Ebola outbreak is \u201cmuch more than a health crisis,\u201d Ms. Amos said, warning that the three countries\u2019 capacity to deliver food and other necessities of daily life was \u201con the brink of collapse.\u201dDr. Nabarro said the funding the United Nations estimated was needed to tackle the crisis had jumped tenfold from $100 million a month ago. He justified the increase with the somber assessment that the outbreak would \u201cgo on doubling in that sort of frequency if we don\u2019t deal with it.\u201dSo far, he said, the appeal has raised about 30 percent of what is needed. Offers of assistance are coming in all the time, he said, but it will take \u201csomething quite exceptional\u201d to turn the situation around.The first priority is increasing the number of treatment centers to isolate those infected with disease, Mr. Aylward said, noting that in some areas, infected people are still walking around their communities, generating more infection.In Liberia, which had three treatment centers with a total capacity of 314 beds last week, Mr. Aylward said, the United Nations now has firm commitments of 500 new beds and expects more in the coming weeks.Among the latest international contributions to fighting the epidemic, China is sending Sierra Leone a mobile laboratory consisting of 59 clinicians, epidemiologists and nurses from its Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who will join 115 medical staff members it already has working in the country.\u201cThe most urgent immediate need in the Ebola response is for more medical staff,\u201d Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, said in a statement welcoming China\u2019s move as \u201ca huge boost, morally and operationally.\u201dThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said Monday that it had opened a 60-bed treatment center in Kenema, one of the most badly affected cities in Sierra Leone.Setting up new treatment centers requires weeks, however, so one of the main initiatives to \u201ctake the heat out of the outbreak\u201d is developing small Ebola \u201ccare units\u201d in the community to try to get sick people out of their homes.Despite the scale of the threat, Mr. Aylward saw hope of progress in some areas. \u201cYou definitely want to get Nigeria and Senegal, obviously, done quickly,\u201d he said after the news conference. Sierra Leone\u2019s capital, Freetown, and Guinea\u2019s capital, Conakry, should be freed of the disease soon, he said, and \u201cGuinea should be able to get most of the country free in the very near term as well.\u201dMonrovia still poses a particular challenge, he said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misattributed a comment about the W.H.O.\u2019s priorities. It was Bruce Aylward \u2014 not Dr. David Nabarro \u2014 who said the first priority was increasing the number of treatment centers and noted that in some areas, infected people were still walking around infecting others.Advertisement"}

At his best, Mr. Holder stepped up and said things that Mr. Obama could not or would not say.

{"Headline": "Obama Faulted in Terror Fight, New Poll Finds", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs Mr. Obama broadens the military offensive against Islamic extremists, the survey finds broad support for United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, but it also demonstrates how torn Americans are about wading back into battle in the Middle East. A majority is opposed to committing ground forces there, amid sweeping concern that increased American participation will lead to a long and costly mission.With midterm elections approaching, Americans\u2019 fears about a terrorist attack on United States soil are on the rise, and the public is questioning Mr. Obama\u2019s strategy for combating the militant organization calling itself the Islamic State, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Most respondents say the president has no clear plan for confronting the group, and that he has not been tough enough in dealing with it.\u201cHe is ambivalent, and I think it shows,\u201d Jennifer Shelton-Armstrong, a 45-year-old Democrat in Mission Viejo, California, said in a follow-up interview. \u201cThere is no clear plan.\u201dMr. Obama has lost considerable ground with the public in the month since he announced military action against the Islamic State, which also saw the group release two videotapes showing the beheadings of American journalists. Fifty-eight percent now disapprove of his handling of foreign policy, a 10-point jump from a CBS News poll conducted last month. Fifty percent rate him negatively on handling terrorism, a 12-point increase from March, compared with 41 percent who rate him positively, while the rest had no opinion. Taken together, the results suggest a profoundly unsettled public mood, with two-thirds of Americans surveyed saying the country is on the wrong track and half disapproving of how Mr. Obama is doing his job, a negative assessment that threatens to be a substantial drag on Democrats in November.Still, the public is sending some mixed signals. For instance, while Americans give Mr. Obama low marks on handling terrorism, foreign policy and the Islamic State, they say they back the prescription he has laid out to counter the militants \u2014 airstrikes and no combat troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria. Respondents also said Republicans would do a better job on two of their top issues \u2014 terrorism and the economy \u2014 even though they disapprove of congressional Republicans in greater numbers than they do congressional Democrats.The poll numbers present a steep climb for the president as he seeks to rally public support for the effort against the Islamic State, just as Democrats are seeking ways to motivate their core supporters, who include antiwar voters. Mr. Obama\u2019s job approval ratings are strikingly similar to those of George W. Bush at the same point in his second term in office in 2006, when Americans\u2019 war fatigue helped Democrats sweep both houses of Congress in what Mr. Bush later called \u201ca thumping.\u201dThe poll shows Republicans having gained sharply with voters ahead of the November balloting, with 45 percent of likely voters saying they will back Republicans in November\u2019s contests for the House of Representatives, compared with 39 percent who say they will back Democrats.While the survey shows both political parties deeply unpopular, Republicans fare worse than Democrats, with a majority of their own voters giving the Republicans low marks for their performance in Congress. But Mr. Obama\u2019s poor standing is proving a rallying point for his disaffected political opposition; 55 percent of Republicans said their vote for Congress would be a vote against the president.\u201cIt\u2019s a vote for the lesser of two evils and a vote against Obama,\u201d said John Durr, a 71-year-old independent in Virginia Beach, who listed economic issues and recent \u201cscandals\u201d involving the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice\u2019s \u201cFast and Furious\u201d program, and the attack on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, as among the reasons he would vote Republican in November. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost world respect. I don\u2019t think he has a foreign policy; we\u2019re just reacting.\u201dThe findings represent the first time since he became president that more Americans rate Mr. Obama negatively on terrorism than they do positively. Despite his low ratings on terrorism and foreign policy, a majority says it has confidence in Mr. Obama\u2019s ability to handle an international crisis. And while most Americans continue to say the United States should not take the leading role in trying to solve international conflicts, that view is losing ground.Fifty-four percent say the United States should not play the primary role, compared with 58 percent in June and 65 percent in February. The results help explain the political predicament facing Mr. Obama with his Democratic base, which includes an antiwar faction that is less enthusiastic than Republicans about airstrikes, while his Republican critics are considerably more hawkish and worried that the president is projecting weakness.\u201cMy fear is he won\u2019t go far enough \u2014 I think he should go further,\u201d said Richard Kline, 56, an engineer and Republican in Indianola, Iowa. \u201cI\u2019d rather see them fought over there than over here.\u201dA New York Times/CBS News poll shows that President Obama\u2019s approval ratings are similar to those of President George W. Bush in 2006 when Democrats swept both houses of Congress in the midterm elections.While Democrats are more positive about Mr. Obama\u2019s management of foreign policy crises and terrorism, a third of them say he has no clear plan for countering the Islamic State and two fifths of Democrats say he is not being tough enough.Most Americans \u2014 nearly 6 in 10 \u2014 say they view the Islamic State as a major threat to the security of the United States, and 7 in 10 support airstrikes against the group, including majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents. Still, on the issue of sending ground troops, opposed by 55 percent of respondents, the parties diverge, with most Republicans in favor and Democrats and independents opposed.\u201cI\u2019m glad President Obama is not too hawkish,\u201d said Margaret Scioli, 67, a retired electrocardiogram technician and Democrat in Melrose, Mass. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get into wars, but hard to get out of them.\u201dThe split comes amid a debate, including inside the Obama administration, about whether ground troops may ultimately be necessary to confront the Islamic State.Mr. Obama on Wednesday renewed his vow not to involve American troops in a ground war, a day after Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, his top military adviser and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that he might recommend deploying them in Syria if airstrikes were not successful.On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved by a vote of 273-156 Mr. Obama\u2019s request for authorization to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight the Islamic State, and the Senate takes up the measure on Thursday. The poll finds 48 percent saying they back doing so, while 40 percent are opposed. A majority says it backs sending additional military advisers to Iraq.While terrorism is a concern for voters, the survey shows the economy is by far their top issue, with 38 percent saying that topic was driving their vote this fall and more voters saying Republicans are likely to do a better job on it. That\u2019s a notable change from last month\u2019s CBS News Poll, which found voters split on which party would do a better job on the economy.Republicans also get higher marks on handling foreign policy and terrorism, while Democrats have an edge on health care. Voters are split on which party would do a better job on immigration. The environment for incumbents is poisonous, with nearly 9 in 10 voters saying it is time to give new people a chance. And in a striking finding, the poll diverges from the well-worn adage that voters hate Congress but love their congressmen; nearly two-thirds now say they are ready to throw their own representatives out of office as well.Marina Stefan and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Most Bulgarian banks are operating as usual, but for the 200,000 or so businesses and individuals with deposits at Corporate Commercial Bank, or K.T.B., financial life has not yet gotten back to normal.SOFIA, Bulgaria \u2014 What seemed at first to be a short-term banking crisis is looking more like a chronic condition.But the name of the affliction probably does not matter as much to companies and consumers as the money, about $4 billion in all, that has been stranded at a big Bulgarian bank since the government seized it in late June.Most Bulgarian banks are operating as usual. But for the 200,000 or so businesses and individuals with deposits at Corporate Commercial Bank, the country\u2019s fourth-largest institution, financial life has hardly returned to normal. The government has said the bank, known here as K.T.B., might not reopen before December.As a result, some businesses are having trouble making payroll, and many families are having to scrape by without access to cash.The trouble has pushed Bulgaria, the European Union\u2019s poorest country, which has a reputation for mismanagement and corruption and is now being run by a caretaker government, ever lower in the esteem of the international financial community. Bulgaria\u2019s longstanding ambition to join the euro currency union is hardly being helped.\u201cGive us back our money,\u201d read placards carried by hundreds of depositors who demonstrated on Friday in the Bulgarian capital. The same sentiment might have been uttered by international investors holding $150 million in bonds that the bank defaulted on in early August.The bank was forced to close on June 20 after customers, unnerved by news reports of dubious deals by its main shareholder, withdrew more than a fifth of deposits in a weeklong bank run. The Bulgarian central bank, which is now supervising K.T.B., has said the lender might remain closed until late this year as officials continue to wrangle over whether the state should bail the bank out or find private investors to save it.The businesses left hanging include Rila Style, a family-run clothing company that has about $2 million on deposit in the bank. Rila Style had been planning to expand, doubling its work force to about 500, based on the strength of orders from neighboring European countries, as well as Germany and Switzerland.\u201cNot only did we not hire 250 new people as we had planned \u2014 we had to fire 140,\u201d said Rauf Akhundov, the 29-year-old managing director of Rila Style. Other plans now deferred include opening another factory and renovating the company\u2019s headquarters, a rundown Communist-era building in the center of Sofia.Mr. Akhundov showed a visitor around the deserted third floor of the building, which was gutted to make way for a new showroom before Rila Style\u2019s deposits were frozen. With the renovation suspended, all that remains is rubble, broken glass and cables hanging from the ceiling.\u201cNow we are struggling with the salaries for those who are left,\u201d Mr. Akhundov said. \u201cWe can hold on for another two or three months, but not much longer.\u201dOn Friday, the country\u2019s interim finance minister, Rumen Porozhanov, said the Bulgarian authorities were considering letting depositors withdraw sums of up to 1000 leva, or $670, a month. That plan, though, would bring little solace to businesses like Rila Style.\u201cRight now we are postponing orders because we cannot afford to buy the fabrics for our clothes,\u201d Mr. Akhundov said. \u201cWe hope our winter collection will sell well so that we can pay salaries to those who have remained of our staff.\u201dSome much bigger Bulgarian businesses also have deposits tied up at the bank, including Vivacom, Bulgaria\u2019s biggest telecom operator. Another is the company that runs the Sofia airport. Most of the country\u2019s military contractors have money at the bank, as do many state-owned enterprises, hospitals, municipalities and schools.Bulgaria guarantees bank deposits of up to 100,000 euros (about $131,000). But because K.T.B. has not been declared insolvent, that insurance has not yet kicked in.The waiting game could kill some enterprises. More than 80,000 jobs could be lost if businesses that have money parked at K.T.B. go bankrupt, according to Konstantin Trenchev, president of the Podkrepa, Bulgaria\u2019s second-biggest labor union.That is no small number for Bulgaria, which had around 390,000 unemployed people in July, according to the most recent data from Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistics agency. The country, with a population of 7.3 million, has an unemployment rate of 11.5 percent, higher than the union\u2019s average of 10.2 percent.\u201cThat\u2019s why we worry that the K.T.B. blow will ricochet through to the whole economy, and the consequences for such a frail economy as the Bulgarian one will be enormous,\u201d Mr. Trenchev said.Bulgaria\u2019s Finance Ministry, in response to questions for this article, said Friday in a statement that \u201cdespite the fact that there are businesses with blocked funds, there are no systemic problems in the various economic sectors as well as delayed payments by these companies to the state budget.\u201dAfter the bank was forced to close, an audit by the central bank revealed outsize exposure to companies linked to its biggest shareholder, Tsvetan Vassilev, and missing documentation for more than two-thirds of the bank\u2019s loans.Some experts say the financial impact may be minimal, assuming the bank can be saved soon. \u201cEven if companies fire some of their work force, they will probably hire them back once the access to their funds is restored,\u201d said Petar Ganev, senior economist at the Sofia-based Institute for Market Economics.Still, \u201cif the bank goes bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Ganev cautioned, \u201cthose businesses that have most of their funds there will go under and their jobs will be lost.\u201dThe banking turmoil comes during a period of political instability in Bulgaria. The government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski resigned on July 23, the second cabinet to depart in less than 18 months. With a caretaker administration presiding until early elections in October, there may be no quick fix for the embattled lender.The Bulgarian Finance Ministry said it favored a market solution for rescuing the bank, including recapitalization by shareholders and other investors. \u201cPublic support should be limited and used only as a last resort,\u201d the statement read.Last month the Washington-based Institute of International Finance estimated that a state bailout could increase Bulgaria\u2019s budget deficit to 6.3 percent this year from the planned 1.8 percent.For K.T.B.'s 500 employees, anxiety is high. Most still go to work every day, but there is little to do. Internet access and all phone communications are cut off while the lender is under central bank supervision.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what will happen with our jobs \u2014 we live from day to day,\u201d said Plamen Grigorov, the bank\u2019s treasurer. \u201cThere were also many pensioners who received their pensions at our bank \u2014 people who get \u20ac100 per month. How did they survive the past two months?\u201dMany of the protesters who rallied in front of the central bank\u2019s headquarters recently had bitter memories of the financial crisis in 1996 that led to the bankruptcy of more than a dozen lenders and months of hyperinflation. Similar demonstrations were held in other cities across the country where K.T.B. has branches.As about 300 protesters marched along the yellow, cobbled street in Sofia that connects the central bank and Parliament, Violeta, a construction engineer who did not want to give her surname, voiced her fury.\u201cMost of my family\u2019s savings are at K.T.B.,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband and I had to ask for an advance of our salaries to live through the past two months. Now with the school year around the corner, I don\u2019t know how we will find the money to buy new clothes for our children.\u201dAt Rila Style, Mr. Akhundov said he worried about his workers \u2014 but also about the company\u2019s ability to stay afloat.\u201cWe want to see the bank working again so we can access our funds, hire more people and continue with the renovation of the building,\u201d he said.He gestured toward the building\u2019s backyard, where a half-dozen big chipboard boxes sat, covered with dark green tarp. \u201cThese are the new elevators we\u2019ve bought for \u20ac50,000,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they are just sitting there, and we are hoping it doesn\u2019t rain.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Or are they the opposite \u2014 a giant step toward unleashing the human productivity and creativity that technologists have prophesied?Technology has conditioned us to expect ease, efficiency and speed in almost everything we do. Once it came from sewing machines and dishwashers, later from Google and Kayak, and most recently from start-ups that provide on-demand services like Uber for cars, Instacart for groceries and Munchery for dinner.How do we judge whether technology is making us more productive, or just lazy and impatient?Economists think about outsourcing chores in terms of opportunity costs. If you can work during the hour you would have spent mailing a package, it would probably be a better use of your time \u2014 as, perhaps, would taking a nap, going for a run or spending time with your child.Outsourcing individual chores to other people, as opposed to machines or software, has been made possible by location-aware mobile phones. Few people can afford a full-time personal assistant, but many more can pay a few dollars to outsource chores here and there. Shyp costs $5 to mail an unlimited number of boxes; you pay the postage.Whereas some of the on-demand businesses lose more money the more people that use them, Shyp makes more money when more people use it \u2014 the kind of business school basic that much of Silicon Valley seems to have forgotten. Some customers have actually moved from one home to another using Shyp, paying just $5 for messengers to retrieve their belongings and package them. Kevin Gibbon, Shyp\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said he welcomes that because Shyp makes a lot of money on the difference between the bulk shipping fees it pays and the retail fees customers pay to mail such heavy boxes.\u201cWith logistics companies, you need to prove out your business model very, very early,\u201d said Mr. Gibbon, who was an eBay \u201cpower seller\u201d before starting Shyp and who said that sellers on sites like eBay and Etsy are among its biggest users. \u201cYou can\u2019t wait for scale.\u201dShyp keeps so-called satellite vans around the city, and when messengers retrieve a package, they tag it and drop it in the van. When the van fills, the driver takes the packages to Shyp\u2019s warehouse, where a gigantic box-cutting machine creates a perfectly sized box in eight seconds. Another printer produces address labels and stamps, and FedEx and the others come several times a day to pick up the packages.Claire Cain Miller\nis a reporter for The\nUpshot, a New\nYork Times politics\nand policy venture.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Job Creation Should Be Policy Priority, O.E.C.D. Report Finds", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 High unemployment rates in most of the developed world are mainly a result of the tepid economic recovery, rather than a lack of appropriate skills in the work force, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in a report on Wednesday.The findings could hold significant implications for policy makers aiming to reduce unemployment, while adding fuel to arguments of economists who say that eurozone governments need to abandon austerity budgeting and instead take steps to stimulate their economies.The number of openings per unemployed job seeker remains low by historical standards, according to the report by the O.E.C.D., a research organization and discussion forum for the world\u2019s developed economies. Its 34 members include the United States, Japan, and all 28 European Union nations, but not rising economic giants like China and India.The annual jobs outlook is part of a regular series of publications by the O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris. But this year\u2019s is especially timely for the eurozone, as a debate intensifies over how to pull the bloc out of its economic torpor. That sense of urgency is putting pressure on the European Central Bank, which holds its monthly meeting on Thursday, to take further steps to stimulate the region\u2019s economy.Joblessness that results from a downturn in the business cycle is called cyclical unemployment \u2014 the type of joblessness that currently prevails, according to the report. But the document also noted evidence of another more fundamental type of joblessness \u2014 known as structural unemployment \u2014 which occurs, for example, when workers cannot get jobs because they lack the skills that are in demand. Policy makers are particularly concerned about preventing structural unemployment from becoming firmly rooted, to avoid the creation of a \u201clost generation\u201d of workers.Because cyclical unemployment is the main problem right now in many O.E.C.D. countries, the report said, economic stimulus \u201cpromoting aggregate demand and job creation remains a key policy priority.\u201dOtherwise, the report warned, there is a risk that unemployment caused by economic weakness could eventually lead to structural unemployment as \u201cthe many people who have accumulated long jobless spells, discouragement and loss of human capital make their reintegration more difficult.\u201dGovernments could help, the report suggested, by focusing job training and creation on the long-term unemployed who are most at risk of giving up on work.\u201cGovernments should increase public investment in infrastructure to support aggregate demand, and boost employment in the short-term while mitigating the adverse consequences of long-term unemployment,\u201d he said, adding that \u201craising the minimum wage and increasing the share of wages through collective bargaining would definitely help support demand, and in the current situation also help job creation.\u201dWhile member nations are in no way bound by the organization\u2019s recommendations, the report comes at a particularly sensitive time for officials in Europe, who are debating whether their tight-budget approach has gone too far.Recent data shows that the eurozone economy stopped growing in the second quarter and indicates that the 18-member currency bloc is slipping from ultralow inflation toward outright deflation. Extended weakness in Europe poses significant risks for the global economy and for the region\u2019s trading partners, including the United States.On the positive side, the organization noted that a \u201csmall but welcome decline in unemployment has been recorded\u201d recently, with the average jobless rate in O.E.C.D. countries falling to 7.4 percent in May from around 8 percent, where it had been stagnating for several years. That is down from the peak of 8.5 percent in October 2009. The organization predicted \u201cmodest declines\u201d in the jobless rate through the end of 2015.The report also noted that the crisis had weighed on many of those who managed to keep their jobs, as inflation-adjusted wages have grown slowly or not at all, because the large number of unemployed has kept the supply of labor so plentiful.This has been a boon to some countries, particularly in the eurozone, the report noted, by promoting external competitiveness. But over all, it noted, weak growth or declines in real wages risk increasing the number of working poor.It also warned of the growing use of temporary workers in developed countries, saying the practice \u201cis damaging to individuals and the economy.\u201d While companies and employees can benefit from the flexibility of \u201cnon-regular\u201d work forces, such contracts leave workers with few protections and, it noted, \u201cfirms tend to invest less in non-regular workers, which in turn may depress their productivity and human capital development.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservative Experiment Faces Revolt in Reliably Red Kansas", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUTCHINSON, Kan. \u2014 In his 40 years living in Kansas, Konrad Hastings cannot remember voting for a Democrat. He is the type who agonizes over big purchases, trying to save as much money as possible. He is against stricter gun laws, opposes abortion in most cases and prefers less government involvement in his life.But when he casts his ballot for governor in November, he plans to shun the leader of this state\u2019s conservative movement, the Republican incumbent, Sam Brownback, and vote for the Democratic challenger.\u201cHe\u2019s leading Kansas down,\u201d said Mr. Hastings, 68, who said he voted for Mr. Brownback four years ago, when he easily won his first term. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be bankrupt in two or three years if we keep going his way.\u201dVoters like Mr. Hastings are at the heart of Mr. Brownback\u2019s surprising fight for political survival.Although every statewide elected official in Kansas is a Republican and President Obama lost the state by more than 20 points in the last election, Mr. Brownback\u2019s proudly conservative policies have turned out to be so divisive and his tax cuts have generated such a drop in state revenue that they have caused even many Republicans to revolt. Projections put state budget shortfalls in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, raising questions of whether the state can adequately fund education in particular.This has boosted the hopes of the Democratic candidate, Paul Davis, the State House minority leader, who has shot up in the polls even though he has offered few specifics about how he would run the state. Many disaffected Republicans might give Mr. Davis their vote because, if nothing else, he is not Mr. Brownback.\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of negative momentum behind Brownback, and Davis has been hammering that home,\u201d said Chapman Rackaway, a political-science professor at Fort Hays State University.The governor\u2019s campaign has appeared so worried about his weak poll numbers that it took the unusual step last month of releasing an internal poll that showed the race to be essentially tied, hardly something that would usually be showcased. In some ways, it is unsurprising that many Kansas Republicans have turned on Mr. Brownback. This is a state that once had a tradition of centrist Republicans, like former Senator Bob Dole, and has had five Democratic governors over the past half-century.But much of this moderation went by the wayside as Mr. Brownback and conservative majorities in the Legislature turned the state into a laboratory for the policies they had run on. In addition to passing the largest income tax cuts in state history, they have made it easier to carry guns in public buildings, turned over management of Medicaid to private insurance companies, made it more difficult to get an abortion, and made it harder to qualify for public assistance.Even some of Kansas\u2019 staunchest Republicans have found some of these measures to be too far to the right. More than 100 current and former Republican elected officials have endorsed Mr. Davis.Mr. Brownback, 58, a former United States senator who grew up on a Kansas farm, has defended his record and is trying to force Mr. Davis, who is from Lawrence, home of the University of Kansas in one of the state\u2019s most liberal regions, to define himself.\u201cHe\u2019s been mostly just hiding as a candidate,\u201d Mr. Brownback said in an interview. \u201cAll his statements have been basically against me, and none of it has been what he would do.\u201dThe governor has painted Mr. Davis as a supporter of President Obama who wants to raise taxes and force the president\u2019s health care law on Kansans.Mr. Davis has hammered away at the \u201cgovernor\u2019s economic experiment,\u201d as he put it in a debate held at the State Fair, saying it had left Kansas with a vast budget deficit. \u201cIt\u2019s damaging our schools. It\u2019s hurting our economy. It\u2019s jeopardizing our future,\u201d he said. As Election Day draws closer, both sides can expect an even tighter, and perhaps rougher, clash, with outside groups stepping up their involvement.Most criticism of Mr. Brownback has centered on the tax cuts, which slashed individual income tax rates and eliminated taxes on nonwage earnings for nearly 200,000 small businesses. The most recent fiscal year ended with state revenues more than $300 million short of expectations. Based on decreased revenue from the tax cuts, the state\u2019s nonpartisan legislative research department estimates that the budget will have to be adjusted by $1.3 billion, either through spending cuts or additional revenue, over the next five years in order to remain balanced.Opponents of the governor have used this to stoke fears that he would cut vital services. Both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s have downgraded Kansas\u2019 credit rating.Mr. Brownback said that the steps he had taken on Medicaid, on bolstering the teachers\u2019 pension system and on cutting taxes had been needed to stabilize state finances, and that revenue growth would resume. The tax cuts will attract new businesses and residents \u2014 and, in turn, cash \u2014 to the state, he said. And because he has reduced the size of government and made it more efficient, he said, state revenues do not need to grow that much to fulfill budget obligations.As promising signs, the governor and his allies point to an increase in the number of private-sector jobs since the tax cuts went into effect in January 2013. They also promote a record number of new business filings \u2014 more than 15,000 \u2014 in the state last year as a sign that businesses were attracted to Kansas. Spending is also an issue. Mr. Brownback said he would not cut funding for education or other essential services, and since taking office he has increased the total state dollars that go toward primary and secondary schools by more than $200 million. He has put tens of millions of dollars toward new programs for technical education and reading initiatives.So far, Mr. Davis, 42, the son of two teachers, has spoken mostly in broad terms about his priorities \u2014 improving public schools and investing in work force training and higher education. \u201cWe know that if we have a highly skilled work force, industry will come,\u201d he said.The only specific plan he has put forward is to freeze Mr. Brownback\u2019s tax cuts next year and to appoint a commission to address tax issues. \u201cI\u2019m not giving people the illusion that this is the magic bullet that\u2019s going to fix the very, very deep financial problems that Governor Brownback has caused,\u201d said Mr. Davis, a lawyer who joined the House in 2003 and has been minority leader since 2008. \u201cBut I think it is a good first step.\u201dRay Merrick, the Republican speaker of the House, called freezing the tax cuts a nonstarter. \u201cRight now, the Legislature on both sides, House and Senate, are on the side of the governor,\u201d he said.The question is whether most voters will stand with the governor. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that some of the tax policies have been as effective as we\u2019d like them to be,\u201d said Dianne Blick, a 58-year-old development officer from Hutchinson, who has usually voted for Republicans but is undecided in this race. \u201cEither candidate has to really convince me that they can create positive change and can work across the aisle.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thinking Twice on Alibaba", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseInvestors love a good story.They lined up hundreds deep at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York earlier this month to hear Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, Jack Ma, promote the Chinese Internet retailer\u2019s initial public offering.\u201cIt was a zoo,\u201d said Vincent Rivers, senior portfolio manager for the London-based investment firm J. O. Hambro Capital Management. \u201cThere must have been 400 people waiting in line. Everybody was there. It was like a social event.\u201dThe shy, somewhat awkward Mr. Ma opened by saying that he\u2019d first come to the United States 15 years ago looking for about $2 million in capital. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m asking for slightly more.\u201dThe line drew a knowing laugh from the crowd \u2014 Alibaba was asking for nearly $22 billion, the biggest I.P.O. ever in the United States \u2014 but Mr. Ma should probably keep his day job. What the crowd really wanted to hear about was Alibaba\u2019s growth, and Mr. Ma didn\u2019t disappoint them.A few vivid charts and statistics told the story. Alibaba is already the world\u2019s largest Internet commerce company, with 231 million active buyers using its site, 11.3 billion annual orders and $296 billion in annual merchandise sales, a measure Alibaba uses instead of revenue.To put this in perspective, Amazon has less than $82 billion in revenue. EBay has just over $17 billion.But what excites Alibaba\u2019s potential investors isn\u2019t only its size, but its prospects for getting bigger. China currently has 302 million Internet shoppers. That\u2019s less than half the country\u2019s 618 million Internet users. And Internet penetration in China is less than half the country\u2019s population of about 1.35 billion. Competition from brick-and-mortar retailers in China is far less than in the United States, which should also drive increases in Internet shopping.\u201cThe potential is absolutely massive,\u201d Mr. Rivers said. \u201cThe real question isn\u2019t whether they\u2019ll have more users. It\u2019s how much will they spend.\u201d Chinese Internet shoppers spend far less per person than in the United States. \u201cIf you look long term and they can close that gap, you can get to some huge numbers,\u201d he said.Alibaba also has enviably high profit margins of more than 40 percent, which even by Internet standards, let alone retail, is extraordinary. Amazon has struggled for decades to eke out a slender profit. EBay has an operating margin of 20 percent and Google 23 percent.And Alibaba keeps profits large by dispensing with the high-cost, low-margin businesses that have dogged Internet retailers in the United States. Alibaba is simply a platform for connecting buyers and sellers. \u201cWe do not engage in direct sales, compete with our merchants or hold inventory,\u201d the prospectus notes.I was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Friday morning, where the excitement of newly minted billions was palpable. The Alibaba trading station occupied the center of the floor, where it was surrounded by a throng of \u201cV.I.P. guests\u201d squeezed behind velvet ropes. The street outside was packed, the balconies were crowded with onlookers and cheers went up every time the indicated opening price was adjusted upward. Mr. Ma watched as some of his customers rang the opening bell, and later dropped in on the on-floor set of CNBC.Alibaba was priced on Thursday night at $68 a share. And on Friday, pent-up demand drove the opening price to $92.70. The stock immediately rose from there and ended the day at $93.89.Perhaps some stocks should reflect what I\u2019ll call an \u201cexcitement premium,\u201d which in Alibaba\u2019s case is surely significant. That\u2019s fine until the excitement wears off. For a more sobering view, I turned to Bruce Greenwald, co-author of \u201cCompetition Demystified\u201d and \u201cValue Investing,\u201d and a finance professor at Columbia Business School. Value investors like Professor Greenwald, by nature, tend to be skeptical of stories, especially when those stories are as rosy as Alibaba\u2019s. Still, Professor Greenwald said he agreed with much of the Alibaba thesis. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt they benefit from a network effect and they have growth potential,\u201d he said.But value investors tend to prefer numbers to words, and Alibaba\u2019s numbers, impressive as they are, may give some investors pause.At $68 a share, Alibaba\u2019s market capitalization is about $168 billion. It\u2019s hard to find a United States company that\u2019s directly comparable, but Professor Greenwald said eBay comes the closest. Like Alibaba, it has an auction site that benefits from a powerful network effect, it offers a vast e-commerce site and it has a pay system, PayPal. (While Alibaba spun off its payment system, Alipay, Alibaba will get a share of the proceeds from any sale or public offering of Alipay.) EBay\u2019s market capitalization is about $65 billion.Of course, eBay doesn\u2019t dominate e-commerce in the United States to the degree that Alibaba does in China. But is it reasonable to assume such dominance will persist as the Chinese market matures? No one company dominates e-commerce in the United States or in Europe, and none are as large as old-economy Walmart. China may now be underserved by national brick-and-mortar chains, but that could change. Professor Greenwald said he believed that Alibaba deserved a premium to eBay \u2014 perhaps twice eBay\u2019s market capitalization. \u201cBut three times? That\u2019s really pushing it,\u201d he said.Then, there\u2018s the most common valuation metric, the price-to-earnings ratio. At $68 a share, Alibaba\u2019s is just over 40. EBay had a loss in its most recent quarter, so it has no P/E ratio. But over eBay\u2019s life as a publicly traded company, its P/E ratio has averaged a little over 26.No Chinese Internet company is quite like Alibaba, so comparisons with Chinese stocks are difficult. But Baidu, China\u2019s version of Google, which also benefits from network effects and the growth in Chinese Internet use, has a market capitalization of about $80 billion, and a P/E ratio of 45. Tencent Holdings, which is classified as social media rather than e-commerce, although it has elements of both, is even further afield. Its market capitalization of $147 billion is also smaller than Alibaba\u2019s, although its P/E ratio is a steep 51.Alibaba\u2019s valuation may not be outrageous, but to Professor Greenwald, these comparisons are \u201cpretty scary.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hype in Alibaba, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the price.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t change the Alibaba story, and sometimes a story is enough. Amazon is the leading example, a company that barely earns a profit and drives value investors crazy. Its market capitalization is $150 billion, nearly as big as Alibaba\u2019s, and its P/E ratio is over 500. Investors buy the Amazon story, which is that Internet commerce dominance is just over the horizon, along with huge profits.After Alibaba\u2019s presentation in New York, \u201cI\u2019d say the mood was excitement,\u201d Mr. Rivers said. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t much new, but there was significant buzz that this is a great growth opportunity.\u201dInvestors, Mr. Rivers added, \u201cwant to be able to say they\u2019d been there.\u201dThe Common Sense column last Saturday, about the prospects of the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, referred incorrectly to the company\u2019s connection to the ringing of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on the day it began trading. And a correction in this space in some copies on Thursday also misstated its involvement. The bell was rung by some of the company\u2019s customers \u2014 not by Jack Ma, the company\u2019s executive chairman and not by employees of Alibaba.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For First Time Since April 2013, Consumer Prices Fall ", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Consumer prices fell in August for the first time in nearly a year and a half, and underlying inflation pressures were muted, which could lessen the urgency for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.\u201cThere is still enough slack in the economy to keep a tight lid on price increases, which should support the view of those within the Fed arguing in favor of patience before the first rate hike,\u201d said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.Concerns at the Fed that inflation was running too low had abated in recent months, but the C.P.I. data suggested a quickening of inflation during the spring may have run its course.The index increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months through August, the smallest advance in five months, while a core index that strips out food and energy prices was up by the same amount, a slowdown from July\u2019s 1.9 percent gain. Month-on-month, the core index was unchanged for the first time since October 2010.While the economy appears to be on a sustainable growth path, anemic wage growth is diminishing price pressures. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0.4 percent in August. Even so, they have risen only by that same amount over the last year.A second report showed homebuilder sentiment hit a near nine-year high in September, with builders reporting a sharp pickup in buyer traffic since early summer. The surge in confidence underscores the economy\u2019s improving fundamentals.The upbeat housing report, and better-than-expected earnings from homebuilder Lennar, pushed up housing stocks, which were solidly outperforming the broader market. The Standard & Poor\u2019s home-building index was up 4.7 percent.\u201cWhile an inflationary surge is not in the offing, with the economy continuing to recover in the second half, there is a better than even chance for a modest acceleration in inflation,\u201d said Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG in New York.In August, energy prices fell for a second successive month, recording their biggest decline since March 2013. There were broad declines in energy prices, with the cost of gasoline falling by the most since April of last year. Food prices rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in July as the effects of a drought in California lingered.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Per Capita Medicare Spending Is Actually Falling", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthHealth economists call that difference \u201cexcess cost growth.\u201dLately, though, some have taken to using the unwieldy phrase \u201cnegative excess cost growth.\u201dThis year, Medicare, which covers those 65 and older and people with disabilities, will spend about $11,200 on average for every person enrolled in the program. By comparison, it spent $12,000 three years ago, in inflation-adjusted dollars. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the number will fall below $11,000 by 2017 and stay below this year\u2019s number until 2020.The starkness of the pattern has been obscured because the budget office does not generally adjust its numbers for inflation. So its official charts \u2014 and other charts based on them \u2014 can mislead when it comes to future costs because they show increases that are simply a reflection of economy-wide inflation. Adjusted to reflect the value of a dollar, Medicare spending has not been rising and is not projected to rise in the next few years.The only other time cost growth has ever stayed below zero was in the late 1990s, when Congress made substantial cuts to Medicare spending. Then, the trend lasted for three years. This time, the budget office expects it to be more enduring.The recent pattern reflects two main factors. One is that the baby boom generation is entering the program. In the long term, that\u2019s a problem for Medicare\u2019s finances because the number of people it must care for is going to surge. But in the short term, it skews the group enrolled in Medicare toward a younger, healthier population.The second factor is more surprising and consequential. Over the last few years, Medicare patients have been using fewer expensive medical services, particularly hospital care and prescription drugs. The budget office is increasingly persuaded that such a pattern is going to last for a while.The reduction in the usual growth in health care spending means spending for the entire Medicare program is on track to grow more slowly over the next decade, even as more baby boomers reach retirement age and the number of people entering the program grows.An inflation-adjusted picture of Medicare\u2019s overall spending trajectory, according to the C.B.O., shows modest growth for the program, especially compared with its estimates from just a few years ago. Reductions made in the last four years alone are responsible for 10-year savings of more than $715 billion, which dwarfs nearly every deficit-reduction measure currently under discussion.(The budget office\u2019s projections here assume that Congress will not raise doctors\u2019 pay through its usual custom of temporary \u201cdoc fix\u201d bills, but the trend will look almost identical even if Congress does pass such bills.)Will it last? No one knows. The 1990s slowdown obviously did not last. But even if you focus only on what has happened, rather than on what budget analysts think will happen in the future, the change is remarkable. The notion that Medicare would have been spending less money, per person, would have been hard to fathom just a few years ago. (Remember the fights about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201crationing\u201d board and Paul Ryan\u2019s Medicare voucher plan? Both were aiming for annual excess cost growth targets of 1 percent.)The demographic pressures on the program still matter, but the flat per-person spending growth makes the Medicare budget more affordable. Historically, the budget office has thought about excess spending growth as representing about half of Medicare\u2019s future spending growth, with the aging of the population representing the other half. Now that first half has gotten a lot smaller.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. \nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Warming Concerns Grow", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile few Americans regard the environment as the nation\u2019s foremost challenge, most say it should be a priority, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. And more than half say global warming is caused by human behavior, the highest level ever recorded by the national poll.Economic issues continue to top the list of most important problems, and only 1 percent of those surveyed last week offered the environment as a top concern for the country. Other concerns, ahead of the environment, were foreign policy, poverty, education, immigration and politics.Still, nearly half of the public said global warming was having an impact now. One-quarter said they doubted it would have a serious impact at all, and about three in 10 expected its consequences to show up in the future. Even at the risk of limiting economic growth, 58 percent said protecting the environment should be a priority. \u201cEconomic growth is important, but if we don\u2019t take care of the environment, we won\u2019t be here to enjoy it,\u201d Bernice Schneiderman, 66, a retired teacher from Studio City, Calif., said in a follow-up interview. Economic growth was more important to 37 percent of those surveyed, including Steven Swoboda, 36, from Victorville, Calif. \u201cBecause our economy is so bad,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need to focus on it and on jobs and not worry so much about global warming.\u201d Fifty-four percent said the warming was caused by human behavior. \u201cMan has ruined the earth,\u201d said Laura Fort, 27, from Lexington Park, Md. \u201cWe need renewable energy that won\u2019t hurt the environment.\u201d By contrast, 31 percent considered warming to be a natural phenomenon, and 10 percent did not accept the idea that global warming existed at all. Animal and plant species around the world may be threatened by warmer global temperatures.Fifty-seven percent of those surveyed said they did not think global warming would cause any harm to them personally. But 42 percent saw it as an imminent threat. \u201cWhen I was little, we were taught to reduce and recycle but I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not going to be around,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Lauri Tupper, of Salisbury, N.Y. \u201cBut now that I have a daughter, it\u2019s scary knowing that what is going on right now could become worse.\u201d A 31-year-old Democrat, Ms. Tupper said, \u201cI get called a tree-hugging hippie all the time.\u201d Partisan and generational divides were reflected throughout the survey. About half of Republicans considered the economy more important than the environment, while nearly two-thirds of Democrats said the environment should take priority. While 18 percent of Republicans did not think global warming was real, only 3 percent of Democrats agreed. Sixty-one percent of Democrats said global warming was causing an impact now, compared with only 26 percent of Republicans. More than seven in 10 of those 65 and older expected to see no impact from global warming in their lifetimes, but many younger people did, including 50 percent of those under 30. The nationwide telephone poll was conducted using landlines and cellphones Sept. 10-14 with 1,000 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.

{"Headline": "On Raising Children Outside of Marriage ", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLettersTo the Editor:One key component of this discussion is missing.I lecture on these issues semester after semester. One common theme that arises is that many young poor women are choosing to have babies as a means to creating a future \u2014 the only future they can see as an option \u2014 to replicate what they knew growing up.For many of them having a baby is a means to collecting an array of social welfare benefits (falsely believing that those benefits will support them), and a way of having someone to love and of possibly getting a guy at least somewhat invested in their lives.My students regularly suggest that what is needed is for these young women to have some hope for their future that does not involve becoming a mother at a young age. What if these women had a more affordable option for higher educational opportunities?What if there were great guidance counselors or school social workers willing to discuss family planning with teenagers? Until young poor girls have a broader array of future possibilities, I don\u2019t think that increased access to IUD\u2019s will make much of a difference.The writer is an assistant professor of social work, Florida Atlantic University.\u00a0To the Editor:As an obstetrician-gynecologist, I applaud Isabel V. Sawhill\u2019s appeal to increase access to the most effective forms of birth control: IUDs and the implant. Even when women choose those methods, there are frequently additional barriers they have to overcome.Ideally, women should be able to have the IUD placed the same day they make the decision to use it, but the high upfront cost and limited access prove to be continuing impediments for many women. Even women with insurance coverage often have to pay for it first, or wait for their doctor to order it.IUDs and the implant are not right for every woman, but many women want them and cannot get them. Increasing access to all methods by eliminating barriers of cost and access will ultimately empower women to make the best decision for themselves and their families.The writer is a reproductive health advocacy fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health in New York.\u00a0To the Editor:Isabel V. Sawhill ponders options about how to raise children outside of marriage. There are three options she didn\u2019t mention:First, be like Sweden has been since the 1950s. Instead of hoping that the parents will figure out how to struggle on their own, the government gives a subsidy to each child, every month, from the time of conception until 18.Second, have financial disincentives to having many children and financial incentives to waiting to have children.And third, encourage the poor to have an education to lift themselves out of poverty by providing an affordable method for attending college. For the poor, that means free \u2014 with obligations. For example, after high school, if graduates work for two years or so in areas in which the government needs help, then they get college paid for.\u00a0\u00a0To the Editor:There have been so many changes in the structure of the economy, the structure of the family and the politics of the nation that it is hard to believe that more effective contraception is the answer to child poverty and \u201cirresponsible parenthood.\u201d Is it lack of effective contraception that has increased economic inequality so greatly, or is it the unequal distribution of wealth?There was a time, not too long ago, when one parent (the man) supported the family and the family enjoyed economic upward mobility. Why can\u2019t a single parent support a family today? Is it because that single parent is a woman, often earning less than minimum wage, often working fewer than 40 hours a week (not by choice) and often earning less than a man?Yes, contraception is important. But there is no reason a single woman cannot support her family if she earns a living wage, has supportive child care and health care, and lives in an environment that doesn\u2019t consider her a bad parent.The writer is professor emeritus of social work at the University of Connecticut.\u00a0To the Editor:Isabel V. Sawhill provided timely information on the vital role and efficacy of various methods of family planning available to the American public.Effective contraception, if made easily available and affordable to all adolescent girls and women, along with solid education through schools, physicians\u2019 offices, clinics and other agencies that serve the public, would to a large extent render the fraught debate about abortion less relevant, while significantly improving the life prospects of millions of children and their families.The actions of politicians, including Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, to reduce funding for Planned Parenthood and the drop in federal funding for contraception in overseas programs are counterproductive at best.The writer is a psychiatrist.

{"Headline": "Housing Data Is Mixed, but Job Figures Show Strength", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting that a sharp slowdown in job growth last month was probably an aberration.While other data on Thursday showed that housing starts declined in August, upward revisions for groundbreaking in July offered hope that the housing market was continuing to improve.\u201cWe have broad-based growth in the economy, including the housing market,\u201d said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 280,000 for the week ended Sept. 13, the lowest level since July, the Labor Department said Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to only 305,000 last week. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped 4,750, to 299,500.Mr. Faucher said the data was consistent with what the Federal Reserve was expecting to see. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 14.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 956,000 units. July\u2019s starts were revised to show a 1.12-million unit rate, the highest level since November 2007, instead of the previously reported 1.09-million unit rate.That helped take some of the sting out of the report, which also showed that permits fell 5.6 percent, to a 998,000-unit pace in August.Single-family starts in the South, where about half of the single-family construction takes place, increased last month to an eight-month high. Permits in the South hit their highest level since April 2008.Housing is clawing back after a setback caused by a rise in mortgage rates last year. However, it remains constrained by a relatively high unemployment rate and stringent lending practices by financial institutions.With the labor market gaining traction, though, economists expect housing activity to accelerate next year.\u201cThe underlying momentum in the housing sector remains quite favorable and we expect building activity to rebound next month,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.Last week\u2019s jobless claims data covered the period during which employers were surveyed for September\u2019s nonfarm payrolls. Claims fell 19,000 between the August and September survey periods.Employers added only 142,000 jobs to their payrolls in August, snapping six consecutive months of job increases above 200,000. The jobless claims report showed that the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 63,000, to 2.43 million, in the week to Sept. 6. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Independence Movement\u2019s Energy Wager Could Prove Risky for Scotland", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Scottish nationalists have long argued that being governed from London has deprived their country of its fair share of the wealth from Britain\u2019s oil and natural gas fields, which mostly lie in North Sea waters off their shores.\u201cIt\u2019s Scotland\u2019s oil\u201d was the rallying cry in the 1970s that helped raise the profile of the Scottish Nationalist Party, which now leads the country and is pushing for a vote to secede in the referendum on Thursday. Alex Salmond, the politician leading the separatist movement, has pointed to North Sea energy as the treasure that would help finance an independent Scotland \u2014 ensuring that the country could continue the generous public spending, including free university tuition, that he is promising voters.But North Sea energy revenue \u2014 even if the bulk of it went to a stand-alone Scotland, as is expected \u2014 would not be sufficient to justify such a big bet on the country\u2019s economic future.The approximately 5 billion pounds, or $8 billion, that the British government received in tax revenue from North Sea energy last year would have been the equivalent of only about 3 percent of the Scottish economy.While the oil and natural gas industry, and its 225,000 or so Scottish jobs, would remain vital to Scotland for years, the North Sea is no longer the bonanza it once was. Oil and gas production has declined by about two-thirds from the peak of 4.6 million barrels a day in the late 1990s, and tax revenue is declining and too erratic to count on, industry experts say.Even though some big oil companies have begun venturing farther offshore into deeper waters north of Scotland, the industry opposes the independence movement and might think twice before making the billions of dollars of investments required to bring that oil and gas to the surface. The ever-fluctuating price of oil makes any planning by industry executives, not to mention government treasurers, highly uncertain.Perhaps the harshest reality check on Mr. Salmond\u2019s forecasts has come from Ian Wood, a Scotsman who is the retired founder of Wood Group, a global oil services company based in Aberdeen. He is a widely respected figure in the industry whose work has been used for years by the British and Scottish governments.Even in Aberdeen, the former fishing port in northern Scotland that has become one of the wealthiest areas in Britain thanks to its role as gateway to the North Sea, there is an undertone of worry. Oil executives say that production costs have risen sharply because aging platforms and equipment require more frequent and extensive maintenance. Some oil and natural gas fields, they say, are now so depleted and their equipment so dilapidated that they cost more to operate than they generate in revenue.\u201cThis is a vulnerable industry,\u201d Barney Crockett, a Labour Party member of the Aberdeen City Council, said in an interview.The government that winds up in charge of Britain\u2019s oil and natural gas will face the task of giving tax incentives and finding other ways to squeeze the remaining oil and gas out of fields that are increasingly expensive to develop, analysts say.\u201cThe opportunities are smaller and more challenging to develop than in the past,\u201d Robert W. Dudley, chief executive of the oil giant BP, the second-largest investor in British waters after Royal Dutch Shell, said in a statement last week urging a no vote. \u201cFuture long-term investments require fiscal stability and certainty.\u201dThere are two main, diverging views on what Scottish victory would mean for the industry. One is that the Scottish government might pay closer attention, given energy\u2019s economic importance to the country.The other view, perhaps the majority one, holds that a period of uncertainty could hamper the industry since the North Sea is already at a crossroad. If Scotland does vote yes, there would be at least 18 months of transition before the country would be fully autonomous.\u201cThe larger players want things cleared up before proceeding,\u201d said Alex Martinos, an analyst in London with Energy Intelligence, a research firm.There are also doubts about whether a stand-alone Scottish government could afford to give the energy industry the new tax incentives that might be needed to continue production in the North Sea. About 40 billion barrels of oil and gas have been produced from the area since the 1970s. That leaves an estimated 12 billion to 24 billion barrels more, still a sizable amount \u2014 but it will be increasingly difficult and costly to extract.Mr. Salmond\u2019s government says it has no plans to increase the tax burden on the oil industry. But whether it could afford to cut taxes is another question.Even with better management, oil and gas production is likely to tail off to around a couple of hundred thousand barrels a day by 2050, down from about 1.5 million barrels day now, according to Alexander G. Kemp, professor of petroleum economics at the University of Aberdeen.Fortunately for the Scottish government, 2050 is a long way off \u2014 and the immediate future looks better. Thanks to recent heavy industry investments, Mr. Kemp and others foresee production picking up in the next few years. As a result, the Scottish government is assuming that energy-related tax revenue will recover to the annual range of \u00a36 billion to \u00a38 billion.But those estimates assume oil prices of $110 a barrel. That could prove too optimistic, as expanding energy production in the United States is putting downward pressure on world prices. Oil prices are hovering around $100 a barrel.Further weighing on the prospects, the industry\u2019s cost of retiring depleted fields and decommissioning old oil platforms is likely to rise, crimping tax receipts. The British government has guaranteed tax relief on these costs. Wood Mackenzie, an Edinburgh research firm, estimates that Scottish fields will cost $9 billion in cumulative tax relief by 2030.There is little doubt that managing this decline is going to be the main job of whatever government is in charge. The British government, which has long been something of an absentee landlord for the North Sea, has been spurred to action by the referendum\u2019s threat.Mr. Wood, the oil services expert, recommended this year in a report commissioned by the government of Prime Minister David Cameron that the government establish a powerful new regulator, separate from the bureaucratic Department of Energy and Climate Change, and that it provide incentives, like one in Norway that allows small companies to quickly recover cash for their exploration expenses. The Cameron government has said it would act on these proposals.Whether it gets the chance to fulfill that promise will depend on Thursday\u2019s vote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "President\u2019s Drive for Carbon Pricing Fails to Win at Home", "Date": "2014-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisPresident Obama stood in the chamber of the United Nations General Assembly last week and urged the world to follow his example and fight global warming. But a major new declaration calling for a global price on carbon \u2014 signed by 74 countries and more than 1,000 businesses and investors \u2014 is missing a key signatory: the United States.The declaration, released by the World Bank the day before Mr. Obama\u2019s speech at the United Nations Climate Summit, has been signed by China, Shell, Dow Chemical and Coca-Cola. It calls on all nations to enact laws forcing industries to pay for the carbon emissions that scientists say are the leading cause of global warming.The United States, which is under growing international pressure to price carbon, is missing from the declaration for a key reason: conservative opposition to Mr. Obama\u2019s climate change proposals, specifically a carbon tax. The opposition will only intensify if Republicans win control of the Senate in November and the new majority leader is Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, where coal \u2014 the world\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution \u2014 is the lifeblood of the state\u2019s economy.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the global elites to face facts,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s war on coal won\u2019t have any meaningful impact on global carbon emissions. What it will do is ship American jobs overseas, raise the cost of living substantially for middle and working-class families and throw thousands more Kentuckians out of work.\u201dAlthough the nonbinding World Bank declaration is meant largely as a show of resolve ahead of a 2015 climate summit in Paris, it signals the broadest, most explicit effort to date of world leaders and financial institutions to push all nations to enact new taxes on old forms of energy. The declaration notes that governments can either directly tax carbon pollution or create market-based cap-and-trade systems, which force companies to buy government-issued pollution permits.\u201cThe most powerful move that a government can make in the fight against climate change is to put a price on carbon,\u201d said Rachel Kyte, the World Bank\u2019s vice president of sustainability.In order to avoid more opposition from conservatives, Mr. Obama and other top administration officials no longer call publicly for a national price on carbon. But they have nonetheless signaled their support for international and state efforts. In his speech at the United Nations, Mr. Obama quoted the Democratic governor of Washington, Jay Inslee, who is urging other states to pass carbon pricing laws: \u201cAs one of America\u2019s governors has said, \u2018We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.\u2019\u00a0\u201dThe Obama administration has also enacted a policy signaling its readiness to price carbon should the politics of Congress ever shift: a metric it calls \u201cthe social cost of carbon,\u201d designed to account for the cost of one ton of carbon dioxide pollution. Mr. Obama\u2019s economists have determined the cost to be $37 a ton. Secretary of State John Kerry, a longtime advocate of government policy to fight climate change \u2014 and the chief author of the failed 2010 cap-and-trade bill in the Senate \u2014 last week told a meeting of the Major Economies Forum that \u201cwhen it comes to climate change, we know exactly what it takes to get the job done.\u201dBut Mr. Kerry did not specifically mention carbon pricing at the forum, a gathering of foreign ministers of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies, and said only, \u201cIt takes energy policy.\u201dAbout 40 countries have already implemented carbon pricing policy, while dozens of others are now exploring it. In 2005, the European Union enacted a cap-and-trade plan for carbon pollution, and at the United Nations last week, European leaders pushed hard for the rest of the world to sign on.\u201cWe need to define a new economy of the world,\u201d President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France said in his remarks at the climate summit. \u201cThere will have to be a new pricing system for carbon.\u201dThe new carbon pricing push comes as countries and institutions that once fought the idea are now embracing it.\u201cOn carbon pricing, there\u2019s a perfect storm taking place,\u201d said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard. \u201cThere is increasing recognition that approaches that have been taken in the past haven\u2019t worked, and that the only way one can affect the hundreds of millions of decisions is through price signals.\u201dOver the last year China has enacted seven pilot cap-and-trade programs in its provinces, although outside experts remain skeptical of Beijing\u2019s plans as the nation\u2019s carbon emissions continue to rise.At the same time, the political power of the coal industry to fight such laws remains potent. Australia, a major coal-producing nation, offers a case study in the political dangers of supporting a carbon tax in a coal-heavy democracy. A former Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, made tackling climate change a signature issue and enacted a carbon tax \u2014 a move that was seen as political suicide. Last year Australians voted her out of office and this past summer, the new prime minister, Tony Abbott, pushed through a bill to repeal the carbon price.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the location of nine of the states that have enacted cap-and-trade programs. They are in the Northeast, not in the Northwest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Army Chief Says Ground Troops Will Be Needed Against ISIS", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWIESBADEN, Germany \u2014 The United States general who beat back Islamic extremists in Iraq in 2007 suggested on Wednesday that the battle against Islamic State jihadis would only succeed with the use of ground forces.Airstrikes have halted the advance of the Islamic State, also known by the acronyms ISIS or ISIL, General Odierno, now the Army chief of staff, told journalists from four news organizations, including The New York Times, in what aides said were his first public comments on the current situation in Iraq. Ultimately, though, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have ground forces that are capable of going in and rooting them out,\u201d he said, referring to the Islamic extremists.The airstrikes \u201cwill not be the end all and be all solution in Iraq,\u201d he said. Similarly, he added, the jihadis cannot be allowed to have a safe haven across the border in Syria.Gen. Odierno was in Wiesbaden for an annual conference that brings together representatives of 39 countries, with 34 sending the commanders of their ground forces. The gathering, which has taken place in the past several years, stood in the shadow of conflicts in Iraq and Ukraine.The new demands on American forces should prompt a new debate in Congress over the wisdom of sequestration and the subsequent need to draw down America\u2019s military presence both overseas and at home, General Odierno said.It is \u201cessential to have this debate,\u201d he said, adding about any drawdown, \u201cIt\u2019s time to take a re-look at this.\u201dBoth he and Lt. Gen. Donald M. Campbell Jr., the commander of U.S. Army Europe, expressed satisfaction with the current deployment of troops in Europe. But they stressed that new \u201cRussian aggression\u201d in Ukraine and the changing situation for NATO partners such as Poland and the Baltic states would certainly complicate any further reduction.Efforts to stem the rise of the Islamic State.Both generals envisioned an immediate future in which American troops would rotate through Europe to enhance their ability to operate with other forces from NATO and other partner nations, and they pointed to the current involvement of about 200 American troops in a NATO exercise in Ukraine as an example of what was to come. Both men said it was not yet clear in what form the United States would contribute to the so-called spearhead rapid deployment force approved by NATO leaders at their summit meeting this month.Looking back at Iraq in 2010, when he left at the end of his third tour, General Odierno said that the level of violence was low, the security forces functioned, the economy was growing and politics were unitary.He called the current situation \u201cvery disappointing,\u201d and blamed former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki for undoing what he said were two of the three conditions that were needed for Iraqi forces to maintain security after American troops left in 2011.Those forces needed good leadership, good training and politics that united rather than divided Iraq, the general said. Mr. Maliki, he said, built sectarian forces and offered sectarian leadership, rendering the Iraqi security forces essentially powerless to resist the jihadis who had been driven into Syria after the 2007 surge led by General Odierno, and who have flooded back into Iraq over the past year.Faced with the jihadis, he said, Iraq\u2019s security forces under Mr. Maliki simply melted away. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they lost the fight,\u201d Gen. Odierno said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fight at all.\u201d\u201cThe sectarian nature of the force has really rendered them ineffective.\u201d\u201cIf we were there, maybe we would not have seen the breakdown of the government,\u201d the general said. \u201cI think we would have been able to keep a closer eye on what was going on.\u201dNow, with a new unity government forming under Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the United States must try to ensure that its partners believe in that unity, he said.\u201cAs we look to the future, our ability to partner with them will be based on those that are truly representative of Iraq as a whole,\u201d the general said.He did not comment on whether there would be a need for military action against the jihadis if they pull back to Syria, but he did specify that they should not be allowed a safe haven anywhere. The Islamic State poses \u201ca long-term threat\u201d to Europe and the United States, he said.Advertisement"}

Asked to explain what the Islamic State, a notoriously ruthless group, had received in return, Mr. Erdogan did not directly answer.\u201cWhen we say the word operation, people only think of strikes, bombs, weaponry, but operations are also political, diplomatic, civilian, and they involve discussions, contact,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said through a translator. \u201cI can tell you we have not had any monetary relationship, that\u2019s clear. Now as to the rest, you probably cannot expect us to publicly divulge what intelligence agencies do in their business, but the end result is that 49 diplomatic and consular staff have been freed. Some say maybe there\u2019s been an exchange, you might have an exchange. But it also takes an effort to prepare for such a thing.\u201dAsked specifically whether Turkey had given the Islamic State people it wanted in exchange for the Turkish hostages, Mr. Erdogan responded: \u201cI just said, such things may be possible. I think what\u2019s important is to be well prepared.\u201dTurkey\u2019s prolonged effort to obtain the release of the hostages weighed heavily on the level of support it had pledged in recent meetings with representatives of the United States and Arab nations on how to build a coalition to destroy the Islamic State group, which now occupies swaths of Syria and Iraq. Turkey conspicuously did not join the coalition, although it promised humanitarian support.With oil revenues, arms and organization, the jihadist group controls vast stretches of Syria and Iraq and aspires to statehood.Mr. Erdogan said he had told Secretary of State John Kerry that \u201cwe could talk about many issues after we secured the release of the 49 hostages.\u201d Now, Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cTurkish and American officials are talking as we speak, and those discussions continue.\u201dThe Turkish leader, who has vastly expanded his country\u2019s role in the Middle East and presided over an economy that has tripled in size, was introduced at the event by Fareed Zakaria, the CNN foreign affairs show host, as the most important political figure in Turkey\u2019s history since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder the Turkish republic. Mr. Erdogan devoted much of his speech to what he described as Turkey\u2019s unique position as the epicenter in a legacy of Middle East conflicts that can be traced back to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, and therefore is best suited to help solve them. \u201cTurkey best knows the geography it\u2019s in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe share a common history with every people in the region.\u201dHe reiterated his deep anger at what he called a \u201csystematic attack on Turkey\u2019s international reputation\u201d by news media organizations, including The New York Times, that in his view had sought to falsely imply that Mr. Erdogan and his aides tolerated the presence of Islamic State fighters in Turkey and even countenanced oil smuggling with the group, which helps finance itself via contraband sales from seized Syrian petroleum fields. Mr. Erdogan called such reporting \u201cso unfounded, so slanderous.\u201dThe Turkish leader also reminded that Turkey was hosting hundreds of thousands of refugees who have fled the conflict in Syria, had shouldered that burden without much international help and was facing a new influx of Kurdish villagers in northern Syria, who have fled an onslaught by Islamic State fighters in recent days. Mr. Erdogan also sought to rebut accusations that he has engaged in anti-Semitism because of his severe criticism of Israel over the treatment of the Palestinians. He drew a distinction between the Israeli people and the Israeli government.\u201cOur criticism is solely directed at the Israeli government\u2019s policies,\u201d he said.Referring to the 50-day Gaza Strip war this summer, in which more than 2,200 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military attacks to stop rocket fire and tunnel digging into Israel by Palestinian militants, Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t anti-Semitism to criticize the massacre of children and babies in their homes.\u201d He reminded his audience that Turkey\u2019s sizable Jewish population was a legacy of the Ottoman Empire\u2019s religious tolerance, and that he had denounced anti-Semitism as a crime. \u201cWhen Jews were expelled from Spain, they sought refuge in the Ottoman territory,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the same way, our country embraced Jews fleeing Hitler\u2019s persecution.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The University of Houston \u201cwas this school that was rather dilapidated, had a reputation for being \u2018Cougar High,\u2019 and it was everyone\u2019s second or third choice.\u201dThat year was the university\u2019s first under Renu Khator, its president who also doubles as the chancellor of the University of Houston system. As the first woman to hold both positions concurrently, and the only chancellor of a Texas public university system who is a woman, a minority or foreign-born, she was well cast as the face of change. (The university is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.) Over the next six years, Ms. Khator tried to instill a drive for national competitiveness in place of a mentality she described as \u201cwe are what we are.\u201d While the aggressive transformation of the urban university has drawn praise, it has prompted questions about the college\u2019s role in both the community and the university system.\u201cWe are in an experiment to make sure that diversity and excellence are not put in two mutually exclusive categories,\u201d Ms. Khator said. \u201cBecause we are such a diverse university, we are very important for the country. We are the prototype of what universities will look like.\u201dToday, it is difficult to spend a day at U.H. without being reminded that it has reached the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching\u2019s highest classification for research activity. On campus, this is referred to as \u201ctier one\u201d status. The designation holds particular significance in Texas, where lawmakers have provided major financial incentives to encourage eight of its public universities, including U.H., to elevate themselves to the same perch as U.T.-Austin and Texas A&M University. (U.T.-Austin and Texas A&M are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.) Perhaps no Texas university has embraced the challenge with as much enthusiasm as U.H. But some legislators have begun sounding the alarm that U.H.\u2019s transition could provide a less-accessible academic environment for its roughly 40,000 students, a majority of which are minority. \u201cWhat we complain about as legislators is the lack of students of color at the tier ones we already have,\u201d State Representative Garnet F. Coleman, Democrat of Houston, said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the model, then that means we\u2019ve just limited access at U.H. like it\u2019s limited at A&M and U.T.\u201dThere are concerns about rising costs during the tier one push: In fiscal year 2014, according to data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the average tuition and fees at U.H. were 46 percent higher than they were in fiscal year 2007, and exceeded those at U.T.-Austin and A&M. Despite that, Dr. Khator noted that the school had fared well in rankings of universities that graduate students with the least amount of debt. There have also been questions about college culture. Dr. Khator is determined to improve U.H.\u2019s graduation rate; currently, 55 percent of students graduate within six years.One of her proposed strategies for improving student engagement and retention called for requiring most freshmen to live on campus. It was quickly set aside last month after strong objections from State Senator John Whitmire, Democrat of Houston.Mr. Haston a student in the business school at U.H. and the student government association president, said the exchange represented \u201can ideological struggle about what the university\u2019s mission is supposed to be.\u201dHe added that U.H. was \u201cnot the same university that Whitmire went to or that people even 20 or 30 years ago went to.\u201d Among the state\u2019s public universities, U.H. now has the second-highest number of students living on campus, after Texas A&M. Mr. Whitmire, who declined to comment for this article, also questioned how Dr. Khator had gotten so far along on such a proposal without local lawmakers getting a heads up. \u201cWe generally try to keep all our legislators as informed as possible, but you can get blindsided sometimes and you can make mistakes sometimes,\u201d Dr. Khator said, adding that she is always willing to step back and reconsider alternative strategies.It was not the first time this year that Dr. Khator had made waves. Mr. Castille said he was concerned that the campus transition would leave students in the Houston suburbs who could not access or afford the latest \u201ctier one\u201d offerings with few options for higher education. \u201cBut if you question or resist,\u201d he said, \u201cKhator takes no prisoners, because she has never understood her role as chancellor of the entire U.H. system.\u201dDr. Khator said she was deeply committed to improving the entire system, and noted that under her leadership, two of the system\u2019s two-year colleges transitioned to four-year universities. She said she intended to convert U.H.-Victoria into a destination university. \u201cIt\u2019s possible you end up disappointing someone, but I think that ends up happening in every family,\u201d she said. \u201cI respect people\u2019s disappointments, people\u2019s frictions, people\u2019s sense of unease. We will work through them. We don\u2019t want any campus that\u2019s not successful.\u201dState Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston, said it was natural that U.H. would experience \u201cgrowing pains.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying there won\u2019t be hiccups along the way,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think they\u2019ll be able to address them. Obviously, the diversity issue is a challenge, but so far they\u2019re holding on.\u201dIn addition to increasing student success, Dr. Khator said she was focused on growing the university\u2019s footprint in energy, health care and the arts, since those are most relevant to Houston\u2019s economy.\u201cThe hardest thing for any organization in transformation is really changing the culture,\u201d she said. \u201cThat has been the toughest thing in all of this. But as time passes, that has become easier.\u201dMr. Haston, who has disposed of his Longhorn shirt, said the shift in perception was palpable.\u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone call it \u2018Cougar High\u2019 to my face in five years,\u201d he said.rhamilton@texastribune.orgAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Gross, Calpers and the End of the Investment Guru", "Date": "2014-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCollective WisdomThere were two big developments last week that seemed unrelated but are really part of the same big story of how finance is changing.Each development presages the end of the cult of the lone genius who can, through superior mental circuitry, outsmart the entire rest of the financial world and earn superior returns for his or her investors.It has been a long time coming. The advent of low-cost index mutual funds \u2014 and more widespread understanding of their advantages \u2014 has squeezed out the active stock-pickers of the not-too-distant past. Remember Peter Lynch of Fidelity and Bill Miller of Legg Mason, who often appeared on magazine covers as the era\u2019s great stock gurus? It is hard to name a contemporary equivalent.Mr. Gross is among the most successful investors of our age, building a reputation for picking which corners of the global bond market offer the best return relative to their risks. He outperformed the broader market consistently enough that the Total Return Fund, which he managed, attracted a peak of $293 billion in assets last year, and Pimco as a whole manages an astounding $1.97 trillion. Mr. Gross became a billionaire, and arguably the most visible public figure commenting on bond markets.What they\u2019re saying is that hedge fund managers' huge fees \u2014 typically 2 percent of assets managed plus 20 percent of profits \u2014 are too pricey relative to the returns they are able to reliably create. Even when hedge funds are able to consistently outperform markets (and many aren\u2019t), they extract much of that outperformance in the form of their fees, leaving not enough left over for the school and municipal employees of California.When you buy a financial asset, you are buying a claim on future resources: the earnings of a company whose stock you acquire, or years of interest payments plus your money back after some fixed period when you buy a bond. In the aggregate, those returns are shaped by the megaforces shaping the world of the future: how big the global economy is, and how much of economic output turns into corporate profits.Any individual investor might be able to take a larger or smaller share of that return by being savvy about predicting the future. If you predict that Facebook will become a wildly profitable company and Twitter will crash and burn, you can bet accordingly and make a fortune if you\u2019re right. Think the Chinese economy will slow but Japan is finally poised to boom? There are bets you can make on that!But what works when you\u2019re a small-potatoes investor doesn\u2019t work so well when your job is to safeguard a $300 billion pension fund the way Calpers does, or $2 trillion of client money the way Pimco does. At that size, you are being paid not to take on big risks that could either succeed wildly or fail completely. Your job is to capture a fair share of that future output of the global economy in as efficient a manner as possible.The conclusion that the leaders of Pimco and Calpers both seem to have reached is that you are more likely to achieve that with a high-functioning team of people who constantly assess the risk and potential return of various investment strategies and implement them, for a reasonable paycheck. Leaving yourself vulnerable to the whims of a single portfolio manager may leave you more vulnerable to missteps than one built on a methodical, team-driven approach. Moreover, the high compensation that a top investment guru or hedge fund manager can demand acts as a drain on returns.In short: When investment performance depends on one superstar, that superstar will want to be paid accordingly, and you become vulnerable to his or her idiosyncratic mistakes and misjudgments.There is no such thing as truly passive investing. Even if you believe that you can\u2019t consistently beat the market by trying to outsmart everyone else, you still have to decide how to allocate your portfolio among stocks and bonds; domestic versus international investments; and whether or how to invest in hard assets like office buildings or timberland.In other words, even a Calpers or a Pimco needs to employ people to figure out how to deploy their billions. But betting on a system, rather than the latest masters of the financial universe, may well prove the way of the future for not just the biggest investors but anyone who wants to capture a share of the global economy\u2019s future bounty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Market Awaits Next Move by the Fed", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors played it safe on Monday ahead of a potentially pivotal Federal Reserve meeting, leaving the overall stock market little changed. But smaller, riskier stocks slumped, giving the Nasdaq its biggest loss since the end of July.The Fed\u2019s policy makers start a two-day meeting on Tuesday, and some investors expect the central bank to indicate that it is moving closer to raising its key interest rate as the economy continues to strengthen. The Fed has held its overnight rate close to zero for more than five years, and stocks have surged against that backdrop.\u201cReading the tea leaves, it seems that investors are trying to position themselves for a more aggressive Fed,\u201d said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.63 points, or 0.3 percent, to 17,031.14. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index dropped 1.41, or 0.1 percent, to 1,984.13. The Nasdaq composite index fell 48.70 points, or 1.1 percent, to 4,518.90, its largest decline since July 31, when it fell 2.1 percent. The Russell 2000, an index of small-company stocks, slipped 14.09 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,146.52. Among individual stocks, Molson Coors was the biggest gainer in the S.&P. 500. The brewer\u2019s stock jumped $4.20, or 5.9 percent, to $76 on merger speculation in the beer industry. Heineken said late Sunday that it had rejected a takeover bid by a rival, SABMiller, the world\u2019s second-largest brewer.The news on the economy on Monday was mixed. Manufacturing output declined in August for the first time in seven months.Output at manufacturing plants fell 0.4 percent in August after a 0.7 percent rise in July, the Federal Reserve reported Monday. Total industrial production was down 0.1 percent in August, also the first setback for the overall figure since January. Output was up in mining and utility production but these gains were not enough to offset the decline in manufacturing.Output of motor vehicles and parts dropped 7.6 percent after a 9.3 percent increase in July, but the reversal was not viewed as worrisome. The July figure was boosted because many plants did not shut down as they normally do to retool for new models. Paul Dales, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, said he was not overly concerned by the dip in industrial production because it reflected a temporary seasonal adjustment problem. He said gains in a number of industries outside of autos \u201cunderlines that industry remains healthy.\u201dA separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that manufacturing rose on its index to the highest level in more than three years. The manufacturing gauge increased to 59, the highest point since March 2011. The index in July stood at 57.1. Any reading above 50 signals that manufacturing is growing.Some strategists say investors should not focus too much on this week\u2019s Fed meeting, because policy makers will keep rates low until they are convinced that the economic recovery is entrenched. A sell-off caused by Fed worries might even present investors with a buying opportunity, said Robert G. Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the first time that interest rates have moved up and it hasn\u2019t stagnated the economy,\u201d Mr. Pavlik said. \u201cThe market does well if interest rates move up gradually.\u201dAmong the stocks on the move, the construction-equipment maker Terex dropped $2.23, or 6.4 percent, to $32.47 after it cut its full-year profit outlook, citing a downturn in orders for its cranes.The financial information company Bankrate plummeted $1.90, or 13.8 percent, to $11.92 after it replaced its chief financial officer as it faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Avanir Pharmaceuticals soared $5.75, or 85.3 percent, to $12.49 after it reported positive study results for a potential treatment for agitation in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.The drug developer Gilead Sciences dipped $2.67, or 2.6 percent, to $100.99 after it reached a deal with generic drug companies in India to sell a cheaper version of its hepatitis C drug Solvadi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With New Health Law, Shopping Around Can Be Crucial", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublic HealthIf you bought health insurance at an Affordable Care Act marketplace this year, it really pays to look around before renewing your coverage for next year.The combination will create a dilemma for many people and highlights both a benefit and drawback of the new insurance marketplaces created by the health law. As the law\u2019s designers intended, plans are competing for customers, which often holds cost down. But all the jostling around in the market means that consumers are stuck with tough choices \u2014 swallow a big premium increase or switch to a cheaper plan that may cover different doctors and hospitals.The McKinsey data is based on preliminary information about rates in 18 states and the District of Columbia.The subsidies the federal government pays to low- and moderate-income households will decrease, on average, in 2015. But because of the way the Obama administration is processing renewals, many customers who don\u2019t shop may end up paying the wrong amount each month and getting a big bill (or refund) for the difference when they pay their federal income taxes.You may have read what\u2019s happening with average premiums. But individual consumers don\u2019t buy the average plan. And the federal government doesn\u2019t pay for the average plan. Instead of looking at averages, we looked at three sets of numbers to give a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening in the marketplaces where data is currently available.If you stayed with the cheapest silver plan from 2014 \u2014 according to the Department of Health and Human Services, it was the most popular choice around the country \u2014 those prices are going up almost everywhere. In some cases, they have increased by more than 10 percent. The average increase is 8.4 percent.A year after it was fully in place, the Affordable Care Act has largely succeeded in delivering on President Obama\u2019s main promises, even as it fell short in some ways and gave birth to a new and powerful conservative movement.Here is an example of how those changes are playing out: In New York City, the cheapest 2014 silver plan was offered by MetroPlus and cost $359 a month, before tax credits, for a 40-year-old single nonsmoker. Renew that plan and the premium will increase by 17.3 percent. But switch to the cheapest plan now listed, offered by Health Republic, and the premium will go up by only 1 percent. The Health Republic network is broad, and includes providers who were in the MetroPlus plan. But consumers in other markets may need to be willing to jettison providers if they want the best price.The third number we examined is important, too. For people with incomes between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 about $33,000 to $95,000 for a family of three \u2014 the federal government will kick in money to help pay for the insurance. Those subsidies are calculated based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan and the purchaser\u2019s income. What\u2019s happening in these plans can tell us how much the federal government\u2019s bill for subsidizing health insurance is going to go up. On average, the prices for the second-cheapest plans, called \u201cbenchmark plans,\u201d are actually going down by 1.4 percent, and in most places where they are increasing, they are increasing modestly. That\u2019s good news for the federal budget.The small increases in the cheapest silver plan and the decreases in benchmark plans are a sign the marketplace is working as intended, said Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. economist who helped design the marketplace structure in the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe main feature was that competition would bring rates down, and it did,\u201d he said.A few important caveats about this data: We still don\u2019t know the rates in every state. The McKinsey database includes rates the company has collected from the 18 states and the District of Columbia, which have publicly posted the prices that insurers plan to charge consumers. About 43 percent of Americans eligible to sign up live in those states, which include New York, California, Michigan and Ohio. In many of the states included in this analysis, the rates are still being reviewed by regulators. Even in states where regulators have approved the rates, prices could go down before the marketplaces open on Nov. 15. As more state data becomes available, we plan to update our map.Historical evidence suggests that few customers will return to the marketplace to shop for a new health plan. Customers in the Affordable Care Act marketplace may be more price-sensitive than those in previous government insurance markets. But in those other plans, inertia has tended to set in.In the marketplaces, it\u2019s not yet clear why rates on the most popular plans are increasing so much more than their competitors. It\u2019s possible insurers are charging more for these plans to take advantage of inertia and increase profits. It\u2019s also possible that some priced their initial policies unsustainably low, given the new nature of this market, and are now correcting.Brendan Buck, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry group, said the main factor driving premium increases was \u201cwho signed up.\u201d Many of the new lowest cost plans are new market entrants, according to McKinsey, which means they may have less data on how expensive these new customers will be to cover. We\u2019re likely to get more insight into the forces driving premiums changes in coming years.Automatically renewing marketplace plans will be a mistake for many people, but it is an especially risky one for the 85 percent of people who qualified for some sort of subsidy. The Obama administration has chosen not to recalculate the value of tax credits for people who don\u2019t return to the Healthcare.gov site.Not everyone has to worry about these invisible price changes, especially if incomes haven\u2019t changed. But in markets where federal rules apply and the benchmark is going down a lot, it pays to return to the marketplace before renewing. Places where that will be an issue include parts of Georgia, Indiana and Ohio \u2014 where benchmark prices are declining by more than 15 percent. For people in those areas, returning to the marketplace could prevent a surprise tax bill.The Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. \nnytimes.com/upshotAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lessons From Scotland on British Drive to Leave E.U.", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyWith Scotland having voted to stay part of the United Kingdom, attention will turn to the next potential British referendum: on whether the country will remain in the European Union. David Cameron has promised to hold an in-or-out referendum on membership in the bloc if he is re-elected prime minister in next year\u2019s general election. There are comparisons and contrasts between the two votes, as well lessons to be learned. If Scotland had voted to quit Britain, the influence of both Scotland and what would have been left of the United Kingdom would have been diminished. Scotland\u2019s economy would have been damaged. The divorce would also have been acrimonious. Many British politicians have been happy to deploy such arguments when seeking to prevent a schism with Scotland. But some are so deeply euro-skeptic that they are not willing to take on board parallel arguments about the effect of a schism between Britain and the European Union. Look at the influence point. It is hard to see how the standing in the rest of the world of either Britain or what would remain of the Union would be enhanced by Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc. President Vladimir V. Putin would be delighted at the disarray on Russia\u2019s western front. Think, too, how much harder it would be for a fractured Europe to construct a proper policy for confronting extremism in the Middle East.British euro-skeptics say this is nonsense, as a Britain freed from its European Union shackles, would still be part of NATO \u2014 and that is what matters. But the sense of common purpose and ability to take joint action on foreign policy would have been reduced.Now look at the economy. The main weaknesses in the case for Scottish independence was the claim that Edinburgh could share a single currency with the rest of Britain without having to do London\u2019s bidding on matters such as fiscal policy. In fact, the British politicians said flatly there would be no currency union.Britain doesn\u2019t share a currency with the rest of Europe. But it does share the single market. It is just not credible that it could continue to do so after quitting the European Union without following rules set in Brussels.There are also parallels in the bitterness of a schism, should it happen. If Scotland had voted for independence, there would have been intense wrangles over not just the currency but also the division of North Sea oil and the national debt. Years of uncertainty would have squished investment. Euro-skeptics, who are open to staying in the Union only if there is a radical renegotiation of Britain\u2019s relationship with it, might argue there is another parallel with the Scottish vote. Britain will get a really good deal with Brussels only if it takes the bloc right to the brink. After all, it was only because Scotland looked to be on the verge of voting for independence that the British political parties offered it at the last minute both more powers to determine its own fate and guarantees of generous budget support.Britain should certainly seek to change the European Union. But the best way of achieving this is not to engage in brinkmanship. Mr. Cameron made a near-fatal error by not coming up with a devolution package early on.The good thing is that the British prime minister is focusing early on overhauling the European Union. He is also sensibly concentrating on matters that would benefit the whole of the bloc \u2014 principally bolstering its competitiveness \u2014 not just Britain.The rest of the Union is starting to appreciate Britain\u2019s concerns. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s incoming president, plans to cut red tape; develop a capital markets union, which would be great for London; complete the single market in services; cut a free trade deal with America; and combat so-called benefit tourism, the fear of a vast migration of Europeans to the country with the most generous social system.One might think Britain could secure even more concessions if it took the negotiations to the wire. But here the parallels with Scotland break down. The emotional ties are not as strong. What is more, the mechanism for reaching agreements in the European Union are much slower-moving. Mr. Cameron could pull a rabbit out of the hat on Scotland by merely consulting the leaders of the two other main parties and without even debating his offer in Parliament. Any concessions from the Union would require the agreement of either most, or in some cases all, of the other 27 member countries.Another lesson pundits might like to draw from the Scottish vote is that the people can ultimately be relied on to make sensible choices. While there is something in this, the internal dynamics of the Conservative Party could easily shift Mr. Cameron, who is politically weak, in a more euro-skeptic direction. The eurozone might also enter a new crisis, which would make Britain\u2019s membership in the bloc seem less attractive. The bigger lesson of the Scottish referendum is the folly of complacency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Travelers to Cuba Face Stricter Rules on Imports", "Date": "2014-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHAVANA \u2014 Lugging duffel bags crammed with soap, socks, toys and other hard-to-obtain consumer goods, travelers arriving in Cuba on Monday complained that new government restrictions on their imports would leave their families wanting.Passengers on flights from Miami said they were bringing in far less than usual because of higher customs duties and stricter limits on the number of products allowed under rules that went into effect on Monday.At Havana\u2019s international airport, there appeared to be fewer bicycles, 40-inch televisions or other bulky household items that normally made the baggage carousels look like a Target or Walmart checkout line during a holiday sale.\u201cThere are barely any bags on the floor inside,\u201d said Arnaldo Roa, a 45-year-old Miami handyman on a trip to see relatives. While he had a bag stuffed with toys and clothes for his daughter, he said he was not able to bring his usual extra bags filled with gifts for other family members.\u201cI\u2019m upset,\u201d he said. \u201cSome relatives are going to get upset because normally I bring them things.\u201dThe easing of travel restrictions by the United States and Cuban governments over the last five years has allowed travelers to bring in nearly $2 billion of products a year. The government says the new limits are meant to curb abuses that have turned air travel in particular into a way for professional thieves to illegally import supplies for both black-market businesses and legal private enterprises that are supposed to buy supplies from the state.Ana Maria Perez, who works in a South Florida factory making airplane seats, said she had been forced to pay $95 in customs duties, far more than usual. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pay a lot now,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it at all, but I paid.\u201dThe new rules run 41 pages and give a sense of the quantity and diversity of the commercial goods arriving in checked bags and, alternatively, by sea shipment. Travelers are now allowed to bring in 22 pounds of detergent instead of 44; one set of hand tools instead of two; and 24 bras instead of 48. Four car tires are still permitted, as are two pieces of baby furniture and two flat-screen televisions.The authorities took to the airwaves and pages of state media in recent days to assure Cubans that the vast majority of travelers will not be affected. The change is intended \u201cto keep certain people from using current rules on noncommercial imports to bring into the country high volumes of goods that are destined for commercial sale and profit,\u201d Idalmis Rosales Milanes, deputy chief of Cuban customs, told the government newspaper Granma.Still, some travelers were furious.\u201cI\u2019m not coming back anymore,\u201d said Diamara Cespedes, a Miami nurse. \u201cThey\u2019re finishing off the Cuban people with this.\u201dThe government has justified the new rules with examples of prolific thieves, including one passenger who it said brought in 41 computer monitors and 66 flat-screen televisions in a year.From $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in goods were flown to Cuba in travelers\u2019 baggage last year, with the average visitor bringing in goods valued at $3,551, according to a 2013 survey of 1,154 Cuban and Cuban-American travelers conducted by the Havana Consulting Group, a private consultant based in Florida that studies the Cuban economy.\u201cIt\u2019s sustenance, support that greatly aids in the survival of the Cuban family,\u201d said the group\u2019s president, Emilio Morales. \u201cAlong with cash remittances, it\u2019s the most significant source of earnings for the Cuban population, not the salaries the government pays.\u201dWhile his study did not look at the final destination of travelers\u2019 goods, Mr. Morales said he estimated that, based on his knowledge of the gift-giving, about 60 percent went to families and 40 percent to black-market retailers.With foreign reserves dropping sharply over the last two years as Cuba tries to pay off sovereign debt and make itself a more attractive destination for foreign investment, Mr. Morales said, the government is desperate to reduce the flow of goods and push Cubans\u2019 relatives abroad to send help in the form of cash remittances, which are subjected to hefty government fees. Limiting informal imports also would presumably help bolster business in state-controlled stores.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Charles Bowden, Author With Unblinking Eye on Southwest, Dies at 69", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCharles Bowden, an author and journalist acclaimed for his vivid, unsparing and often lyrical portrayals of life in the Southwest, particularly the brutality on the border between the United States and Mexico, died on Saturday in Las Cruces, N.M. He was 69.Molly Molloy, his companion of many years, said that he had taken ill recently and died suddenly of an unknown cause. An autopsy was to be performed, she said.Mr. Bowden\u2019s most notable work cut through debates about drug wars and immigration, peering instead into basic human needs and motives, letting individual lives reveal broader concerns. His best-known book, \u201cDown by the River: Drugs, Money, Murder and Family,\u201d published in 2002, is a blend of biography, history, narrative journalism and essayistic expression that spins outward from a single, seemingly unremarkable crime along the Rio Grande: the murder of a man who had no apparent involvement in the border conflict but turns out to have been the brother of an official at the Drug Enforcement Agency. Charles Clyde Bowden was born on July 20, 1945, in Joliet, Ill. His father, a lawyer who read deeply and was fascinated by the West, moved the family to Tucson when Charles was a boy. Mr. Bowden fell in love with his new surroundings. He graduated from the University of Arizona and received a master\u2019s degree in American intellectual history from the University of Wisconsin. He completed work toward his doctorate there but walked out while defending his dissertation, frustrated with what he felt were uninformed questions from his review committee.In addition to Ms. Molloy, a research librarian at New Mexico State University who specializes in border issues, his survivors include a son, Jesse Niwa, from a previous relationship; a sister, Margaret Bowden; and a brother, George. His two marriages ended in divorce. In an interview with The Times in 1991, Mr. Bowden said he once made a publisher remove the word \u201cenvironmentalist\u201d from the dust jacket of one of his books. \u201cEnvironmentalism,\u201d he said, \u201cis an upper-middle-class, white movement aimed at absolution and preserving a lifestyle with a Volvo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Put Cultural Issues in Their Quiver", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRESTON, Va. \u2014 After a generation of campaigns in which Republicans exploited wedge issues to win close elections, Democrats are now on the offensive in the culture wars.Democrats see social issues as potent for the same reasons Republicans once did, using them as a tool to both stoke concerns among moderate voters, especially women, and motivate their base.In few places has the change been as notable as in Virginia, where Democrats for decades practiced defensive politics to assure voters they were in the state\u2019s cultural mainstream.Now it is Republican candidates who are in a crouch. When Senator Mark Warner, a first-term Democrat, and his Republican opponent, Ed Gillespie, met for their first debate this summer, it was Mr. Gillespie who had to summon a creative way to rebut the suggestion that he was extreme. When Mr. Warner attacked his views on abortion, contraception and same-sex marriage, Mr. Gillespie used his Catholic faith as a shield. \u201cMy religious views, really, Senator, should not be at issue here,\u201d he said.In Virginia, North Carolina and Colorado, important swing states, Democratic senators contending with a sour climate have used debates to hammer their Republican opponents on issues related to contraception and women\u2019s rights. Those efforts may carry them only so far in a year when Republicans have more paths to winning control of the Senate than Democrats have to keeping it.But the Republicans\u2019 attempts to parry attacks reveal how the ground has shifted. Their candidates in the three states have fought back with proposals to sell birth control pills over the counter, a shift that not long ago might have enraged religious conservatives. But there is little indication so far that the Democrats\u2019 push on social issues is motivating cultural conservatives to respond.Even in more conservative Arkansas and Louisiana, Republican candidates are not raising the topic. In 2004, Republicans used state referendums barring same-sex marriage not only to re-elect President George W. Bush but also to win close Senate races.This year, the most notable advertisement on the topic comes from Monica Wehby, a Republican Senate candidate in Oregon who supports same-sex marriage and is trying to break through.Some Republicans believe that the Democrats\u2019 reliance on cultural issues in politically moderate states underlines the structural challenges that Republicans face with voters.\u201cJust as Democrats had to accept or pretend to accept what was viewed as the cultural center of the country, Republicans are going to have to accept or pretend to accept that the center has shifted,\u201d said Ben Domenech, a conservative writer. \u201cThey can respond by pretending it isn\u2019t happening or isn\u2019t a problem. But they have tried that in recent cycles, and it hasn\u2019t really worked. Or they can reorganize around an agenda that favors individual liberty.\u201dAn electorate reshaped by a growing presence of liberal millennials, minorities, and a secular, unmarried and educated white voting bloc will most likely force Republicans to recalibrate.On issues like gun control, drugs, the environment, race and even national security, this demographic shift has substantially weakened the right\u2019s ability to portray Democrats as out of the social mainstream. When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, white voters without a college degree made up 65 percent of the electorate; by 2012, that number had dropped to 36 percent.His view may be too bullish, but even Republicans acknowledge that they must adapt. Democrats \u201cdid win the culture war,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist who is urging his party to adopt a \u201cfreedom nationally, values locally\u201d approach that would effectively cede social issues to states and localities.Democrats are making adjustments, too, speaking less about abortion and more about a broader range of \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d issues.The willingness of Mr. Warner, a cautious politician, to challenge his opponent over same-sex marriage, abortion rights, contraception and climate change illustrates the Democrats\u2019 new boldness.\u201cThe public has moved,\u201d Mr. Warner said after a campaign forum with technology executives in Northern Virginia, exactly the sort of voters who have reshaped politics in the state. When he won the governorship in 2001, Mr. Warner distanced himself from the other Democrats on the ticket who had more liberal views on gay rights, gun control and the death penalty.Now, Democrats win in Virginia by emphasizing those very issues. Senator Tim Kaine did in 2012, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe prevailed last year, with both men winning big among women voters. A new generation of Democratic strategists believe that using cultural attacks as a turnout lever is essential to success in swing states.\u201cWhen we polled and focus-grouped, it was so evident you weren\u2019t going to motivate our base unless you were vocal and clear on these issues,\u201d said Robby Mook, Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s campaign manager.For many Democrats watching Colorado politics, the same moment came in 2010, when Senator Michael Bennet won by portraying his Republican opponent as out of step with the state\u2019s moderate voters, especially women.\u201cThat would have been prima facie evidence for commitment 20 years earlier,\u201d joked David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist. After all, it was a Colorado Republican senator, Wayne Allard, who in 2004 sponsored a bill in Congress that would have amended the Constitution to define marriage as being between a man and a woman.Now Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat who succeeded Mr. Allard in 2009, is running a campaign courting female voters by emphasizing the culture wars. Along with an array of outside liberal groups, Mr. Udall has pounded his Republican challenger, Representative Cory Gardner, on abortion, contraception and same-sex marriage, including at their first debate recently.\u201cWhen it comes to a woman\u2019s reproductive rights and women\u2019s health, how can women and families trust you?\u201d the senator asked.Mr. Gardner countered by showing a commercial featuring him speaking to a group of women in which he vowed \u201ccheaper and easier\u201d access to birth control pills.Colorado Republicans say that if Mr. Udall\u2019s cultural assault is successful, it will represent an ominous sign about their party\u2019s ability to win statewide.\u201cIf he can\u2019t win this in this environment and against this incumbent, I shudder to think when we are going to be able to win one,\u201d said Dick Wadhams, a former Colorado Republican chairman. \u201cThis election, in many ways, is going to determine whether Colorado has really shifted blue.\u201dIn North Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat, has also sought to portray her Republican opponent, Thom Tillis, as on the wrong side of the cultural divide. She also used her first debate against Mr. Tillis to raise contraception as an issue. \u201cSpeaker Tillis, it\u2019s 2014 \u2014 why did you work to make birth control so inaccessible?\u201d she asked.Like other important Senate elections this year, the North Carolina race could ultimately be decided by the size of Ms. Hagan\u2019s margin among women. \u201cThat is who is absolutely now deciding elections,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the head of Emily\u2019s List, which backs female candidates who support abortion rights. \u201cAnd they will decide this year by going or not going to the polls.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Years After Fukushima, Japan Approves a Nuclear Plant", "Date": "2014-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEven with the approval, it will probably be months before either of the reactors can be turned back on. In addition to further safety checks, the plant\u2019s operator, the Kyushu Electric Power Company, must obtain the consent of local governments around the plant. The final decision on whether to restart the plant will be made by the prime minister, probably in December, according to local news media reports.However, opinion polls have shown that the public remains skeptical about both the safety of the plants and the ability of Mr. Abe\u2019s governing Liberal Democratic Party to ensure that safety, as the party has long had close ties to the politically powerful nuclear industry. Those doubts were aired last month during a monthlong public comment period after the Nuclear Regulation Authority released a draft report in July that expressed approval of the Sendai plant\u2019s safety measures.The agency said it had received 17,800 comments, more than it expected. Many were highly skeptical about the safety of the Sendai plant, which is in a volcanically active area. Still, the agency on Wednesday ended up adopting its July findings without major modifications.The agency said it made the decision after reviewing 18,600 pages of supporting documents filed by Kyushu Electric, as well as the results of its own inspections of the plant. It said the design and construction of the reactors and other facilities, and also the contingency plans for dealing with emergencies, met new safety standards that the agency adopted in July of last year.\u201cI think the huge number of public comments, more than anything, reflects the enormous sensitivity toward the restart question, and the safety of nuclear power,\u201d Kenzo Oshima, a commissioner at the agency, told reporters. \u201cI also see it as reflecting a strong desire after the Fukushima accident to learn from that experience and raise the level of safety.\u201dAgency officials have sought to reassure the public by calling the new safety standards the most stringent in the world, saying they fully incorporate the lessons of the Fukushima disaster, which happened when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out vital cooling systems at the Fukushima plant.Opponents of the restart said the agency was ignoring the concerns raised in the public comments. They said the agency, which had started amid high hopes for more independent oversight, was looking more and more like a rubber stamp for the administration.\u201cThere was clearly huge pressure on the regulatory agency from the Abe government,\u201d said Akira Kimura, a professor of peace studies at Kagoshima University who has been involved in efforts to block the restart of the Sendai plant. \u201cThis government is just ramming through its agenda, with complete disregard for the public will.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghanistan\u2019s Failed Transformation", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorOn Sunday, after months of bitter wrangling, the two leading candidates in Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election agreed to form a national unity government. Ashraf Ghani, a Pashtun technocrat, is to be president, and Abdullah Abdullah, a former foreign minister of mixed Tajik and Pashtun descent, is to be chief executive, a newly created post akin to prime minister. The power-sharing agreement came after an audit of the ballots cast in a June runoff, in an election widely believed to have been partially rigged. It has no basis in Afghanistan\u2019s election law. And given the rancor that has come before, it may not hold very long.This deal, which was brokered with help from Washington, is yet another makeshift compromise that only reveals the shortcomings of the United States\u2019 13-year presence in Afghanistan. But rather than admit these failures, American and NATO officials would have us think that democracy is gaining traction in Afghanistan, the Taliban insurgency has stalled and Al Qaeda is being defeated. All these arguments, of course, serve as an excuse for U.S. troops to start withdrawing at the end of the year, a plan that seemed wrong when it was made in December 2009 and is proving catastrophically wrong now.John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, apparently is the only official in Washington who dares speak truth to power. In a Sept. 12 speech at Georgetown University, he said that Afghanistan \u201cremains under assault by insurgents and is short of domestic revenue, plagued by corruption, afflicted by criminal elements involved in opium and smuggling, and struggling to execute basic functions of government.\u201d His comments were largely ignored by the American media, and there was no immediate reaction from the Obama administration.And yet anything less than a heavy dose of honesty and fresh thinking by Afghans and their Western supporters will almost certainly mean the relapse of Afghanistan into civil war and the emergence of groups even more extreme than the Taliban, as has happened in Iraq and Syria.Moving from the lengthy U.S. military presence to full Afghan sovereignty was premised on the completion of four distinct transitions. But none has been successfully carried out, despite more than $640 billion in U.S. direct spending in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2013.The most critical transition, the one on which everything else rested, was political. Rather than build state institutions or carry out much-needed electoral reforms, President Hamid Karzai spent his long tenure encouraging a form of crony politics that failed to sap the power of the warlords. He won a second term in 2009, after a vastly fraudulent election. The following year, according to U.N. officials, he asked that the United Nations stop supervising elections in the country, and Washington and NATO went along.The second promised transition was military. U.S. forces were to hand over security matters to Afghan forces, proving that the new, U.S.-trained Afghan Army would then be able to hold back the Taliban on its own. Yet Interior Minister Mohammad Omar Daudzai told Parliament in Kabul on Sept. 16 that the previous six months had been the deadliest ever for the Afghan police. Today there is fighting in 18 of 34 provinces, Afghan and NATO officials have told me. In many areas, Afghan soldiers are barely able to secure their own bases, much less retake lost territory. Helmand, the critical drugs-producing province in southern Afghanistan, is at risk of being taken over by the Taliban. If it falls, all of southern Afghanistan might too.The third failed transition has to do with economics. According to a senior Afghan official at the Finance Ministry, The Washington Post reported recently, the Afghan government is broke and needs an emergency $537 million bailout; it was barely able to pay more than half a million government employees this month. Money spent on schools and hospitals has dramatically improved education and health for Afghans, but these services remain dependent on foreign funding. There has been little large-scale investment in agriculture or basic industry; instead, the bulk of the economy has focused on servicing foreign troops and on their spending. And now the troops are about to withdraw.When I first visited Afghanistan in the 1970s, the country was desperately poor, but it was almost self-sufficient in food and had a small yet thriving export trade in fruit, handicrafts, furs and gems. Today, Afghanistan imports much of its food and it produces very few commercial goods. The service economy, which is run by the middle class, has been collapsing, as both educated people and billions of dollars in capital have left the country. The resulting vacuum opens the way for the opium-fed underground economy to expand enormously, breeding crime and corruption.The fourth contribution expected of the U.S. presence was insulating Afghanistan from foreign interference, which many Afghans fear as much as the Taliban. Iran, Pakistan and Russia, but also India, Saudi Arabia and other states helped fuel the civil war in the 1990s. The Obama administration pledged in its first term to negotiate a noninterference agreement among Afghanistan\u2019s neighbors. But that, too, has not happened, and the country remains vulnerable to meddling from outside.History will not look kindly on the legacy of the U.S. government and Mr. Karzai in Afghanistan. But this also means that Afghanistan\u2019s new leaders can do better, and now, simply by acting responsibly \u2014 and working together to legitimize the results of this problematic election that has brought them to power.The four-page joint agreement between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah calls for convening a loya jirga, a traditional gathering of tribal representatives and elected district councilors, in the next two years in order to amend the Constitution to reflect the recent creation of the chief executive post.But a loya jirga should be called as soon as possible, so as to promptly give constitutional cover to the power-sharing agreement between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah. The assembly should also discuss how the present presidential system, which is highly centralized, could be improved and how electoral reforms can be made to prevent future vote-rigging. And the gathering should be convened before the parliamentary elections scheduled for next year: This would allow the legislators who are elected then to have some of the legitimacy that is lacking at present.2015 is supposed to mark the start of Afghanistan\u2019s \u201cTransformation Decade.\u201d But if the country is to even get to 2015 in one piece, its new leaders must act fast to correct course after the failed transformation of the last decade.An earlier version of this article misidentified the ballots investigated in an audit of Afghanistan\u2019s presidential election. The audit was of ballots cast during a runoff vote in June, not during the first round of voting in April.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Charles Plosser and Richard Fisher, Both Dissenters, to Retire From Fed", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Two Federal Reserve officials who have warned loudly and persistently that the Fed is overreaching in its economic stimulus campaign plan to retire next year after completing terms on the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee.Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia since 2006, said on Monday that he would retire in March. Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas since 2005, is required to step down by the end of April.Both men dissented at the committee\u2019s most recent meeting, last week, arguing that the central bank is not retreating fast enough from its support program as the economy gains strength.The departures are unlikely to have a large influence on policy. The two men, and a handful of like-minded officials, have been marginalized in recent years as their warnings that inflation would accelerate have failed to materialize. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, and her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, have chosen to press ahead with majority support rather than seeking unanimity. Still, the turnover is part of a gradual generational shift at the Fed as policy makers trained in the 1970s, who tend to fear inflation above all else, are gradually replaced by younger officials more comfortable with pursuing broader policy goals.Annual inflation in the United States has averaged 3.8 percent during Mr. Plosser\u2019s adult life. By contrast, inflation has averaged just 2.5 percent during the adult life of Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, who at 50 is the youngest member of the policy-making committee and who has become the most outspoken proponent of expanding the Fed\u2019s stimulus campaign.The influence of recent events, rather than the 1970s, was also evident in the advocacy of Jeremy C. Stein, 54, who recently completed a brief stint on the Fed\u2019s board, for policy makers to consider potential threats to the stability of financial markets in setting policy.Successors for Mr. Fisher and Mr. Plosser will be selected by the boards of their reserve banks, made up of local business and community leaders, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors in Washington. Their eventual successors will not vote on policy until 2017.The presidents of the 12 regional reserve banks hold rotating votes on the Fed\u2019s open market committee, which sets monetary policy. They also oversee the work of the reserve banks, including financial regulation, operating parts of the nation\u2019s financial plumbing, and directing large staffs of economic researchers.Mr. Plosser, 66, was an economics professor at the University of Rochester before joining the Philadelphia Fed in 2006. He has embraced a role as a policy advocate for the idea \u2014 prevalent among many academic economists \u2014 that the Fed tends to overestimate its power. Central banks, in this view, are largely limited to the ability to control inflation, and they should focus on doing so. In 2008, he voted reluctantly in favor of the Fed\u2019s efforts to arrest the financial crisis, and then almost immediately began to express misgivings about its efforts to revive growth, including the Fed\u2019s expansive bond-buying campaigns. As a member of the committee in 2011 and again this year, he has dissented frequently, but he has not been able to shift the Fed\u2019s course. During Mr. Plosser\u2019s tenure, the Fed has never moved in the direction of tighter policy.He has had greater success in promoting a related view that the Fed should conduct policy on the basis of predictable rules. He worked with Ms. Yellen, during her term as vice chairwoman, on a 2012 document that for the first time formalized 2 percent annual inflation as a primary goal of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy. Ms. Yellen praised Mr. Plosser\u2019s work on that policy statement on Monday, adding: \u201cMy colleagues and I will miss his keen insights, deep analysis and good humor.\u201dUnder Fed rules, Mr. Plosser could have served until August 2016. The Philadelphia Fed\u2019s statement did not explain the timing of his departure and a spokeswoman said that Mr. Plosser had decided not to speak with the news media on Monday.Mr. Fisher, who has frequently joined Mr. Plosser in dissent, is regarded by his colleagues as something of a maverick. Most of them are trained economists; he is an investor who made a fortune in private equity deals before joining the Dallas Fed in 2005.In 2008, he repeatedly played down evidence of economic collapse. With the crisis in full swing, Mr. Fisher initially dissented from the Fed\u2019s interventions in December 2008 before changing his vote to preserve the appearance of unity.More recently, he has warned that the Fed was encouraging excessive speculation in financial markets, risking a new round of bubbles.Mr. Fisher, 64, has not set a departure date, but Fed policy requires reserve bank presidents appointed after the age of 50 to step down after 10 years. A spokesman said he would pick a date between January and April.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Where House Prices Shot Up, Rebound Is Slowest ", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsWHEN an economy is growing rapidly, and the population is increasing, house prices are likely to rise.Conversely, areas with slow growth are not likely to see house prices increase.That is generally what has happened in the United States since the summer of 2007, when house prices peaked, as measured by the Federal Housing Finance Agency index. But there are exceptions. In the Pacific region, house prices soared during the boom. But they have performed relatively poorly in recent years even though the regional economy has outpaced the national one. In the East North Central region \u2014 Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, the bulk of the states in the so-called Rust Belt \u2014 the economy has grown more slowly than in any of the other eight regions tabulated by the Census Bureau, and population growth has also lagged other regions. But home prices have performed better than might have been expected.The anomalies appear to reflect excesses during the housing boom. In the seven years before home prices peaked in June 2007, they rose 60 percent for the entire country. But in the Pacific states \u2014 Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington \u2014 prices climbed 115 percent. Perhaps as a result, home prices in that region fell further than in any other region during the Great Recession, and now remain 14.1 percent lower than they were in June 2007, despite an economy that has done better than the national average.Over all, the housing finance agency reported this week, home prices nationally have recovered to the point that they are only 4.6 percent lower than the peak value. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, the East North Central states have matched that performance, and thus done better than many regions, despite having less economic growth than any other region since mid-2007. That may reflect the fact that house prices in that region rose just 26 percent during the seven years before the housing bubble burst, less than in any other region.House price indexes, it should be noted, can vary sharply. The housing finance agency index uses mortgages bought or insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises that the agency regulates. That excludes the sales history of homes that require so-called jumbo mortgages, loans too large for Fannie and Freddie to buy.The index did not rise as rapidly as some others did during the boom, but it continued to go up for nearly a year after a major competitor, the Case-Shiller 20-city composite, peaked. That index has not recovered as rapidly as the housing finance agency index since the recession ended.According to the agency index, the best-performing region since 2007 has been the one called West South Central by the Census Bureau, comprising the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. Home prices there are now 14.6 percent higher than they were in the summer of 2007. That is also the section that has had the strongest economic growth during the period, in large part because it benefited from the boom in energy production. At the end of 2013 \u2014 the latest regional data available \u2014 the real gross domestic product of that group of states was 18.6 percent larger than it had been in mid-2007. That is more than twice the growth of the entire country during the period.The mining industry, which includes oil and gas wells, accounts for about 10 percent of the economy in that region but produced 20 percent of the growth over the period. In the West North Central area \u2014 Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 home prices are 1.6 percent higher than they were in mid-2007. That area\u2019s G.D.P. is up 11.8 percent, in significant part because of a surge in shale gas production in part of the region, and its population has also been rising. North Dakota, the center of the oil boom, has experienced both a surging population as people move in and the fastest economic growth of any state.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m an illusionist and an escape artist. Houdini is my hero. When I started flying to give performances I thought it was really exciting. That lasted for about 30 flights. Now, flying is so routine I don\u2019t even think about it much. It\u2019s like brushing my teeth.The first really long flight I ever took was when I was 18 years old. I decided to study the craft of magic and went to Las Vegas to do that. I got interested in magic when I was a very young boy in Trento, Italy, and saw my mom, who is a serious person, break into a big smile when she saw a street magician. He was part of a small circus that came to town, and I was fascinated by the smells and colors. My mom, however, was absolutely captivated by the magician, and that\u2019s when I thought making people smile with magic was a pretty good way to make a living. And so far, I\u2019m loving every minute of it.I remember dreaming about being able to sit in business class since I was always in coach. Many years ago I was sitting in the first row of economy class, just behind the business class section. I thought the comfortable seats in business class were just incredible.To pass the time, I started practicing with cards. An elegant lady who was sitting just in front of me in business class turned her head in my direction and started to watch what I was doing. I really thought she was annoyed with the noise I was making shuffling my cards.At some point she approached me and I absolutely thought she was going to ask me to stop. Instead, she asked me if I was a magician. When I said yes, she told me how much she enjoyed magic and asked me to give her a demonstration. She actually invited me to sit in the empty seat right next to her in that business class section.After a while I started to catch the attention of other passengers seated around us. Not only did my dream of sitting in business class come true that day, but by the time we arrived at our destination, I had landed some private gigs and made new friends, too. And, yes, those business class seats were as comfortable as I imagined. I\u2019ll be dreaming about those comfortable seats again next month when I start flying a lot on tiny commuter planes, twice a week or more, for \u201cThe Illusionists,\u201d which is a traveling stage show.The only time I almost got into some trouble was at the Singapore Changi Airport. I didn\u2019t know that handcuffs were prohibited in Singapore and unfortunately I had decided to pack some in my luggage. When I was going through customs, the security officials took one look at the handcuffs and one look at me, and I thought I was going to be arrested or fined or thrown out.I had to explain that I was an escape artist and that the handcuffs were part of my act. Luckily, the series of performances I was doing in Singapore were being heavily promoted with billboards and ads on buses.The security people were quite nice once all was sorted out, but they didn\u2019t let me keep my handcuffs. Instead, an officer came to the show each night with my handcuffs, and after I used them in the performance, he took them back for safekeeping, which was fine by me.As told to Joan Raymond.

{"Headline": "2 Economic Reports Point to Strengthening 3rd Quarter", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 American manufacturing activity hit its highest point in nearly three and a half years last month and construction spending rebounded strongly in July, providing further signs that the economy entered the third quarter on strong footing.The upbeat data, released on Tuesday, added to reports on employment and housing that have suggested growth remains sturdy, despite a slowdown in consumer spending in recent months.\u201cThings continue to fall into place for our view that growth should accelerate in the year\u2019s back half,\u201d said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG, an institutional brokerage firm.The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 59 last month, the highest reading since March 2011, from 57.1 in July.A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected a pullback to 56.8. August\u2019s reading was lifted by a surge in a gauge of new orders, which touched its highest level 10 years. Order backlogs and new export orders also rose.American manufacturers fared better in August than factories in Europe and Asia, which have been hurt more by escalating tensions between Ukraine and Russia and a patchy recovery in China.The new-orders index correlates closely with quarterly changes in gross domestic product. Carl Riccadonna, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank, said the current level of new orders had historically been consistent with an annualized G.D.P. growth pace of 4.4 percent.Manufacturers were mostly upbeat in August, with business conditions described as improving, good, strong and robust. The bullish manufacturing picture was corroborated by another factory survey. The financial data firm Markit said its manufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 57.9, the highest level since April 2010, from 55.8 in July.The bright growth picture was underscored by a report from the Commerce Department that showed construction spending increased 1.8 percent in July to its highest point in five and a half years. This was the largest monthly gain since May 2012.In addition, construction outlays for May and June were revised up, which left some economists expecting the government to raise its second-quarter G.D.P. estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 4.4 percent rate later this month.Third-quarter growth estimates range as high as a 3.5 percent pace, and some economists say the run of relatively strong economic data, if sustained, could prompt an early interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve.\u201cWe think that there will be a shift in forward guidance at the September policy meeting to a more neutral posture that would allow for a rate hike early in 2015,\u201d said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics.Construction spending in July was buoyed by a 3.4 percent increase in outlays for state and local government projects. That offset a 1.1 percent drop in spending by the federal government.Private construction advanced 1.4 percent to its highest level since November 2008. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Eye on 2016, Christie Resists Climate Change Plan ", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey explores a 2016 presidential campaign, he is under growing pressure from his State Legislature to rejoin a regional cap-and-trade program that would limit New Jersey\u2019s carbon emissions \u2014 and likely hurt his chances for the Republican nomination.Mr. Christie, who withdrew from the program in 2011 as he first considered running for president in 2012, remains adamant that New Jersey not participate in the nine-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, even though the majority of state legislators say it would be in New Jersey\u2019s economic and legal interests. Business groups remain divided on the plan. \u201cNo, I would not think of rejoining it,\u201d Mr. Christie told reporters during a recent trip to Mexico. \u201cI think it\u2019s a completely useless plan.\u201dThe New Jersey Superior Court ruled this year that Mr. Christie failed to follow proper legal procedure when he withdrew his state from the program because his administration did not hold public hearings on the move. To comply with the law, Mr. Christie\u2019s administration held a public hearing last month, but has made it clear that the governor still has no plans to rejoin the program. The New Jersey Legislature has voted twice to rejoin, but Mr. Christie vetoed both bills.Some political analysts say Mr. Christie\u2019s motive in staying out of the plan is to placate powerful conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity, which are highly influential in Republican primaries and consider cap-and-trade programs to be energy taxes that hurt business and eliminate jobs. Mr. Christie will be the main speaker at an Americans for Prosperity donor meeting in New York on Friday.\u201cThis is one of those issues where Christie decided he\u2019s going to take a firm position that resonates with the G.O.P. and stick with it,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, N.J. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the Legislature wants, it doesn\u2019t matter what New Jersey voters want, cap-and-trade is anathema to the base of the Republican Party.\u201dMr. Christie says he is acting for the benefit of his state and that he withdrew because the plan was inefficient and unfair to New Jersey, since other regional states like Pennsylvania did not take part in it. Environmentalists note that Mr. Christie has pledged to ban coal-fired power plants \u2014 the chief source of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming \u2014 from New Jersey. In 2011, Mr. Christie also acknowledged the human role in climate change: \u201cWhen you have over 90 percent of the world\u2019s scientists who have studied this, stating that climate change is occurring and that humans play a contributing role, it\u2019s time to defer to the experts.\u201dSince then, however, Mr. Christie has avoided speaking publicly about climate science.New Jersey became a founding member of the regional plan in 2005 under Gov. Richard Codey, a Democrat. The program, which created a regional cap on carbon emissions and required power plants to buy pollution permits from the states, slightly raised electricity rates in the region. But the overall economies of the participating states improved and their carbon pollution declined, according to a 2011 study by The Analysis Group, a Boston consulting firm.In New Jersey, the study found that electricity bills increased less than one percent as the state collected $118 million in fees for pollution permits purchased by power plants.The pressure on Mr. Christie to rejoin the program intensified in June, when President Obama proposed an Environmental Protection Agency regulation that would require all states to create climate-change plans. For states under the regional plan that once included New Jersey, complying will largely mean operating under the existing cap-and-trade system. Energy policy experts as well as some of Mr. Christie\u2019s fellow state Republicans \u2014 including his mentor, Thomas Kean, a former New Jersey governor \u2014 say the most efficient way for New Jersey to comply with the rule would be to rejoin the program. \u201cI disagreed with the decision when he did it,\u201d Mr. Kean said in an interview. \u201cI wish we\u2019d stayed in the program.\u201dState Senator Kip Bateman, a Republican who voted to rejoin the plan, said it was the best option available to the state. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we\u2019re better off being in it than not being in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is, groups such as Americans for Prosperity are adamantly opposed to it. They have scared a lot of Republicans away from it.\u201dAmericans for Prosperity, which receives funding from the libertarian billionaires Charles G. and David H. Koch, spent heavily in the 2010, 2012 and 2014 elections to oppose candidates who supported cap-and-trade. The group took aim at Republican candidates in primary races who signaled that they would back climate-change policy, and it is expected to play a key role in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. \u201cWe were exceedingly pleased that the governor got New Jersey out of the R.G.G.I. boondoggle,\u201d said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, referring to the regional plan. \u201cIt\u2019s something that A.F.P. in New Jersey worked hard on, and the governor listened, and we applauded him pulling out and applaud him for refusing to go back in.\u201d Mr. Phillips said the move would be sure to help Mr. Christie\u2019s efforts in the Republican primaries, should he run.Although many Republican politicians question the established science that burning fossil fuels warms the planet, support in New Jersey for climate-change policies increased after Hurricane Sandy battered the Northeast in 2012. Experts say no single storm can be directly attributed to climate change, but a federal study released in May, the National Climate Assessment, concluded that climate change is making the Northeast more vulnerable to deluges, rising sea levels and higher storm surges. Last year a Stanford University poll found that 80 percent of New Jersey adults think the government should take action to limit greenhouse gases from industry.Even after withdrawing from the program, New Jersey customers still have slightly higher electricity bills because the state is part of a wider regional electricity market, said Susan Tierney, an author of the Analysis Group report and a former top Energy Department official in the Clinton administration. Ms. Tierney also noted that the state no longer enjoyed the revenue flow from companies paying for pollution permits. \u201cIt would be a very economically efficient thing for New Jersey to rejoin,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could get more bang for their buck and have money to circulate back into the economy.\u201dNew Jersey\u2019s largest electric utility, Public Service Enterprise Group, supported the state\u2019s participation in the program and has pushed to take the policy national. Michael Jennings, a company spokesman, wrote in an email that the utility is \u201cadvocating that the E.P.A. allow states like New Jersey the flexibility to pursue a comprehensive approach to reduce greenhouse gases.\u201d But he did not directly address questions about Mr. Christie\u2019s refusal to join the program.In the view of Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist, the utility is remaining silent so as not to antagonize the governor. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned about getting ahead of where Christie is,\u201d said. \u201cThey\u2019re a New Jersey company. They have to get along with the administration.\u201dSome New Jersey businesses agree with Mr. Christie. \u201cWe supported the governor\u2019s position to withdraw,\u201d said David Brogan, vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. \u201cIt was a flawed program. We already pay some of the highest rates for energy in the nation.\u201dIf New Jersey does not rejoin, the state will still be required to come up with a carbon reduction plan under Mr. Obama\u2019s proposed rule, which requires New Jersey to cut its carbon pollution by 42 percent by 2030. Last week Mr. Christie told reporters that he did not believe new policies would be required, given his pledge to ban coal plants. \u201cSo I think New Jersey is very well positioned without R.G.G.I. and our people don\u2019t need another tax on their utility bills to make some environmentalists feel good on a program that is absolutely worthless in my view.\u201dAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized and mistated the title of Patrick Murray. He is a political analyst and director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. He is neither a critic of Mr. Christie nor a professor of political science at the university.Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Texas Group Uses Health Care Issue to Get Hispanics to the Polls", "Date": "2014-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Texas Tribune\u201cWhat are some of the biggest concerns you have in your life right now?\u201d Mr. Ornelas asked in Spanish. Health care, Mr. Rodriguez replied, and whether his family could afford it. The conversation was familiar for Mr. Ornelas, who goes door to door to talk to residents as part of efforts by the Texas Organizing Project to increase voter participation among minorities. The group\u2019s field organizing team often meets minority voters who list health care as a top concern, and it is looking to leverage that issue to get more Hispanic voters to the polls in November.Since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2009, Republican leaders in Texas have opposed expanding Medicaid to cover poor, uninsured adults, saying the system is broken and should be overhauled before it is expanded.The issue of Medicaid expansion resonates strongly with Hispanics, who make up a large portion of the state\u2019s uninsured population. In Harris, Dallas and Bexar Counties \u2014 three of the state\u2019s most populous counties \u2014 the Texas Organizing Project is working to use Hispanic support of affordable health care to spur a movement that could change the state\u2019s electoral tide. The group\u2019s leaders said they believed their efforts, which include 200 canvassers and phone bankers, will be successful because residents are receptive to candidates who support the federal health law regardless of political affiliation.\u201cThese aren\u2019t people who are worried about turning Texas blue,\u201d said Ginny Goldman, executive director of the Texas Organizing Project. \u201cNot only will we support Republicans who are on our side of the issues, but we\u2019ll take on Democrats who are not.\u201dThe group has endorsed Democratic candidates who are supportive of the health care law. For their part, Republicans are prioritizing the economy and jobs \u2014 issues on which they say their party holds the upper hand \u2014 to reach Hispanic voters. They point to polling data indicating that job security and the economy resonate with Hispanic voters.\u201cHealth care is a concern among all Texans \u2014 not just Hispanics,\u201d said David Zapata, Hispanic engagement director for the Republican Party of Texas. \u201cHowever, what we\u2019re seeing is that jobs and the economy continue to dominate voters\u2019 concerns.\u201dAs the state\u2019s Hispanic population continues to grow, both major political parties are honing their messages to reach this swelling voting bloc. Although fewer than a third of eligible voters in Texas are Hispanic, they are expected to make up a plurality of the state\u2019s population by 2020, from 38 percent of the state\u2019s population now. Mr. Zapata said conservatives who oppose the federal health law stand to gain from the party\u2019s outreach to Hispanic voters by focusing on the economy. Texas Republicans can promote the \u201ceconomic success our state has experienced\u201d under their leadership, he said.Jim Henson, Texas Tribune pollster and director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, said Hispanics overwhelmingly support almost all of the major provisions of the federal health law. (U.T.-Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.) But the issue ranks far behind unemployment and the economy as the top problem facing the state.Mr. Henson said that while health care was not expected to be a driving force among registered Hispanic voters, those with lower incomes could be more sensitive to health care costs and efforts to mobilize on that issue.\u201cWhat we see is a pattern of support among Hispanics for much better health care delivery,\u201d Mr. Henson said. \u201cAnd, when necessary, for government to help improve that delivery.\u201dHispanic voters also disapprove of the fines that most Texans will face if they do not buy health insurance under the federal law, and polling data shows they have been critical of its fumbled rollout. Mr. Zapata said Hispanic voters could also agree with Republicans on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cnegative consequences,\u201d which include cases in which individuals have lost their doctors under new health care plans and high premiums they are left to pay for health coverage.Political analysts are at odds on whether health care could be a driving issue among Hispanics whose voter turnout in Texas \u2014 much like the general population \u2014 has been dismal. Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville, said Republicans would eventually have to compromise on health care issues with large support among Hispanics, like Medicaid expansion, if they want to be successful in coming elections in which Hispanics will carry increased electoral weight.Matt Mackowiak, a conservative political consultant, said the health care debate could work for organizing groups, like the Texas Organizing Project, looking to \u201ctarget certain constituencies very narrowly\u201d to increase voter turnout. But he quickly added that Democrats looking to use the issue to their advantage are facing a losing proposition.\u201cThe question is, \u2018Can Democrats motivate voters narrowly on the issue of health care?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Mackowiak said. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if health care as an issue is a net plus for Democrats in 2014, I think the answer is no.\u201dThe organizing project\u2019s goal for the year is to deliver more than 100,000 new minority voters and reach thousands of minorities who are registered to vote but do not turn out. There is a large area for improvement in Hispanic voter turnout in Texas. In 2012, only 39 percent of Hispanics eligible to vote in Texas cast a ballot in the presidential election. In that same election, 61 percent of eligible Anglo Texans voted.The group\u2019s leaders believe those voters could be motivated to head to the polls when they realize the polarity of positions on government-subsidized health care in the current election cycle.They also argue that Hispanics\u2019 likelihood of being uninsured could favor their mobilization efforts as they organize around ways to make health care more affordable in a state where almost one out of every four residents is uninsured.\u201cWhen the numbers are on your side, this is a Latino problem,\u201d said Ms. Goldman, the executive director of the Texas Organizing Project, speaking about the large number of Hispanics in the state that are uninsured. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our numbers, and we\u2019re going to leverage them.\u201daura@texastribune.org This article was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

{"Headline": "Larry Ellison Bought an Island in Hawaii. Now What?", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHenry Jolicoeur is a retired French Canadian hypnotherapist and a glass-products importer who enjoys making very low-budget documentary films. In the summer of 2012, Jolicoeur read that Larry Ellison, a founder of the Silicon Valley giant Oracle and the fifth-richest man in the world, had bought 97 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lanai \u2014 not a 97 percent stake in some kind of company, but 97 percent of the physical place. Jolicoeur was curious, so he booked a flight and packed his camera.Jolicoeur knew a little about Lanai, having lived in Hawaii in the \u201990s. It is among the smallest and least trafficked of Hawaiian islands \u2014 a quiet, spectacular place where Cook Island pine trees vault up everywhere, like spires or giant peacock feathers \u2014 and can feel like a charming wormhole to an earlier era. There is only one town, Lanai City, where virtually all of the island\u2019s 3,200 residents live. Ellison now owned a third of all their houses and apartments; the island\u2019s two Four Seasons-run hotels; the central commons at the heart of Lanai City, called Dole Park, and all the buildings around it; the town swimming pool; the community center; the theater; a grocery store; two golf courses; a wastewater treatment plant; the water company; and a cemetery. In a single sweeping real estate deal, reported to cost $300 million, he had acquired 87,000 of the island\u2019s 90,000 acres. And he would subsequently buy an airline that connects Lanai to Honolulu as well. On all of Lanai, I heard of only a handful of businesses \u2014 the gas station, the rental-car company, two banks, a credit union and a cafe called Coffee Works \u2014 that are neither owned by Ellison nor pay him rent.Jolicoeur spent about three weeks strolling around the island, asking locals to hold his ungainly, foam-sheathed microphone and tell the camera how they felt about the big acquisition. Everyone seemed to feel very, very good. \u201cI want to thank Mr. Ellison,\u201d one fishing-boat captain says. \u201cHe\u2019s got a vision, and he\u2019s taking care of us over here on Lanai.\u201d A pack of landscapers, shown assiduously raking dirt, say things like: \u201cThank you for work, Mr. Ellison! Thank you very much!\u201d The owner of a salon: \u201cI just want to take this time to thank Mr. Ellison for the unbelievable, incredible takeover of Lanai.\u201d Inside the island\u2019s Catholic church, a priest in a purple robe, surrounded by children, says: \u201cHeavenly father. . . . We ask for your blessings for Mr. Ellison, particularly, and those who work with him, that all the good plans and intentions that he has for Lanai be fruitful.\u201d Elsewhere, a woman shouts a little breathlessly: \u201cMr. Ellison! Thank you for being here! We love you! I\u2019ve never met you before and really would like to, and I can imagine that you will do awesome wonders for this place!\u201dJolicoeur is still working on his film but has posted some footage on YouTube in the meantime. From time to time, he makes an appearance himself, pontificating about the bewildering new relationship between Ellison and everyone else. Introducing one segment, Jolicoeur announces, \u201cThe great philosopher Plato said, 2,500 years ago, that rulers of man must be philosophers.\u201d A title card reads, \u201cORACLE = A person who delivers authoritative, wise or highly regarded and influential pronouncements.\u201dAt a public meeting on Lanai last year, an Ellison representative explained that his boss wasn\u2019t drawn to the island by the potential for profits but by the potential for a great accomplishment \u2014 the satisfaction one day of having made the place work. For Ellison, it seemed, Lanai was less like an investment than like a classic car, up on blocks in the middle of the Pacific, that he had become obsessed with restoring. He wants to transform it into a premier tourist destination and what he has called \u201cthe first economically viable, 100 percent green community\u201d: an innovative, self-sufficient dreamscape of renewable energy, electric cars and sustainable agriculture.Ellison has explained that Lanai feels to him like \u201cthis really cool 21st-century engineering project\u201d \u2014 and so far, his approach, which seems steeped in the ethos of Silicon Valley, has boiled down to rooting out the many inefficiencies of daily life on Lanai and replacing them with a single, elegantly designed system. It\u2019s the sort of sweeping challenge that engineering types get giddy over: a full-scale model. Of course, there are actual people living inside Ellison\u2019s engineering project \u2014 a community being hit by an unimaginable wave of wealth. But unlike all the more familiar versions of that story, Lanai isn\u2019t being remade by some vague socioeconomic energy you can only gesture at with words like \u201ctechies\u201d or \u201chipsters\u201d or \u201cWall Street\u201d but by one guy, whose name everyone knows, in a room somewhere, whiteboarding out the whole project.Jolicoeur seemed to understand the precariousness that power imbalance created: the staggering responsibility, the incomprehensible control. At one point, standing on a beach, he announces theatrically to the camera, \u201cThe Bible says, \u2018Where there is no vision, people perish.\u2019 \u201d Eventually he visits the island\u2019s animal-rescue center, where a young employee explains that because there are no natural predators on Lanai, the feral-cat population just explodes. Right now, she tells him, the shelter is housing 380 cats.From behind the camera, Jolicoeur hollers: \u201cSo basically, these are 380 cats of Mr. Ellison\u2019s?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re his cats!\u201d the woman says, laughing and laughing.Next we see a half-dozen cats, occupying different areas of a multitiered bungalow-style dollhouse for cats, licking themselves and lapping water and napping. More cats appear as Jolicoeur enters the shot, holding his long microphone, extending his free hand to stroke whichever cat looks most cooperative. His eyes are bright. He looks thrilled with his wonderful discovery: He has reached an unanticipated edge of the island\u2019s new reality.Clasping an animal with a meaty palm, he turns back to the camera and says, \u201cMr. Ellison, do you know that you have, now, 380 cats?\u201dHawaiians lived happily on Lanai for about 800 years. Then the Mormons started arriving, eventually led in 1861 by Walter Murray Gibson, who, in retrospect, may have been only a megalomaniac con man masquerading as a Mormon. An article published by the Hawaiian Historical Society in 1960 describes Gibson as \u201cambitious and romantic and interested in ruling a tropical government.\u201d Gibson spent his early years tramping through Southeast Asia, stoking a native revolt against the Dutch in the hope of commandeering one. He converted to Mormonism only one year before showing up on Lanai. After building a Mormon colony in the island\u2019s interior, Gibson began buying land on Lanai until he controlled nearly the entire island. He paid for the land with the church\u2019s money but put the titles in his own name. When the Mormons figured this out, they excommunicated him.Gibson retained the land, though. By the time he died in 1888, it had passed to his daughter, then through a few other owners as a single holding. None of them could figure out what to do with Lanai. They tried ranching sheep. They tried sugar cane. One crop that grew well was pineapples, and this caught the attention of James Drummond Dole, a Harvard grad with a fledgling pineapple company on Oahu.In 1922, Dole paid $1.1 million for the land Gibson and his successors had accumulated. Just like that, The New York Times reported, \u201can entire island, Lanai, has been taken over by a pineapple company.\u201d Dole plowed the interior into fields, built a harbor and roads and laid out an idyllic town near the center of Lanai \u2014 a grid of plantation-style cottages, with Dole Park in the middle \u2014 to house his mostly Japanese and Filipino workers. By 1930, Lanai City had 3,000 residents, nearly all of them Dole employees, and the island was exporting 65,000 tons of pineapples a year. The company sent landscaping crews to weed and mow workers\u2019 lawns. It ran an athletics program and built a golf course. Life on Lanai was good; Dole insisted it should be. His motto was: \u201cHave happy workers, grow better pineapples.\u201dFor 70 years, Lanai was among the world\u2019s largest pineapple plantations. Then in 1992, the island harvested its last crop. Overseas production had driven down prices, and Lanai was left behind. By that point, the island had changed hands two more times. It was now controlled by the California billionaire David Murdock, who acquired the company Castle & Cooke, which took over Dole Foods\u2019 holdings on Lanai in the \u201960s. Murdock was a somewhat imperial presence on Lanai. He referred to residents as his \u201cchildren.\u201dAs the pineapple era wound down, Murdock pivoted Lanai\u2019s economy toward tourism. He built two resorts \u2014 the first developments on the island besides Lanai City and still the only major ones \u2014 and eventually contracted the Four Seasons to run them. Pineapple pickers were retrained as hotel staff and landscapers. Lanai was still a company town; the company just did something different now.The transition did not go well. Murdock had to steadily infuse the island with money \u2014 as much as $20 million or $30 million a year, he\u2019d later report. By the mid-2000s, he started cutting back. He laid off large numbers of workers and began abandoning some of his quasi-governmental responsibilities as the island\u2019s majority landowner. Buildings fell into disrepair. The Chamber of Commerce disbanded. As one resident put it, \u201cEconomically, there was real potential that we might dry up and blow away.\u201dEventually, Murdock proposed a way forward: He would build an array of 45-story wind turbines on 20 square miles of the island and sell the electricity they produced to Oahu. The idea was controversial. It would be a mammoth development on an insistently small-scale island. Lanai had been settled by disparate immigrants who had to figure out how to get along, and that history, locals told me, keeps people from dwelling on divisions and differences. (\u201cThat\u2019s what makes the place so special,\u201d one woman explained. \u201cWe still have aloha together.\u201d) But the long fight over what the locals called Big Wind was brutal and divisive. Family members stopped talking to one another. There were protests in the street. Many people who supported the wind turbines saw the protesters as reckless idealists; they were handcuffing the man the community relied on and driving the island into the ground. Murdock seemed to feel the same way. By the summer of 2011, he confessed to the editor of the island\u2019s newspaper that Lanai had been \u201cthe poorest financial investment I\u2019ve made in my entire life.\u201d He had only so many options. One was to \u201cclose it all down and leave.\u201d Instead, he put Lanai up for sale.The island rippled with anxiety. People worried that Murdock might sell off parts of Lanai to multiple owners, tossing the community into some uncharted, joint-custody arrangement. Or that he\u2019d sell to a big resort developer who would shatter the character of the place. \u201cOh, my God, he could sell to a Russian oligarch,\u201d one woman remembered thinking. Another said, \u201cWe were praying it wasn\u2019t some sheikh!\u201d It wasn\u2019t some sheikh. It was Larry Ellison.Lanai has been ruled by the god of nightmares, a dubious Mormon missionary, a pineapple baron, a California billionaire and, now, a tech-industry magnate.It was easy to be hopeful, and the civil war over Big Wind had left people scarred and exhausted with fighting. Now Ellison wanted to revive the island, and he had the money to fund his dreams until they came true. But was he a utopian businessman like Dole? Or a slippery autocrat like Gibson? Was he the nightmare god \u2014 or the renegade chief who finally came to vanquish him?One morning, nearly two years later, at the Blue Ginger Cafe, I asked Pat Reilly, a 74-year-old regular with a thin white mustache and oversize glasses who has lived on Lanai for more than 30 years, how he felt when he heard that Ellison bought the island. Reilly reached over his coffee mug and drew a big, slow question mark in the air, then jabbed his index finger at me to dot the question mark, hard.\u201cAnd it\u2019s still that way,\u201d he said.Ellison\u2019s vision for the island was first delivered, by proxy, early last year, at a meeting of the island\u2019s Community Plan Advisory Committee. These meetings were part of a county-government process to update the island\u2019s comprehensive planning document, which dictates everything from zoning and land use to cultural preservation. Butch Gima, a Lanai native and social worker who was chairman of the committee, told me that Ellison\u2019s takeover put them in a tricky position. On one hand, it allowed for greater ambition. (\u201cA new world has opened up,\u201d one member told the committee.) But it also felt strange to chart a course for an island that someone else had taken control of. Even the committee\u2019s economic research and growth projections might now be obsolete, depending on what Ellison wanted to do. And so they invited Pulama\u2019s new chief operating officer, Kurt Matsumoto, to brief them.Matsumoto was hired to oversee operations on Lanai a couple of months earlier. He had a background in running large resorts, but he was also a \u201cLanai Boy,\u201d as people kept putting it to me \u2014 he grew up on the island. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t come off as being real slick,\u201d Gima told me. (As kids, Gima and Matsumoto were in Boy Scouts together.) His appointment was encouraging; the relationship between the island and its new owner had been brought down to a more human scale.Matsumoto appeared before the committee in mid-January \u2014 a middle-management Moses coming down the mountain with an important PowerPoint. He prefaced his presentation by explaining that Ellison didn\u2019t have any firm plans yet, only \u201cintentions.\u201d Then he put up his first slide.That night, and in other meetings, Matsumoto unveiled a startlingly ambitious vision for the island. He explained that Ellison aimed to build a third resort, this time on the uninhabited southwestern coast, as well as a complex of private estates \u2014 maybe 50 of them, each five or more acres. Ellison intended to expand Lanai\u2019s airport, adding a bigger runway to accommodate direct flights from the mainland for the first time. The limiting factor on Lanai has always been water, but Ellison would build a state-of-the-art desalination plant to produce more fresh water. Ellison would expand Lanai City; build an \u201cenergy park,\u201d where electricity produced with solar panels or photosynthesizing algae would be fed into a new smart grid; and bring commercial agriculture back to the island, in fields outfitted with sensors to control fertilization and irrigation, so that Lanai could begin to feed itself and even export products, rather than depend on weekly food barges from Oahu. Eventually Matsumoto would tell The Wall Street Journal that Ellison hoped to see the island\u2019s population double to about 6,000. Elsewhere, there was talk of organic wineries and flower farms and an innovative aquaponics-and-hydroponics operation that would raise fish and fruits and vegetables in a sustainable symphony of positive feedback loops. Better health care. A bowling alley. An institute for the study of sustainability. A 22-acre film studio. A top-flight, residential tennis academy for competitive youth.Matsumoto\u2019s tone at that first meeting was low-key, humble and inclusive. He used words like \u201crespect\u201d and \u201cempower,\u201d \u201csharing\u201d and \u201cinvesting.\u201d Then, eventually, he hit his last slide: \u201cMahalo\u201d \u2014 Hawaiian for \u201cThank you\u201d \u2014 and was done.\u201cIt was hard to formulate any thought-out questions,\u201d Gima recalled about the presentation. \u201cI think people just went, \u2018Whoa.\u2019 \u201dAfter several years of terrible unemployment, people on Lanai were back to work. Within four months of Ellison\u2019s purchase, unemployment shot down to 1.2 percent. There were new faces everywhere, new luxury cars on the road and lines of new Mercedes vans and Nissan Leafs parked in the company\u2019s lot near the center of town. Pulama had started a summer program for kids and another program to help high-school students pursue college scholarships, screened \u201cFrozen\u201d in the park and held an \u201canimal-care day\u201d so people could get their cats dewormed free. They\u2019d opened a Nobu restaurant at one hotel. I saw posters advertising free water-aerobics classes at the new community pool. There were ukulele lessons and Pilates. A month earlier, at an Oracle event in Las Vegas to unveil the company\u2019s new cloud software, someone asked Ellison about Lanai, and he pointed out that \u201cfor the first time, Lanai has a football field where the high school can have home games.\u201d He also noted, \u201cWe\u2019re empowering the locals to start their own businesses,\u201d whether it\u2019s \u201cin agriculture or a juice bar in Lanai City.\u201dThe juice bar occupies a cabana-like building at one corner of Dole Park and is owned and operated by Tammy Ringbauer, an effusive woman with bright flowers tattooed up her right arm. Ringbauer is deep into juicing \u2014 I never saw anyone juice a turmeric root before \u2014 and charges 12 bucks for a large.Ringbauer told me she moved to Lanai from Maui just weeks before the change in ownership, and this storefront caught her eye immediately. It was the only vacant commercial space in Lanai City, though she had heard that, for some reason, Pulama Lanai kept rejecting entrepreneurs who wanted to lease it. (Pulama says that it did not turn down any previous applicants.)When I asked Ringbauer why the company finally gave the lease to her, she hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of the changes that are happening, there\u2019s sort of a model we\u2019re trying to move in the direction of. And I think certain businesses may not fit into that model.\u201d She thought her vision was aligned with Pulama\u2019s: She was using locally grown, organic produce and compostable to-go cups. \u201cI\u2019m explaining the benefits of juicing, I\u2019m educating,\u201d she said. Later, I heard that Ellison himself had come in for a juice a couple of times, sitting on a stool and sipping away like a regular person.I couldn\u2019t find any other small businesses that had started up on Lanai since Ellison\u2019s purchase. But there were stories about entrepreneurs, like the owners of the island\u2019s wood shop, who had approached Pulama for leases or partnerships only to be offered a job with the company instead \u2014 which was good but allowed Pulama to preserve its hold on the economy. Ringbauer had no complaints. \u201cIf we all work together,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to thrive.\u201d The wooden sign hanging behind her register read: \u201cNo whining. No complaining. No frowning. Only hugs, smiles and warm feelings are allowed. Thank you.\u201dAnother obstacle: Roughly half of the adults on the island are employed by Pulama Lanai or its hotels, and nearly everyone else, it seems, has a sister or uncle who is \u2014 or else relies on the company indirectly for a livelihood or lives in a house that Pulama Lanai owns. Lots of people told me that they were instructed not to talk to reporters or that they just didn\u2019t want to risk upsetting the company. One young man delivered a long, seemingly rehearsed preamble, insisting that he absolutely had to remain anonymous and that any opinions he expressed were his alone and did not reflect the views of either Pulama Lanai or his employer, which did business with Pulama and which I also shouldn\u2019t name. I expected something inflammatory, but his opinion was this: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complainers \u2014 some people aren\u2019t happy \u2014 but they don\u2019t realize how much they have. It\u2019s just awesome!\u201dWell, yes and no. As it turns out, my perception of Pulama Lanai \u2014 as a vast, mostly incommunicative force \u2014 was pretty close to that of many residents I was meeting. They didn\u2019t necessarily understand how that force operated either, but they saw its handiwork everywhere. And some of it didn\u2019t feel awesome at all.For starters, Pulama had inadvertently intensified a housing shortage on Lanai. There was so much work that contractors had to be shuttled in daily or weekly from other islands or relocated. A few off-island construction companies bought up housing in Lanai City in anticipation of winning contracts from Pulama, and the island\u2019s independent landlords found they could demand higher rents from the remaining workers. Though the company was busily fixing up cottages to rent out, many displaced locals wound up on Pulama\u2019s indeterminably long waiting list for housing, which they believed Pulama employees were bypassing. The process didn\u2019t feel transparent or fair, and Pulama was resisting calls for a town-hall meeting about the issue. (Later, I attended one of the company\u2019s informational meetings about renovations at the Four Seasons \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re adding two new teppanyaki stations,\u201d a Pulama representative explained \u2014 and watched residents try to derail its narrow agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s something you folks never even anticipated!\u201d one older man said. He was leaning on his walker, raising his voice. \u201cYou took all the housing! It all went poof!\u201d)A 27-year-old Lanai native named Zane de la Cruz told me that he was \u201cstarting to think that communication is actually worse\u201d than under the previous owner, \u201cbecause there\u2019s a false sense of good communication.\u201d He elaborated: \u201cThey give out a lot worthless information. They give you buzzwords.\u201d At one meeting, a Pulama executive, Arlan Chun, was asked how much residents would pay for water from the new desalination plant and how Ellison expected to recoup his costs. Chun suggested that Ellison wasn\u2019t concerned with costs. \u201cThe mandate we have is to move the island forward,\u201d he said.De la Cruz told me: \u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s a fun and fancy thing to say, but someone is going to need to pay for this. And if Larry Ellison decides, five years from now, that he doesn\u2019t want to play this game anymore, we\u2019ll be paying for it then.\u201d John Ornellas, chairman of the island\u2019s planning commission, said he was struggling to get a straight answer about what would happen if Ellison dies. (\u201cHe does do a lot adventurous things,\u201d Ornellas noted; for example, there\u2019s a rumor \u2014 the truth of which remains murky \u2014 that Ellison once flew a fighter jet under the Golden Gate Bridge.) And Diana Shaw, who directs the Lanai Community Health Center, one of two medical providers on the island, said that Pulama ignored her requests for an introductory meeting for months. \u201cThey kept talking publicly about the health care system and how they were going to improve it and enhance it and change it,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBut nobody came and talked to us. We are the health care system \u2014 at least 50 percent of it.\u201d Finally Pulama reps sat down with her. The meeting didn\u2019t go well. Shaw described one executive as \u201cthe master of spin.\u201dAt a small gathering one night, over pizza and beer, a retired school principal, Pierce Myers, explained it to me this way: \u201cThe hope is real. The potential is fantastic.\u201d And yet lots of residents can\u2019t help seeing everything Ellison does through a scrim of \u201csuspicion and uncertainty.\u201d He went on: \u201cThis place was developed on the backs of humble people; people who cared for each other. When you live on an island, you can\u2019t afford to make enemies. A compassion grows from that. Now it feels like everything\u2019s being driven from outside by some force that is not part of that tradition.\u201dEventually the man sitting next to Myers spoke up. \u201cAny changes are going to be uncomfortable, but the changes are happening so fast,\u201d he said quietly. His name was Anthony Kaauamo Pacheco. He is 29 and was born on Lanai but left to study filmmaking on Oahu. Two years ago, he came back to the island. He wanted to inspire would-be filmmakers there to tell their own stories; he even imagined drawing Hollywood productions to Lanai. But there wasn\u2019t an obvious way to start. For the last two years, he\u2019d been teaching film at the school, unpaid.That afternoon, as a critical exercise, Pacheco had shown his students a promotional video produced by Love Lanai, a new branding campaign that Pulama was using to pitch the island to affluent tourists. Love Lanai is the brainchild of a Southern Californian \u201capproachable luxury\u201d brand consultant named Audrey Cavenecia. (Cavenecia has previously worked as a personal \u201clife redesigner\u201d and developed a reality show for E!, \u201cThe Apology Concierge,\u201d which curates \u201chigh-end apologies\u201d \u2014 like for wealthy people who cheat on their wives.) The video showed swirling aerial footage of the island\u2019s beaches and cliffs, a man on a windy ridge getting down on one knee to propose and a woman on horseback rising from her saddle slightly, feeling free. It had been posted to YouTube with the caption: \u201cFor Love Lanai, compassionate luxury is more than just a phrase, it\u2019s an action of purpose,\u201d which doesn\u2019t really make sense.In an interview that Pachecho found online and showed to his students, Cavenecia explained that she created Love Lanai to tell the stories of everyday Lanaians as their lives, under Ellison, improved. It was the kind of work Pacheco had come home to encourage. But for a branding consultant to tell those stories, as promotional material for high-end tourists, felt a little exploitative. \u201cI\u2019m not a spectacle,\u201d he said.He seemed to be having trouble sorting out his feelings \u2014 deciding whether his skepticism was warranted or just reflexive. Most of the island was private property when Pacheco was growing up too, but Murdock left a smaller footprint, tending to focus mainly on his hotels. \u201cIt never felt like I was trespassing,\u201d Pacheco said. Now it did. He said he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to live on Lanai anymore.Then, two weeks later, in the middle of April, Pacheco\u2019s situation improved. Pulama Lanai funded his teaching position as part of its commitment to improve education. He had a way to support his family now and resources to start the idealistic work he\u2019d come back to Lanai to do. He\u2019d also signed a nondisclosure agreement with the company and couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore.The course, which is attached to the smaller of the two Four Seasons hotels and abuts Allen\u2019s neighborhood on the hillside above Lanai City, had been slated for renovation at the beginning of the year. Pulama ripped out the turf and irrigation systems, but little else happened after that. Finally in May, the Jack Nicklaus design-company employee who had been relocated with his family to Lanai to oversee the redesign was abruptly sent home. He told neighbors that the golf-course renovation had been put off until 2015 or 2016. By then, mosquitoes were breeding on the course. The ponds\u2019 stench blew through peoples\u2019 homes. \u201cIt smells like a sewer up here,\u201d Allen told me in early July when I called for an update.Allen owns a gift shop in town and looks a little like Meryl Streep when she smiles. When we met on her patio back in March, she was adamantly optimistic; she went on and on, telling me \u201cI feel like I\u2019m living in a utopia!\u201d and claiming to have inside information that Ellison was outfitting Lanai with 4G cellular service. \u201cNot even Honolulu has 4G!\u201d she said. (Actually it does.) Now she was distraught. It wasn\u2019t just the golf course; there were other signs of Pulama Lanai\u2019s incompetence, or maybe just its insensitivity \u2014 it was tough to tell which. \u201cI don\u2019t think Mr. Ellison\u2019s trying to hurt people,\u201d she told me on the phone, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he realizes what a delicate little ecosystem the economy is here. We were so zealous: \u2018Oh, my God, he\u2019s coming to save our island!\u2019 It just feels like everything\u2019s in limbo now. All of a sudden, there\u2019s a fear factor: \u2018What are we going to do if this thing falls apart?\u2019 \u201dI flew back to Lanai a few days later. A lot had gone subtly sideways since my first visit, as the company transitioned from the easy work of sprucing up the island to rolling out its reimagined version. A central problem seemed to be that Pulama underestimated the difficulties that came with building on Lanai, where materials and labor have to be brought in. In May, with work on the island consuming more and more resources, Philip Simon \u2014 an accountant, and president of another of Ellison\u2019s companies, Lawrence Investments \u2014 was called in to consult with Pulama executives. At public meetings, Pulama was now explaining that it had given up on the second airport runway and was also downshifting the $27 million makeover of the existing Four Seasons at Manele Bay too: The company would renovate only half the resort this year and was scrambling to finish in time for a large booking in October. (Around town, the event was rumored to be a giant party for Ellison\u2019s daughter, Megan.) There were now 360 contractors on the job, many of them living at the hotel and in half of the other Four Seasons as well. Just before I arrived, Ellison bought the small Hotel Lanai at the top of Dole Park \u2014 the last hotel on the island \u2014 and was filling it with workers every Monday through Friday, too. Ornellas, head of the Lanai Planning Commission, told me that lately the gist of his conversations with company executives was: \u201cThe infrastructure can\u2019t support their lofty goals.\u201dOn such a small island, every adjustment Pulama made to its plans had repercussions, and the strain of disenfranchisement I encountered in the spring was spreading, as more stories of the company\u2019s apparent carelessness or undependability surfaced. Late last year, for example, Pulama told the owners of Trilogy Excursions \u2014 a large family-owned business based in Maui that, among other things, runs diving tours for hotel guests on Lanai and whose employees hand out a free turkey and a bag of rice to every family on the island at Thanksgiving \u2014 that in October, the Four Seasons would begin running its own dive operation. Then this spring, Pulama recanted; they were delaying that plan. This was good news for Trilogy, except that several of its employees, presuming they\u2019d be out of work, had already taken other jobs, and the company was now short-staffed.It\u2019s possible that, internally, Ellison\u2019s management team had reasonable explanations for what was being experienced as aloofness and disarray. But down here, on Lanai, locals worried that the inscrutable engineer remaking their island was either turning away from his creation or \u2014 worse \u2014 incapable of manning all those knobs and switches as competently as they\u2019d believed. People\u2019s lives were entangled in each decision; all the instability was upsetting their sense of the future.\u201cPretty soon, it\u2019s not going to be the Lanaian way of living here anymore,\u201d Mike Lopez, Trilogy\u2019s director of operations, told me one afternoon. \u201cEverybody feels that now.\u201d Then, all of a sudden, he shot out: \u201cSee, this guy here!\u201d and gestured across the street, to a willowy man with a gray beard, in a ball cap and sunglasses, standing at the edge of Dole Park. It was a new face that Lopez kept noticing around, always alone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they put people in to observe the atmosphere or what,\u201d he said.I turned around. The man, who\u2019d paused next to a garbage can, quickly walked away. I\u2019m not really equipped to judge whether a stranger on Lanai looks sinister or not. But neither was Lopez anymore, and that was the point.The planned desalination plant, already in its first phase of construction near the Four Seasons at Manele Bay, was a linchpin in Ellison\u2019s vision; by converting up to 10 million gallons of salinated groundwater into fresh water a day, it would make more development and population growth possible. Earlier this year, the company went to the Lanai Planning Commission for a 30-year special-use permit to operate the plant. (The commission, made up of nine residents, is the one body of truly local government on Lanai. Everything else on the island gets decided by the county government, on Maui, or the state, in Honolulu. And it\u2019s worth noting that while Ellison has declined to meet with Lanai residents, he hosted Alan Arakawa \u2014 the mayor of Maui County, which includes Lanai \u2014 for lunch on his yacht and held two big-ticket fund-raisers for Gov. Neil Abercrombie before Abercrombie lost his primary in August.) But after months of hearings, the Planning Commission rejected Pulama\u2019s request and decided to issue a permit for 15 years instead. The move may sound insignificant, but as Robin Kaye, a longtime resident, who helped lead the resistance to Murdock\u2019s wind farm, pointed out, \u201cThis is the first time in two years, in a formal way, that any part of the community has said no to something Pulama has asked.\u201d And it provoked the first instance of outright intransigence the community had seen from Pulama. During one of the final meetings about the plant in June, Kurt Matsumoto kept issuing the same ultimatum: Without a guarantee of 30 years of operation, he said, the company probably wouldn\u2019t build the plant. It just wouldn\u2019t be worth the investment. \u201cIt\u2019s not a threat,\u201d Matsumoto explained, adding later: \u201cBut we\u2019re not here to negotiate that tonight.\u201dWhen I ran into Pat Reilly, the gentleman I met at the Blue Ginger Cafe in the spring, he broke down the altercation for me. It was starting to feel as if Matsumoto and his team saw the local political process as an annoyance, he said. They weren\u2019t acting like elected officials, building public support for their agenda; they were acting like they owned the place \u2014 because they did. \u201cThe local people want a say,\u201d Reilly explained. \u201cAnd this was their chance. It was a display of power. Psychologically, it makes all kinds of sense to me.\u201dBy now, the standoff was taking on an ugly feel. Many residents felt the commission had acted impetuously, handcuffing Ellison the same way activists sabotaged Murdock\u2019s wind-farm proposal \u2014 even if, in this case, the commission wasn\u2019t actually opposed to the plant and had, in fact, given the project a green light. The commission, meanwhile, had just received a stern letter from Pulama\u2019s attorney on Maui, laying out a complicated argument attacking a separate restriction written into the permit. (The restriction stipulated that, once the plant was up and running, the hotel and surrounding homes could only draw water from the island\u2019s main aquifer in emergencies, and only then for human consumption.)One afternoon, I was waiting out a rain shower in one of Pulama\u2019s Four Seasons, enjoying a very expensive ginger ale and some free popcorn, when I overheard a woman venting to the bartender about the commission\u2019s audacity and underhandedness. \u201cThis is a lot of money they\u2019re playing with!\u201d she said. She grumbled about one former commissioner in particular, whom she saw as a ringleader, and huffed, \u201cWhat was she thinking?\u201d She went on and got louder, until she\u2019d finally talked herself out.Thirty minutes later, I walked into a public meeting that Pulama was holding at the old union hall in town and saw the owner of a luxury home near the resort \u2014 a very large man in a polo shirt \u2014 standing over Pat Reilly, pointing and shouting: \u201cTalk some sense into those people! They want to shut off our water!\u201d I also saw the woman from the bar, smiling and offering people pastries and bottled water: it was Lynn McCrory, Pulama\u2019s senior vice president of government affairs.On Sept. 12, Pulama suddenly stopped construction at the desalination plant. It was unclear when \u2014 or even if \u2014 it would restart. \u201cSounds like the baby couldn\u2019t get his way,\u201d Ornellas, the head of the Planning Commission, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s sad it had to come to this.\u201dMaly was born on Oahu, he explained to the interviewer. As a child, he felt disconnected and lost, and eventually he was taken in by the Kaopuikis, one of Lanai\u2019s oldest families. Mr. and Mrs. Kaopuiki were born in the 1890s, 30 years before James Dole planted his first pineapple on Lanai, and they raised Maly the way they raised their 14 other children: speaking Hawaiian and steeped in the island\u2019s history and traditions. Maly was enthralled, and ever since he has dedicated his life to perpetuating traditional Hawaiian culture. He was now executive director of the Lanai Culture and Heritage Center, a nonprofit museum at the top of Dole Park. Kepa was the name the Kaopuikis gave him. It means \u201cto embrace.\u201dI called Maly, but never heard back. So one afternoon in March, I knocked on the door of the small blue house where I was told he worked. I\u2019d just started to introduce myself when the openness on his face collapsed into what seemed like embarrassment. He knew who I was, he said. \u201cI guess it was rude not to call you back. But I have to be cautious.\u201d The thing was, he\u2019d taken a job at Pulama Lanai. He wanted to talk with me, but I needed to clear it with the company first. After some phone calls, and another fruitless face-off with the impregnable Roger, the company surprised me: I would be allowed to interview Maly the next day.\u201cMy experience with the previous owner was a challenging one,\u201d he explained when we reconvened. But all that difficulty went away when Ellison arrived. \u201cIt was really awesome!\u201d he said. Last year, Pulama hired him as its senior vice president of culture and historic preservation. He has 10 employees now. A crew was out that afternoon clearing the area around the religious center of ancient Lanai, and they\u2019d soon be restoring ancient fish ponds and taro fields. It was the sort of stewardship he\u2019d continually asked the island\u2019s previous ownership to support. \u201cNow, all the things we were talking about, but really struggling on, we are out in the field doing,\u201d he said.Maly had not yet met Ellison, but he believed that Ellison understood that investing in the preservation of Lanai\u2019s culture and history is, at the very least, good business. Today\u2019s tourists, especially wealthy ones, value more than beaches and mai tais. \u201cIt\u2019s place-based now. People want \u2018authentic.\u2019 People want real experiences,\u201d he said.I\u2019d heard the same explanation that morning from Tom Roelens, the manager of the Four Seasons at Manele Bay. Roelens led me through a newly renovated room, noting all the local touches, like the wall panel illustrating the story of the demigod Maui and the canoe paddle over the toilet. (\u201cIt\u2019s just a stunning room product,\u201d Roelens beamed. \u201cIt truly reflects Hawaii.\u201d) Often, he said, resorts insulate guests from the community. But on Lanai, the owner of the resort wasn\u2019t in competition with the surroundings; he owned most of those, too. \u201cLanai is this entire experience,\u201d Roelens said. And the people of Lanai are part of that experience, as well. Nearly a quarter of the island works at the two hotels, he explained, and the company believes improving residents\u2019 quality of life will \u201ctruly translate to the guest experience.\u201d Ellison had once articulated this philosophy himself: \u201cWe think, If we do a good job taking care of the locals, the locals will do a good job taking care of our visitors.\u201dIt sounded like the same Silicon Valley philosophy that spawned all the epicurean cafeterias, yoga classes and nap pods on tech-company campuses \u2014 amenities designed to keep engineers happy and maximize their productivity. But now, in his office, Kepa Maly reminded me that it was a much older model too, and one that Lanai had fared pretty well under. \u201cIt\u2019s just like Dole said,\u201d he said. \u201cHave happy workers, grow better pineapples.\u201dAn article on Sept. 28 about Lanai, an island owned by Larry Ellison, misidentified the source of a complaint by a senior vice president of Pulama Lanai, the management company set up to oversee the island\u2019s transformation. She was complaining about a former planning commissioner, not a current one. The article also misspelled part of the name of a tennis tournament that is owned by Ellison. It is the BNP Paribas Open, not BPN Paribas.An article on Sept. 28 about Lanai, an island owned by Larry Ellison, misidentified the Harvard institution from which James Drummond Dole, a previous owner of the island, graduated. He obtained a degree from Harvard College, not Harvard Business School.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.D.P. Report Emphasizes the Problem of Conflicting Economic Signals", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy the NumbersIt\u2019s a useful case study of how economic statistics can send conflicting signals and the complications this can cause policy makers.According to the government figures, gross domestic product \u2014 an estimate of total production in the economy \u2014 grew at a rate of 4.6 percent in the second quarter. That\u2019s the strongest quarter so far in this recovery. But don\u2019t break out the Champagne just yet. Much of this growth is simply catching up from the first quarter when severe winter storms led the economy to contract at an annualized pace of 0.8 percent. The snow, it seems, led spending to be deferred a quarter, rather than canceled.Better, then, to look through this short-run volatility, and to focus instead on the average growth rate through the first half of this year. By that measure, G.D.P. has been growing at a disappointing annual rate of only 1.2 percent. That\u2019s not only slower than the rate through most of the recovery but is also so disappointing that if it persists, it will lead unemployment to start rising.However, there\u2019s actually a better measure of G.D.P., hidden deep inside the same National Income and Product Accounts data. That alternative measure, called Gross Domestic Income, is calculated by adding up everyone\u2019s income, rather than everyone\u2019s spending.So there you have it: a self-contradictory Goldilocks report, which finds that the economy is running too hot, too cold and just right \u2014 all at the same time.Of course, all three can\u2019t be true. My judgment is that we\u2019re better off trusting the Gross Domestic Income data, which suggests that the economic recovery is continuing on its relentless, albeit disappointingly slow, path.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Truths of a French Village", "Date": "2014-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few weeks ago I was in France, where I\u2019ve owned a village house for almost 20 years that I am now planning to sell. A real estate agent had taken a look at the property and we had made an appointment to discuss how to proceed. She swept into the kitchen, a bundle of energy and conviction, with an impassioned appeal:\u201cMonsieur Cohen, whatever you do, you must on no account sell this house!\u201dI gazed at her, a little incredulous.\u201cYou cannot sell it. This is a family home. You know it the moment you step in. You sense it in the walls. You breathe it in every room. You feel it in your bones. This is a house you must keep for your children. I will help you sell it if you insist, but my advice is not to sell. You would be making a mistake.\u201dThis was, shall we say, a cultural moment, one of those times when a door opens and you gaze, if not into the soul of a country, at least into territory that is distinct and deep and almost certainly has greater meaning than the headlines and statistics that are supposed to capture the state of a nation, in this case one called France, whose malaise has become an object of fascination. I tried to imagine an American or British real estate agent, presented with a potentially lucrative opportunity, deciding to begin the pitch with a heartfelt call not to sell the property because it was the repository of something important or irreplaceable. I came up blank. I could not picture it. There were no circumstances in which self-interest, or at least professional obligation, would not prevail. Price would be pre-eminent, along with market conditions and terms. Yet in this French village, across a wooden kitchen table set on a stone floor, the setting of economic interest below emotional intuition seemed a natural outcrop of soil and place.I thought of this exchange the other day as Prime Minister Manuel Valls, a modernizing socialist, faced a confidence vote in the National Assembly over yet another plan to cut public spending, make the job market more flexible, and break the French logjam of high unemployment, a bloated state sector and handouts that can have the perverse effect of making work in the official economy an unattractive proposition. \u201cWhat matters today is effectiveness and not ideology,\u201d Valls said.He prevailed even though 32 members of his own party abstained in protest at a perceived attack on socialist principles. More than any other party of the center-left in Europe, the French socialists have had trouble jettisoning ideological baggage ill-adapted to 21st-century global competition. More than any other Western country, France has resisted modernity, at least in the way it thinks of itself. So my feeling listening to Valls talk about \u201ceffectiveness\u201d could be summed up in two words: Good luck!The prime minister is up against something deeper than the resistance of labor unions or his own party: a culture that views the prizing of efficiency as almost vulgar. Effectiveness had no place in my chat with the real estate agent. Effectiveness does not seem to enter into it as I contemplate French butchers bard a chicken or prepare a cut of beef with deft incisions. Effectiveness is not the rule in French shopping habits. It lies at a far remove from the long conversations between shopkeepers and clients. Efficiency for the French is a poor measure of the good life, just as making a buck from the sale of a house pales before the expression of feeling about what a house may represent. Whether this is good or bad hardly matters. It is often bad for the French economy. It is also a fact of life.These distinctive cultural components of nations are probably underestimated as globalization and homogenization create the impression that the same standards or systems can be pursued everywhere. I used to be impatient with such thinking. The Russians need a czar! The Egyptians need a pharaoh! The French need to strike! No, I would think, the Russians and the Egyptians and the French are like everyone else, they want to be free, they want governance with the consent of the governed, they do not want their lives subjected to arbitrary rules, or to live less well than they could without czars and pharaohs and strikes. Now I feel I was wrong about that. Globalization equals adaptation to insurmountable differences as much as it equals change. Some things do not change, being the work of centuries.A couple of days after my meeting I was having a beer with my sons in a French cafe. The bill was 14 euros. The waitress was going to take a credit card, then saw I had a \u20ac10 note. \u201cJust give me that,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the rest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Add an L to Q70, Get a Longer Infiniti", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike a lot of people, I\u2019ve found myself a little confused by Infiniti\u2019s recent shift in nomenclature. The Q70 sport sedan, for instance, was known until the 2014 model year as the M; now Infiniti has thrown another letter into the alphabet soup by offering a long-wheelbase version for 2015, the Q70L.First up was the 2015 Q70. My test car was equipped with a 330-horsepower 3.7-liter V6, a seven-speed automatic transmission (with optional paddle shifters for more adventurous types) and rear-wheel drive. It accelerated adequately, had cozy seats and was largely unnoticeable \u2013 even to the driver \u2013 as it settled into a freeway-speed cruise from Manhattan up to Bear Mountain State Park.Once I left the highway, the Q70 handled the curvy two-lane roads about as well as any car of that size should. Infiniti says the curb weight on the rear-wheel drive 3.7-liter Q70 is 3,867 pounds. That\u2019s not a huge number by today\u2019s crash-resistance standards, but the car felt a little heavy in the turns.I didn\u2019t monitor fuel economy, but Infiniti says the E.P.A. mileage estimates for the V6-equipped Q70 are 18 miles per gallon in the city and 26 m.p.g. on the highway. The numbers drop to 17 city and 24 highway for the all-wheel drive model. Equipped with an optional 420-horsepower 5.6-liter V8, the Q70\u2019s mileage estimate drops to 16 m.p.g. city, 24 highway for the rear-wheel drive model, with the all-wheel drive version 1 m.p.g. lower in the highway rating.The L\u2019s added weight made it ride slightly smoother on the highway, but it sat on any desire I had to do any spirited driving on curvy country roads. The back seat of the L version is plush and comfortable; it\u2019s the sort of place you would want to be when whoever is at the tiller is tempted to pretend the Q70L is a true performance car.Infiniti says the E.P.A. fuel economy estimates for the V8-powered, all-wheel drive L are 16 m.p.g in the city and 23 on the highway.Parked next to a woodland cabin in upstate New York, the Q70 and its lengthier counterpart made for an attractive couple. The Porsche-like bulges on the hood are an interesting touch, and when observed from the driver\u2019s seat those curves offer a contrast with the grid of squarish buttons covering the dash. Inside, the center stack is covered with a pleasing woodgrain and Infiniti\u2019s ever-classy signature analog clock. But the stack has a strange curve to it, looking a bit like one of those clocks in a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting; the rows of buttons cascade over the sloped console like a technology waterfall of sorts.Either of these cars would be fine for something like a Garden State Parkway cruise. They\u2019re comfortable, reasonably quiet, they have heated and air-conditioned seats and as you drive the cars you really don\u2019t have to think about them too much, because the nanny-controls do much of the thinking for you (at one point, they surprised me by taking control of the brakes when I was passing someone on the freeway). Luckily, those controls \u2013 which include blind-spot intervention and lane-departure prevention systems as well as semiautonomous braking \u2013 can be turned off if you don\u2019t want them to exercise any undue influence upon your driving.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Errors and Emissions", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis just in: Saving the planet would be cheap; it might even be free. But will anyone believe the good news?But you know that such assessments will be met with claims that it\u2019s impossible to break the link between economic growth and ever-rising emissions of greenhouse gases, a position I think of as \u201cclimate despair.\u201d The most dangerous proponents of climate despair are on the anti-environmentalist right. But they receive aid and comfort from other groups, including some on the left, who have their own reasons for getting it wrong.Where is the new optimism about climate change and growth coming from? It has long been clear that a well-thought-out strategy of emissions control, in particular one that puts a price on carbon via either an emissions tax or a cap-and-trade scheme, would cost much less than the usual suspects want you to think. But the economics of climate protection look even better now than they did a few years ago.On the other side, it turns out that putting a price on carbon would have large \u201cco-benefits\u201d \u2014 positive effects over and above the reduction in climate risks \u2014 and that these benefits would come fairly quickly. The most important of these co-benefits, according to the I.M.F. paper, would involve public health: burning coal causes many respiratory ailments, which drive up medical costs and reduce productivity. And thanks to these co-benefits, the paper argues, one argument often made against carbon pricing \u2014 that it\u2019s not worth doing unless we can get a global agreement \u2014 is wrong. Even without an international agreement, there are ample reasons to take action against the climate threat.But back to the main point: It\u2019s easier to slash emissions than seemed possible even a few years ago, and reduced emissions would produce large benefits in the short-to-medium run. So saving the planet would be cheap and maybe even come free.Enter the prophets of climate despair, who wave away all this analysis and declare that the only way to limit carbon emissions is to bring an end to economic growth.You mostly hear this from people on the right, who normally say that free-market economies are endlessly flexible and creative. But when you propose putting a price on carbon, suddenly they insist that industry will be completely incapable of adapting to changed incentives. Why, it\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re looking for excuses to avoid confronting climate change, and, in particular, to avoid anything that hurts fossil-fuel interests, no matter how beneficial to everyone else.So here\u2019s what you need to know: Climate despair is all wrong. The idea that economic growth and climate action are incompatible may sound hardheaded and realistic, but it\u2019s actually a fuzzy-minded misconception. If we ever get past the special interests and ideology that have blocked action to save the planet, we\u2019ll find that it\u2019s cheaper and easier than almost anyone imagines. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Air France Outlines Latest Proposal to Pilots\u2019 Union", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Nearly two weeks into a French pilots\u2019 strike, Air France-KLM outlined its latest proposal on Friday, while union leaders called for an independent mediator to help break the deadlock.The company said it was ready to move swiftly on plans to accelerate the development in France of its budget subsidiary, Transavia, but it held firm on the condition that pilots there would work under a separate contract, rejecting a crucial demand by unions for uniform working conditions and pay scales.Leaders of the French National Union of Airline Pilots responded that while they were strongly in favor of the proposed new investments in Transavia, management\u2019s latest offer still \u201cfailed to respond\u201d to pilots\u2019 concerns over pay and working conditions.But as a \u201csign of good faith,\u201d the union said it was ready to end the strike as soon as an independent mediator was named.Air France-KLM, which has been cutting costs for years, added that it was prepared to hire up to 1,000 new employees in France, including 250 pilots, for Transavia over the coming two to three years and was ready to begin expanding Transavia in France as early as next summer. The investment plan includes the addition of around three dozen new Boeing 737 single-aisle jets to Transavia\u2019s French fleet.Under the terms of management\u2019s latest proposal, Air France pilots who volunteer to fly temporarily for Transavia would be paid as Transavia employees for that period. But they would accumulate hours toward their Air France seniority during that time, and would be paid as Air France pilots upon their return.\u201cAir France believes that this balanced solution to develop Transavia France should be enough to end this strike, which is extremely costly and damaging to the company, its customers and its staff,\u201d Air France-KLM said.Until now, the pilots have viewed the budget-airline expansion plan as a means of cutting wages, and of increasing work hours, which at Air France are well below the allowable European maximum.The latest offer from Air France-KLM came at the end of a day of tense negotiations on Friday, the 12th day of the dispute and the longest in the airline\u2019s history.But without any sign of an immediate breakthrough, the airline said it expected to operate \u201cmore than half\u201d of its flights on Saturday, as slightly more than half of its 3,800 pilots are still refusing to work.\u201cNegotiations are continuing with an aim of rapidly resolving the conflict,\u201d the airline said.The disruption is costing the airline 20 million euros, or $25 million, a day in losses and has already disrupted the plans of more than half-a-million travelers.Opinion polls have shown that most of the French public lacks sympathy for the strike, perhaps because the pilots\u2019 salaries, which start at around \u20ac75,000 a year, are well above national norms. Government officials including Prime Minister Manuel Valls have for days been calling for a rapid resolution to stop the damage to the unprofitable airline and to France\u2019s national image.The airline insisted, however, that it would go ahead with a planned expansion of Transavia in France, where it has operated since 2007, but with a fleet of just 14 planes, and just three bases: Paris Orly, Lyon and Nantes. Transavia\u2019s Dutch unit is already an established low-cost brand in the Netherlands, with a fleet of 35 planes and a 20 percent share of the Dutch market. Air France also operates Hop, another low-cost carrier, which flies point-to-point services between French regional airports and also to a number of European destinations.The main remaining roadblock to a deal is the question of the terms for hiring new pilots. The union is not opposed to expanding Transavia France, but it has demanded that all pilots be hired on the same contract across the Air France-KLM group \u2014 effectively defeating a primary aim of management as it tries to reduce its cost base to fend off the erosion of its market share from the upstart.Peter Morris, chief economist of Ascend, an airline consulting firm in London, said Air France-KLM needed to adapt its model if it was to win \u201cthe war of attrition\u201d between the low-cost leaders \u2014 which have doubled their available seats over the last 10 years \u2014 and the old-guard carriers, whose number of travelers has shrunk by half over that same period.\u201cOne model is expanding, one model is declining,\u201d he said.Giving in to pilots by curtailing the Transavia expansion to France only \u201cjust postpones the day of reckoning,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cYou may have happier pilots now, but you\u2019re still putting higher-priced tickets into the marketplace.\u201dTransavia France, which flies between France and destinations like Lisbon, Barcelona in Spain, Naples in Italy and Istanbul is only about half the size of Transavia\u2019s more cost-effective Dutch operation, and Air France has identified the French unit as having the potential for significantly more growth.The unit\u2019s operating costs per seat remain higher than those of its Dutch counterpart. Air France-KLM has said it hopes to reduce costs in the French part of Transavia by as much as 15 percent through increased economies of scale and by operating more frequent flights.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Airstrike in Somalia by U.S. Forces Targets Shabab Leader", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNAIROBI, Kenya \u2014 For nearly a decade, the United States has been trying to fight the Somali Islamist group known as the Shabab, using everything from its African allies and economic sanctions to American missile strikes and commando raids.On Tuesday, Pentagon officials announced that they had conducted American airstrikes to go after the leader of the Shabab directly, striking at the heart of a militant group that has allied itself with Al Qaeda and terrorized the region for years.Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said military officials were trying to assess whether the Shabab leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, had been killed in the strikes, which took place on Monday on an encampment and a vehicle south of Mogadishu, the capital. The attack was carried out by Special Operations forces using both manned and unmanned aircraft, launched, Admiral Kirby said, based on \u201cactionable\u201d intelligence that Mr. Godane was at the encampment.The American warplanes dropped a number of Hellfire missiles and precision bombs. Defense officials said they believed that both the encampment and the vehicle had been destroyed, and that the militants there had been killed. But they were still trying to determine the fate of Mr. Godane.\u201cWe certainly believe that we hit what we were aiming at,\u201d Admiral Kirby said during a news briefing. He said that the United States would \u201ccontinue to use all the tools at our disposal\u201d to \u201cdismantle Al Shabab and other terrorist groups.\u201dOne American official in Nairobi said that \u201cwe\u2019re 80 percent sure\u201d Mr. Godane was killed in the strike. Still, militants in places like Yemen and Pakistan have been thought to be killed in drone strikes just like this one, only to resurface weeks or months later, crowing about having survived American attempts to kill them.Admiral Kirby said that no American combat troops were on the ground calling in the airstrikes on Monday. \u201cAll I would tell you is we continue to work with partners in Somalia and in the region, but I won\u2019t get any more specific than that,\u201d he said.Mr. Godane has been the driving force behind turning what was once a poor, obscure local militant group in a country many had forgotten into one of the most fearsome Qaeda franchises in the world. At the height of its power, the Shabab, under Mr. Godane\u2019s merciless leadership, controlled more square miles of territory than just about any other Qaeda offshoot.Mr. Godane, thought to be around 40 years old, has been one of the most wanted figures in Africa, widely believed to have orchestrated countless attacks on civilians, including the massacre of dozens of shoppers at a mall in Nairobi last year. He has presided over a reign of terror inside Somalia for several years, organizing the stoning of teenage girls and crude public amputations, all part of an effort to place Somalia under a harsh interpretation of Islamic rule.During Somalia\u2019s famine in 2011, when more than 200,000 people died, Mr. Godane gave the orders to block food supplies from reaching starving people. His masked fighters even diverted rivers from famished farmers. Mr. Godane has also taken the Shabab\u2019s violence international by organizing suicide attacks in Kenya and Uganda.The Shabab leader is one of a number of terror suspects whom the military has standing orders to strike if the opportunity presents itself, administration officials said. President Obama has already authorized such strikes.\u201cThis is not one of those cases where a permission slip is needed,\u201d a senior administration official said on Tuesday.American commandos have winnowed down the leadership of the Shabab, killing other leaders in airstrikes over the years, while thousands of African Union troops have pushed the group out of the capital, Mogadishu, and many of its strongholds.The Shabab are not nearly as powerful as they once were, when they controlled vast areas of southern Somalia and nearly overran the government. But they still control some towns and villages, and in recent days, they have stepped up assassinations of Somali officials in Mogadishu.Even if Mr. Godane was killed, some Somalia analysts said the terror threat in East Africa would remain.\u201cThe U.S. has been so focused on Somalia, they took their eye off their ball,\u201d said Bronwyn Bruton, deputy director of the Ansari Africa Center of the Atlantic Council in Washington. \u201cThe real threat isn\u2019t Somalia itself. It\u2019s the regionalization of Al Qaeda in East Africa, which has already been happening.\u201dShe mentioned recent attacks in Uganda and Kenya, two countries with important and growing economies where many Westerners live, compared with Somalia, where there are scant few.Still, American counterterrorism and intelligence officials greeted news of the airstrike with cautious optimism.\u201cIf true, this will be a huge blow to Shabab, especially if Godane\u2019s inner circle was wiped out in the strike,\u201d said Rudolph Atallah, a former director of African counterterrorism policy for the Pentagon. \u201cWe\u2019ve been after Godane for a long time. Having him out of the picture,\u201d he said, would give Somalia \u201cbreathing room to make positive strides on all fronts.\u201dThe caution Pentagon officials were exercising on Tuesday about whether Mr. Godane had been killed underscored the social media war that the United States has waged with media-savvy terror networks. \u201cThe last thing anyone here wants is to declare victory and then have this guy pop on Twitter bragging that he\u2019s alive,\u201d one administration official said.The United States has tried a number of ways to rein in the militant Islamist movement in Somalia. In 2006, when radical Islamist militants began taking over local courts in Somalia, the Central Intelligence Agency teamed up with a coterie of notorious Somali warlords, bringing them bags of money. But the effort quickly backfired, and the Islamists ran the warlords out of the capital.Then the United States helped Ethiopia invade Somalia by providing classified intelligence and even coordinating airstrikes, with the hope that the Ethiopians could crush the Islamists. Instead, the Shabab flourished, becoming a lionized guerrilla army.At the same time, the United States has taken an opportunistic counterterrorism approach, inserting few ground troops into Somalia but occasionally striking at specific Shabab leaders or terrorist suspects. Several have been killed, including Aden Ayro, Sheikh Muhyadin Omar and Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.According to a recent book on the Shabab written by Stig Jarle Hansen, a professor in Norway, Mr. Godane was once a star pupil, winning scholarships to study economics outside Somalia, though soon enough he abandoned the classroom, traveling to Afghanistan and then falling into jihadist circles. In the early 2000s, he returned to Somalia, where, according to the local authorities, he helped plan the murder of several aid workers. If Mr. Godane is dead, it could affect the split inside the Shabab between the Somali nationalist wing, which has more local ambitions, and the more die-hard jihadists who want to spread terror through the region and the world.\u201cIf Godane\u2019s gone, maybe the Shabab will take a nap for a couple months,\u201d said one former Somali security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cBut they\u2019ve recruited so many young people. Maybe Al Qaeda has a plan for who will be next.\u201dJeffrey Gettleman reported from Nairobi, and Helene Cooper from Washington. Mohamed Ibrahim contributed reporting from Mogadishu, Somalia, and Eric Schmitt from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Now as Provocateur, Summers Says Treasury Undermined Fed", "Date": "2014-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCross PurposesLawrence Summers, the former chief economic adviser to President Obama, said on Tuesday that the Treasury Department had undermined the Federal Reserve\u2019s stimulus campaign and that doing so was a large and expensive mistake.The facts are straightforward: The Fed has been trying to reduce the supply of long-term Treasury securities. The Treasury, meanwhile, has been issuing relatively more long-term debt and less short-term debt. In effect, one arm of the government has been draining the bathtub while the other adds water.On Tuesday, Mr. Summers, who at one point was widely assumed to be Obama\u2019s top choice to be Fed chairman, brushed aside those apparent contradictions. He embraced the role of a provocateur who was, in effect, criticizing his former colleagues \u2014 not least the former Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner. The two old friends have aired several disagreements since leaving the administration.The Fed has sought to stimulate the economy by purchasing large quantities of long-term Treasury securities. The campaign, which is scheduled to end in October, aims to force investors to buy other kinds of debt and, in the face of increased competition, to accept lower interest rates from the borrowers.During the same period, the Treasury has greatly increased its issuance of long-term debt. Mary John Miller, until recently the Treasury official responsible for debt issuance, said the average duration of government debt, historically about 58 months, fell to 48 months during the crisis and has risen to 68 months.Mr. Summers and his co-authors calculate that the Fed\u2019s campaign reduced long-term rates by 1.37 percentage points, but that the Treasury\u2019s debt policies put back 0.48 of those points.\u201cIt seems very odd that the Federal Reserve is taking actions that have the effect of substantially reducing the duration of the debt held by the public at a time when the Treasury is arguing that it is in taxpayers\u2019 interest to extend the duration of the debt at a rapid pace,\u201d the paper said. \u201cMoreover, the Federal Reserve has done so without formally acknowledging any of the considerations invoked by the Treasury. Similarly, the Treasury is taking steps that in the judgment of the Fed are contractionary.\u201dThe Treasury certainly has had its reasons. Issuing long-term debt lets the government lock in low interest rates, which could save taxpayers a lot of money. It also reduces the amount of short-term debt that must be rolled over, potentially at higher rates, during periods of uncertainty about whether Republicans in Congress will vote to raise the debt ceiling.But Mr. Summers and his colleagues argued that the Treasury and the Fed should coordinate management of the debt, perhaps by issuing an annual report describing a shared strategy.(Mr. Summers was listed as the fourth author on the paper, which he wrote with three other Harvard economists. But he was the outsize personality; organizers joked they expected him to consume half of the three-hour session.)Representatives of the Fed and Treasury, on a subsequent panel, rejected both the findings of the Harvard paper and the proposal for more coordination.And Mr. Powell said increased coordination was \u201cfraught with risk,\u201d because it could give the Treasury greater influence over the course of monetary policy.Jason Cummins, chief United States economist at Brevan Howard, said in a response to the paper that the Fed and Treasury had coordinated more closely at various times in the past, and the results were almost always unfortunate. He recounted the story of President Johnson\u2019s summoning the Fed\u2019s chairman, William McChesney Martin, to his Texas ranch, slamming him against the wall and telling him, \u201cMartin, my boys are dying in Vietnam, and you won\u2019t print the money I need.\u201dMr. Summers, reliably pugnacious, characterized his opponents in remarks at the Brookings event as \u201ccentral bank independence freaks\u201d and said it was \u201cat the edge of absurd\u201d to suggest that debt management coordination would substantially erode the Fed\u2019s independence.He has a point, in the sense that the Fed\u2019s independence has always sounded more impressive than it is. Indeed, the Fed and the Treasury already coordinate extensively. Mr. Summers recalled that in the 1990s, when he himself was Treasury secretary, the two agencies held a regular \u201cdebt management meeting.\u201d Ms. Miller said the meeting still took place under a less descriptive name. The Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, and the Treasury secretary, Jacob Lew, have a regular lunch. Their staffers work together on a wide range of issues.And that raises the question of why Mr. Summers, in his time as an administration official, did not press for more conversations about this issue. On Tuesday, he said only that he had objected lightly, but that he did not pursue the point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Israel, Values of a Holy Respite Are Adapted for a High-Tech World", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are not typical efforts at corporate consciousness, but part of a new Israeli experiment with alternative observances of shmita, the sabbatical that began Wednesday night with the Jewish year 5775. Translating biblical concepts of renewal and responsibility to a knowledge-based economy, they are part of a broader push to infuse Jewish values and rituals into secular or at least non-Orthodox strands of society.Shmita comes every seventh year, a required rest period for the land. The Torah commands farmers not to till their fields and to let poor people and animals feed off what grows; separately, it mandates that all debts be forgiven during shmita years.During the last two shmita cycles, controversy erupted between the religious and the more-religious in Israel over a century-old workaround that enables Jews to temporarily transfer ownership of their lands to non-Jews so it can still be cultivated. That fight continues this year as people protest the military\u2019s move to buy produce only from non-Jewish farms. But in its wake, a separate set of initiatives that have nothing to do with agriculture is taking root.\u201cPeople are thinking, this is just too good to remain in the area of arcane Halakhic arguments, the values here are really important for any modern society,\u201d explained Julian Sinclair, a vice president at Energiya who is also an economist, rabbi, and author of a new book on shmita, referring to debates over Jewish law. \u201cIt\u2019s about the sources of our wealth and letting go of our control and the hold on the things which make us wealthy, and the absence of which leaves other people behind.\u201dThe reinterpretation is also a response to the radical changes in Israel\u2019s economy, where a booming high-tech sector long ago replaced the collective farming culture of the state\u2019s founding. Less than 2 percent of Israel\u2019s G.N.P. came from agriculture in 2011, down from more than 60 percent in 1949.So Yossi Tsuria, a founder of NDS, a video-software company now part of Cisco Systems, has been promoting a list of 49 things technology firms might try to fulfill the shmita spirit. They include a patent pool, where companies could donate patents not part of their core business to be used by any entrepreneur; required rotation of business models and management positions, and: \u201cA year without exorbitant bonuses. The money can be directed to social causes.\u201d (No. 32). \u201cThe workday will be no longer than eight hours and the work week will have no more than five days\u201d (No. 40). \u201cEmail only works during business hours. If an email is received out of hours, a message will be returned explaining policy.\u201d (No 41).Mr. Tsuria admitted that he does not know of big outfits that have actually adopted any of the measures (even at Energiya, the shmita committee dismissed the email time limits as impractical). But 100 tech workers have enrolled in a special shmita program where they will spend a half-day each week studying at Hebrew University, which Mr. Tsuria sees as a start.\u201cHigh-tech as a whole is running faster than regular people can accommodate, and stopping for a year \u2014 don\u2019t try to push a new iPhone 7, O.K., let the people breathe \u2014 has real value,\u201d he said. Noting that Jewish Sabbath observance today \u201cis totally different\u201d from what it was during the First and Second Temples, when animal sacrifices were the centerpiece, Mr. Tsuria added: \u201cShmita was stuck in 2,000 years ago \u2014 it didn\u2019t have any evolution to adapt itself to the life of the people.\u201dEinat Kramer, who has spent the last two years promoting alternative shmita, told of an online time bank matching volunteers with certain skills with people in need, with each hour completed marked with a blue dot on a map of Israel. One man told Ms. Kramer he planned to purchase monkeys used in laboratory experiments and set them free.Ms. Kramer herself recently bought a 500-square-foot, $500 white tent she plans to bring to public squares across the country as a sort of \u201cHyde Park for dreamers.\u201d Inside will be a lending library, a recycling center, and free coffee, tea and fruit.Though in the Torah, shmita only applies to the land of Israel, diaspora Jews are also on board. Amichai Lau Lavie, an Israeli-American rabbinical student who runs a pop-up synagogue in New York, has created a website called Fallow Lab encouraging \u201cdigital detox\u201d for shmita.Some initiatives are more direct descendants of the biblical dictates. Four nonprofit groups have enrolled 1,500 families each with debts of about $25,000 into an eight-month budgeting seminar. Those who complete it will have to pay only a third of their reduced debt; the groups promise to collect donations to cover another third, and convince creditors to forgive the rest.At Energiya, shmita fits with the socially-conscious, environmentally-friendly ethos, but clashes somewhat with the intense start-up culture.For example, one idea being debated is a prohibition on assigning projects with a deadline of less than 48 hours (current practice, as at so many companies, is that managers often ask for things \u201cright now\u201d). Going fully paperless would save the firm of 14 employees about $3,500 a year in paper and toner. But they are not yet unplugging the printers because the founder is something of a paper addict.\u201cNext time he hands me a document with his chicken scrawl in the margins, I\u2019m going to say, \u2018I do not accept that,\u2019 \u201d said Sara Halevi, the communications director, whose personal shmita commitments include exchanging the yellow pads she brings to meetings for a laptop, and leaving that laptop at the office four nights a week.\u201cI can\u2019t push it to the point where I get fired, that would be counterproductive,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}

And 2007 household incomes were actually below the 1999 peak.This simple fact may be the most important thing to understand about today\u2019s economy: Around 1999, growth in the United States economy stopped translating to growth in middle-class incomes. In the last 15 years, median income has been more or less flat while there was far sharper growth in, for example, per capita gross domestic product.There are various potential reasons. Evolving technology favors those with the most advanced skills and allows companies to replace formerly middle-class workers with machines. Declining union power gives workers less power at the bargaining table over wages. Cultural norms have shifted such that top executives and financiers are paid much more compared with regular workers than they used to be.But there really is no mystery as to why public opinion has been persistently down on the quality of the economy for years. You can\u2019t eat G.D.P. You can\u2019t live in a rising stock market. You can\u2019t give your kids a better life because your company\u2019s C.E.O. was able to give himself a big raise.The rubber-meets-road measure of whether the economy is working for the mass of Americans is median real income and related measures of how much money is making its way into their pockets and what they can buy with that money.And the newest census numbers show that the nation experienced virtually no progress on that frontier in 2013, and remains far behind where we were seven years ago. Americans feel disappointed by the economy; the new data show that they have good reason.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crete Finds Self in Union", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe passionate debate in Scotland over the issue of independence, the surge of Catalonian nationalism, the separatist war in Ukraine \u2014 all of these made me think of the tides that draw nations toward union or separation, and of my own island\u2019s long battle to unite with Greece a century ago. Crete succeeded in joining Greece in 1913, after a series of rebellions against the crumbling Ottoman Empire, having repeatedly rejected the autonomy that the great powers of Europe were pressing as an alternative. Their battle cry, \u201cUnion or Death,\u201d was a world away from the genteel Aye or Nae of the Scottish referendum last Thursday, but the two struggles had the same aim: to preserve identity and achieve greater security. The Cretans had fought for freedom valiantly but vainly for centuries \u2014 after coming under Venetian rule in the 13th century and, after 1669, as Ottoman subjects. They knew that in their part of the world, safety lay not in autonomy but in being part of a larger group with which they could identify. In their case, it was the Greek state, established in 1830 at the end of a nine-year war of liberation against the Turks. But the major European powers did not allow Crete to join the newly independent Greece \u2014 for their own reasons, each preferred the status quo. This resulted in continual strife between the island\u2019s Christians and Muslims. The great powers granted autonomy in 1908, and Crete finally joined Greece five years later. So keen were the Cretans for union that they were not deterred by Greece\u2019s bankruptcy in 1893, or by its defeat in an 1897 war with Turkey, or by the fact that its economy was under international supervision (as has been the case, once again, since 2010). The Cretans knew they would always be in danger if they did not become part of something bigger.\u201cThe only real solution to our problem will be union with Greece,\u201d the rebel leader Eleutherios Venizelos explained to the Italian admiral whose ships were part of an international force blockading the island in 1897. Earlier that year, Italian, British, French and Russian naval ships had bombarded rebel positions and blocked Greek forces from the island, ostensibly to prevent them from provoking the Turks.\u201cBut,\u201d Venizelos continued, \u201cwe are forced to adapt to the decisions of the powers and accept the promised autonomy, as a new stop on the way to achieving our national aim.\u201d Venizelos won such credibility for his leadership that he became prime minister of Greece in 1910, three years before union was achieved. In 1923, the last of Crete\u2019s Muslims left the island in a major exchange of populations, after another war between Greece and Turkey. The Cretans had fought hard for their freedom, but although they remain fiercely proud of what distinguishes them from other Greeks \u2014 mainly their music, their poetry and millenniums of history at the crossroads of Europe, Africa and Asia \u2014 there is no sign that today\u2019s Cretans seek autonomy. A couple of years ago, as Greece\u2019s economic crisis was deepening, the Cretan flag that flew between 1898 and 1908 began to appear on T-shirts, hats and even walls on the island. But today, with tourism surging and Crete\u2019s economy recovering, the flag is seldom seen. It seems that too much went into the fight for union to start toying with the idea of separation now, however great the frustration with Greece\u2019s woes. Also, Cretans are aware of their island\u2019s strategic position, and the importance of its military facilities for the United States and NATO. Along with Greece\u2019s membership in the European Union, this provides a sense of security. People\u2019s identities are defined not only by who they feel they are but also by their history and by whom they fear. Over the past 2,000 years, Crete was invaded and occupied by Romans, Arabs, Venetians, Turks and, in World War II, Germans and Italians. Its fate was often determined by the games of greater powers seeking to further their own interests. As a result, Cretans have a reputation for being both uncompromisingly rebellious yet also skilled at the diplomacy required to deal with sometimes unreliable allies. Today, with a resurgent and belligerent Russia, would Poland, Romania and any of the Baltic states choose to be, like Ukraine, outside of NATO and the European Union? Successful transnational organizations, like the European Union, allow small nations or ethnic groups to feel that they can prosper without being part of some larger country. It is interesting to note that Malta, the smallest member of the European Union (smaller than Crete in size and population), has the highest percentage of people who feel that they are citizens of the European Union \u2014 87 percent. It is likely that if a majority of Scots felt that their identity, sense of self-determination and well-being would be threatened if they remained in the United Kingdom, more would have voted for independence. People who feel subjugated by others within the same country will fight to break free; those who feel alone and threatened will seek union. Scotland and Crete, at geographical opposite ends of the European Union, reflect different phases of each people\u2019s struggle to preserve its identity and to survive. Separatism and irredentism have always been major causes for war, as we see across the world today. In the European Union, with its values of democracy and tolerance, they are still important. But they are not life-or-death issues. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Atlantic City\u2019s Next Gamble", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorATLANTIC CITY \u2014 NUCKY JOHNSON\u2019S town can still throw a party. Tens of thousands of fans recently flocked to Atlantic City for two free concerts on the water\u2019s edge, first by Blake Shelton and then by Lady Antebellum. With casinos shutting their doors, leaving thousands jobless, these are just the type of fun events that the resort city needs if it is to survive. But some businesses misbehaved. Several casinos charged concertgoers $50 for parking, five to 10 times the usual rate. Some people in this city never miss the opportunity to sacrifice long-term vision for a fast buck. Since the arrival of casino gambling in 1978, Atlantic City has squandered one opportunity after another. Much of the city looks as drab and dreary as it did before the casinos opened. Many buildings abandoned in the early 1970s \u2014 the last time the resort hit bottom \u2014 still haven\u2019t found a use. The people in City Hall can\u2019t decide whether to let them stand or knock them down, creating more empty lots. For large portions of the city, it\u2019s as if gambling never happened. For 20 years Atlantic City had most of the nation\u2019s gamblers to itself, but the city\u2019s leaders failed to exploit that position by diversifying the local economy. Huge casino profits and tax revenues rolled into town like tidal waves of cash. Some casino operations reinvested in the city better than others, but City Hall frittered away many millions on salaries and contracts with power brokers\u2019 pals. No thought was given to a serious citywide capital improvement program. The easy money generated complacency, and now we\u2019re paying for it. There are more than 60 places to gamble east of the Mississippi, not counting online. Vacationers don\u2019t have to travel to Atlantic City to visit a casino, and they won\u2019t, unless we give them more reasons to come. The key to the future lies in the past. Atlantic City was built on \u201cspectacles\u201d: crowd-drawing events from free concerts, boxing matches and beauty contests to art shows, beer festivals and basketball tournaments. Founded in 1854 as an experiment in social planning, it was the first city in America conceived solely as a resort. With the singular purpose of providing leisure-time activities for visitors, it has no other reason to exist. Yet implicit in this experiment is that vacationers\u2019 tastes are forever changing and so, too, must Atlantic City. Keeping the experiment flourishing, by perpetually reimagining an up-to-date resort economy, requires each generation to develop a new vision.In the 19th century, Atlantic City wasn\u2019t so much the \u201cworld\u2019s playground\u201d as Philadelphia\u2019s watering hole. Excellent railroad service made it easy for Philadelphia\u2019s immigrant factory workers to break away from the staid City of Brotherly Love. The resort reached the zenith of its popularity in the \u201920s. To quote one old-timer, \u201cProhibition didn\u2019t happen in Atlantic City.\u201d Boss of the city throughout this era was Enoch \u201cNucky\u201d Johnson (no relation to me). He dominated political and social life from 1911 to 1941, when he went to jail for tax evasion. Nucky understood that repeat business by vacationers was indispensable. Unlike Nucky Thompson, the character based on him in HBO\u2019s \u201cBoardwalk Empire,\u201d Johnson ruled with a velvet hammer. His power was such that he never needed violence to get his way. (Still, I can picture him handling the money-grubber demanding a $50 parking fee for a free concert. It wouldn\u2019t happen a second time.)Despite being a corrupt autocrat, Johnson had the foresight to invest in the future. During Prohibition, while the bars, nightclubs and hotels were rolling in cash, he knew it couldn\u2019t last forever and rallied the city to construct a first-rate entertainment venue in the form of the Atlantic City Convention Hall, now known as Boardwalk Hall. Although the city saw a steady decline in visitors following the repeal of Prohibition, the venue remained a draw, as it does today. Unfortunately, Johnson also left behind a community so acculturated to political bossism that when the \u201cOrganization\u201d finally collapsed in 1971, the city was rudderless. Machine politics was replaced by an endless free-for-all among hapless politicians hoping to be the next boss. (Few succeeded; some went to jail.) Those who did make it into office used the city\u2019s payroll to swell the ranks of their supporters. Today the city has one of the highest ratios of government employees to population in the country. With so many tax dollars going to salaries, there\u2019s little left for anything else. Despite its corruption, Johnson\u2019s machine didn\u2019t bloat City Hall\u2019s payroll and delivered essential municipal services in a competent manner. That\u2019s not true today. City Hall is where innovative ideas go to die. There has yet to materialize a sustained effort to rethink the city\u2019s role in the national economy and rebuild it into a safe, clean, first-rate resort. Any attempts at \u201cplanning\u201d are smothered in the cradle by petty political interests.Nucky\u2019s town has lost its edge. Once again, Atlantic City must reinvent itself. It\u2019s not hopeless. There\u2019s more to Atlantic City than casinos. While gambling revenue is plummeting, retail and restaurant profits are rising. Hiding in plain sight are splendid assets: the mighty Atlantic Ocean, beautiful beaches, easy access by one-fourth of the nation\u2019s population, the Boardwalk, modern convention facilities, an excellent international airport 10 miles away, institutions of higher learning eager to help, and finally, a skilled work force to make things run smoothly. We just need a City Hall that can free itself from Nucky Johnson\u2019s legacy of corrupt patronage, while embracing his example of creative foresight. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Financial Challenges for the E.U.", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPolitical EconomyOne of the biggest projects for the next European Commission, which takes office in November, will be to create a \u201ccapital markets union.\u201d Last week, Jean-Claude Juncker, the incoming president, gave Jonathan Hill of Britain the task of creating such a union \u201cwith a view to maximizing the benefits of capital markets and nonbank financial institutions for the real economy.\u201dThe prime goal of a capital markets union should be to develop healthy sources of nonbank finance that can foster jobs and growth. The European Union suffers from clogged up and fragmented capital markets, which are a fraction of the size of their American equivalents. Changing this is vital because banks, especially in the eurozone periphery, are unable to finance recovery on their own.How exactly should this capital union be created? In some cases, no doubt, there will have to be new regulations. One of the ironies of creating any single market is that rules have to be passed to break down barriers that balkanize the market. But new rules are not the only answer. The main thrust of a capital markets union should be about liberating, not controlling, markets. In pursuing this, some of the regulations put in place after the financial crisis will need to be revised because they are holding back nonbank finance.One target should be regulations that prevent the revival of securitization, or the practice of taking loans, packaging them and trading them on the markets. Securitization got a bad name because of the role it played in the American subprime mortgage crisis. But the experience in the European Union was not nearly as bad. Despite this relatively good experience, the European market has been virtually regulated out of existence, while the American market has rebounded. One of the European rules requires insurance companies, the main purchasers of securitized loans, to hold extra capital if they buy these assets. As a result, they are not interested. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have urged that the rules should be relaxed for \u201chigh-quality\u201d securitizations with clear and simple structures.Another part of the financial services industry that has gotten clobbered by regulation are credit rating groups. To some extent, this is justified. They were guilty of bad practices in the run-up to the credit crunch. But credit ratings are often needed before companies can issue debt on the capital markets. The flood of new rules implemented by the European Union may have gone too far and may be imposing such costs that it is a drag on smaller companies in gaining access to the markets. The commission should review whether specific elements of the regulations should be relaxed. The guiding principle should be to free up the credit rating agencies to give an honest view about the risks as they see them, but not to treat these views as if they are God\u2019s word.Vigorous capital markets do not just require companies to be able to issue debt and equity to investors; they also require investors to be able to sell those securities without suffering a big hit in the value of their investments. The ability to trade securities smoothly in the secondary market makes it more attractive to invest in the first place. It allows investors who do not necessarily want to lock up their money for the long-term to provide permanent capital to companies in the form of equity and back long-term investment projects, such as those in infrastructure.There is one European initiative that could gum up such trading and so make it harder to fund jobs and growth: the financial transaction tax, which 10 countries in the Union, including Germany, France and Italy plan to impose. Details of the tax have not been determined. But if it is set too high, it could reduce liquidity and make capital markets in the bloc a less attractive place for investors to put their money.There is understandably a desire to make the financial industry pay more tax, given the mess it caused in the credit crunch. The snag is that the tax hits investors and companies, not banks. There are two better ways of taking money from the banking industry: levies, which tax banks depending on how much they rely on short-term hot money; and a financial activities tax, which taxes their profits and remuneration and would be justified because they are exempt from a value-added tax.Many countries have adopted some form of bank levy. But there is patchwork of different systems and rates. The Union should try to put some order into different countries\u2019 bank levies. Meanwhile, the 10 countries that are still committed to the financial transactions tax should abandon it and switch to the financial activities tax They should also invite the other 18 member states, which do not want the transactions tax, to join them.There will undoubtedly be resistance to the idea that rules governing capital markets should be relaxed. But what is required is sensitive adjustments to particular regulations rather than wholesale deregulation. This also fits in with one of Mr. Juncker\u2019s other priorities: to cut unnecessary red tape.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweden Looks to Exclude Far Right From Coalition", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGOTHENBURG, Sweden \u2014 Sweden, a country synonymous with stable government, generous welfare and liberal immigration policies, entered a new era on Monday, as its fragmented political mainstream scrambled to form a coalition government strong enough to exclude the surging far right.Elections held Sunday gave the center-left enough votes to take power from the governing center-right alliance, yet neither bloc won a majority. But the Sweden Democrats, an anti-immigrant party, more than doubled their vote and now hold the balance of power in Parliament. On Monday, the popular tabloid Expressen published a front page starkly displaying on a black background the number of Swedes who voted for the Sweden Democrats: more than 780,000, or almost 13 percent of the total. Thousands of protestors gathered in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo on Monday to protest against racism in reaction to the Sweden Democrats, who have roots in the white supremacist movement. \u201cIt is a sad day,\u201d said Annie Loof, leader of the Center party.As the scale of the gains for the Sweden Democrats became clear, their leader, Jimmie Akesson, declared to cheering supporters: \u201cWe said that we would become kingmakers, and we have done that. We said we would double our support, and we have doubled our support.\u201dThe left-leaning Social Democrats, with 31 percent, barely exceeded their total from the previous election four years ago, a result seen as a disaster for the party and setting off a leadership fight. The Green party, the Social Democrats\u2019 most likely coalition partner, scored less than 7 percent, and conceded its dreams of being Sweden\u2019s third political force dashed to the far right.Together with the Left party of former communists, the so-called red-green bloc mustered only 43.8 percent of the vote, compared with 39.3 percent for the center-right bloc \u2014 a wafer-thin margin unforeseen in opinion polls.On Monday, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and Finance Minister Anders Borg of the main governing party, the Moderates, submitted their resignations, despite having presided over a dynamic economy that quickly bounced back from the global slump of 2008.But inequality in Sweden has grown, and with it a fear that the free market is failing to deliver the standard of welfare services that Swedes expect. The left attracted voters by promising a sharp break with the Reinfeldt government\u2019s economic austerity policies, pledging to tax banks and the well-off to fund schools and infrastructure, and to create jobs.Both political blocs have supported immigration policies that opened Sweden\u2019s doors to tens of thousands of refugees from Syria, Somalia and Iraq, straining housing and public services while giving the Sweden Democrats an easy target for public dissatisfaction.Stefan Lofven, the Social Democrat leader poised to become the new prime minister, on Monday extended a hand to smaller parties of the center-right.\u201cI have been negotiating most of my adult life,\u201d Mr. Lofven, a former trade union leader, said at a news conference. \u201cWe will have a cooperation across bloc boundaries. Now begins the process of crafting alliances between the parties.\u201dBut he faces a Rubik\u2019s cube of political calculations, as leaders of potential coalition partners on the left and the right expressed their entrenched hostility toward each other.\u201cIt is too early to predict if we could support a government with bourgeois ministers,\u201d the Left party leader, Jonas Sjostedt said. \u201cBut we are not willing to be in a government with the Liberals,\u201d a reference to a center-right party that won 5.4 percent of the vote. He also said, \u201cwe are too far away from the Center party to be in government with them.\u201d Mr. Lofven said later Monday that he would not have Left party members in his government, and in response, Mr. Sjostedt said that the Left would become an opposition party.The right-leaning daily Svenska Dagbladet said in an opinion column that Mr. Lofven\u2019s win was a \u201cPyrrhic victory,\u201d describing both political blocs as losers. The left-leaning Dagens Nyheter wrote that eight years of center-right rule had broken the political hegemony of the Social Democrats, but the price was the prospect of an era of \u201cweak governments and painful compromises.\u201dParliament reconvenes on Sept. 30, the earliest date by which Mr. Lofven can receive a formal mandate to form a government. He then has three weeks to present a budget. Carl Bildt, the outgoing foreign minister, said on his blog, \u201cIt is in fact the most difficult parliamentary situation that we had in our modern history.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Economic Gender Gap Will Eventually Close", "Date": "2014-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewDebates over the supposed differences between men and women are a staple of pop culture. But two new books offer an economic look at the evidence, giving support to both pessimistic and optimistic perspectives on the direction of gender relations and the prospects for more fairness and equality. In another test, called the ultimatum game, one player received $10 and then decided how much of it to offer to a partner. (Let\u2019s say the first player suggests, \u201c$8 for me, $2 for you.\u201d If the respondent accepts the offer, that\u2019s what each gets. If the respondent is offended by the unequal division or dislikes it for any other reason, he or she may refuse, and then no one gets anything.)In sum, these research results suggest that women are perceived as easier to take advantage of in a variety of economic settings. That\u2019s the bad news, and it comes from measuring a difference in gender behavior at a specific point in time. Drawing upon data from politics, business meetings and behavior in the corporate boardroom, they portray a society where women participate less in many public settings, especially those in which real power is exercised. This links up with the experimental results described in Mr. Eswaran\u2019s book, because an underparticipating group that doesn\u2019t resist discrimination is more likely to suffer.This sounds gloomy so far. But the authors show that once women achieve a critical mass in a particular area, their participation grows rapidly, at least after basic norms of inclusion have been established. In fact, the general method of economics provides foundations for some feminist views. First, economics emphasizes that incentives matter and that incentives can be changed. These are common themes underlying feminist thought, which stresses how a fairer social environment can give people greater reason to choose better behavior.Second, the long-term response to a change in incentives is often much greater and more important than the short-term response. For instance, Mr. Karpowitz and Ms. Mendelberg show that, over time, men behave in a less stereotypically male way when more women are participating in an organization or an activity.As a former chess player, I am struck by the growing achievements of women in this great game \u2014 one in which men were once said to have an overwhelming intrinsic advantage. (Among the unproven contentions was that men were better at pattern recognition.) Although women were never barred from touching the chess pieces, strong female players were few in number.

{"Headline": "Finland\u2019s Lesson for Ukraine", "Date": "2014-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorHELSINKI, Finland \u2014 If you want to get a rise out of a Finn, start talking about \u201cFinlandization\u201d and small countries\u2019 subservience to their larger neighbors. The former American national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, has used the term to suggest that accepting Russian domination is the only course Ukraine can take. I disagree. Finlandization \u2014 or the challenge of surviving as a small nation in the shadow of a larger one \u2014 can be an inspiration for Ukraine, but it doesn\u2019t work the way Mr. Brzezinski thinks. Russia has had problems over the past 20 years with all of its neighbors with one notable exception \u2014 Finland. And this is a Finnish rather than a Russian achievement.Despite escaping occupation during and after World War II, Finland\u2019s continued survival depended on dealing with Stalin\u2019s heirs without becoming subservient to them. Small countries living in the shadow of larger and stronger neighbors must find their own way to survive. And Finland\u2019s experience is unique because of the crucial fact that it was never occupied by the Red Army. Finlandization isn\u2019t a synonym for capitulation; it\u2019s the key to managing an asymmetric power relationship.As the Swedish historian Kristian Gerner has argued, centuries of Russian history demonstrate that Moscow has two approaches to neighboring countries: the models of Kazan and Manchu. Under the first model, Russia absorbs, overwhelms or keeps bullying its neighbor as it did in 1552 when Ivan the Terrible conquered the Khanate of Kazan. Under the second model, it recognizes the neighbor as equal or too big to confront as it did in the 1689 Nerchinsk Treaty, Russia\u2019s first border treaty with China. For centuries, there was nothing in between. But Finland proved in the postwar years to be the exception.It\u2019s not difficult to sort Russia\u2019s present neighbors into Mr. Gerner\u2019s categories. Russia has demonstrated on several occasions in its handling of conflicts in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine that is has no compunction when it comes to attacking weaker neighbors and seizing territory. Finland survived and prospered after World War II because it was ahead of its time. In an era of near total polarization, it adapted the principles of asymmetric defense to its very difficult geographic situation. Finland was far from a vassal to the Soviet Union. It maintained its democracy, a low-profile military defense and above all its Western orientation. How we were able to do this is the true story of Finlandization. The strategy worked because Finland remained true to its principles: credible defense and a strong free-market system. After Stalin\u2019s death, Finland\u2019s president, Urho Kekkonen, used two arguments to turn the tables on Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. First, he made clear to the Soviets, without explicitly saying so, that Finland would defend its independence, as it had done in repelling two Soviet attacks in 1939 and 1944. Second, he convinced them that Finland\u2019s economy would suffer and that Russia\u2019s own interests would be harmed if the Soviet Union prevented Finland\u2019s integration into postwar West European economic arrangements such as the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Community. Finland remained the Soviet Union\u2019s largest Western trading partner until the 1970s. Joining the European Union in 1995 was a homecoming. Viewed from this perspective, President Petro Poroshenko of Ukraine is following the right course. After assuming office, he moved rapidly to sign the association agreement with the European Union, leaving no doubt about Ukraine\u2019s choice to be part of the West. At the same time, Mr. Poroshenko fortified Ukraine\u2019s defenses against a Russian military intervention in the East. One result of Moscow\u2019s aggression has been the emergence of a strong Ukrainian national identity. Russia has grabbed Crimea and destabilized Eastern Ukraine \u2014 but it has lost the Ukrainians. In a globalized world, Russia cannot prosper as an angry island, however large it may be. Russia has already wrecked its relations with Europe and the United States. Banking sanctions are particularly painful, and its economy is bound to suffer. Renewed interest in NATO membership in Finland and Sweden, which are not part of the alliance, is only one of the unintended consequences. As we have observed in recent months, Russia is pivoting toward China. But this does nothing to diminish Russia\u2019s isolation; the role of a junior partner to the Middle Kingdom isn\u2019t an enviable one. Russia\u2019s inability to deal with its neighbors is its predicament. The maxim of defining security by total control of its perimeter and attempting to direct the policies of its neighbors by diktat is no solution to modern Europe\u2019s problems. It provides neither security nor stability. The best Russia can now hope for is a deal in the form of a peace treaty, which would effectively give it title to Crimea. Otherwise Crimea will remain toxic for investors and a no-go destination \u2014 harming Russia more than Ukraine.Ukraine\u2019s best defense is to pull together and show, as Finland did in the 1960s and 1970s, that Russia\u2019s insistence on preventing Ukraine\u2019s economic integration with Europe will foster dysfunction and chaos that Moscow can ill afford.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Inflation Stabilized in August", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Estimated inflation in the eurozone was revised upward on Wednesday, tempering fears that the currency bloc is in danger of being caught in a destructive downward price spiral.Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, said that the annual rate of inflation in the 18 countries that use the euro was 0.4 percent in August and therefore unchanged from July. Eurostat had earlier estimated August inflation at 0.3 percent.Inflation remains well below the European Central Bank\u2019s official target of just below 2 percent. The revised figure for August suggests that inflation may have stabilized, but is unlikely to end a debate among economists about whether the eurozone is at risk of deflation \u2014 a broad, sustained decline in prices that is associated with depression and high unemployment.Moderate inflation is regarded as healthy for economies, in part because it provides a cushion against deflation. When deflation takes hold, consumers delay major purchases because they expect prices to fall further. Corporate sales and profits suffer, which forces companies to lay off workers, creating a vicious circle of falling demand.As Japan has illustrated, reversing deflation is extremely difficult, which is why many economists have watched falling inflation in the eurozone with alarm.Another school of thought, though, says that falling prices are necessary for countries like Greece or Spain to regain competitiveness. The inflation rate in Greece was minus 0.2 percent in August and it was minus 0.5 percent in Spain, according to Eurostat, leading some economists to argue that the countries are already in a period of deflation.Among eurozone countries, Estonia, Italy, Portugal and Slovakia also recorded negative inflation in August. The highest inflation rate was in Austria, at 1.5 percent. Finland, with inflation at 1.2 percent, was the only other eurozone country in which inflation exceeded 1 percent in August.Among the 10 countries that are in the European Union but that do not use the euro, inflation ranged from minus 1 percent in Bulgaria to 1.5 percent in Britain.Eurostat said that the biggest price increases were at restaurants and cafes, in rents, and in vehicle maintenance. The biggest price declines were in fuel, fruit and telecommunications services.Advertisement"}

Poroshenko of Ukraine on Thursday implored Congress to provide Ukraine\u2019s soldiers with heavy military equipment as his country seeks to repel what he called a continuing invasion by Russian forces.But after meeting with President Obama in the Oval Office later in the day, Mr. Poroshenko said he was satisfied with American support that falls short of his request.

We are ready to fight.\u201dSpeaking in English, he urged the United States to come to the aid of Ukrainian soldiers who are battling with Russian-backed forces in the eastern part of his country. \u201cThey need more military equipment, both lethal and nonlethal,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease understand me correctly. Blankets, night-vision goggles are also important, but one cannot win the war with blankets.\u201dOn Wednesday, the White House pledged an additional $46 million in security assistance that it said would help support Ukraine\u2019s military and its border guards. The United States will also send an additional $7 million to international relief agencies to be spent on humanitarian needs in the eastern part of Ukraine, the Obama administration said.In the White House meeting with Mr. Obama, Mr. Poroshenko thanked the United States for \u201cdefending democracy and freedom\u201d and told Mr. Obama that \u201cyou are a friend.\u201dMr. Obama offered words of encouragement but did not promise the lethal military aid that his counterpart wants. \u201cDuring this meeting, we reaffirmed this assistance to Ukraine, and we are providing additional assistance,\u201d Mr. Obama said.Speaking to reporters later, Mr. Poroshenko said he was not disappointed with the president\u2019s decision. \u201cI am satisfied with the level of cooperation with the United States of America in the defense and security sector,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot say more, but I am satisfied.\u201dWhite House officials said the United States did not believe that providing heavy equipment and lethal weapons would help to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, stressed that the United States had provided a long list of equipment to the Ukrainians, including body armor, helmets, night-vision goggles, radar equipment and vehicles. But he said Mr. Obama was not inclined to go further.\u201cIt\u2019s simply the judgment of the president that the best way for the situation in Ukraine to be resolved is through negotiations,\u201d Mr. Earnest said.In his remarks in Congress, Mr. Poroshenko offered thanks for that help, but he said it was not enough. He said the Russian aggression in his country would threaten European nations and the rest of the world if it was not stopped.\u201cHybrid proxy war, terrorism, national radical and extremist movements, the erosion of the national and international agreements, the blurring and even erasing of the national identities \u2014 all these threats now challenge Europe,\u201d Mr. Poroshenko said. \u201cIf they are not stopped now, they will cross European borders and spread, absolutely, throughout the world.\u201dIn addition to requesting military support, Mr. Poroshenko called on Congress to establish a special economic fund to support investment in Ukranian companies as a way of helping to build up the country\u2019s civil society and economy. He acknowledged Ukraine\u2019s history of corruption and bureaucracy \u2014 a legacy, he said, of the country\u2019s ties to Russia \u2014 but he pledged that any assistance from the United States would not be wasted. \u201cI assure you that all aid received from the West will be utilized by noncorrupt institutions,\u201d he said.In concluding his remarks, Mr. Poroshenko used the phrase \u201clive free or die,\u201d a motto associated with the American Revolution. He said that the phrase could also be applied to the Ukrainian soldiers who were fighting against Russia-backed foes on the battlefields in Eastern Europe.\u201cLive free must be the answer,\u201d he declared. \u201cLive free must be the message Ukraine and America send to the world while standing together in this time of enormous challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tunisians Following a Path of Less Rancor", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byListening PostUNITED NATIONS \u2014 Moncef Marzouki, the physician and human rights activist who became president of Tunisia after the Arab Spring swept out the country\u2019s longtime dictator, is a hot ticket at this year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly. And why not?Mr. Marzouki, 69, leads one of the only countries in the Arab world that is not riven by sectarian strife, tribal feuds, jihadist insurgency or American military intervention. Tunisia is two months away from its first popular election for the presidency since the revolution. Mr. Marzouki, who was elected interim president in late 2011, is one of about 30 candidates for the job. An island of stability amid the furies of Libya, Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Yemen, Tunisia is an attractive model for Westerners. Mr. Marzouki, who is devoting part of this annual trip to the General Assembly to selling foreign investors on his country, happily supplies some theories.\u201cPeople are asking me all the time: Why is the outcome so different in Tunisia than in Syria?\u201d he said this week at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI think it is because of structural reasons.\u201dTunisia, Mr. Marzouki said, has few of the tribal or religious cleavages of its neighbors. It is a predominantly middle-class Muslim country with a well-educated population and a developed economy. In a testament to the national consensus, he said, the country was able to hammer out a new Constitution without rancor. And yet, for all his pride in the path Tunisia has taken since the Arab Spring, Mr. Marzouki voiced fear, both for the short term and long term. He worries that extremists will try to disrupt the election over the next 60 days, perhaps by assassinating one of the candidates. Two opposition leaders were killed last year by assassins with links to Al Qaeda.\u201cWe do know we are targeted by terrorists because terrorists, they don\u2019t want Tunisia to be a success story,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want Tunisia to be part of the Arab chaos.\u201dTunisia\u2019s economic problems are compounded by the chaos in Libya, its next-door neighbor. Instead of carrying on vibrant trade, Mr. Marzouki said, Libya has saddled Tunisia with refugees. Its slide into lawlessness poses a critical security threat to Tunisia.Living in such a dangerous neighborhood has forced Mr. Marzouki to make compromises. Tunisia has not reformed its security forces since the Ben Ali era, despite their reputation for torture and arbitrary arrest. Tunisian courts have not yet filed charges against those who killed the two politicians. Mr. Marzouki said those accounts would be settled only after Tunisia had completed its transition to democracy.\u201cI must be frank with you,\u201d he said to a human rights activist. \u201cWe do need badly our security forces. When you are fighting against terrorists, you also have to take this into account.\u201dWhile Mr. Marzouki said he understood President Obama\u2019s decision to go after the Islamic State with military force, he said, \u201cFighting ISIS, without addressing the roots of the problem, seems to me as a physician to take the symptoms but not cure the disease.\u201dOne of the other things that distinguishes Tunisia from Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Yemen and now Syria, analysts point out, is that it has no history of American military involvement. Has that spared it from the strife afflicting its neighbors? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Mr. Marzouki answered, but he hastened to add, \u201cNow we are asking for more involvement \u2014 of course, not military, but helping and supporting the economy of Tunisia.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Jobless Rate: The Worst Benchmark, Except for All the Others", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic IndicatorsThe unemployment rate\u2019s reputation as a reliable economic indicator has taken a beating in recent years. But what\u2019s the better alternative?A decline in the unemployment rate from 10 percent in October 2009 to just 6.1 percent in August once would have been greeted as clear evidence that the labor market was returning to good health. Instead, many Fed officials and economists are arguing that it overstates the actual improvement in the economy.\u201cMost of us have come to the conclusion that we can\u2019t just look at the unemployment rate anymore,\u201d the Princeton University economist Alan Blinder, a former Fed official, told me last month. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge change and a kind of confession of our ignorance or uncertainty about the labor market.\u201dBut the demise of the unemployment rate has been greatly exaggerated. The search for other gauges has failed to produce clear alternatives to the old workhorse. It may not be perfect, but it\u2019s not clear there\u2019s anything better. So the unemployment rate is dead. Long live the unemployment rate.Our story begins with this problem. The adult population can be divided into three categories: Working, looking, outside the labor force. The share of adults who are working fell sharply during the Great Recession and has recovered only slightly. The category of those looking, which is what the unemployment rate measures, has fallen steadily, but mostly because people stopped looking, not because they started working.The great mystery is how many may eventually start looking again. How misleading is the unemployment rate?At first economists expected that most of those people would start looking. That suggested the best gauge of the labor market was the \u201cemployment rate\u201d \u2013 the share of adults with jobs \u2013 or its close cousin, labor force participation, which measures both those who have jobs and those who are looking.But inside the Fed, and among outside economists, there is growing support for the view that labor force participation will not recover. That is the conclusion of a new paper published Thursday by a group of Fed economists.The basic explanation is that the aging of the baby boomers was already reducing the share of adults in the work force. The sharp drop in participation caused by the recession just shrank the work force a few years ahead of schedule.Yet the striking fact about this new index is that it closely tracks the movements of the unemployment rate. \u201cThese indexes are highly correlated with unemployment,\u201d James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, told me. \u201cSo I kind of question how valuable these other indicators are in comparison to our workhorse indicators. How much extra are you getting from the 17th indicator or the 18th indicator?\u201dSo we return to where we began: The unemployment rate remains an inaccurate gauge of the labor market, yet perhaps more accurate than anything else.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Scots Must Vote Nae", "Date": "2014-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorGLASGOW \u2014 To most Americans, Scotland means golf, whisky and \u2014 if they go there \u2014 steady drizzle. Even to the millions of Americans whose surnames testify to their Scottish or Scotch-Irish ancestry, the idea that Scotland might be about to become an independent country is baffling.Yet, this week, a referendum could decide just that. With days remaining before the Scottish electorate votes on whether or not to remain in the United Kingdom, the result is too close to call.Born in Glasgow, but having spent most of my life in England and America, I am rather baffled, too. From the moment in 2012 when a deal was done to hold a referendum on the question \u201cShould Scotland be an independent country?\u201d the opinion polls have shown a consistent and comfortable lead for the Better Together, or No, campaign. But the past two weeks have seen a surge of support for the pro-independence Yes campaign. What is going on?Let\u2019s first deal with some common misapprehensions. This is not a belated revolt by England\u2019s last colony. The Welsh were subjugated in medieval times; the Irish slowly conquered from the mid-1500s. But Scotland and England were united as equals.In one respect even, it was Scotland that acquired England, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne upon the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603. The merger of the two countries\u2019 Parliaments by the Act of Union in 1707 was also consensual, even if the great Scots poet Robert Burns later lamented that the Scottish elite had been \u201cbought and sold for English gold.\u201d To this day, the Scots retained their separate legal and educational systems.Is this a choice, then, between being Scottish or English? No. It is a choice between being inside or outside the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (its full, long-winded name). Like the English and the Welsh, the Scots are British: Indeed, it was James VI who, on becoming James I of England, adopted the appellation \u201cGreat Britain\u201d to reconcile his new English subjects to having a Scotsman as king.Scotland regained its own Parliament in 1999, following an earlier referendum on so-called devolution, which significantly increased the country\u2019s autonomy. Since 2007, there has been a Scottish government, which is currently run by the Scottish National Party. So much power has already been devolved to Edinburgh that you may well ask why half of adult Scots feel the need for outright independence.Yet the economic arguments against independence seem not to be working \u2014 and may even be backfiring. I think I know why. Telling a Scot, \u201cYou can\u2019t do this \u2014 if you do, terrible things will happen to you,\u201d has been a losing negotiating strategy since time immemorial. If you went into a Glasgow pub tonight and said to the average Glaswegian, \u201cIf you down that beer, you\u2019ll get your head kicked in,\u201d he would react by draining his glass to the dregs and telling the barman, \u201cSame again.\u201dSo what kind of appeal can be made to stop the Anglo-Scottish divorce? The answer may be an appeal to Scotland\u2019s long history of cosmopolitanism.The great Scottish philosopher David Hume was contemptuous of what he called the \u201cvulgar motive of national antipathy.\u201d \u201cI am a Citizen of the World,\u201d he wrote in 1764. Hume\u2019s account of the consequences of union with England could scarcely have been more positive: \u201cPublic liberty, with internal peace and order, has flourished almost without interruption.\u201d His only complaint was the tendency of the English to treat \u201cwith Hatred our just Pretensions to surpass and to govern them.\u201d (At the time, the English had not quite got used to Scottish prime ministers, of which there have been 11, by my count.)Petty nationalism is just un-Scottish. And today\u2019s Scots should remember the apposite warning of their countryman the economist Adam Smith about politicians who promise \u201csome plausible plan of reformation\u201d in order \u201cto new-model the constitution,\u201d mainly for \u201ctheir own aggrandizement.\u201d All over Continental Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, nationalism was what ambitious hacks espoused to advance themselves. Scotland was the exception. May it stay that way.Advertisement"}

The latest figures were particularly disappointing because sales had fallen steeply in August 2013, which should have made for an easy year-over-year comparison.\u201cWe\u2019ve actually been seeing a deceleration since April,\u201d Rabih Freiha, an auto analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in London, said. \u201cThe market had been expecting the recovery to continue at the same pace it achieved earlier in the year, around 5 percent, but that didn\u2019t happen.\u201dIn the year through August, European car registrations reached nearly 7.9 million, on pace for fewer than 12 million new passenger cars this year. The market peaked at nearly 16 million in 2007, but analysts say it could be many years before that figure is reached again.Mr. Freiha said it appeared that the revised industry consensus for European market growth this year of around 4 percent would look increasingly shaky if the pace did not pick up.The American market, in contrast, is back at precrisis levels, he said, lifted by replacement demand and easy financing terms, and is expected to grow about 6 percent this year.\u201cThe risk of a sanctions spiral with Russia continues to exist and economic activity in the eurozone remains disappointing,\u201d Clemens Fuest, the institute\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cLast but not least, it is difficult to assess potential consequences of Scottish independence.\u201dSales remained robust in Spain in August, growing 13.7 percent from a year earlier, helped by a government rebate program for trade-ins of older models.The British market, which Mr. Freiha said accounted for about 35 percent of the recovery over the last year, also continued to do well, growing 9.4 percent in August, helped by easy financing terms and a more robust economy than on the Continent.Sales of cars made by the Volkswagen Group, the largest European automaker, outpaced the pack in August, growing 9.4 percent from a year earlier on the strength of a 14.1 percent increase in sales of its main VW brand.PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the Continent\u2019s No. 2 carmaker, posted a rise in sales of 1 percent, while sales fell 3.1 percent at the third-largest manufacturer, Renault. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s sales fell 2.8 percent.Sales at Ford Motor rose 17.4 percent from a year earlier, while General Motors\u2019 sales fell 14.7 percent.Sales at both of the main German luxury carmakers fell, with BMW down 1.4 percent and Daimler posting a fall of 5.4 percent.Advertisement"}

At the same time, China, where Royal DSM has some 40 plants, is losing its edge. \u201cIt is less attractive than it used to be as a source from which to serve the world,\u201d Mr. Tanda said.For the last time the United States was as competitive as it is now, he added, \u201cyou have to go back to before the first oil shock in the 1970s.\u201d Of the $3.6 billion in acquisitions by Royal DSM since 2010, 80 percent has come to the United States.Could globalization make a U-turn?Over the last year or two, a growing number of business analysts have been arguing that we are entering a new era of global manufacturing, with the United States at center stage.But before becoming overly excited about the prospects for an American industrial renaissance, it is worth looking more skeptically at the claim that globalization has run its course.\u201cI don\u2019t agree that China\u2019s moment is coming to an end,\u201d said Karl P. Sauvant at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. \u201cThe most important determinant of investment is market size and market growth, and China remains a big market and continues to grow at a reasonable pace.\u201dSo what if workers in China\u2019s coastal areas are becoming more expensive? The country will move up the value-added ladder to make more sophisticated stuff. Indeed, countries tend to trade more as their incomes converge, not less. Manufacturers seeking cheap labor still have plenty of places to go, like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Mexico or even China\u2019s heavily populated hinterland, which will benefit from Beijing\u2019s huge investments in transportation infrastructure connecting it to the coast.There are dynamics that could put a real dent in globalization. If energy prices take off again, that will favor regional rather than global production networks. Intellectual property piracy in China might temper multinational corporations\u2019 appetite to invest in advanced industries there.Technologies that allow fewer workers to perform more sophisticated tasks \u2014 3-D printing, say \u2014 might encourage more production in rich countries, near consumer markets.Terrorism and political instability could slow the process further, adding another layer of cost to global production networks.Perhaps China\u2019s rising costs will finally provide a break to American workers who have been losing ground for two decades to a once-bottomless pool of cheap workers.Even if the United States draws a larger share of global manufacturing, lots of high-wage jobs are unlikely to follow.Jan Svejnar at the Center on Global Economic Governance at Columbia\u2019s School of International and Public Affairs is optimistic about American prospects. \u201cThe most promising emerging market in the world is the United States,\u201d he told me. But any new manufacturing that develops here will be capital-intensive, he added, relying on far fewer factory workers than in the past.And for all the hope that cheap and abundant American energy or rising Chinese labor costs might drive a wave of reshoring, it isn\u2019t happening yet.James B.

Is there an historical bar (300 years of existence? 50 years? 10 years?) that must be surpassed to demonstrate a sense of valid \u201cgroupness,\u201d or can new facts on the ground through ethnic cleansing create links between persons and territories that are then legitimized in the international realm through self-determination exercises and state recognition?These are not just academic questions, as the wars in the Balkans have shown. The impact of the referendum on Scotland could add fuel to efforts to create more societies based on dominant \u201cin groups\u201d and other \u201cout groups,\u201d and greatly complicate relations among nations in an already unwieldy international community.\u00a0Re \u201cAuchtermuchty to England\u201d (Sept. 11): Roger Cohen calls the Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond \u201creckless,\u201d a scurrilous charge that one could also level against any leader of an independence movement. George Washington could have lived a comfortable life under British rule, but chose a bold path leading to self-government. Mr. Salmond has hardly led an ill-considered revolt. Rather, he has carefully pushed for a referendum, a route much more rationally democratic than reckless.\u00a0Re \u201cFrom Kurdistan to Texas, Scots spur separatists\u201d (News, Sept. 12): Scotland\u2019s approaching referendum is gaining a massive amount of international support. If the voters in Scotland favor separation, it is important that independence and national sovereignty be acknowledged by the rest of the world.Countries such as India and Ireland have already been granted independence. Britain\u2019s response to the referendum has to take into consideration the international support for Scotland\u2019s move toward independence.\u00a0Re \u201cScots, what the heck?\u201d (Sept. 10) by Paul Krugman: As a Scot who lives in England, my short-term concern about independence is the prospective damage to the economic recovery in Britain.The issue of which currency an independent Scotland would use is practically unresolvable without real economic pain. The euro illustrates the problem of not sharing political control with a currency. Scotland would have to go from huge debt to near-balanced books, and it would be very painful reducing health and social spending while the larger companies left for England.My main concern is that the recent return of geopolitics (the end of the \u201cEnd of History\u201d) has not yet registered with the British public. Scotland could lead a number of other regions in Europe into leaving their present states. Any consensus for NATO or the European Union to act against a potential aggressor would be much harder to achieve.Russia is perhaps the obvious threat right now, but others will arise over the next decades. Although only 10 percent of the United Kingdom would be lost through Scotland\u2019s independence, the psychological impact (and loss of submarine bases in Scotland) could lead to the remainder of Britain leaving its position as the staunch ally of the United States and the bridge to Europe, the glue that holds the Western world together.America may look to Europe and see a bunch of smaller nations declaring non-nuclear policies, minimal defense spending and a fear to rock the boat with the aggressors that may be keeping their economy going. This would not encourage decisive intervention when needed to protect open societies and democracy in Europe and elsewhere.\u00a0John Redwood, a Westminster member of Parliament, recently posed a key question: Who speaks for England? He correctly stated that we need a voice and a new deal. William Hague, standing in for David Cameron (who was in Scotland pleading for Scots to remain within the U.K.), responded by arguing that having represented Yorkshire for 25 years, he can claim to speak for England from time to time. But while individual M.P.s may speak out on England\u2019s behalf if they so wish, they are neither elected nor mandated to do so.The 2012 Future of England survey showed strong support among respondents in England for a form of governance that treats England as a distinct political unit. Only 8 percent of those surveyed supported regions in England having their own elected assemblies. There was an overwhelming vote, in 2004, against a regional assembly in the Northeast and 9 out of 10 cities rejected elected mayors in referendums in 2012. Yet Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has now endorsed a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research proposing a new wave of combined local authorities headed by directly elected \u201cmetro mayors.\u201d Such proposals clearly do not speak for England and it is for England, not for Mr. Clegg, to decide upon England\u2019s system of local governance.Whether after Scotland\u2019s decision we in England are left in a U.K. offering further devolution of powers to Scotland, or a U.K. of England, Wales and Northern Ireland alone, in order to truly speak for England M.P.s of English constituencies in all parties need to reject further attempts at imposing regionalization on England, and instead share their support for a devolved Parliament for the people of England, maintaining the unity and the identity of England as a distinct nation.The writer is a member of the Campaign for an English Parliament.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Struggling to Starve ISIS of Oil Revenue, U.S. Seeks Assistance From Turkey", "Date": "2014-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is struggling to cut off the millions of dollars in oil revenue that has made the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria one of the wealthiest terror groups in history, but so far has been unable to persuade Turkey, the NATO ally where much of the oil is traded on the black market, to crack down on an extensive sales network.Western intelligence officials say they can track the ISIS oil shipments as they move across Iraq and into Turkey\u2019s southern border regions. Despite extensive discussions inside the Pentagon, American forces have so far not attacked the tanker trucks, though a senior administration official said Friday \u201cthat remains an option.\u201d In public, the administration has been unwilling to criticize Turkey, which insists it has little control over the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq and Syria across its borders, or the flow of oil back out. One senior official, calling President Obama\u2019s recent conversations with Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, \u201csensitive,\u201d said the decisions about what the country will do to counter ISIS \u201cwill be theirs to make.\u201dBut behind the scenes, the conversations about the Sunni extremist group\u2019s ability to gather vast sums to finance its operations have become increasingly tense since Mr. Obama\u2019s vow on Wednesday night to degrade and ultimately destroy the group. Turkey\u2019s failure thus far to help choke off the oil trade symbolizes the magnitude of the challenges facing the administration both in assembling a coalition to counter the Sunni militant group and in starving its lifeblood. ISIS\u2019 access to cash is critical to its ability to recruit members, meet its growing payroll of fighters, expand its reach and operate across the territory of two countries. \u201cTurkey in many ways is a wild card in this coalition equation,\u201d said Juan Zarate, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and author of \u201cTreasury\u2019s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Financial Warfare.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great disappointment: There is a real danger that the effort to degrade and destroy ISIS is at risk. You have a major NATO ally, and it is not clear they are willing and able to cut off flows of funds, fighters and support to ISIS.\u201d The victories gained by the militant group calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were built on months of maneuvering along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers.Turkey declined to sign a communiqu\u00e9 on Thursday in Saudi Arabia that committed Persian Gulf states in the region to counter ISIS, even limited to the extent each nation considered \u201cappropriate.\u201d Turkish officials told their American counterparts that with 49 Turkish diplomats being held as hostages in Iraq, they could not risk taking a public stance against the terror group. Still, administration officials say they believe Turkey could substantially disrupt the cash flow to ISIS if it tried.\u201cLike any sort of black market smuggling operation, if you devote the resources and the effort to attack it, you are unlikely to eradicate it, but you are likely to put a very significant dent in it,\u201d a senior administration official said on Saturday.A second senior official said that Mr. Obama\u2019s national security team had spoken several times with Mr. Erdogan and other top Turkish officials in the past two weeks about what they can do to help counter ISIS, and that ISIS\u2019 financing was part of those discussions. \u201cStopping the flow of foreign fighters, border security and dismantling ISIL funding networks are also key aspects of our strategy, and we will continue to work closely with Turkey and our other partners in the region on these efforts in the days ahead,\u201d the official said, using a different acronym to describe the militant organization. At the core of the talks are the dozen or so oil fields and refineries in Iraq and Syria on territory the group has controlled. The output has provided a steady stream of financing, which experts place at $1 million to $2 million a day \u2014 a pittance in terms of the global oil market, but a huge windfall for a terror group. \u201cOil is a huge part of the financing equation\u201d that empowers ISIS, said James Phillips, the senior fellow for Middle Eastern Affairs at the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based research center. The territory ISIS controls in Iraq alone is currently producing anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil a day, which can fetch a minimum of $1.2 million on the black market, according to Luay al-Khatteeb, a visiting foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, who also directs the Iraq Energy Institute. Some estimates have placed the daily income ISIS derives from oil sales at $2 million, though American officials are skeptical it is that high.\u201cThe key gateway through that black market is the southern corridor of Turkey,\u201d Mr. Khatteeb said. \u201cTurkey is becoming part of this black economy\u201d that funds ISIS.But targeting the smuggling network has proved a major challenge, and so far the Turkish authorities have been unwilling to cooperate.\u201cThey\u2019ve been turning a blind eye to it, because they benefit from the lower price of smuggled black-market oil,\u201d Mr. Phillips said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure there are substantial numbers of Turks that are also profiting from this, maybe even government officials.\u201d. The supply chain of routes, individuals, families and organizations that allow the oil to flow are well-established, some dating back decades, to when President Saddam Hussein of Iraq smuggled oil during the United Nations\u2019 oil-for-food program. \u201cThose borders have never been sealed, and they never will be sealed,\u201d Mr. Phillips said.For the Obama administration, getting at ISIS\u2019 oil revenue is far more complex than, say, its crackdown on Iran. That has been the administration\u2019s most successful use of sanctions, and officials credit the effects on Iran\u2019s economy, along with American sabotage of its nuclear facilities, for Iran\u2019s reluctant decision to negotiate on the future of its nuclear enrichment program. But Iran used fairly conventional means of reaching oil markets, and not one of its techniques applies to ISIS\u2019 black-market sales, which take place mostly through networks of smugglers.The long-term American plan appears focused on persuading Turkey to crack down on the smuggling networks \u2014 some of which, one Western diplomat noted, \u201cbenefit a powerful Turkish elite\u201d \u2014 and aiming at the refiners who would ultimately have to turn the crude oil into petrochemical products. But gathering the intelligence is a slow process, analysts say.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to use any of the suite of tools that are available to the U.S. Treasury Department to sanction people in this case,\u201d said Patrick B. Johnston, a RAND Corporation researcher who is working on a top-to-bottom study of ISIS\u2019 financing and organization. \u201cGetting a grip on who the right financial targets would be at the Treasury Department would be difficult.\u201dThat is equally true of the other major source of ISIS money \u2014 its extortion activities in the areas it controls, said Mr. Johnston, who is examining declassified documents that detail the group\u2019s funding streams. ISIS demands anywhere from 10 percent to 20 percent of revenue from businesses in its territories and operates other \u201cmafia-style\u201d rackets that yield as much as $1 million a day.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Political Shift Stalls Efforts to Overhaul Immigration", "Date": "2014-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 By the time Senator Angus King called the White House to warn President Obama against taking executive action to overhaul the immigration system, officials were well aware they had a problem on their hands.What had once looked like a clear political imperative for both parties \u2014 action to grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants \u2014 had morphed instead into what appeared to be a risky move that could cost Democrats their majority in the November midterm congressional elections. But Mr. King, a Maine independent who is a member of the Democratic caucus, warned Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, of yet another nightmare scenario: Unilateral action by the president might undermine the prospects for bipartisan agreement on a broad immigration overhaul for years to come.After a summer in which a surge of Central American migrants into the United States at the southern border had reawakened public worries and anger about immigration, and with Republicans running attack ads against Democratic senators on the topic, the issue had simply become too toxic and combustible for Mr. Obama. \u201cIf we were to act in this political hothouse environment, that would undermine the long-term ability to finish the job on immigration reform,\u201d one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.It was a stark turnabout that demonstrates a stunningly quick shift in the politics of overhauling United States immigration laws, which looked like an imperative after the 2012 presidential election, when Republicans received a paltry 27 percent of the Hispanic vote and said publicly they needed to re-evaluate their hard-line immigration stance.\u201cAll the progress we\u2019ve made over two years was destroyed in six weeks,\u201d said Tamar Jacoby, who has advised Republicans on immigration strategy and heads ImmigrationWorks USA, an employer group that backs an overhaul. \u201cIt\u2019s always harder to do something than not to do it, and especially on an emotional topic like this, it\u2019s very fragile.\u201dNow the president says he must go back and repair the broken consensus that had emerged around the immigration issue. \u201cI want to spend some time, even as we\u2019re getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we\u2019re doing this, why it\u2019s the right thing for the American people, why it\u2019s the right thing for the American economy,\u201d he said.In the meantime, Mr. Obama has earned bitter outrage from Latinos, who make up one of his party\u2019s strongest political constituencies. Already angered by the president\u2019s move during his first term to accelerate deportations, activists have called the delay of promised executive action a betrayal.\u201cA guy says he\u2019s going to propose, and then he decides he\u2019s going to delay and not propose for a couple of months, so you go, \u2018O.K., I want a two-carat ring now instead of a one-carat ring,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms. Kelley said. \u201cThe cost is high for what he\u2019s done in terms of a delay. He\u2019s asking the community to pay now, and to some extent, he\u2019ll have to pay later.\u201dIt took about one month for Mr. Obama\u2019s promise to begin crumbling. By early August, the start of Congress\u2019 summer break, Representative Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, had released an attack ad charging that Senator Mark Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas \u2014 one of his party\u2019s most at-risk candidates in November\u2019s midterm congressional elections \u2014 was ignoring an immigration crisis on the United States-Mexico border, where thousands of Central American migrants were streaming into the United States. Other vulnerable Democrats were facing similar ads, and one by one, they began calling top White House officials, including Mr. McDonough, to vent their concerns that if Mr. Obama took executive action, it could cost them their seats \u2014 and their party control of the Senate. The White House requested polling data in key Senate races and received numbers from Arkansas and Iowa, where voters overwhelmingly sided with those opposed to the possibility of Mr. Obama taking executive action on immigration.The decline stemmed at least in part from a perception, elevated by the growing number of migrants, that the southern border was porous and immigration law was not being enforced there.White House officials said it became clear in recent weeks that the crisis had created a mistaken impression that the border was not secure, thus sapping support for further action to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants. Republicans seized on that perception, arguing that Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 directive shielding certain undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children from deportation had prompted the surge.In the end, though, it was a cautionary tale from 20 years ago that swayed Mr. Obama and his team. An important \u201cobject lesson,\u201d said one official, was the 1994 crime bill, which then-President Bill Clinton pushed through before that year\u2019s midterm elections, in which his party lost control of the House for the first time in four decades. Many Democrats, including some who work at the White House, believe the passage of that legislation \u2014 which included the federal assault weapons ban \u2014 doomed a dozen of their candidates and has made the gun issue a toxic one for members of their party to this day.\u201cIt affects the psychology of the folks on the Hill and emboldens the opponents,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhat would be the worst of all worlds would be to act and lose the election, and have people say it was because of immigration reform.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Draghi Says Government Spending Could Help Eurozone Economy", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, on Thursday stepped up pressure on countries like Italy to improve the climate for business. But he also said there was room for governments to use public spending to reinvigorate the stalled eurozone economy.But Mr. Draghi also suggested that countries that can afford it should consider higher spending. \u201cIt may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area,\u201d he said, \u201cwith the view to raising public investment where there is fiscal space to do so.\u201dThe call for more spending was probably aimed at Germany, which has a balanced government budget but which critics say has not invested enough in transportation networks and other public infrastructure.In addition, Mr. Draghi said, governments should consider offering guarantees to encourage lending to small businesses. Specifically, he said, they should consider support for asset-backed securities, bundles of bank loans that are resold to investors. By packaging and selling their loans, banks free up money for more lending.In recent weeks Mr. Draghi has increasingly pushed for countries to roll back work rules and other regulations that he said stymie business investment and job creation. Monetary policy, he has stressed, will not be effective unless it is accompanied by such changes.The pressure from Mr. Draghi on Thursday may have had extra significance because it was delivered in Italy, his home country, often regarded as one of the eurozone\u2019s most sclerotic economies.Mr. Draghi, who rarely criticizes countries explicitly, cited France and Italy as examples of how government red tape throttles growth. Estonia regulates just 45 professions, he said, quoting European Union figures, but Italy regulates 170 and France regulates 219. (Slovakia, which regulates 304 professions, is the most extreme.)\u201cSuch barriers to entry limit competition and employment, creating undue rents for a select few to the detriment of customers,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi said business investment had bounced back in the United States since the financial crisis but had improved only slightly in the eurozone. Investment will recover only when there is ample bank lending, better conditions for entrepreneurs and government stimulus, he said.\u201cWe are currently facing a set of conditions \u2014 low growth and low inflation, high debt and high unemployment \u2014 that can only be addressed by concerted action on both the demand and supply sides of the economy,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. \u201cThis requires all actors \u2014 both at national and European level \u2014 to play their parts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Total Failure on Auto Safety ", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThere is no question that G.M., which hid details about the defect for more than a decade, bears primary responsibility for those deaths. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was also culpable, failing to dig deeper even when presented with information that should have led to an immediate investigation. The defect caused cars to turn off unexpectedly, disabling their air bags. According to a report by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the agency did not follow up on evidence turned up by a Wisconsin state trooper and researchers at Indiana University pointing to a possible link between the defective switch and disabled air bags in a crash that killed two teenagers in October 2006. The agency also did not connect the dots between consumer complaints, service bulletins G.M. sent to its dealers about the ignition switch and reports of accidents in which air bags didn\u2019t deploy.Officials at the safety agency have said there simply wasn\u2019t enough evidence to justify an investigation and that G.M. did not reveal critical information. But the agency should have pressed for more, and, in general, seemed too willing to take the company\u2019s word at face value. Not surprisingly, a stingy Congress is also to blame. The safety agency has very little money and a tiny staff. While advanced electronics have made cars increasingly sophisticated, the transportation administration\u2019s defect investigative office seems stuck in a time warp. Its budget of about $10.6 million has remained essentially the same year after year, and its 51-member staff has 12 people fewer than in 2001. The House report said the agency\u2019s lead investigator on the G.M. ignition case had not attended a formal training class in six to eight years. This is an unacceptable state of affairs. On a practical level, the government cannot hope to keep up with new auto technologies if it cannot hire enough employees and cannot properly train those it does have. No administrator will be able to identify every problem in every car. But the agency will have a much better chance of doing so if lawmakers give it the resources it needs to do the job.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In M.T.A. Capital Budget, a Reappearing Cash Gap", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEvery five years, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority unveils a glossy long-term plan for its vast system of trains, buses and bridges. This week, the capital proposal it released put the cost of keeping the aging system in working order at $32 billion.The figure for the capital budget, as in years past, was billions of dollars more than the available financing. But this gap set a record, totaling $15.2 billion, up from $9.9 billion in 2009, making it a topic of considerable discussion on Wednesday at the authority\u2019s board meeting in Manhattan. Even as the board voted to approve the 227-page capital program, many members said the time had come to rethink how to pay for the authority\u2019s work. Without new sources of revenue, the capital budget gaps will only grow and the infrastructure will only fall into further disrepair, experts and officials said. The board appeared to recognize the need for action by the agency and its chairman, Thomas F. Prendergast, an appointee of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Jeffrey A. Kay, a board member, told Mr. Prendergast that \u201cthe board itself supports you going to Albany, keeping the pressure on to remind people that this needs to happen now.\u201dThe spending plan calls for $22 billion to buy new subway cars and buses and to make improvements to tracks and signals in the system, which serves more than eight million passengers a day. An additional $4.3 billion would pay for new technology like countdown clocks and a more advanced fare payment system. And $5.5 billion would pay for expansions, like the second phase of the Second Avenue subway and the East Side Access project, which is to bring the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central Terminal. It also includes the first request for financing to bring the Metro-North Railroad\u2019s New Haven line into Pennsylvania Station and to build four new stations on the line in the Bronx, a proposal Mr. Cuomo has expressed support for. From the construction of a new Tappan Zee Bridge to the rebuilding of the storm-damaged Montague subway tunnel, which connects Brooklyn to Manhattan, the governor has recently focused on transportation and infrastructure issues. But transportation advocates and experts said that Albany would have to do far more if the region\u2019s subways, buses and railroads are to cope with their advancing age and increasing ridership.Mr. Prendergast said the new capital plan was the start of a campaign to convince riders and state and city leaders that the system needed a lot of money \u2014 and a sustainable way to finance its capital needs. The authority has not done enough to show riders how important the system is for the region\u2019s economy, and making that case will be part of the campaign, Mr. Prendergast said.\u201cWe are going to aggressively go out to inform, to educate and get a consensus together to be able to sell people on the need for $30 billion, and then find the other funding streams we can do to close that gap for that last $15 billion,\u201d he told reporters at a news conference after the board meeting. But many public transit advocates were uncertain that state officials would find the money and said they feared that the authority would again have to borrow money, scale back its ambitions or both. Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a riders\u2019 group, said he was concerned that the authority would rely on borrowing, but he said he believed that Mr. Prendergast, who has worked on transportation issues for more than three decades, wanted to find new sources of revenue. \u201cI believe he\u2019s sincere, and he\u2019s looking for another way,\u201d Mr. Russianoff said. With Mr. Cuomo running for re-election in November and seeking to burnish his reputation as a fiscal centrist, the political climate for any significant changes has not been ideal. But proponents of new state financing said they hoped that after his expected re-election, the governor would be more open to new approaches.At the board meeting, there was discussion about alternatives but few specifics. The governor\u2019s Transportation Reinvention Commission, convened this year to consider the authority\u2019s future, is expected to release a report soon with recommendations for long-term funding. At the meeting, Mr. Kay, who leads a development company, mentioned an idea that has been debated for years: establishing tolls on the Brooklyn Bridge and other East River crossings. But he noted that many of the funding sources the board has considered in the past would need significant political support.In 2008, a plan for congestion pricing pushed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg died in Albany. The plan would have charged drivers $8 to enter a congestion zone in Manhattan during peak hours, with the revenue going to the transportation authority. The capital plan now goes to the Capital Program Review Board, which has 90 days to review it. The gap in the last five-year capital plan was closed mostly by reducing the size of the program and by increased borrowing, according to a report issued in July by the New York State comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. He warned in the report that additional borrowing could increase pressure to raise fares and tolls. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo, Dani Lever, declined on Wednesday to discuss how the governor would address the funding gap. But the state\u2019s financial picture is brighter compared with recent years: As a result of large settlements with banks, New York expects to have a one-time surplus of about $4 billion to divide up in the negotiations over next year\u2019s state budget. In a speech to a business group last week, Mr. Cuomo cited \u201crebuilding the aging infrastructure\u201d in New York as one possible use of some of the windfall. But when he raised that idea, he emphasized the infrastructure needs of upstate New York.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Data on Durable Goods Slides on Aircraft Orders ", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Coming off a strong July, business orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell significantly in August, dragged lower by a plunge in demand for commercial aircraft. Orders in an important category that tracks business investment plans posted a gain.Durable goods orders fell 18.2 percent in August, after a 22.5 percent increase in July, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Both the big increase and the big drop were records, reflecting a sharp swing in demand for commercial aircraft, which is an extremely volatile category that can skew overall results. Airplane orders fell 74.3 percent in August.However, the crucial category that serves as a proxy for business plans for investment rose 0.6 percent. Manufacturing production has been a source of strength for the economy this year, and economists are looking for this to continue.In addition, the Labor Department said on Thursday that the number of people seeking unemployment aid increased last week after falling sharply two weeks ago.Weekly unemployment benefit applications rose 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000. Despite the rise, the level of applications remains near pre-recession levels, a sign hiring will remain healthy. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell for the second straight week to 298,500.In durable goods orders, economists are looking for businesses to step up spending to expand and modernize their operations, a move that will help economic growth.In addition to the decline in demand for commercial aircraft, orders for motor vehicles and parts also fell, declining 6.4 percent after a 10 percent increase in July. The August dip was expected to be temporary, given automakers\u2019 strong sales gains this year.Excluding the volatile transportation category, orders would have risen 0.7 percent in August after a 0.5 percent drop outside of transportation in July.Industries showing higher demand in August included machinery, where orders rose 0.7 percent, and electrical equipment and appliances, where orders rose 3.1 percent.A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing output declined 0.4 percent in August, marking the first decline in seven months. The drop in production came from a sharp fall in production at auto plants, due mainly to seasonal adjustment issues.Broad increases in manufacturing this year have pointed to stronger growth across the economy, suggesting that manufacturers expect business investment and consumer spending to improve in the coming months.A closely watched index compiled by the Institute for Supply Management showed that manufacturing rose to the highest level in more than three years. The ISM manufacturing gauge increased to 59 in August, the highest point since March 2011. The index in July was 57.1. Any reading above 50 signals that manufacturing is growing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young Households Are Losing Ground in Income, Despite Education", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ChartsYOUNG families are better educated than ever before, but they are earning lower real incomes.Since 1989, the Fed has conducted extensive interviews of consumers every three years. Respondents are asked about their family\u2019s income in the previous year, as well as about wealth, debt, education and attitudes toward financial issues. The results are released by family, not by individual, so the median family income may include the income of both spouses. Single-person households are included in the family calculations.As can be seen in the charts, younger families have fallen further and further behind older families as time has passed. Nearly a quarter-century after the first survey was taken, families headed by people over 55 generally have higher incomes, after adjusting for inflation, than their predecessors did. But those in groups under 55 generally earn less than their predecessors.In the first survey, the younger group included families headed by people born after 1954, and so was dominated by baby boomers. The latest group includes families headed by people born after 1984, and they seem not to have done nearly as well early in their careers. The earlier group came of age in a stronger economy and its members were generally not burdened by education loans as many of the latter group are. The largest declines have come since the 2007 survey \u2014 the last one in which participants discussed their income in a year before the Great Recession began. The following survey covered income earned during the recession, and it was not easy to know how much of the falloff was a cyclical phenomenon that would disappear when the economy recovered. But the newest survey covered income in 2012, three years after the recession ended, and shows that most of the lost ground has not been recovered. In fact, the real median income for all of the age groups except those in the 35-to-44 group declined from 2010 to 2013.Among families of all ages, those with more education tend to earn more than those with less. But that differential appears to be shrinking. at least for younger families. In 1989, the median income of families headed by young college graduates was twice that of similar families headed by high school graduates who never attended college. Now, the difference is only 52 percent. There are more college graduates in the group, but those graduates have a lower real median income than their predecessors.Median incomes tell only part of the story, of course. But the relative decline of the young can also be seen in the distribution of high-income families. In the first survey, nearly a third of younger families had incomes that put them in the top 40 percent of all families. That figure has been steadily falling, and in the latest report just over a quarter of young families are in that group.The age group whose real income has grown the most over the last quarter-century covers those age 65 to 74. The median income of that group used to be lower than that of younger families. Now it is higher. People past the traditional retirement age of 65 are much more likely to be working now than they used to be, but higher pension income may also be a factor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Clinton Shifts to Domestic Issues, With a Focus on Women ", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Rodham Clinton has spent the past several months discussing her foreign policy record as secretary of state, but on Thursday she officially dived back in to kitchen table issues during a panel discussion about equal pay for women, affordable child care and paid sick leave.\u201cThe difference women and men face in getting the kinds of jobs that will provide the kind of income they need for themselves and their families is roiling beneath the surface of the political debates,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.The pivot to domestic issues comes as Mrs. Clinton contemplates another run for president and as she campaigns for candidates ahead of the midterm elections, in which women\u2019s issues have become a central focus.Democrats in several key Senate races have attempted to shift the debate from President Obama and the Affordable Care Act to issues affecting the key constituency of women, whose votes could sway close races.Mrs. Clinton said women\u2019s issues have become \u201cimperative in the political environment\u201d and urged voters to make them part of their determination in the midterm elections. \u201cWhen we can turn an issue into a political movement that demands people be responsive during an election cycle, it carries over,\u201d she said.Democrats have said the ability to mobilize women, particularly those who are single and struggling with minimum wage jobs while paying for child care, could determine whether the party maintains a Senate majority and wins governors races in states like Florida and Pennsylvania.Republicans, meanwhile, have accused Democrats of trying to cast some of their candidates as anti-women in order to win votes. Emily\u2019s List, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that supports pro-abortion-rights women candidates, has seized on comments made by Republicans, including an operative\u2019s likening Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Senate candidate from Kentucky, to an \u201cempty dress.\u201dMs. Gillibrand, who has promoted legislation in the Senate to address the sexual assault of women in the military, has lately homed in on other women\u2019s issues, including her personal challenges with weight loss and child rearing, as she promotes her new book \u201cOff the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice, Change the World.\u201d On Thursday, she delivered an impassioned case for paid sick leave for working women.\u201cWe\u2019re the only industrialized country in the world that doesn\u2019t have paid leave,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said. \u201cPakistan and Afghanistan that don\u2019t even educate their girls have more paid leave. That is outrageous.\u201dMs. Pelosi tried to put the issue into a broader context. \u201cIt\u2019s about women, it\u2019s about their families, it\u2019s about their retirement, but it\u2019s also about our economy,\u201d she said.Women\u2019s issues have emerged as a consistent theme in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s post-State Department speeches, especially in recent weeks as she has shifted gears from promoting her memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d to campaigning and fund-raising for midterm candidates.On Friday, Mrs. Clinton is expected to deliver a speech on similar topics at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Forum here, where President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will also speak.At the Clinton Global Initiative, a gathering related to the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in New York next week, Mrs. Clinton will participate in several speeches and panels related to advancing women\u2019s rights, as part of the foundation\u2019s \u201cNo Ceilings\u201d initiative.The events allow Mrs. Clinton to focus on issues affecting women and girls that she has worked on throughout her career, and they also allow the potential 2016 candidate to lay the groundwork for what could be a campaign message focused on elevating women in order to advance the economy.Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and the policy director for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, moderated the event, and told the story of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supportiveness when Ms. Tanden was trying to balance a demanding campaign job with raising small children.The panel also included working mothers. Rhiannon Broschat talked about losing her job at Whole Foods after she had to take a day off work to care for her young son because his school had closed for a snow day, as the politicians on the panel nodded understandingly. \u201cIt\u2019s our lowest income workers who are the most vulnerable,\u201d Ms. Tanden said.Mrs. Clinton tried to tie her work abroad to her domestic efforts. \u201cWhere women are not given the opportunity to pursue their economic well being, their children suffer, their community suffers, indeed,\u201d she said, and \u201ctheir countries suffer.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sting of Guzzler Tax, Frozen for Decades, Fades ", "Date": "2014-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMotoringEven the fastest, most powerful new cars can be classified as fuel-sipping stewards of the environment \u2014 by the federal government\u2019s measure, anyway. Despite increasingly challenging revisions to fuel-economy standards, each demanding significant improvements in efficiency, fewer cars are incurring the gas-guzzler penalties stipulated by the Environmental Protection Agency. To a great extent, this is a result of technology developments made by the automakers, which include hybrid powertrains, smaller turbocharged engines, advanced transmissions and lightweight structures. But the trend \u2014 in 2012, the Internal Revenue Service collected $73.5 million through the gas-guzzler tax, down from $201.7 million in 2006 \u2014 calls into question the relevance of a law that was written in the late 1970s and last updated in 1990.The shrinking pool of vehicles subject to the tax is a sign of the steady flow of improvements, delivered each model year, in which higher fuel-economy numbers have often arrived with little or no sacrifice in horsepower or acceleration. Yet unlike other policies intended to spur the acceptance of greener, higher-mileage vehicles, the gas-guzzler tax has not evolved to keep pace with the market. Even as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy program, new federal greenhouse-gas standards and California\u2019s zero-emission-vehicle incentives prod automakers to continue their progress in raising efficiency, the guzzler tax is losing its bite as a means of promoting efficiency and as a source of revenue. The tax is levied on passenger cars with a combined city-highway fuel-economy rating of less than 22.5 miles per gallon, as measured by the standardized testing procedure of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rules are complex. For instance, the mileage numbers displayed on a car\u2019s window sticker are derived using a different methodology that produces values 20 to 25 percent lower, so a car that displays an E.P.A. combined rating of 21 m.p.g. may not incur a guzzler penalty. And the regulations embody any number of allowances and loopholes. The penalties start at $1,000 and increase to $7,700 for cars that achieve less than 12.5 m.p.g., although there isn\u2019t a vehicle that is taxed at the steepest rate. Automakers pay the fee to the I.R.S., but the cost is passed on to buyers in the price of the car.The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport Vitesse with its 16-cylinder engine is the thirstiest car on sale in America at 10 m.p.g. combined on the window sticker. An unadjusted rating of 12.6 m.p.g. means it is subject to a $6,400 guzzler tax, higher than any other model. That may be a pittance compared with the Bugatti\u2019s $2.3 million price, but even if the tax has a negligible effect on the car\u2019s cost (or a customer\u2019s decision to buy), there are alternatives, also fast and exotic, that escape the tax altogether.The 887-horsepower 2015 Porsche 918 Spyder, the quickest production vehicle that Car and Driver magazine has ever tested, charges to 60 m.p.h. in 2.2 seconds and rockets through the quarter-mile in 9.8 seconds with its V8 engine roaring. Two electric motors and a lithium-ion battery pack add a power boost when the car is driven hard but can also deliver up to 12 miles of electric-only range if driven conservatively. That hybrid system also helps the $847,975 918 Spyder clear the gas-guzzler tax\u2019s 22.5-m.p.g. bar. (The E.P.A. combined rating on the window sticker is 22 m.p.g.)BMW and Mercedes-Benz face the greatest exposure to the guzzler tax when measured by the number of models affected. To reduce fuel consumption in models from their performance divisions, BMW M and Mercedes AMG, the companies are making a transition to smaller engines that drink less in mileage tests and relaxed driving, relying on turbochargers to deliver extra thrust on demand. The engine that powers the 2015 BMW M3 and M4 models, for instance, is a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder engine that replaces the V8s their predecessors used. The new models are quicker and more powerful, yet also efficient enough to avoid the guzzler designation.Rather than promoting efficiency, the guzzler penalty these days serves mainly as a sin tax, having outlived the luxury-car tax that expired in 2002. In 2013, there were roughly 60 nameplates billed as gas-guzzlers, more than half of them with prices starting over $100,000. The cheapest model was a Dodge Challenger SRT8 with a price of $41,020, including a $1,030 gas-guzzler tax; the 707-horsepower 2015 Challenger Hellcat has a $2,100 penalty.Perhaps nothing is more telling of how dated the gas-guzzler regulations are than the fact that pickup trucks and S.U.V.s are not subject to the tax. When the Energy Tax Act of 1978 was passed in the midst of a fuel crisis, trucks were primarily bought for commercial use; their thirst was viewed as an unavoidable consequence of needed capability.But restricting the guzzler tax to cars led to a major shift in the types of vehicles built and bought, with full-size cars declining and the modern sport utility vehicles emerging. Today, light-duty trucks account for more than half of all new vehicle sales in the United States.Changing the gas-guzzler tax penalties requires an act of Congress, and regulatory agencies appear content with the latest fuel-economy and emissions legislation. When asked if the guzzler rules needed to be modernized, Ernesta Jones, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., instead called attention to its greenhouse-gas and fuel-economy standards.The gas-guzzler tax was adopted a year after the Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations went into effect. Originally, manufacturers were held to a single average for their entire year\u2019s production, so a carmaker could offset inefficient vehicles by selling fuel-sipping hybrids and subcompacts. In 2012, the law changed to establish fuel-economy mandates for individual models based on their size, giving manufacturers added incentive to improve their thirstiest vehicles, in some cases lifting guzzlers off the list.\u201cFrom a policy perspective, it\u2019s kind of a belt and suspenders approach,\u201d said David L. Greene, a research professor at the Howard H. Baker Jr. Center for Public Policy at the University of Tennessee, noting that the stricter the fuel-economy standard, the fewer the benefits that accrue from a tax.It\u2019s likely that the gas-guzzler law will be reviewed and rewritten only if legislators decide that, even as cars become cleaner and more economical, the thirstiest cars are always socially unacceptable.\u201cIt\u2019s as much a morality or ethical perception as a question of economically efficient policy,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cWhether it sticks around is more a matter of whether people like it than whether it has a big impact, because it\u2019s not having a big impact.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The label says \u201cJa!\u201d next to a Scottish flag, Flemish for yes.From Catalonia to Kurdistan to Quebec, nationalist and separatist movements in Europe and beyond are watching the Scottish independence referendum closely \u2014 sometimes more so than Britons themselves, who seem to have only just woken up to the possibility that Scotland might vote next Thursday to bring to an end a 307-year union. A curious collection of left and right, rich and poor, marginal and mainstream, these movements are united in the hope that their shared ambition for more self-determination will get a lift from an independent Scotland.In the Basque Country, an autonomous community in northern Spain, the leader of the governing nationalist party has been known to dress up in a kilt and jokes that Basques would rather be part of an independent Scotland than remain part of Spain, which has ruled out any kind of vote. In Veneto, a region of northern Italy, nationalists have held a Scottish-inspired online referendum and now claim that nine in 10 inhabitants want autonomy.\u201cIt would create a very important precedent,\u201d said Naif Bezwan of Mardin Artuklu University in the Kurdish part of Turkey. Across the Iraqi border (\u201cthe Kurdish-Kurdish border,\u201d as Mr. Bezwan puts it), where a confluence of war, oil disputes and political turmoil has renewed the debate about secession, Kurds pine for the opportunity of a Scottish-style breakup.History offers few examples of nations splitting up in a consensual way. The velvet divorce between the Czechs and the Slovaks in 1993 is one, the Norwegian referendum on independence from Sweden in 1905 another. But mostly, nation states go to war over their borders.The United States fought a civil war to preserve the union. Turkey fought Kurdish nationalists for decades and still denies them the right to Kurdish-language education. Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia only after a war in the 1990s.In Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory even though Taiwan is effectively independent with its own currency, military and democratically elected government, some hope a Scottish \u201cyes\u201d vote could prompt a more careful deliberation over the island\u2019s future.But it is in Europe that a Scottish \u201cyes\u201d vote would probably create the largest ripples.It would be the first time that a member of the European Union faces secession by a region eager to become a member in its own right. If Scotland succeeds in negotiating its own membership in the bloc, it would suddenly make the prospect of independence seem safer and more attractive elsewhere in Europe, said George Robertson, a former secretary general of NATO.\u201cThere is a serious risk of a domino effect,\u201d said Mr. Robertson, himself a Scot and an opponent of independence. A \u201cyes\u201d vote, he warned, could trigger \u201cthe Balkanization of Europe.\u201dNationalists, however, say that a bit of Balkanization may be just what Europe needs.National self-determination, he said, \u201cis about bringing policies closer to the people.\u201dAcross town, Mark Demesmaeker, a Flemish member of the European Parliament who has decorated his office with a Scottish flag and keeps a copy of the Scottish white paper on independence on his desk, speaks of \u201cfailed nation states.\u201dIn his view, Britain has failed to give the Scots and Welsh proper representation in Parliament, and Spain has failed to deliver democracy to Catalans and Basques eager to have their own independence vote. Other nations, like France and Italy, have been mired in political and economic stagnation. Mr. Demesmaeker\u2019s own country, Belgium, cannot even form a government. (Belgium had elections in May and is still deep in coalition talks; the last time it took 541 days.)Pro-European national movements like his own, the New Flemish Alliance \u2014 now the biggest party not just in Flanders but in all of Belgium \u2014 are the best antidote to the far-right, anti-European and anti-immigrant nationalist movements that did so well in European elections earlier this year, he said.\u201cIf Scotland votes \u2018yes,\u2019 it will be an eye-opener for many people on the street,\u201d Mr. Demesmaeker said. \u201cMost people think it\u2019s our fate to be part of Belgium. But Flanders could be a prosperous nation. It\u2019s a democratic evolution that is going on in different states of the European Union. Eventually we want Flanders to take its place in the E.U.\u201dIf plenty of nationalists have pledged their solidarity with Scotland, the reverse has been less true. The Scottish referendum takes place just days before the regional government of Catalonia is expected to confirm that it will hold an independence vote of its own on Nov. 9, which would override legal and political objections from Madrid.Alfred Bosch, a Catalan lawmaker, said his counterparts in Scotland had shown little interest in being associated with events in Catalonia.The Scots \u201cprobably want to distance themselves from anything that they see as not as ripe and as mature as their own process,\u201d Mr. Bosch said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to create any hostility from Spain or other countries that might also have pro-independence movements,\u201d not least because those governments will have to recognize an independent Scotland and consider whether to allow it into the European Union.Whatever the outcome of the referendum, many nationalists say Scotland has already won.\u201cThey have the opportunity to decide their own future,\u201d said Andoni Ortuzar, the president of the governing Basque Nationalist Party, who wore a kilt in the 2012 carnival to celebrate the announcement of a Scottish referendum that year. \u201cThat\u2019s what national self-determination is,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we ask.\u201dAzam Ahmed contributed reporting from Erbil, Iraq; Raphael Minder from Madrid; and Austin Ramzy from Taipei, Taiwan.Advertisement"}

This entitles Mr. Dougherty to early boarding, free checked baggage and spiffy luggage tags.What his special status as a Premier 1K member does not always do these days, though, is provide him with a favorite perk for frequent fliers: a complimentary upgrade to first or business class. Instead, United first tries to sell him the upgrade, for several hundred dollars.\u201cI kind of feel like it\u2019s something they should comp me on,\u201d said Mr. Dougherty, a lawyer from Santa Monica, Calif., who has flown close to two million miles on United. \u201cIt used to be pretty common, but getting upgrades now is so challenging.\u201dAs planes fly closer to capacity, leaving fewer seats available for upgrades, and as airlines, with an increasing assortment of fees, do everything but shake loose seat cushions in their search for more revenue, perks like complimentary upgrades to the front of the plane are no longer handed out like steaming washcloths in first class.Elite status is not what it used to be. Now, it is only for the ultra-elite.Some airlines, like United \u2014 which declined to detail how its Premier 1K members receive upgrades \u2014 offer upgrades for a fixed price rather than giving them away. Others, like American Airlines, put unsold front-of-the-plane seats up for bid online. The idea, according to analysts, is to squeeze more revenue out of each trip by getting customers who have already bought a ticket to spend more on their seat.\u201cYou\u2019re not incurring any costs; it\u2019s pure profit at that point,\u201d said Tim Winship, the editor and publisher of FrequentFlier.com. \u201cFrom the airlines\u2019 standpoint, it\u2019s low-hanging fruit.\u201dThe danger, Mr. Winship noted, is not delivering enough of the perks that airlines\u2019 best customers have come to count on, like free upgrades. If that happens, a short-term profit is in danger of becoming bad for long-term business.\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky tightrope to be walked there,\u201d Mr. Winship said.Delta Air Lines understands this. Last March, it announced that it would no longer offer complimentary upgrades on its transcontinental Business Elite routes from New York to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Diamond Medallion members, who fly at least 125,000 miles a year on Delta, could get upgrades by using miles or redeeming a certificate.As frequent fliers watched from the back of the cabin as first-class seats sat empty, outrage quickly built. Delta has since changed its policy, loosening restrictions.\u201cWe definitely got feedback from customers, who were seeing seats not being filled up front,\u201d said Anthony Black, a Delta spokesman. \u201cWe made an adjustment. There were specific rules about when you could upgrade into those seats. Now, how people are upgraded is based a lot more on availability.\u201dMr. Kelly said Delta\u2019s backpedal was not surprising.\u201cAirlines push, push, push,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil people push back.\u201dThe change in how airlines award upgrades is part of a broader overhaul of the industry\u2019s rewards program, which is shifting away from being based on miles traveled toward one that rewards customers for dollars spent.It is a model that Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways have long used for their rewards program. Delta and United have announced that they will do the same beginning Jan. 1, and there is speculation that American could do the same once its merger with US Airways is completed.These changes could shift how airline loyalties are viewed.Bethaney Davies, who lives in New Zealand with her husband and young child, is an itinerant traveler and does not belong to any airline\u2019s reward program. Instead, she shops for low fares on all airlines, which gives her greater flexibility. And with so many airlines making upgrades available for purchase, Ms. Davies seeks out inexpensive routes to the front of the cabin.Sometimes that is through a low-priced upgrade offer. Other times it is a smart bid on a flight that has plenty of open first-class seats. They got one recently, with first-class upgrades on a flight from Maui to Seattle for an additional $150 per ticket.But for the customers who spend the most with airlines \u2014 the one-percenters, as it were \u2014 perks of all sorts remain on offer.When Akio Tagawa, a recently minted member of United\u2019s invitation-only Global Services club, arrives at an airport, he goes through a dedicated boarding line. And other than when he had to make last-minute switches, he cannot remember a flight this year \u2014 he has taken 106 so far \u2014 in which he was not upgraded to first class.If he wants to get on an overbooked flight, someone else will be bumped. If he is running late for a connecting flight at a large United hub, like in Houston or Newark, an attendant in a Mercedes S.U.V. whisks him from one terminal to another.Mr. Tagawa, an information technology consultant in Washington, said that while some of the perks are small, he does take notice.\u201cIt is quite a different experience,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Yet when it comes to persuading policy makers, the European Union\u2019s response to technological innovation has been uneven.\u00a0LISBON \u2014 Start-ups like Uber and Airbnb want European consumers to embrace their companies. Yet when it comes to persuading policy makers, these companies have run into regulatory hurdles that have exposed the European Union\u2019s uneven response to technological innovation.Some cities are clamping down on the companies, like Barcelona, where Airbnb, an apartment-sharing service, was recently fined for breaching regional property rental rules. In other cities, like Amsterdam, politicians have passed legislation to help jump-start the local sharing economy.As in the United States, where tech start-ups have also faced legal challenges, the wide-ranging response in Europe often comes down to whether lawmakers view the companies as a threat to local businesses or an opportunity to improve economic growth. Whatever the reasoning, the patchwork of rules and regulations has left companies struggling to navigate regulatory changes.\u201cIt would be paradise for us if we only had one regulator, not thousands of different authorities, that we had to deal with,\u201d said Arnaud Bertrand, a French entrepreneur who co-founded HouseTrip, a European rival to Airbnb.Neelie Kroes, the departing European commissioner for the digital agenda, has supported many start-ups as a way to promote growth and innovation. Some technology companies have even received financing from the European Union to challenge American leaders like Uber.Adolfo Mesquita Nunes, the Portuguese secretary of state for tourism, said his government had studied the response to Airbnb in places like Barcelona and Amsterdam and concluded that \u201cin a digital world, this is an unstoppable movement.\u201dAirbnb allows people to list their room or home for rent for short periods of time. More than half of its business now comes from Europe, with Paris as its biggest listing city in the world, ahead of New York City.In July, the house-sharing start-up received its first fine in Europe, of \u20ac30,000, or about $38,500, for violating a 2012 law introduced by the regional government of Catalonia, whose capital is Barcelona, that forbids renting individual rooms for tourism purposes. Airbnb is appealing the fine.Mr. Mesquita Nunes, the Portuguese politician, said the authorities should focus on improving property tax collection from people using Airbnb. Governments, he said, should not just add rules that are difficult to enforce, even if that strategy upsets traditional hoteliers who are themselves subject to tough regulations.Federico Gonz\u00e1lez Tejera, chief executive of the Madrid-based NH Hoteles, which operates about 360 hotels in Europe, said if regulators granted Airbnb and others unfettered market access, \u201cperhaps they should also reduce the conditions put on us.\u201dPortugal\u2019s new law, which goes into effect in November, sets no limit on how many rooms or how long an apartment can be rented. It forces owners, however, to register their properties online with local municipalities as an apartment or a hostel if it has more than nine rooms.Hotel operators pushed unsuccessfully for more stringent rules, like forcing apartment owners to offer a bathroom with each room, according to Ad\u00edlia Lisboa, the president of the Confederation of Portuguese Tourism. Still, she said, the new law is an improvement if \u201cit gets people into the system who are now renting their apartments and competing with established hotels but not even paying any taxes.\u201dAirbnb argues that it has simply magnified issues that policy makers previously chose not to confront. \u201cUntil services like Airbnb came along, many people weren\u2019t paying any taxes if they rented out rooms to travelers,\u201d said David Hantman, head of global public policy for Airbnb. \u201cWe\u2019re helping to increase transparency.\u201dEven with the changes, greater tax revenues for Portugal are not a foregone conclusion.Andr\u00e9 Penin, 32, started renting out a one-bedroom Lisbon apartment last June for \u20ac45 a night, or about $58, but said he would now study whether the law made it \u201cstill profitable or better to shut down.\u201d\u201cIt has been an incredibly successful and crazy summer\u201d of renting, Mr. Penin said.Some European politicians warn that weaker oversight raises safety risks and other concerns for customers.\u201cAll the risks are currently delegated to people who are the most at risk in the labor market,\u201d said Mei Li Vos, a left-leaning Dutch politician who wants start-ups to hold more legal responsibility for the way people use their services.Vocal opposition by some of Europe\u2019s hoteliers has been somewhat muted by record tourism revenues in countries including Spain and Portugal.Some hotel owners have even welcomed competition from the likes of Airbnb. My Story Hotels, which opened its first establishment in downtown Lisbon this year, plans to have five hotels in the area within 18 months.Alfredo Tavares, its operations manager, said the government needed to oversee the safety and tax compliance of rental apartments, but should not outlaw them.\u201cWith more offers available, Lisbon will have more visibility,\u201d he said.The stance toward Airbnb is different, however, in a city like Berlin, where the population is increasing by almost 50,000 people each year.To allow residents to lease apartments that might otherwise be set aside for short-term rentals, the German capital has introduced rules that ban short-term renting without approval from local authorities. Airbnb has faced similar problems in New York, where politicians say the service has led to a reduction in available apartments.In contrast, cities like Paris have passed rules specifically meant to allow people to rent out their homes through companies like Airbnb as long as they fulfill certain safety checks. But even in these cities, companies have outsourced the collection of local tourist taxes \u2014 often applicable to local hotels \u2014 to the homeowners that rent out apartments through the start-ups\u2019 websites.Yet to build trust with local authorities, Airbnb has recently started collecting taxes on behalf of some city governments in the United States, first in Portland, Ore., and starting next month in San Francisco.Mr. Hantman of Airbnb said the Portland trial had gone well, though he added that the company still needed \u201cto figure out what each city thinks about who should pay each tax,\u201d before it can consider extending the Portland plan to more of the 34,000 cities where it operates.Raphael Minder reported from Lisbon, and Mark Scott from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Redrawing a State in India Drives Land Prices to the Sky", "Date": "2014-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAgiripalli JournalAGIRIPALLI, India \u2014 In this belt of villages near the fertile Krishna River delta, much is as it has been for generations: The cotton soil is as black, the mango trees as heavy with fruit, the tobacco fields as fragrant and deeply green as ever.But there have been curious changes in recent months. An old temple has received an expensive renovation, complete with a new banquet hall, courtesy of community donors. Some plots once tilled by small farmers lie untended, nothing more than overgrown grazing fields for cattle. Locals say \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs have been replaced by \u201cNo Sale\u201d signs as farmers try to fend off a rush of buyers who seem to have appeared overnight.As for who the buyers are, theories abound. At markets and at stalls, people rattle off the names of politicians who reportedly visit late at night to survey a property undetected. They wonder if the recently retired cricket hero Sachin Tendulkar really bought 100 acres in a nearby town, as the newspapers say.At first glance, these mango groves in the middle of nowhere seem an unlikely spot for a speculation boom. But in June, after years of impassioned debate, India split Andhra Pradesh, a large state in southern India, in two, creating India\u2019s 29th state, Telangana. The new state will keep the ancient city of Hyderabad as its capital, so what is now Andhra Pradesh will eventually need a new capital, and these tiny villages could end up on the outskirts of what might be a sprawling new city. In India, the politically connected seem to have a knack for buying land at just the right moment. Privy to government decisions about zoning or development, they are often accused of acquiring land near a planned development or using clout to get land rezoned, ending up with a windfall.In Andhra Pradesh, the location of the new capital has become an opportunity, especially in and around the roughly 25-mile stretch between two towns: the trading town of Vijayawada and the tobacco fields near Guntur, each strongholds of politically connected castes.Ram Babu Nardala, 31, a mango and rice farmer, has positioned himself as the village real estate broker in recent months, an intermediary between farmers and shadowy buyers from town.Mr. Nardala does not know if this expanse of fields will become the new capital, but he does know that business is good. He spends his mornings managing his crop, then drives his new sport utility vehicle, with the chief minister\u2019s party flag on the hood, to a small pillared shack nestled among banyan trees that line the main road. This unassuming space is the spot where many real estate deals in the village are negotiated.\u201cI have a circle of people in Vijayawada,\u201d he said, periodically reaching into his jeans pocket to quiet his ringing cellphone, \u201cand I keep getting offers.\u201dHe recently oversaw the sale of an acre of farmland belonging to his brother-in-law and said the deal brought in nearly $180,000 from a Vijayawada buyer he would describe only as a businessman.\u201cIf you\u2019re farming on it,\u201d he said, \u201cyou won\u2019t even earn 50,000 rupees,\u201d or around $800. The documents he drew up to register the sale show a price that is much lower, he acknowledged. He has arranged eight deals in recent months, he said, some to buyers who have told him to help them flip the land for a higher price. Many say that the beneficiaries of the speculation are not likely to be the farmers, who sell for relatively low prices. Nor will the government benefit, since it misses out on crucial tax revenue by turning a blind eye to off-the-book sales and illegal construction of housing and apartments on land zoned for agriculture.For Andhra Pradesh, which will need an influx of industry after losing Hyderabad, the Vijayawada-Guntur corridor represents an imperfect opportunity.\u201cI know for a fact that politicians are buying land there,\u201d said Anant Maringanti, the director of Hyderabad Urban Lab, an urban research program. \u201cThey\u2019ll build real estate or high-value apartments. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s really going to jump-start the economy.\u201dAnd despite the optimism, a bubble is a bubble, even for locals unfamiliar with the term. One resident compared the astronomically rising land prices to a pot of milk on the burner: quick to boil up, and, once the heat dies down, just as quick to vanish into nothing.\u201cThere has been no government announcement,\u201d said Ponnaiah Krupam, a mango farmer with 10 acres of land and a small store near the main road. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m too afraid to sell.\u201dNaveen Surya, an infrastructure developer based in Hyderabad, tried to buy half an acre near Vijayawada and quickly abandoned the enterprise, daunted by the competition which he believes comes from politicians and the politically connected. By his calculation, the prices offered for this agricultural land in an undeveloped area are exorbitant.\u201cIt\u2019s mafia land \u2014 they\u2019re buying, not registering the land, paying advances, and they want to trade it,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is running behind easy money. That\u2019s what real estate is.\u201dLand prices just outside the district\u2019s bustling headquarters, Vijayawada, are rising more dramatically still. Lagadapati Rajagopal, a former Congress Party parliamentarian from Vijayawada who earned his fortune through construction and his notoriety through using pepper spray during a particularly contentious parliamentary hearing on the split, views its aftermath with something akin to amusement.His company\u2019s name is emblazoned on billboards and roundabouts throughout Vijayawada. As a member of Parliament in 2007, he oversaw the development and plotting of 150 acres of farmland near town. The land value was around $5 million, he said. A year ago, he could imagine its value at close to $100 million. Today, with the speculation over the capital, he cannot imagine its price.\u201cIt\u2019s good for farmers, and it\u2019s good for the government,\u201d said Mr. Rajagopal. \u201cYou can sell part of your land and still make a killing.\u201dHow good rampant speculation will be for farmers in Agiripalli and for the development of the state remains to be seen.Hari Babu Matcha, a farmer near Agiripalli, has invested in a change. He is now in the business of plotting land. He and a group of partners have bought 13 acres of paddy in Agiripalli, planted grass in its place, installed a paved road and a gate, distinguishing it from the surrounding rice fields. He hopes to see it become a gated community of 300 houses for government employees, teachers and a professional class he is betting will flock to the area. More than half of the plots have been sold, but so far, the frame of just one house has been built, little more than a roof supported by wooden beams in a vast field of numbered, empty plots.Mr. Matcha expressed ambivalence about a sweeping change in the region, as do many other farmers, even though he expects to benefit from it.\u201cFirst they developed Hyderabad, and Telangana farmers were totally corrupted,\u201d he said, citing an influx of five-star hotels and a wave of farmers buying new cars, drinking away their days. \u201cNow, this disease will affect our soil,\u201d he said, then added, after a pause, \u201cbut it depends on the capital.\u201dA map that accompanied an article on Monday about the effects that plans for a new capital for the recently divided Indian state of Andhra Pradesh are having on a remote part of the state reversed the positions of the towns of Vijayawada and Agiripalli. Vijayawada is just north of the Krishna River and Agiripalli is northeast of Vijayawada, not the other way around.Sriram Karri contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Home Prices Decline for 4th Month in China", "Date": "2014-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Prices for new homes in China fell in August for a fourth consecutive month, and declines spread to a record number of cities, government data showed Thursday, underlining a deepening downward trend in the property market that is increasingly weighing on the broader economy.The data, released by the National Bureau of Statistics, showed that the prices had fallen in 68 of the 70 major cities it monitors, up from 64 in July.\u201cHome prices dropped on a monthly basis in most cities in August, but some of them saw easing price falls,\u201d Liu Jianwei, a senior statistician at the bureau, said in a statement accompanying the data.Prices slipped 0.9 percent in August in Beijing, easing from a month-on-month drop of 1 percent in July, while prices in Shanghai fell 1.1 percent in August, the fourth month-on-month fall in a row, though not as fast as a decline of 1.2 percent in July.The string of monthly price declines is now close to wiping out gains made over the past year, which could further weaken buying interest and dampen consumer confidence.Price declines deepened on a monthly basis in smaller cities, including the eastern city of Jinhua, where home prices fell 1.7 percent, accelerating from a drop of 0.8 percent in July.Official transaction data showed sale numbers' picking up slightly in August from July. Industry observers believe the downturn could persist in coming months because of high inventories and pessimistic market sentiment.Government data last weekend showed the square footage of property sold rose 5 percent in August from July, though the figure was still 12.4 percent down from a year before.After a strong performance in 2013, China\u2019s real estate market has softened as sales have slowed and banks have become increasingly cautious about lending to developers and home buyers.In the face of sluggish sales, China Vanke, the country\u2019s largest residential developer, has teamed up with Taobao, the Alibaba-owned online shopping site, to offer discounts of as much as 2 million renminbi, or $325,000, to customers who buy property on the site.More than 30 local governments have acted to support the troubled property sector by easing restrictions on home purchases in recent months.\u201cHome prices are likely to drop further in coming months, as developers need to offer deeper price cuts to attract home buyers to enter the market,\u201d said Lin Bo, deputy head of research at China Real Estate Information, a property data provider in Shanghai. \u201cCompared to a year ago, we expect prices to go negative by the end of this year or earlier next year.\u201dIn the last downturn, in early 2012, China started to see year-on-year house price declines after five consecutive monthly drops. Some economists believe the current slump could last much longer given far higher inventories of unsold homes.Developers will face intensive competition in September and October with more new developments introduced in the traditional peak season, analysts said.Moody\u2019s Investors Service said on Wednesday that developers\u2019 profit margins were expected to continue to be weak, as China\u2019s property prices are likely to remain under pressure for the rest of the year with strong supply from new projects in the second half of 2014.Real estate, which directly affects a variety of business sectors in China, was seen as a heavy brake on economic activity in official data, released last weekend, showing that factory output grew in Augusts at its slackest pace in six years. Other August data showed that China\u2019s economic growth appeared to hit a soft patch after a bounce in June.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Big Unhappy Economy ", "Date": "2014-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialThe report, prepared by the World Bank, the United Nations\u2019 labor agency and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, notes that poor job creation and stagnant wages, if unchanged, will result in permanently lower living standards for most people amid widening inequality. It also states that the situation will not repair itself \u2014 and, actually, is self-reinforcing. In the advanced economies of the Group of 20, including the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the European Union, a lack of good jobs at good pay is stifling growth by undermining consumption and investment. In the group\u2019s emerging economies, including India, Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia, underemployment and off-the-books jobs are mostly to blame for undermining output and productivity in the long term. The report calls for action by the G-20 to break those negative feedback loops, including more government spending to bolster consumption, higher minimum wages to raise pay, and renewed commitment to social safety nets. What the report does not say is that none of that is likely to happen on the needed scale, individually or collectively, unless governments change their priorities. When the United States and other advanced economies bailed out global banks, they were betting, wrongly, that a restored financial system would foster broad prosperity. When they turned their policy focus toward austerity measures and deficit reduction, and away from fiscal stimulus, they doubled down on that bad bet. The result has been prosperity for the few, at the expense of the many.The report is clear that when consumption and investment wane, government is supposed to make up the shortfall to revitalize the economy. But governments in the grip of poisoned politics and misguided ideology have largely abdicated their role. Even the Federal Reserve, which has as part of its mandate the maintenance of full employment, has come under pressure to raise interest rates in the near term. That would be a mistake, akin to the premature removal of fiscal support. The evidence in the report presents a global economy that remains weak and fragile. To be strong and resilient, it needs growth that, in the words of the report, is \u201cjob-rich and inclusive.\u201d Theoretically, such growth is possible. Politically, it is still out of reach.

{"Headline": "Raw Politics on French Bookshelves", "Date": "2014-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter From EuropePARIS \u2014 American politicians like to write heavy books, with ponderous titles. Hillary Rodham Clinton invites us to face her \u201cHard Choices,\u201d John McCain tells us \u201cCharacter Is Destiny,\u201d and Mitt Romney makes \u201cNo Apology: The Case for American Greatness.\u201dFrench politicians, in contrast, let it rip. Their books come out often, and fast. They tend to be short (fewer than 200 pages), and their titles are intriguing. Here is a sampling from this season\u2019s list: \u201cI Will No Longer Stay Silent,\u201d by Claude Bartolone, president of the National Assembly (the book comes out Oct. 15, so readers will have to be patient); \u201cThe Parties Will Die ... and They Don\u2019t Know It,\u201d by Robert Hue, a former Communist Party leader; and in a more melancholy vein, \u201cTo Future Generations Who Will Have to Pay for Our Mistakes,\u201d by an 84-year-old former prime minister, Michel Rocard.Not to mention \u201cThank You for This Moment,\u201d the surefire best seller by the former journalist and first lady Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, who tells of how she tried to overdose on sleeping pills after learning that President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was cheating on her.Two other books are making waves this fall, mainly because of their uncanny timing. C\u00e9cile Duflot, a leader of France\u2019s Green Party who resigned as Mr. Hollande\u2019s housing minister in the spring, was the first off the presses in August with \u201cFrom the Inside: A Voyage to the Land of Disillusion,\u201d a blistering account of her two years in Mr. Hollande\u2019s cabinet. And a biography of Arnaud Montebourg \u2014 the economy minister who last month brazenly challenged Mr. Hollande\u2019s policies and lost, taking down the whole cabinet with him \u2014 is due to come out this week. The book, \u201cMontebourg: I, President,\u201d was in the works before the political crisis: Its content only confirms that it was time for Mr. Montebourg to go.Speaking to the book\u2019s author, Valentin Spitz, in January, Mr. Montebourg said of the French president: \u201cHollande lies all the time. That\u2019s why he is at 20 percent in the polls. He lies. He lies all the time. From the beginning.\u201d Three months after he made that statement, Mr. Montebourg accepted a top ministerial job.Ms. Duflot\u2019s description of Mr. Hollande is not much more flattering. \u201cHis main fault is that he doesn\u2019t say what he means,\u201d she writes. She criticizes him for abandoning his Socialist Party base \u2014 and by extension, herself. Her disappointment with a president who failed to follow her advice jumps off almost every page.What is extraordinary about both books is not the disdain Mr. Montebourg and Ms. Duflot share for Mr. Hollande \u2014 recent polls in France indicate widespread dissatisfaction with him. Rather, it is that they openly expressed their contempt even as they sat in his cabinet and \u2014 here\u2019s the key \u2014 thought they could get away with it.This phenomenon speaks to Mr. Hollande\u2019s authority, or lack of it, as well as his inability to unite France\u2019s fractious leftist politicians as he pursues difficult reforms. But it also points to a blinding narcissism common to French politicians, who come to their jobs with a sense of entitlement. It can come wrapped in a blind adherence to ideology (Ms. Duflot sees any attempt to back away from France\u2019s problematic 35-hour workweek as an act of betrayal) or in a remarkable capacity for self-congratulation (Mr. Montebourg declared in July that his only opponent was \u201cpolitical and intellectual conformism\u201d).Luckily for the French, they have other ways to follow politics. They can watch \u201cLes Guignols de L\u2019Info,\u201d a TV puppet show that regularly skewers politicians of all stripes. French cinema periodically offers an unvarnished glimpse inside Paris\u2019s grand ministries and political campaigns: The film \u201cQuai d\u2019Orsay,\u201d based on a best-selling comic book, painted a very funny picture of antics inside the Foreign Ministry.And every summer, mainstream newspapers indulge their political fantasies with fictional series intended to keep readers hooked while on vacation. This year\u2019s topics? \u201cHollande\u2019s Exit\u201d in Le Figaro, and \u201cThe Kidnapping of Montebourg\u201d in L\u2019Opinion, two cases of fiction skirting with facts.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are Bees Back Up on Their Knees?", "Date": "2014-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorIN 2006, beekeepers in Pennsylvania\u2019s apple country noticed the first sign of many bad things to come. Once thriving beehives were suddenly empty, devoid of nearly all worker bees, but with an apparently healthy, if lonely, queen remaining in place. Over a period of just three months, tens of thousands of honeybees were totally gone. Multiply this across millions of beehives in millions of apiaries in the more than 22 states that were soon affected, and suddenly we faced a huge, tragic mystery. Up to 24 percent of American apiaries were experiencing colony collapse disorder (C.C.D.). Despite the new name for this phenomenon, C.C.D. is not an isolated or unprecedented event. Unexplained mass bee die-offs have occurred throughout recorded history, including some as far back as the years 950, 992 and 1443, when Ireland\u2019s beekeepers noted remarkably high mortality events. Reports from the Cache Valley in Utah in 1903 described thousands of dead hives; around the same time, the Isle of Wight in England faced a near total loss of honeybees.I became a beekeeper in 2005. When C.C.D. started, I was studying how social animals like honeybees resisted disease. We still don\u2019t really know why C.C.D. was happening, but it looks as if we are turning the corner: Scientists I\u2019ve spoken to in both academia and government have strong reason to believe that C.C.D. is essentially over. This finding is based on data from the past three years \u2014 or perhaps, more accurately, the lack thereof. There have been no conclusively documented cases of C.C.D. in the strict sense. Perhaps C.C.D. will one day seem like yet another blip on the millennium-plus timeline of unexplained bee die-offs. Luckily, the dauntless efforts of beekeepers have brought bee populations back each time.While this is undoubtedly good news, we cannot let it blind us to a hard truth. Bees are still dying; it\u2019s just that we\u2019re finding the dead bodies now, whereas with C.C.D., they were vanishing. Bees are still threatened by at least three major enemies: diseases, chemicals (pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, etc.) and habitat loss.C.C.D. changed my own career trajectory as I moved away from basic science into applied research, assisting other beekeepers by bringing bee science to the public. Specialists have been talking among themselves about the waning of C.C.D., but have not articulated this to the community at large. C.C.D. created momentum for the greater cause of bee health, of acknowledging the importance of pollinators. We cannot lose this momentum now. Honeybees pollinate more than 100 fruit and vegetable crops that we rely on for food. According to the entomologist Nicholas W. Calderone at Cornell, bees contribute more than $15 billion annually to the economy in the United States alone, and that number soars past $100 billion globally.And yet we are still losing 30 percent of bees annually in the United States. While this figure is startling, these losses differ from C.C.D. because they appear to have stabilized to a relatively predictable level. The danger to bees no longer seems to be increasing. Like those of most beekeepers, my own honeybee hive losses typically happen in winter. As spring turns to summer, my beekeeping team identifies the largest hives and then splits them into two or more to make up for winter\u2019s losses. As for the farmers who need these bees for pollination, the high annual loss rates have forced them to increasingly rely on migratory beekeeping operations, renting bees instead of owning them, which increases the cost of their growing operations. These higher fees, naturally, are passed on to the consumer. The constant churn of moving rented beehives can\u2019t be good for the bees either.The reliance of farmers on migratory beekeeping operations has increased exponentially since their inception around the 1950s. Most honeybee hives today live on flatbed trucks rather than in permanent apiaries. Our future of living with bees has got to be smarter than this. To make our pollination practices efficient once again, we need to pay attention to the data. Just last year, Jeffery S. Pettis of the United States Department of Agriculture and his colleagues published data indicating that honeybees appeared to be getting credit from farmers for work that other bee species were actually doing. We continue to get crops of blueberries, cranberries, cucumbers, watermelons and pumpkins, but honeybee hives in those fields are not filled with pollen from those crops. If honeybees aren\u2019t pollinating them, then what is? The answer most likely lies with the lesser-known 20,000 or so related species of bee. These other bee species could be affected by factors that caused C.C.D. or other honeybee diseases; we just don\u2019t know. We need more research into these other pollinator species in order to make our agricultural system more efficient, increase crop yields, reduce food costs for the consumer, and get those honeybees off flatbed trucks.Behavioral economics can help us find solutions to the agricultural efficiency challenge by creating financial incentives for\u00a0bee-friendly farming practices. Outdated monoculture farming subsidies like those that go to corn growers should be diverted to farmers and growers who are planting a diversity of crops, including wildflowers. Federal tax incentives should go to farmers, beekeepers and everyday citizens who opt for permanent pollinator sources.\u00a0Bees are not the only ones that would benefit from these policy changes; many farmers would see an increase in sustainability and profitability. It\u2019s a Band-Aid solution, but it can work.The future of bees \u2014 all bees, not just honeybees \u2014 remains obscure. But it isn\u2019t just government policy that needs to change. To make the natural world after C.C.D. a better place, we all need to start doing things differently.Noah Wilson-Rich is the founder and chief scientific officer of the Best Bees Company, and the author of \u201cThe Bee: A Natural History.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Puerto Rico Luring Buyers With Tax Breaks", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBig DealAlex Lemond is among a new wave of New Yorkers trading in their Manhattan condominiums for beachside villas in Puerto Rico. The former hedge fund honcho moved to San Juan from New York last year, and his company, the Encanto Group, is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in developing luxury real estate on the Caribbean island. Puerto Rico, a commonwealth of the United States, passed legislation in 2012 that shields new residents from paying most federal income taxes. After a slow start, Puerto Rico\u2019s status as a tax haven is beginning to catch on, and some are betting big bucks that the trickle of buyers moving there will soon become a stream. Local officials hope that new investment will help turn around an economy battered by several years of recession.\u201cI take at least five calls a day from new people considering moving here,\u201d said Gabriel Hernandez, a tax partner with the San Juan office of BDO Puerto Rico. When the law was first passed, Mr. Hernandez advised two people who relocated to Puerto Rico from the mainland United States; last year that number rose to about 15, and so far this year, he has helped more than 80 people make the move and is advising another 60 who are considering it. Under the tax law, known as Act 22, you can pay minimal or possibly no taxes on interest and dividends, as well as capital gains. You must, of course, fulfill certain criteria, including living on the island for at least 183 days a year, although unlike many other tax havens, you don\u2019t have to turn in your passport. The island also passed a companion law that provides tax incentives to certain companies that relocate to Puerto Rico. \u201cPuerto Rico is basically the 51st state \u2014 there is no immigration, you don\u2019t have to spend millions of dollars on lawyers to figure it all out. All the infrastructure is already in place,\u201d said Neal Sroka, a broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate who is working with Encanto. \u201cIt really began with John Paulson,\u201d said Luis D. Ortiz, an agent at Douglas Elliman who also appears in the reality television show \u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York.\u201d Mr. Ortiz, who was born and raised in Puerto Rico but now lives in New York, said he is working with eight buyers, mostly American, who are searching for homes to buy in Puerto Rico.Margaret Pe\u00f1a Juvelier, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, noted that two years ago \u201cthere was a tremendous amount of inventory and people were just renting.\u201d Today, she said, \u201ceveryone is buying and buying at a quick pace \u2014 they recognize if they don\u2019t jump in now, and they wait a year or two, prices will be substantially higher.\u201dReal estate prices in Puerto Rico are down by as much as 45 percent from the top of the market in 2007, said Ms. Juvelier, a New York City native who moved to San Juan two years ago to open up the Sotheby\u2019s office and take advantage of the tax savings. For years, the island has contended with double-digit unemployment and a soaring cost of living that has led to an exodus of many of Puerto Rico\u2019s professionals and middle-class residents, who have moved to places like Florida and Texas. And the island\u2019s economy remains shaky: It had a per-capita income of $17,400 in 2013, far below Mississippi, the poorest state in the union. Its gross domestic product grew at just 0.3 percent last year and is expected to grow only 0.1 percent this year, according to the Puerto Rico Planning Board. But island supporters say this only means there are still values to be had. \u201cIf you look at St. Barts or Miami it is way more expensive,\u201d said Ms. Juvelier, who is importing some of her Manhattan island branding to Puerto Rico, bestowing San Juan neighborhoods with New York City-type monikers like CoBe, short for Condado Beach, to varying success. And it is true that Puerto Rico is a bargain. At the St. Regis Bahia Beach, for example, arguably some of the most expensive real estate in Puerto Rico, condos with oceanfront views are priced at around $600 a square foot; in Miami, a similar unit would cost around $2,000 a square foot. Over the last 10 months, the St. Regis Bahia Beach sold nine condos, priced at $800,000 to $1.6 million, all to American buyers, according to Paulson & Company. The resort is also constructing six oceanfront villas, priced at $10 million to $12 million; two have already sold. Other luxury developments are in the works on the island. The granddaddy of the Puerto Rican hotels is the Dorado Beach resort, set on 1,400 acres. The hotel was built by Laurance S. Rockefeller and opened in 1958, hosting celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor. It has undergone a $340 million makeover, including the addition of a 115-room Ritz-Carlton Reserve hotel, a renovated golf course and oceanfront residences ranging from $1 million to more than $9 million. Marc Grossman, 46, bought a six-bedroom home at the St. Regis with his wife, Stephanie, and four children, and is considering relocating full-time to Puerto Rico from Sands Point, an exclusive enclave on the north shore of Long Island. Mr. Grossman, a senior partner at the Sanders Firm, a law firm based in Garden City, N.Y., recently opened an affiliated law office on the island and has hired 15 employees. Later this month, he is visiting a private school there with his family. \u201cWe are trying to determine when it would be best to transition my four children,\u201d who range in age from 10 to 16, Mr. Grossman said. While there is much to recommend Puerto Rico as a tax haven \u2014 it has better beaches than Switzerland, no immigration hassles like Ireland and is a lot closer than Singapore \u2014 there are the undeniably distasteful politics of fleeing New York to save on taxes. Many island supporters were anxious to tell me about how wonderful it was to relocate there. But many wouldn\u2019t let me disclose their names. Advertisement"}

Today\u2019s automobiles are beeping and chirping at us robotically like R2D2 or Wall-E, raising lights like stage curtains, playing little movies on our screens and serenading us with theme melodies like those of our favorite shows. When we approach, cars do everything short of sighing or cooing.\u201cWe call it the welcome-farewell experience,\u201d said Parrish Hanna, Ford\u2019s world director of human-machine interaction. \u201cIt can be an emotionally resonant experience.\u201d Designers like Mr. Hanna are carefully orchestrating the experience of slipping behind the wheel. This has become more like entering a room than taking control of a machine, with hints of changes to come that may alter the driving experience as profoundly as the self-starter replacing the hand crank roughly a century ago. For some vehicles, saying hello is simple. The Honda Odyssey and Hyundai Santa Fe display the words \u201cWelcome\u201d and \u201cGoodbye\u201d on their screens. Others show more attitude: As you leave one of Ford\u2019s hybrids, you get a digital note of appreciation: \u201cThank you for driving a hybrid,\u201d the screen says. In luxury vehicles, there is more: Colors and textures on TFT screens match the leather and wood of the interior, and logos or images appear with animated razzle-dazzle. Door handles illuminate when the car senses one\u2019s presence (or, at least, the presence of a keyfob). Headlights and cabin lamps rise and fall like footlights on stage; needles on instruments snap to attention and spin around in salute; graphic screen displays accompany theme sounds like the beginning of \u201cDallas.\u201dThe Cadillac ELR, a plug-in hybrid coupe, plays a welcoming theme that is part Hollywood soundtrack, part jet-plane swoosh. Like some other Cadillacs with the Cue driver interface, the ELR nudges the driver gently in the rear end as part of its haptic warning system.The latest fashion among luxury vehicles is the puddle lamp. Like Sir Walter Raleigh gallantly spreading his cloak over a puddle in the path of a lady \u2014 the epitome of Elizabethan chivalry \u2014 several luxury models greet drivers and passengers with \u201cwelcome mats\u201d of light on the ground below the doors. The Range Rover Evoque projects the company logo on the pavement, a trick evocative of Gotham City\u2019s Bat Signal. On its new MKC crossover, Lincoln calls the feature Approach Detection. It illuminates a welcome mat of the brand logo and, Lincoln says, \u201cSimultaneously, headlamps, taillamps and door handles glow with soft lighting tuned to complement the vehicle\u2019s exterior color.\u201d Said Mr. Hanna of Ford, \u201cYou want to have cohesiveness and fit people\u2019s mental models.\u201d But part of the ideal welcome-farewell combination, he added, is to personalize the vehicle. Ford lets Mustang drivers select among various colors for the instrument panel lights. For the sporty Fiesta ST subcompact, the sound can be customized as well. A device called the Sound Symposer lets the driver mix the amount of engine sound fed into the cabin. At Hyundai, designers try to reflect the brand and the character of the vehicle in the greetings, said Derek Joyce, a company spokesman. \u201cWe try to make sure it matches the personality of the vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cAn economy car might be cheerful, while in the Equus the sound would be more classical and mature.\u201dBut often, cars end up sounding like computers or robots. That should come as no surprise, said Dan Saffer, an interaction designer who is creative director at Smart Design in San Francisco. With all their sensors and software, \u201ccars have secretly been robots for a long time,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe trick now is having the personality in not just the body of the car, but also in the behavior of the car.\u201d Other researchers have suggested that humans are hard-wired to approach machines as if they were people. The late Clifford Nass, a researcher in the Revs automotive research program at Stanford University, argued in his book \u201cThe Man Who Lied to his Laptop\u201d that we inevitably impute personality to computers. In a test, Mr. Nass asked people to do a survey on how well they liked their computers. One group filled out the survey on their own computers and another on identical computers they had not seen before. Sure enough, the \u201clike\u201d percentage was higher for those who used their own computers. People, he concluded, did not want to hurt the machines\u2019 feelings. \u201cAlthough it may seem ludicrous, humans expect computers to act as though they were people,\u201d Mr. Nass wrote. But it is not clear that designers have figured out what kind of people. Too many of the new auto greetings grow tiresome and irritating \u2014 the automotive equivalent of AOL\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d notification. (At least one reviewer bragged about having figured out how to shut off the Hyundai Santa Fe\u2019s greeting.) Mr. Hanna asks, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like your car to greet you by name when you got into it?\u201d Not this driver. Perhaps future cars will greet us with something like Siri and her \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Several manufacturers seem to suggest this, by signing on for Apple\u2019s Carplay or Android\u2019s rival system. Cars seem likely to come to resemble mobile phones more and more. (Mr. Hanna came to Ford from the mobile phone industry.) Mr. Saffer suggests that the ideal car would know our preferences, thanks to sensors and chips, and act like a personal chauffeur. Such a car would recall the design ideal of Dieter Rams, the Braun designer who inspired Apple. \u201cNever forget that a good product should be like a good English butler,\u201d Mr. Rams famously said. \u201cThey\u2019re there for you when you need them, but in the background at all other times.\u201d Perhaps the car will be like Carson, the taciturn butler from \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d Volkswagen may be thinking the same way. This year at CeBit, the European electronics convention, VW showed a concept design for an autonomous car\u2019s interior. At the touch of a button, the wheel and instruments vanish and the driver\u2019s seat shifts to passenger mode. The design\u2019s name suggested a chauffeur or butler: \u201cJames 2025.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Rancor, Afghans Agree to Share Power", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Their campaign workers traded blows over ballot boxes during an election widely seen as fraudulent. Some of the warlords backing them have muttered about starting a parallel government, a potential recipe for civil war in Afghanistan. And they\u2019ve just come out of a vote so discredited that some officials don\u2019t want the final tallies announced.Now Ashraf Ghani, Afghanistan\u2019s new president-elect, and his opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, have joined together in a national unity government in which they will share power.After eight months of enmity over the protracted presidential election, with two rounds of voting, an international audit and power-sharing negotiations finally behind them, they will have to confront the challenges of jointly governing a country that in many ways is far worse off than it was before the campaign began last February.The Taliban have had one of their most successful fighting seasons since the beginning of the war, and the security forces are reeling from heavy casualties, a high desertion rate and poor morale. The Afghan economy is battered by election uncertainty and rising unemployment, and in desperate need of emergency financing from the United States and other donors.But both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah are expected to bring a welcome change from the confrontational relationship between the incumbent, President Hamid Karzai, and his American allies. Their relationship with the Americans will be one of the points of concord in what could well turn into a discordant and possibly unstable government.In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Ghani cited a parable to describe the problem confronting them. \u201cTwo people are riding in a boat and one of them took a chisel and started making a hole in the bottom and the other one said, \u2018What are you doing? You\u2019re going to drown us.\u2019 And the other said, \u2018I\u2019m making the hole in my part of the boat.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\u201cThat captures it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not two boats.\u201dThe agreement forming the new government, brokered by Secretary of State John Kerry, who led an intense diplomatic effort over the past month, makes Mr. Abdullah or his nominee the chief executive of the government, with the sort of powers a prime minister normally has. While reporting to the president, the chief executive will handle the daily running of the government. At the same time, Mr. Ghani keeps all the powers granted to the president by the Afghan Constitution.Already, supporters for each side have debated whether Mr. Ghani will have more power, or whether Mr. Abdullah will be an equal partner.That does not bode well. Neither did the brief ceremony Sunday afternoon during which the two men signed the power-sharing agreement in front of President Karzai and their top supporters.They hugged one another stiffly afterward, to decidedly tepid applause, and the entire event lasted less than a quarter-hour. They failed to show up for a planned joint news conference on Sunday, sending spokesmen instead.While Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah have known one another for many years, having served together in various positions in Afghan governments under Mr. Karzai, they have long had relations widely described as strained. \u201cThey have created a fabricated national unity government, and I don\u2019t think such a government can last,\u201d said Wadir Safi, a political analyst at Kabul University. At the same time, a national unity government is not a completely alien idea here. Mr. Karzai adroitly brought leaders from diverse ethnic and political groups into his government, and the security ministries especially \u2014 defense, interior and intelligence \u2014 were usually headed by northern Tajiks rather than Mr. Karzai\u2019s fellow Pashtuns.The two new leaders have plenty of common ground as well. Both are generally pro-American in their views; Mr. Ghani lived and worked there for many years, and Mr. Abdullah was a frequent visitor, and a close ally when the United States invaded Afghanistan alongside his Northern Alliance.They both say they plan to sign the bilateral security agreement with the United States the moment they take office. Delayed a year because Mr. Karzai refused to sign it, the agreement is necessary if American troops are to remain in Afghanistan after the end of the current combat mission this year.With 30,000 Americans and 17,000 other coalition troops still here, planning a sudden withdrawal by the end of the year would have been a challenge, but neither leader wants to renegotiate the agreement. Only a handful of Afghan military and police units are rated as completely self-sufficient without coalition support, which would potentially make a total pullout a disaster that neither leader wants.There are strong indications, too, that the Taliban have taken advantage of the power vacuum caused by the long election imbroglio to step up their campaign, carrying out 700 ground offensives in the first six months of the current Afghan year, which began March 21, and killing 1,368 policemen and 800 soldiers, more than in any similar period.Both Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah have similar views on fighting the Taliban, agreeing that the country needs the sort of wartime commander in chief it has not had under Mr. Karzai, who has long seemed as if he simply wanted to wish the war away.American diplomats who worked closely with both men in recent months, setting up and attending many meetings between the two, say their understanding of one another has grown greatly, and differences have increasingly been greater among some of their harder-line staff members than with each other.A European official and a former Afghan official said that powerful backers of each candidate appeared to be making no moves to stand down the militias they control, preferring to see what happens in the coming months before sending home the gunmen they had raised over the summer.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen no moves in the north or outside Kabul or in eastern areas where these illegal armies are concentrated,\u201d said the European official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to further inflame tensions in Afghanistan.\u201cThere are going to be lots of centers of power in the government. Who will dominate? Abdullah\u2019s people are worried that he\u2019s going to be relegated to being nothing more than a senior adviser, and they\u2019ll all be shoved aside by Ghani\u2019s supporters, who want to be able to protect their claims on power and businesses,\u201d the European official said.In addition to wartime concerns, their government will have to tackle an economy in deep crisis. The election impasse chased away investment, slowed economic activity and worsened an already growing unemployment problem as the military has been greatly reducing its presence.Afghans voted in the first election in the nation\u2019s modern history with the potential to bring a peaceful change of leadership.By midyear, the Ministry of Finance was reporting net income of less than zero, as the cost of collecting taxes and customs duties exceeded the revenue raised. Afghanistan seemed unlikely to meet even its projected revenue goal of $2 billion this year, which already was $5 billion short of its needs, according to American officials. This month, teachers and other public workers were facing a payless payday, while the government asked donors for $537 million in emergency funding so it could meet its payrolls.Less quantifiable would be the damage to the reputations of Afghanistan and its supporters in creating a viable democracy \u2014 although that, too, could have a price, since donor countries have made a free and fair election and a democratic, peaceful transfer of power the basis for continued aid. In Tokyo last year, for instance, donor nations made satisfactory elections a precondition for $16 billion in development assistance.Despite as much as a half-billion dollars in international support for the elections and the audit (even the lowest estimates exceed $200 million), in the end the two candidates cut a political deal before the vote totals were even announced.At the last minute, Mr. Abdullah had threatened to boycott the deal altogether unless the Independent Election Commission did not release the vote totals, and that is what happened Sunday. The commission merely announced that Mr. Ghani was the winner, without citing any numbers.The European Union\u2019s observer mission, which had more than 410 people here, called the United Nations-supervised audit \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d and expressed \u201cregrets that no precise results figures have been published.\u201d\u201cMany people risked their lives to vote, some lost their lives and this is a very bad precedent,\u201d said Nader Nadery, the head of the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan, a respected Afghan monitoring group. \u201cTo persuade people to come back and vote again will be very hard.\u201dMr. Nadery, whose organization monitored the vote, said it had estimated that the final total would be about 54 percent to 45 percent in favor of Mr. Ghani, even after fraudulent votes were discounted. He said there was clearly large-scale fraud on both sides.American officials were eager to portray Sunday\u2019s outcome as an important milestone, and proof that the country could weather its first change of power peacefully and democratically.It was emblematic of the confused ending to the election ordeal that no one was even sure when President-elect Ghani would be inaugurated. Under the deal, he is obliged to appoint Mr. Abdullah as chief executive at that inauguration, so they will both be in the same boat immediately.Matthew Rosenberg contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Ancestors of ISIS", "Date": "2014-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorCAMBRIDGE, England \u2014 IN the last few years, there has been a dramatic rise of a seemingly new type of polity: the Islamic rebel state. Boko Haram in West Africa, the Shabab in East Africa, the Islamic Emirate in the Caucasus and, of course, the Islamic State in the Middle East, known as ISIS, or ISIL \u2014 these movements not only call for holy war against the West, but also use their resources to build theocracies. Though in some respects unprecedented, these groups also have much in common with the Islamic revivalist movements of the 18th century, such as the Wahhabis on the Arabian Peninsula and the great jihadist states of the 19th century. They waged jihad against non-Muslim powers, and at the same time sought to radically transform their own societies. One of the first groups to engage in anticolonial jihad and state-building was the fighters led by Abd al-Qadir, who challenged the French imperial invasion of North Africa in the 1830s and 1840s. Qadir declared himself \u201ccommander of the faithful\u201d \u2014 the title of a caliph \u2014 and founded an Islamic state in western Algeria, with a capital in Mascara, a regular army and an administration that enforced Shariah law and provided some public services. The state was never stable, nor did it ever encompass a clearly defined territory; it was eventually destroyed by the French. Equally short lived was the Mahdist state in Sudan, lasting from the early 1880s to the late 1890s. Led by the self-proclaimed Mahdi (\u201credeemer\u201d) Muhammad Ahmad, the movement called for jihad against their Egyptian-Ottoman rulers and their British overlords, and it established state structures, including a telegraph network, weapon factories and a propaganda apparatus. The rebels banned smoking, alcohol and dancing and persecuted religious minorities. But the state was unable to provide stable institutions, and the economy collapsed; half of the population died from famine, disease and violence before the British Army, supported by Egyptians, crushed the regime in a bloody campaign, events chronicled in \u201cThe River War\u201d by the young Winston Churchill, who served as an officer in Sudan. The most sophisticated 19th-century Islamic rebel state was the Caucasian imamate. Its imams rallied the Muslims of Chechnya and Dagestan into a 30-year holy war against the Russian empire, which sought to subdue the region. During the struggle, the rebels forced the mountain communities into a militant imamate, executing internal opponents and imposing Shariah law, segregation of the sexes, bans on alcohol and tobacco, restriction on music, and the enforcement of strict dress codes \u2014 all hugely unpopular measures. Czarist troops confronted the imamate with extreme brutality, eventually shattering it. In all of these cases, there were two distinct, though intertwined, conflicts, one against non-European empires and one against internal enemies, and both struggles were combined with state-building. This pattern is in fact not unique to the emergence of Islamic rebel states. The sociologist Charles Tilly once identified war as one of the most crucial forces in the formation of states: The foundation of a centralized government becomes necessary to organize and finance the armed forces. At the same time, Islam was at the center of these movements. Their leaders were religious authorities, most of them assuming the title \u201ccommander of the faithful\u201d; their states were theocratically organized. Islam helped unite fractured tribal societies and served as a source of absolute, divine authority to enhance social discipline and political order, and to legitimize war. They all preached militant Islamic revivalism, calling for the purification of their faith, while denouncing traditional Islamic society, with its more heterodox forms of Islam, as superstitious, corrupt and backward.Today\u2019s jihadist states share many of these features. They emerged at a time of crisis, and ruthlessly confront internal and external enemies. They oppress women. Despite the groups\u2019 ferocity, they have all succeeded in using Islam to build broad coalitions with local tribes and communities. They provide social services and run strict Shariah courts; they use advanced propaganda methods. If anything, they differ from the 19th-century states in that they are more radical and sophisticated. The Islamic State is perhaps the most elaborate and militant jihad polity in modern history. It uses modern state structures, including a hierarchically organized bureaucracy, a judicial system, madrasas, a vast propaganda apparatus and a financial network that allows it to sell oil on the black market. It uses violence \u2014 mass executions, kidnapping and looting, following a rationale of suppression and wealth accumulation \u2014 to an extent unknown in previous Islamic polities. And unlike its antecedents, its leaders have global aspirations, fantasizing about overrunning St. Peter\u2019s in Rome. And yet those differences are a matter of degree, rather than kind. Islamic rebel states are overall strikingly similar. They should be seen as one phenomenon; and this phenomenon has a history.Created under wartime conditions, and operating in a constant atmosphere of internal and external pressure, these states have been unstable and never fully functional. Forming a state makes Islamists vulnerable: While jihadist networks or guerrilla groups are difficult to fight, a state, which can be invaded, is far easier to confront. And once there is a theocratic state, it often becomes clear that its rulers are incapable of providing sufficient social and political solutions, gradually alienating its subjects.In this light, the international community should continue to check the expansion of groups like the Islamic State, and intervene to prevent widespread human rights abuses. But given that the United States and its allies are unlikely to commit the massive military resources necessary to defeat the Islamic State \u2014 let alone other jihadist states \u2014 the best policy might be one of containment, support of local opponents and then management of the groups\u2019 possible collapse.We need to recognize what these groups really are. Referring to them as a \u201ccancer,\u201d as President Obama has, is understandable from an emotional standpoint, but simplifies and obscures the phenomenon. Jihadist states are complex polities and must be understood in the context of Islamic history.David Motadel is a historian at the University of Cambridge and the author of \u201cIslam and Nazi Germany\u2019s War.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Fails to Address All Nuclear Concerns, U.N. Says", "Date": "2014-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProspects for an international agreement over Iran\u2019s disputed nuclear program appeared to suffer a setback Friday when a United Nations monitoring agency said the Iranians had yet to meet two of five confidence-building measures to ensure that their activities are purely peaceful.A report by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said Iran had so far not explained unresolved issues over its research into detonators that could be used to trigger a nuclear weapon, and had likewise not explained studies that could be relevant to calculating the explosive yield of a nuclear weapon.The issues are important because Iran must satisfy the atomic agency\u2019s requests for transparency as part of a broader negotiation Iran has undertaken with the major powers aimed at assuring them its uranium enrichment and other nuclear work will never be used to make bombs. A temporary accord, which has already been extended once to give negotiators more time to reach a permanent agreement, is due to expire in November. Under that accord, Iran had agreed to freeze most of its nuclear work, including uranium enrichment, in exchange for modest relief of onerous Western sanctions that have hurt its economy. Iranian officials had agreed to address the confidence-building measures and other concerns in a meeting with the agency\u2019s director general, Yukiya Amano, at meetings in Tehran last month. The agency said it had asked for a satisfactory response on all five steps by Tuesday.Iran has repeatedly asserted its nuclear work is peaceful, and President Hassan Rouhani has said resolving the nuclear dispute is one if his most important objectives. But negotiators are believed to remain far apart on some of the most contentious issues, including Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment capacity.Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, declined to comment specifically on the atomic agency\u2019s report.\u201cWe know there are outstanding issues with the I.A.E.A. \u2014 that is by no means breaking news to us \u2014 with Iran\u2019s possible military dimension,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think we look at this in a comprehensive way. We are having the bilateral discussions right now. Those are ongoing.\u201dWhile the Obama administration has long insisted that it remains committed to a \u201clong-term comprehensive solution that provides confidence that Iran\u2019s nuclear program is exclusively peaceful,\u201d it imposed sanctions on several Iranian organizations late last month. The announcement came as the Iranian government seemed to be balking at scrutiny of its nuclear program.

{"Headline": "Air France Strife Shows Challenges for European Business", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The airline industry, particularly in Europe, is a highly competitive international business. But old, border-bound ways can be hard to eradicate.Take the recent case of French pilots at Air France-KLM. Even before the strike this week over the planned expansion of the group\u2019s European low-cost subsidiary, union leaders were pressing a separate issue with management.\u201cStop the abusive propagation of English,\u201d the union wrote in a leaflet distributed in July to the carrier\u2019s 3,800 pilots.English is the official language of international air-traffic control, and regulators require English proficiency of all pilots flying internationally. But the group was protesting the linguistic encroachment into internal communications and flight manuals of Air France-KLM, a French-Dutch company.\u201cWhat signal are we to see in the generalization of its usage?\u201d read the leaflet by the French National Union of Airline Pilots. \u201cThe hiring of non-French-speaking pilots?\u201dThat cri de coeur might seem quaint in light of the decades-long internationalization of airlines, whether through cross-border mergers or ever-tighter global alliances among the world\u2019s biggest carriers.But in Europe, the leaflet campaign \u2014 like this week\u2019s strike that through Wednesday had grounded more than 1,800 Air France-KLM flights \u2014 is emblematic.The union opposes the airline\u2019s plan to double the number of planes in the fleet of its low-cost regional carrier, Transavia, and to hire up to 250 new pilots for the unit \u2014 only about a third of them in France \u2014 and pay them less than Air France pilots.It is the sort of challenge facing all sorts of European businesses as they try to become more internationally competitive. Work force resistance, entrenched regulatory regimes and a stagnant regional economy are among the impediments confronting managers of Europe\u2019s former flag carriers \u2014 Lufthansa and Alitalia are also among them \u2014 as they seek to revive their perennially unprofitable businesses.From one side, they face increasingly fierce competition from a proliferation of nimble, low-fare rivals like easyJet and Ryanair flying popular European routes. From the premium end, Europe\u2019s flagship airlines are under relentless pressure from well-financed Middle Eastern carriers like Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways on longer-distance routes between hubs in Europe and Asia.\u201cIt\u2019s not a question that airline managements don\u2019t know what they need to do,\u201d said Chris Tarry, an independent airline consultant in London. \u201cThe issue is the cost of removing the constraints to get there and the speed at which you can do this,\u201d he said, particularly in a European context.At least one Air France pilot voiced frustration with his union\u2019s resistance to accept changes he sees as long overdue.\u201cIt is a big corporation that has been a bit late to realize that the world has changed,\u201d said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Eucat, 49, an Air France captain with 24 years of experience who has volunteered for a temporary assignment at Transavia.Many staff members \u201care still thinking like they did in the 1970s, when Air France was a leader because it was a monopoly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there are more and more carriers all over Europe.\u201dOn Wednesday, even Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who narrowly won a confidence vote in Parliament on Tuesday, urged the pilots to return to work.\u201cThis strike is weighing heavily on the finances of Air France, and on the attractiveness and the image of our country,\u201d Mr. Valls, a member of the Socialist Party, said in a French radio interview.For Air France-KLM, as well as its German peer, Lufthansa, change is coming at a high price. A series of crippling strikes this year has succeeded in disrupting the travel plans of hundreds of thousands of passengers worldwide and erasing tens of millions of euros in revenue.Lufthansa said a three-day pilots\u2019 strike in April \u2014 over reductions to the pilots\u2019 early-retirement benefits \u2014 reduced the airline\u2019s profit around 60 million euros, or $78 million. It has yet to tally the costs of more limited labor action this month, when pilots again walked out for brief periods over the same matter.Air France-KLM has estimated the cost of this week\u2019s strike by its French pilots, which may last through Sunday, at \u20ac10 million to \u20ac15 million a day.Airline employees have been paying a price, too. Through budget cuts, their salaries have been frozen, their working hours extended and many of their benefits slashed or eliminated. Moreover, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa between them expect to shed more than 11,500 jobs by next year. And Alitalia, the floundering Italian carrier that was rescued this summer by Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi, faces substantial cuts to its work force, which now totals 14,000.These trends have already played out many times over in North America and Asia, where sprawling incumbent airlines have found their business models upended by new entrants with leaner staffs, more efficient planes and fewer frills for passengers.But unlike the United States and Japan, for instance, where labor markets are less rigid and airlines have the option of Chapter 11-style bankruptcies and restructurings, the European Union has a patchwork of bankruptcy laws under which cases can languish for years. Europe\u2019s troubled airlines, as a result, have had to search for more creative ways to cut costs and debt without running afoul of national political sensibilities or European Union competition rules.\u201cThey have also a baggage of history that they are still obliged to carry,\u201d said Howard Wheeldon, an independent consultant and a fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society in London. Because they are flag carriers that in some cases also remain partly state-owned, he said, \u201cthere is still a set of expectations, both official and unofficial, about how they operate that do not apply to competitors.\u201dIn many cases, that has included an expectation that these legacy airlines maintain routes that are deeply unprofitable at a time when the main differentiator for most passengers is now the ticket price.Europe\u2019s big airlines have been trying to break out of these old business models \u2014 so far with only mixed success.British Airways years ago ceded most of its money-losing domestic and European business to lower-cost competitors like Ryanair and easyJet to focus on intercontinental services, particularly to North America and Asia.In 2011, seeking to expand its trans-Atlantic reach into Latin America, British Airways acquired Iberia, Spain\u2019s chronically unprofitable flag carrier \u2014 enduring two years of labor unrest and sniping from Spanish politicians as it slashed salaries and eliminated more than 3,000 jobs. The merged group went on to absorb Vueling, the fast-growing Barcelona-based budget carrier, in 2013 and swung to a net profit of \u20ac151 million \u2014 compared with a loss of \u20ac658 million a year earlier.Air France-KLM, though, is still only partway through a turbulent transition. After almost three years of belt-tightening, the airline has made significant progress toward reducing its losses and paring its debt. But the second phase of the restructuring, the new tilt toward its low-cost Transavia subsidiary announced last week, is only in its early, strike-plagued days.Much like Lufthansa, which began enacting a similar plan this year with its Germanwings and Eurowings units, Air France-KLM plans to double the size of Transavia\u2019s fleet to more than 100 planes by 2017, from around 50 currently.The aim is for Transavia to eventually carry 20 million passengers a year, with a focus on connecting major European cities with popular Mediterranean vacation destinations.Air France-KLM expects to hire up to 250 new pilots for Transavia by 2019, with as many as a third based in France, another third in the Netherlands, and the rest in other European countries \u2014 all under contracts that pay less and require pilots to fly more than their counterparts working under the Air France or KLM brands.Financial analysts have generally applauded the move. But French unions have cried foul, fearing it may be the first step of a general \u201coutsourcing\u201d by the group of highly skilled pilot jobs to lower-wage countries in Europe.The reaction of passengers, too, has reflected both sides of the debate.Checking in at Paris\u2019s Orly Airport for her Transavia flight to Crete this week, Jessica Lopez, 22, said she did not understand why Air France-KLM was unwilling to apply the same pay scale to all of its pilots. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to request to be paid the same if they do the same job,\u201d she said.But Joseph and C\u00e9line Dorilas, a couple in their 50s en route to Venice on Transavia, said that on short European flights there was a diminishing difference between the passenger experience aboard a budget carrier and a legacy airline.\u201cI don\u2019t like this company,\u201d Mr. Dorilas said, referring to Air France. \u201cI prefer to look for other ones, because they are less expensive and the comfort is the same.\u201dMr. Eucat, the Transavia pilot, said he was working harder than he had at Air France. But said he was also more motivated and engaged than he had been in years. \u201cIt feels like a start-up,\u201d he said. \u201cI found what I was looking for.\u201dWhile he has the option to return to Air France in 2016, Mr. Eucat said he was not yet certain that he would. That would depend, in part, on the course that union leaders choose in the months ahead.\u201cYou cannot run fast your sport car,\u201d he said in confident, if imperfect, English, \u201cwhile looking in the mirror.\u201dAssia Labbas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Manufacturing Output Dipped 0.1% in August", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Manufacturing output fell for the first time in seven months in August, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steadily expanding factory sector.That view was bolstered by other data on Monday that showed factory activity in New York State jumped to its highest level in nearly five years in September.\u201cThe weakness in factory output in August is likely to be transitory,\u201d said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.Excluding automobiles, manufacturing output gained 0.1 percent in August. So far in the third quarter, factory production is running at a 4.6 percent annual pace for growth, a sign that manufacturing will continue to support economic growth.Motor vehicle output declined 7.6 percent last month after a 9.3 percent jump in July. Economists attributed the surge in July to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations after some automakers kept assembly lines running instead of closing plants for the traditional summer retooling.With auto sales at their highest point in eight and a half years, motor vehicle production is expected to rebound.A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region\u2019s factory activity. A gauge of new orders rose last month and inventories continued to shrink, keeping the balance between orders and inventories favorable.\u201cIf we can be persuaded to look though the volatility of the official data, it\u2019s evident that the U.S. economy has continued to grow strongly in the third quarter,\u201d said Chris Williamson, chief economist at the financial data firm Markit.Third-quarter growth estimates range as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter.With the economic data, including retail sales and housing, continuing to be upbeat, some analysts say that could encourage the Fed\u2019s policy makers to look toward raising interest rates earlier than expected next year when they meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.\u201cInvestors will have to start getting used to the reality that the Fed is going to raise interest rates, most likely during the first half of next year,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.The Fed\u2019s report showed that mining output increased 0.5 percent in August, while utilities production rebounded 1.0 percent.The amount of manufacturing capacity in use fell to 77.2 percent last month from 77.6 percent in July, while overall industrial capacity use hit a six-month low of 78.8 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A President Awakens", "Date": "2014-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Obama, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, presented a powerful picture of a world at the cusp, torn between forces of integration and disintegration, woven together by the very technology also used to deliver images of medieval beheadings, full of a \u201cpervasive unease\u201d despite material and scientific progress, obliged at the centennial of the outbreak of World War I to look again \u201cinto the heart of darkness.\u201dIt was a strong speech from a president stirred from the wavering idioms of a season of uncertainty by the sudden advance out of the carnage of Syria of the organization that calls itself the Islamic State. \u201cThe only language understood by killers like this is the language of force,\u201d Obama said. He vowed to dismantle \u201cthis network of death\u201d through military action and turning social media against the ISIS propagandists that use it to such effect.On the same day, a French mountain guide, Herv\u00e9 Gourdel, was beheaded in Algeria by a jihadi group that pledged allegiance this month to ISIS. Whether the president\u2019s words or such potent images of savagery have greater global impact is an open question that points to the difficulties of the mission outlined by Obama and the giddying nature of a post-hierarchical world.Obama, a leader bent on the extraction of the United States from war without victory in the Middle East, did not expect to find himself three-quarters of the way through his presidency making a call to arms for a new fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The world, a quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, did not expect to find itself at what Obama called \u201ca crossroads between war and peace.\u201d The hopes, so recent, of the Arab Spring did not seem destined for such rapid smothering. The liberal and democratic order of the West had not seemed vulnerable at a time of technology-driven opening.How then did this \u201cpervasive unease\u201d arise? The dangers of a global system in transition from the ordering power of the United States to something as yet undefined were underestimated. The potential of globalization to stir new forms of nationalism \u2014 identity asserting itself against abstract forces \u2014 was not fully appreciated. The social rot and sectarian division seeping through an Arab world that had been frozen in despotism for decades was far greater than imagined. The financial meltdown of 2008 and the perceived failures of democracies skewed by money have raised lasting questions about the Western model.For a while Obama seemed to be sleepwalking through this unraveling, as if resigned to America\u2019s more limited role. \u201cThe world has always been messy,\u201d he said in August, sounding almost like a bystander. His attempt to calibrate every action, as if a perfect result were attainable, resulted in inaction. Vladimir Putin saw this. ISIS saw this. Now he has awoken to the need for American leadership and firmness. It is a belated awakening, but important. Syria has demonstrated how inaction can be more dangerous than the focused use of force, and a vacuum the best incubator of terrorism.\u201cNo grievance justifies these actions. There can be no reasoning \u2014 no negotiation \u2014 with this brand of evil,\u201d Obama said, adding: \u201cIn this effort, we do not act alone \u2014 nor do we intend to send U.S. troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities. We will use our military might in a campaign of air strikes to roll back ISIL. We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground.\u201dIt is critical to this fight that the Sunni Arab states out of which ISIS has grown, and from whose financing it has benefited, be at the forefront of the struggle to stop the black-garbed authors of massacre and beheadings. Only Arabs can extirpate this cancer, a struggle that will require honesty and accountability unseen in their societies of evasion. Obama was right to aim a sharp barb at Saudi Arabia: \u201cIt\u2019s time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down.\u201dHe was also right to point to the central failing of the Arab states: \u201cIf young people live in places where the only option is between the dictates of a state, or the lure of an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism strategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society is allowed to flourish \u2014 where people can express their views, and organize peacefully for a better life \u2014 then you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.\u201dThe central hope of the Arab Spring was that it could offer precisely such an escape from dictatorship or jihadism. Obama, in his long season of wavering, did not help that cause. He undermined it. But the cause still exists and is best served by the president\u2019s new resolve.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "O.E.C.D. Urges Stimulus Measures for Eurozone", "Date": "2014-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 The European Central Bank should begin large-scale bond buying to ensure that weak price pressures do not further undermine demand in the eurozone, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Monday, as it cut its forecast for growth in the developed world.The eurozone, which has 18 member nations, will grow only 0.8 percent, the O.E.C.D. said, revising downward its previous forecast for an expansion of 1.2 percent.\u201cGiven the low-growth outlook and the risk that demand could be further sapped if inflation remains near zero, or even turns negative, the O.E.C.D. recommends more monetary support for the euro area,\u201d the organization said. \u201cRecent actions by the European Central Bank are welcome, but further measures, including quantitative easing, are warranted.\u201dQuantitative easing, a policy that has been used in the United States by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England, involves the outright purchase of bonds on a large scale, flooding the financial system with money in an effort to broaden the availability of credit and lift economic growth.The European Central Bank has become increasingly concerned about the very low inflation in the eurozone. Consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in August from a year earlier, and already there are warnings that a Japan-style crush of falling prices could lead consumers to hold off on purchases and push more borrowers into bankruptcy, with dire effects on the bloc\u2019s already struggling lenders.The O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris, serves as a forum for discussion and research for the most economically advanced countries.It warned that there were \u201cmany significant risks to the near-term outlook\u201d for Europe, including geopolitical risks stemming from conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and the uncertainty surrounding the Scottish independence vote on Thursday.\u201cThe bullishness of financial markets appears at odds with the intensification of several significant risks,\u201d the O.E.C.D. continued. It cited equity markets at or near record highs, government bond yields near all-time lows in many developed countries, and stock market volatility at levels approaching those seen before the 2008 financial crisis.\u201cThis highlights the possibility that risk is being mispriced and the attendant dangers of a sudden correction,\u201d it said.While the organization reduced its forecast for economic growth in the United States this year, it projected that growth would accelerate in 2015, with American gross domestic product rising 3.1 percent. The O.E.C.D. projected that the eurozone would grow a modest 1.1 percent in 2015. It forecast that the Japanese economy, which is receiving a major injection of monetary stimulus from Japan\u2019s central bank as part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic program, would expand by 0.9 percent this year and 1.1 percent in 2015.It projected that China, which is not a member of the O.E.C.D., would grow 7.4 percent this year and 7.3 percent in 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "E.C.B., Despite Mounting Pressure, May Wait and See", "Date": "2014-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 The European Central Bank is expected to leave its main interest rate at a record low on Thursday, waiting to see the effect of a program to encourage bank lending before it resorts to more powerful but riskier measures to stimulate the faltering eurozone economy.Analysts predicted that the central bank, whose policy makers planned to meet here Thursday morning, would leave the rate at which it issues short-term loans to banks at 0.15 percent. The central bank will probably refrain from new stimulus measures, analysts said, until it has a chance to gauge the success of a lending program devised to restart the flow of credit to troubled countries like Italy and Spain.The E.C.B. is scheduled to announce the rate decision at 1:45 p.m. Frankfurt time, with a news conference by its president, Mario Draghi, set for 2:30 p.m.Only a minority of analysts were forecasting that the E.C.B. would cut the main rate to 0.05 percent, a record low. The main effect of such a cut would be to make the central bank lending program more attractive to commercial banks, since the interest rate is tied to the official rate.The likelier approach, in many analysts\u2019 view, will be for the central bank to watch the result of its new lending program, set to begin Sept. 18, which will let banks in the eurozone draw cheap long-term loans from the central bank, if they use the money to issue credit to businesses and households.Still, expectations remain high that the central bank will soon need to begin large-scale asset purchases, similar to the quantitative easing used by the United States Federal Reserve, to try shielding the eurozone from the risk of deflation, a downward price spiral that would be considered even more dangerous than runaway inflation.Mr. Draghi may signal at his news conference Thursday afternoon that the central bank is moving closer to quantitative easing. Recent comments he has made seemed to open the door wider to large-scale asset purchases. But it remains uncertain how far the E.C.B. might be willing to go and how quickly.Annual inflation in the eurozone was 0.3 percent in August, according to an official estimate, well below the E.C.B.'s official target of 2 percent. Many economists have expressed concern that the eurozone economy is so torpid that it faces a grave risk of deflation, a condition in which the expectation of falling prices causes consumers to delay making purchases. Deflation can lead to higher unemployment, as companies lose revenue and are forced to lay off workers.Once it takes hold, deflation is notoriously difficult to reverse \u2014 as Japan has learned in the last two decades. Many economists say the E.C.B. has already waited too long to deploy more powerful tools.\u201cThere is currently a major problem of too low inflation in the eurozone,\u201d said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. \u201cThe E.C.B. should have acted earlier and more forcefully.\u201dThe E.C.B. last cut the main interest rate in June to 0.15 percent, down from 0.25 percent. It also began imposing a 0.10 percent penalty on money that commercial banks park at the central bank. That so-called negative interest rate has helped push down market interest rates on some government bonds and money markets below zero, but the cheap money has not found its way to struggling businesses in countries like Italy and Portugal.The central bank is now pinning its hopes on the lending program, which will allow banks to borrow money for four years at the benchmark interest rate plus 0.10 percentage points \u2014 or 0.25 percent at the current level. The E.C.B. will monitor whether banks have used the money to increase loans to businesses or households. If not, banks will be required to repay the loans early.Analysts said it was unlikely the E.C.B. would begin new stimulus measures until it knew how many banks had taken take advantage of the lending program. That is because, they said, it would be impossible to calibrate new measures without knowing how much money the existing measures were injecting into credit markets.Some bankers have doubted whether the lending program will improve the flow of credit. One of the reasons that lending in the eurozone has remained subdued is simply that many borrowers are considered too risky.\u201cThe question is whether banks are willing to lend at all to those people,\u201d said Richard Barwell, a senior European economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.An earlier version of this article misstated the forecast held by a minority of analysts. Those analysts forecast the E.C.B. would cut its main rate to 0.05 percent, not 0.5 percent.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rashi Fein, Economist Who Urged Medicare, Dies at 88", "Date": "2014-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRashi Fein, an influential economist who strove to bring ethical and humanitarian perspectives to the nation\u2019s health care system and helped lay the intellectual groundwork for Medicare in the 1960s, died on Monday in Boston. He was 88.The cause was melanoma, his son Alan said.When Dr. Fein began working on health issues as a young aide in the administration of Harry S. Truman, health care accounted for about 3 percent of the American economy. By the time he weighed in as a respected elder in the field during the debate over President Obama\u2019s health care proposals, the expenditures had risen to 18 percent, an amount roughly equal to the economy of France.As the money Americans spent on medical care increased, so did the role of economists specializing in health issues. Dr. Fein moved between government and academia, offering research and views on issues like meeting the demand for physicians. During the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, he led a public-private panel to develop ideas for the Medicare legislation, which, along with Medicaid, was signed into law in 1965. Dr. Fein, a proud liberal, regretted that Medicare did not apply to everyone, just as he was disappointed that Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act did not consolidate insurance payments under the federal government. A federal single-payer system, he maintained, would be more cost effective and inclusive. The Obama plan, passed by Congress, relies on private insurance. But Dr. Fein was nonetheless satisfied with incremental progress, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, chairman of the department of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview on Thursday. He quoted Dr. Fein, a former professor of his, as saying, \u201cGetting everybody under the tent is better than standing on principle and not getting anything.\u201dDr. Fein regarded both Medicare and the Affordable Care Act as important steps toward the overriding goal of helping \u201cthe people who have the least,\u201d Dr. Emanuel said. In his 1986 book, \u201cMedical Care, Medical Costs: The Search for a Health Insurance Policy,\u201d Dr. Fein wrote, \u201cDecent people \u2014 and we are decent people \u2014 are offended by unnecessary pain and suffering; that is, by pain and suffering for which there is a treatment and for which some (who are affluent) are treated.\u201dMr. Fein was born in the Bronx on Feb. 6, 1926. His father, Isaac, was a history professor whose work took him to a chain of cities in the United States and Canada, including Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Bridgeport, Conn. His mother, the former Chaya Wertheim, was a schoolteacher. Mr. Fein\u2019s son Alan said his father and his father\u2019s younger brother, Leonard \u2014 who went on to found organizations to combat hunger \u2014 had gotten their zeal for social justice from their parents. \u201cMy preference for a universal insurance program derives from my image of a just society,\u201d Dr. Fein wrote in his 1986 book. \u201cIt is an image based on a broadly defined concept of justice and liberty, nurtured by stories my parents told me, the books they encouraged me to read, and the values they expressed. To them, liberty meant more than political freedom; it also meant freedom from destitution \u2014 in Roosevelt\u2019s phrase, \u2018freedom from want.\u2019\u00a0\u201dAfter graduating from Central High School in Bridgeport, Dr. Fein was a Navy radar technician during World War II. He went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and a doctorate in political economy from Johns Hopkins University.In 1952, he took a teaching post at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while working on a Truman administration commission charged with exploring the possibilities for national health insurance. Six years later, he led a study by the federal Joint Commission on Mental Illness and Health, which estimated that mental illness cost the United States $3 billion a year ($24.7 billion in today\u2019s dollars) in treatment costs and lost work years, a small fraction of the estimated costs today. In 1961, Dr. Fein became a senior staff member on the Council of Economic Advisers under President John F. Kennedy. He studied education issues in addition to helping to write legislation for Medicare. He moved on to the Brookings Institution as a senior fellow in 1963 and remained with it while directing the Medicare panel for Johnson, Kennedy\u2019s successor.After leaving Brookings, Dr. Fein was a professor of economics at the Kennedy School of Government and the Medical School of Harvard University. He retired in 1999.In addition to his son Alan, Dr. Fein is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Ruth Judith Breslau; another son, Michael; a daughter, Karen Fein; and four grandchildren. Another daughter, Bena Fein, died in 1995. Dr. Fein\u2019s brother, Leonard, died in August. Dr. Fein spoke of the importance of language in describing health care, deriding the term \u201cdeath panels\u201d that some opponents used in the debate over the Affordable Care Act.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "French Premier Prevails in Confidence Vote", "Date": "2014-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s embattled Socialist government survived a parliamentary vote of confidence on Tuesday aimed at shoring up support for tough economic policy changes at a time when the economy is flat and President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s popularity is the lowest of any French president in decades.The vote, which passed by 269 to 244 in the 577-seat National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, was called by Prime Minister Manuel Valls after a cabinet reshuffle last month that purged prominent leftists who were critical of austerity measures that have divided Europe and, closer to home, his own Socialist Party.While there was little doubt that Mr. Valls would win the vote, the question was how forceful a rebellion he might face from the left wing of the party, which has opposed budget cuts and efforts by both Mr. Valls and the president to nudge the party toward the center.A group of about 40 left-wing Socialists had threatened to abstain from the vote to protest a government economic approach that they view as a reckless breach of Socialist principles that is too favorable toward business. In the end, 32 Socialist members abstained.Before the vote, Mr. Valls outlined his government\u2019s program, vowing to maintain the French social model, including policies like the 35-hour workweek, while insisting that incentives for business were also essential to revive confidence in the economy.\u201cThe main weakness of our economy is the lack of competitiveness of our companies,\u201d he said in Parliament, prompting jeers and applause. He added, \u201cWhat matters today is effectiveness and not ideology.\u201dAnalysts said that the Socialists\u2019 desire to remain in power had, at least for now, trumped ideological divisions. The fall of the government could have spurred early parliamentary elections that the deeply unpopular Socialists would have been hard pressed to win.Even as the Socialists try to tame a simmering rebellion on the left, they are also confronting a growing threat from the far-right National Front, which is gaining ground and which Mr. Valls has warned is \u201cat the gates of power.\u201dIn addition, Mr. Hollande faces the probable return to politics of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who, though mired in corruption accusations, is expected this week to signal his intention to lead his conservative U.M.P. party, presaging a possible run for president in 2017 that could rejuvenate the country\u2019s now rudderless center-right.Mr. Hollande and Mr. Valls hope, however, that the success of the confidence vote will give the government added backing to follow through on its economic program, including plans for spending cuts totaling 50 billion euros through 2017 (about $65 billion), and a package of tax measures for employers devised to encourage hiring.The French government collapsed in late August after a vociferous internal battle over whether those austerity measures \u2014 instituted under pressure from Germany and the European Union \u2014 were hobbling France.The dispute was spurred when Arnaud Montebourg, at the time Mr. Vall\u2019s combative economy minister, broke ranks with the prime minister, saying that austerity championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was undermining France\u2019s recovery. Mr. Montebourg was forced out of the cabinet and replaced with Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker at Rothschild.It was the second major cabinet reshuffle since Mr. Hollande became president in 2012. Since then, the French economy has faltered and Mr. Hollande\u2019s approval rating has plummeted to about 13 percent.Bruno Cautr\u00e8s, a professor of politics at the Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, said that with or without the confidence vote, Mr. Hollande had lost much of his authority amid political and economic doldrums, and vacillating policies between left and right. \u201cThere is a feeling that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is no longer in control,\u201d he said.

Fraser calls Canada the freest country in the world among those with over 10 million residents; Heritage puts Canada second among large countries, behind Australia.There\u2019s a great deal of truth to the conservative praise for Canada. Its fiscal choices have shown how a country can maintain a strong social safety net while taxing and spending efficiently and encouraging private investment. Openness to trade and skilled immigration have made Canada an attractive place to invest; perhaps too attractive for some, given the dizzying way Chinese investment has driven up housing prices in Vancouver.But there are two big caveats to the conservative case for Canada. First, the offsets. \u201cThe things conservatives love about Canada are closely linked to the things they hate most about Canada,\u201d says Mr. Frum, a Canadian-American journalist. Canada\u2019s light corporate taxes? Made possible, in part, by a value-added tax, imposed by a conservative government in 1991. Canada\u2019s 1990s fiscal austerity? Made possible by top-down restraint of health care spending and a weak Canadian dollar.Canada\u2019s 1990s austerity was able to be expansionary because of an export boom that coincided with government spending cuts. The boom owed something to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which fits the conservative narrative. But a weak currency also favored exporters. In January 1995, the Canadian dollar stood at $0.71, down from $0.89 in November 1991, which prompted The Journal to mock the currency as the \u201cnorthern peso.\u201d But even as Canada\u2019s broad economic metrics improved through the 1990s, the currency kept falling, hitting $0.65 in August 1998. Conservatives urging the United States to follow Canada\u2019s fiscal example usually leave out the \u201cweaken your currency\u201d part of the plan.And those spending cuts were partly achieved through reduced transfer payments to provinces for health care. Provinces turned around and cut payments in their provincially-run health care systems; as a result, health care spending fell to 8.6 percent of the Canadian economy in 1997 from 9.7 percent in 1992, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \u201cIf you want to do spending austerity, single payer is a powerful tool,\u201d Mr. Frum said.The other caveat is that, in the last few years, Canada has been very lucky. Canada is a net exporter of fossil fuels, in a very unusual global recession in which commodity prices have been strong. This helped Canada, like Australia, have a very mild Great Recession experience.Canada also did not experience a housing crisis, partly because of tighter lending policies, but also because housing prices up north have managed to remain at stratospheric levels.Mr. Fund and Mr. Frum both praised to me the limited and targeted nature of Canada\u2019s stimulus package: smaller as a share of the economy, and more focused on infrastructure spending, than President Obama\u2019s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Maybe that was a reflection of conservative policy principles. Or maybe it was just a reaction to the fact that Canada was dealt a better economic hand than the United States and didn\u2019t need so much rescue. The true test of Canada\u2019s conservative grit may come if oil prices, or home prices, start to fall. Then we\u2019ll see whether your conservative friends still love Canadian policies.An earlier version of this article misstated that Heritage ranked Canada as the freest country in the world among those with over 10 million residents.

{"Headline": "Are Subprime Mortgages Coming Back?", "Date": "2014-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s the EconomyAli and Mariluci Sleiman wanted to buy a house. The couple, who run a day care service inside their first-floor rental apartment, had outgrown their space in Taunton, a small city in southern Massachusetts. They also wanted to avoid answering to a landlord who might complain about 10 little kids running around all day. They were \u201cdesperate to buy a home,\u201d Ali told me. And with good credit and $46,000 in joint income, they hoped they wouldn\u2019t have a hard time getting a loan. So they were disappointed when the bank rejected their application, and then when a local credit union did too.This lending freeze is not just preventing people like the Sleimans, who have struggled to document their income, from chasing their dreams. It\u2019s bad for the overall economy too. Laurie S. Goodman, an expert in housing finance at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., recently calculated that lenders would have made an additional 1.2 million loans in 2012 had they merely loosened standards to the prevailing level in 2001, well before the industry completely lost its sense of caution. As a result, fewer young people are now buying first homes, fewer older people are moving up and less money is changing hands. Instead of driving the economic recovery, the housing business is dragging behind. \u201cAn overly tight credit box means fewer individuals will become homeowners at exactly the point in the housing cycle when it is advantageous to do so,\u201d Goodman and her co-authors wrote in their study, published in The Journal of Structured Finance. \u201cUltimately, it hinders the economy through fewer new-home sales and less spending on furnishings, landscaping, renovations and other consumer spending.\u201dIt seems, in other words, as if it might be time for the revival of the subprime-lending industry. Long before these risky loans were blamed, in part, for helping usher in the financial crisis, subprime lending was embraced as a promising antidote to the excessive caution of mainstream lenders. After all, key mortgage rules were first written in the middle of the last century, and they still reflect old-fashioned economic assumptions. It\u2019s still easiest to qualify for a mortgage if a household has one primary breadwinner who is paid a regular salary, has a history of repaying other loans and has enough money saved or inherited to make a significant down payment. Indeed, mainstream lenders have a long history of using race as a proxy for risk, like the refusal to lend in entire \u201credlined\u201d neighborhoods. Last week, the attorney general\u2019s office in New York filed suit against a Buffalo lender, Evans Bank, saying it redlined an area of east Buffalo that is home to more than 75 percent of the city\u2019s African-Americans. (Evans Bank has denied this charge.) Similar lawsuits have recently been filed in Los Angeles and Providence, R.I. Goodman and her colleagues found that those excluded from credit in 2012 were disproportionately African-American and Hispanic households.The subprime solution has always been relatively simple. Instead of offering fixed terms to anyone who meets \u201cprime\u201d standards, terms are tailored to borrowers. People who are judged less likely to repay loans are charged a proportionately higher interest rate. Before things got out of hand during the last decade, subprime lending offered opportunity for many people, including minorities and immigrants, whose economic lives, like the Sleimans\u2019, did not conform to the mortgage industry\u2019s traditional expectations.Most subprime borrowers continue to repay their debts and live in their houses. But even in the industry\u2019s heyday, subprime lending had critics who argued that it deepens underlying economic inequalities between those with money and those who must borrow it. They would prefer to focus on improving economic opportunities or loosening restrictions on housing construction in desirable areas, like coastal cities, where prices are highest. And their arguments have certainly been buttressed by an industry that has a habit of behaving badly \u2014 overcharging customers who cannot easily tell the difference between a reasonable-risk premium and an inflated interest rate and persuading investors to pump money into those loans.The new subprime lenders, however, seem to be trying to rebuild their business in a more cautious manner. Dallas, who created a lending company during each of the last two booms \u2014 each time selling before the crash \u2014 said that his new venture, Skyline Home Loans, spends about $3,500 on compliance per loan and only approves about two a day. Before the crisis, he told me, he didn\u2019t spend a penny, and a typical underwriter approved 10 loans. Gone, he insists, are the days \u201cwhere nobody looks at your income or your credit.\u201d He suggested that he was helping some of those 1.2 million deserving Americans become homeowners.Some experts also agree that access to lending should be broadened. But in order to protect borrowers, stronger institutional measures must be taken. One approach would change the rules of bankruptcy, which currently allow judges to reduce the burden of most kinds of debt but, notably, not primary home mortgages. Jennifer Taub, a professor at Vermont Law School, argues that changing this law would keep lenders on good behavior because they wouldn\u2019t want to end up at the mercy of a bankruptcy judge. \u201cIf everyone knows that these are the rules of the game,\u201d Taub told me, \u201cthere will be a lot more attention to make sure that the underwriting is proper.\u201d Amir Sufi, an economist at the University of Chicago, and Atif Mian, an economist at Princeton, have proposed a slightly more ambitious plan. During broad economic downturns, they suggest, mortgage payments should automatically drop as area home prices fall. In exchange, lenders would get a share of eventual profits if the price of a home eventually rose again.In truth, the benefits of homeownership are often overstated. Home values have climbed only a little faster than inflation over the last 125 years, according to data compiled by the Yale University economist Robert Shiller. The kind of house that sold in 1890 for the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $100,000 would sell today for about $134,000. Still, Americans just want to buy them. A recent poll found that 76 percent of Americans considered homeownership \u201cnecessary\u201d to be a member of the middle class. When I asked the Sleimans why they wanted to move, their answer was as emotional as it was practical. \u201cThis is a good property, but it\u2019s not ours \u2014 it\u2019s a rented home,\u201d Ali Sleiman told me. \u201cIt does not fit our needs. Or our dreams.\u201d And as long as that is the case, it makes sense for public policy to focus on safety rather than abstinence.The It\u2019s the Economy column on Sept. 14, about subprime mortgages, misstated part of the name of the law school where Jennifer Taub is a professor.

{"Headline": "Scottish Independence Would Ripple Through Europe", "Date": "2014-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconoclastLONDON \u2014 If the Scottish referendum next Thursday leads to the breakup of the United Kingdom, the biggest risks for global businesses and investors do not lie in the economic problems created by Scotland\u2019s choice of currency or the inevitable arguments about sharing North Sea oil revenue and the British national debt. These are all crucial challenges for Scotland and they have been much discussed by financial and research institutions. But the really important issues for the world economy and financial markets are about the effects on the European Union and especially on Britain, which will remain the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, even if Scotland departs. These political risks, discussed briefly last week, can be broken down into four questions: What would Scottish independence mean for British politics and economic management in the nine months before the general election in May 2015? What would be the effect on the 2015 election? How will all this turmoil affect Britain\u2019s fraught relationship with Europe? And would Scottish independence act as an inspiration for secessionist movements in other European countries? The answers to all four questions promise to be more destabilizing than almost anyone would have predicted a month ago. Starting with the issue of other European independence movements, the answer is obvious. If Scotland votes for independence, it will become extremely difficult for the Spanish government to continue denying a similar democratic right to the Catalans and Basques. Flemish separatists would intensify pressure in Belgium, and in Italy, the Northern League could get a new lease on life. Returning the focus to Britain, the political implications become more complex. If the United Kingdom breaks up after Thursday\u2019s vote, David Cameron will have to take responsibility for promoting the referendum in conditions that were needlessly risky (and in hindsight look downright reckless). It was Mr. Cameron who decided to offer Scots a simple choice between staying in the union or breaking it, instead of taking up the Scottish National Party\u2019s proposal for a third option: increasing self-government within Britain. It was also Mr. Cameron who allowed preserving the union to be presented as a negative option in the phrasing of the referendum question and who accepted the Scottish National Party\u2019s decision to lower the voting age to 16 from 18. For all these reasons, plus his unpopularity with the Conservative Party\u2019s powerful anti-European wing, Mr. Cameron will face huge pressure to resign if the referendum is lost. The Conservative Party has a history of turning ruthlessly and suddenly against its leaders. In September 1990, nobody imagined that Margaret Thatcher was even remotely vulnerable. Less than three months later, she was gone. Whether or not Mr. Cameron is ousted after an independence vote, the British government will be reduced to lame-duck status until the election next May. The only issues on the political agenda will be the terms of separation and the Cameron government\u2019s astonishing complacency about presiding over a national breakup. This complacency, which voters, investors and businesses have only just started to notice, was exemplified on Monday when Jeremy Heywood, the head of the British civil service, calmly told a shocked parliamentary committee that government departments were doing absolutely nothing to prepare for the possibility of Scottish independence: \u201cThe government has made it clear that it does not wish to do any contingency planning, and that applies to the civil service. When we are given a clear instruction by ministers, we obey it.\u201d What will all this mean for the 2015 election and subsequent policy, especially on Europe? With the government stumbling and consumed by recriminations between now and next May, it is hard to imagine the present coalition winning re-election, especially given the sense of shock and national failure implied by Scotland\u2019s turning its back on Britain. The probability that a Labour-led government would take charge next year would rise to something like 70 percent or 80 percent. That prospect could well be quite alarming to international investors in Britain and the pound, since Labour will campaign on a platform of higher taxes, shrinking the City of London\u2019s financial activities and abolishing the concessions to foreign residents that make Britain one of the world\u2019s top tax havens. To make matters worse, a Labour-led government would lack the political legitimacy needed to enact its manifesto promises \u2014 even less so to negotiate the terms of separation from Scotland, because its majority would depend on Scottish members of Parliament due for expulsion in 2016, once Scotland left Britain. A constitutional crisis therefore would seem almost inevitable and Labour would have to respond by promising another general election after Scotland\u2019s secession in March 2016. The result would be two years of unprecedented political turmoil and economic policy uncertainty for businesses and investors in Britain, leading up to a second election in mid-2016 that Labour would almost certainly lose to a Conservative Party that by that time would be strongly committed to leaving the European Union. Which brings us finally to the European question. If Scotland leaves the British union, many Conservatives will consider their hold on power in Westminster as almost guaranteed because of the removal of Scotland\u2019s 59 members of Parliament, only one of whom is a Conservative. As a result, the party would surely move much further toward the euro-phobia of its most vocal grass-roots activists. The Tories have already promised to renegotiate Britain\u2019s European Union membership and hold an \u201cIn or Out\u201d referendum in 2017. Whether they are returned to power in 2016 or manage to win re-election next May, the Tories would probably be emboldened by their \u201cnatural\u201d majority in a Britain without Scotland to demand conditions for maintaining Union membership that Brussels, Paris and even Berlin would reject. Thus if Scotland breaks the United Kingdom next week, a chain of events will begin that is likely to end with Britain breaking the European Union. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Deciding Who Gets Overtime Pay ", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEditorialUnder federal labor law, if you are an employee making, say, $11.50 an hour \u2014 which passes for decent pay these days in many jobs \u2014 you would be entitled to time-and-a-half for every hour beyond 40 hours a week. However, if you earn $460 a week in salary you often are not entitled to time-and-a-half for overtime no matter how many extra hours you work \u2014 even though your salary works out to $11.50 an hour. The differing treatment of hourly and salaried workers is an invitation to exploitation. By giving many low-paid workers white-collar titles like shift supervisor or assistant manager, employers justify paying them a salary rather than an hourly wage and deny them overtime. This is the sort of exploitation President Obama spoke about in March when he instructed the Labor Department to update the federal overtime rules. Under labor law dating back to 1938, workers are supposed to get overtime unless they earn a salary high enough to qualify as a professional, an administrator or an executive. The salary threshold that defines a white-collar salary has barely budged since 1975, the last time it was updated for inflation. Today, the threshold is stuck at $455 a week, or $23,660 a year, which is below the poverty line for a family of four. Once an employer pays a worker more than that in salary, the worker is commonly no longer eligible for overtime. Then again, nothing is easy. Raising the salary threshold is being framed by some critics as a threat to young professionals. Their argument is that a low-salary threshold allows young professionals \u2014 corporate interns, junior accountants, assistant professors and the like \u2014 to work virtually unlimited hours early in their careers, without their employers having to worry about paying overtime. If the threshold were raised, an employer might balk at letting them work those extralong hours and that would impede their climb up the career ladder. The problem with this argument is that the overtime law is not about young professionals getting ahead. It is about workers who do not control their own time, are not highly paid and are not in jobs that ever have or ever will command professional salaries. Another problem is that government policy in the Obama administration is often debated and developed by people who were once 80-hour-a-week young professionals themselves, and thus may be susceptible to the argument against an appreciably higher salary threshold. That argument, however, is irrelevant. In updating the overtime rules, the Labor Department should set the salary threshold at around $1,000 a week \u2014 which is where it would be now if it had kept up with inflation and other economic benchmarks over the past several decades.

{"Headline": "In Speech on Mexico Trip, Gov. Christie Lays Out Vision for Energy \u2018Renaissance\u2019", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey offered a prescription for what he called a \u201cNorth American energy renaissance\u201d in an expansive speech here, calling for an end to Washington\u2019s 40-year ban on crude oil exports, faster approval of natural gas pipelines between the United States and Mexico, and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast. On the opening day of Mr. Christie\u2019s trip to Mexico, a rare journey abroad as he considers a run for the presidency, he abandoned his trademark swagger for a data-filled, policy-rich and humility-heavy approach.He quoted the writer Bill Bryson and the energy expert Daniel Yergin. He offered lavish praise for the market-oriented overhauls of the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. And he took pains to present himself, over and over, as an eager student prepared to absorb the lessons of his Mexican counterparts. \u201cI want to listen,\u201d Mr. Christie said at one point. \u201cI have much to learn,\u201d he declared at another. (In one speech, Mr. Christie used the word \u201clisten\u201d four times.) In calling for an end to the prohibition against most crude oil exports, Mr. Christie is siding squarely with the energy industry, which views the rule as an outdated act of economic protectionism that is hampering the United States economy and increasing global fuel prices. The United States prohibited most crude exports to conserve domestic oil reserves after the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s. But over the past few decades, American production of oil and natural gas has risen drastically, transforming the United States into a world leader that can afford to send its domestic energy overseas, experts say. That, Mr. Christie said, \u201chas changed the strategic equation, making our continent less vulnerable to imports from the Middle East or unstable sources elsewhere.\u201dAlthough careful not to mention President Obama by name, Mr. Christie offered a forceful critique of the president\u2019s delay in approving the Keystone XL pipeline, asserting that it had hurt American-Canadian relations, squandered a chance to lower energy prices and produced a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on similar investments across North America. \u201cIt should have been done a long time ago,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cIt should be done today.\u201dMr. Christie traveled here on Wednesday with a coterie of aides and a surprise guest: his oldest son, Andrew, who forfeited his final week of summer vacation to accompany his father to Mexico. The younger Mr. Christie, a junior at Princeton who is said to have a keen interest in public policy, joined his father for lunch with the United States ambassador to Mexico and the Mexican ambassador to the United States. He lugged a thick white briefing binder as he shuttled from meeting to meeting. Might there be a bipartisan summit meeting in the Latin American metropolis, a show of domestic political good will on foreign soil? No, aides to Mr. Christie said. There would not. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Slow Growth, Experts Say, Health Spending Is Expected to Climb", "Date": "2014-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Government experts on Wednesday predicted a rebound in national health care spending as expansions in coverage and improvements in the economy take hold after four years of exceptionally slow growth in the nation\u2019s medical bills.The combined effects of the Affordable Care Act, faster economic growth and the aging of the population will fuel the growth of health spending this year and in the coming decade, according to a report by a team of nonpartisan economists and actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\u201cThe period in which health care has accounted for a stable share of economic output is projected to end in 2014, primarily because of the coverage expansions of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said the report, by Andrea M. Sisko and colleagues at the federal health care agency.Still, they said, even as millions of people gain coverage, the average annual rate of increase in health spending through 2023 will be somewhat lower than it was in the two decades before the recession that began in late 2007.In their annual projections of health spending, the experts predicted that the total would climb 5.6 percent this year and then an average of 6 percent a year until 2023, when health care will account for 19.3 of the nation\u2019s total output \u2014 two percentage points more than last year.From 2013 to 2015, the new report says, federal spending on Medicaid will increase 27 percent to $323 billion, from $254 billion. In those years, it said, Medicaid spending by state and local governments will rise 12 percent to $218 billion, from $195 billion.The federal government will initially pay all the costs resulting from the expansion of Medicaid eligibility in states that choose to cover certain childless adults with low incomes. States will have to pay some of the cost for new beneficiaries who could have qualified for Medicaid under old eligibility rules.The experts estimated that spending on prescription drugs would increase at a rapid clip, rising 6.8 percent this year and 6.4 percent next year.While many factors will tend to increase the use of prescription drugs, the experts estimate that drugs will account for the same share of total health spending, 9.4 percent, in 2023 as in 2013.Ms. Sisko and her colleagues said that the growth of health spending in recent years had been constrained not just by the recession, but also by an unusually slow economic recovery.Obama administration officials have said that innovations in the delivery of health care, inspired by the Affordable Care Act, are reining in the growth of health spending. The authors of the report said they were hopeful but wanted to see the results of demonstration projects.\u201cIt\u2019s still too soon to say what the ultimate impact of the delivery reforms will be,\u201d Ms. Sisko said.The experts forecast substantial growth in Medicare enrollment and spending, but said the growth in spending would be moderated by cutbacks in payments to private Medicare Advantage plans, which cover about 30 percent of beneficiaries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jerry Brown Seeks More Electric Cars in California", "Date": "2014-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legislation is designed to make electric cars more affordable for low-income residents, and the intent is to have at least one million zero-emission and near-zero-emission vehicles on the state\u2019s roads by 2023.Under the legislation, the State Air Resources Board will be asked to draft a plan that does more to allow low-income residents to access the state\u2019s rebate program, implemented in 2010. So far, the program has issued more than 75,000 rebates for electric and hybrid cars.The new plan will give low-income drivers who want to purchase or lease an electric car extra credits. Related legislation that Mr. Brown signed Sunday will also install charging stations for electric vehicles in apartment buildings in low-income neighborhoods and offer assistance to car-sharing programs as well.Mr. Brown also signed related legislation that allows more electric vehicles to use car pool lanes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jordan Finds Energy Sources in Unlikely Places", "Date": "2014-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGreen ColumnWhen the oil gusher lottery came to the Middle East, Jordan seemed to have drawn a losing ticket. And now that some of the neighbors it depended on for fuel supplies, like Iraq and Egypt, have convulsed with political or sectarian strife, Jordan is frantically looking for other sources \u2014 and finding them in unexpected places.It is \u201cpotentially an enormous deal, but one that makes Jordan partially dependent on Israel, which is politically very problematic for Jordan in both domestic and regional politics,\u201d Curtis Ryan, an expert on Jordanian politics at Appalachian State University in North Carolina, said in an email.The plan, Dr. Ryan said, is \u201ca difficult political sell in Jordanian politics under any circumstances \u2014 but especially right now,\u201d in the wake of Israel\u2019s strikes on the Gaza Strip.Because Jordan has neighbors \u2014 which also include Saudi Arabia and Iraq \u2014 that are awash in oil or natural gas, a conspiracy theory of sorts has developed that Jordan is hiding its oil, according to Zu\u2019bi Al-Zu\u2019bi, dean of the business school at the University of Jordan.Jordan imports about 95 percent of its energy, according to Dr. Al-Zu\u2019bi and other experts. In recent years, its natural gas imports had come mostly from Egypt (before that, Jordan had relied heavily on cheap oil from Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq). Repeated attacks on the Egyptian pipeline following the 2011 ouster of President Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring uprisings forced Jordan to look for alternatives.The pipeline attacks were \u201cdevastating for Jordan\u2019s economy,\u201d Dr. Ryan said. The nation \u201cwas already in an economic downturn and deeply in debt, and the constant sabotage of the pipeline effectively turned off Jordan\u2019s supply dozens of times.\u201dCompounding the challenge, the country\u2019s population has soared, in part because of refugees from Syria, Iraq and other nations. International institutions have leaned on Jordan to cut energy subsidies even as the costs of reliable sources of energy have risen. The Jordanian government has increased energy prices for consumers, but that is never a popular move.Jordan\u2019s electricity is now generated mostly from a mix of Saudi oil and Egyptian gas, Dr. Al-Zu\u2019bi said. Jordan is \u201cin a very vulnerable situation,\u201d he added, likening it to Lebanon, another relatively energy-poor country, which is trying to import liquefied natural gas.\u201cJordan would be well placed to make great use of both solar and wind power, but needs the internal push and the external support to make that really happen,\u201d Dr. Ryan said.And Jordan will always be looking for new suppliers. This month, it held talks with Cyprus about importing gas.Jordan\u2019s predicament shows the importance for a country not to be \u201cover reliant on a particular type of energy source,\u201d Dr. Ryan said. Given the region\u2019s volatility, he added, countries should also avoid being \u201cover reliant on any one country as a supplier.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Love Them or Loathe Them, Reverse Mortgages Have a Place", "Date": "2014-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money\u201cI can\u2019t even imagine a scenario where a reverse mortgage should be considered anything but radioactive,\u201d said one comment.And: \u201cThey\u2019re nothing but a scam that nobody with any common sense should fall for,\u201d according to another.\u201cThese vehicles are the province of the most unscrupulous of lenders and would be outlawed in a more civilized society,\u201d said a third.But this summer, BNY Mellon got back into the business as a servicer and securitizer of the loans. And several respectable researchers have endorsed certain uses of reverse mortgages; one has even gone so far as to invest money in a start-up reverse mortgage lender. A series of legal and regulatory changes intended to lower the number of defaults have also taken effect or are about to.Many of the people entering or examining the reverse mortgage business now describe their interest in it as a sort of conversion. Even half a decade ago, Michael Gordon, BNY Mellon\u2019s head of retirement and strategic solutions, would never have suggested that the company come near the product. Companies considering a potential customer generally did not check to make sure that the borrower would be able to afford property taxes and home insurance payments. They also did not disqualify many borrowers for whom the loan was simply not suitable.That\u2019s changing now, and BNY Mellon\u2019s news release about its intentions was replete with happy talk about buying only loans that lenders had underwritten in a \u201csocially responsible\u201d manner. Mr. Gordon is quick to note that the product is not right for everyone. But he also thinks that many retirees with investment portfolios that are half in stocks and half in bonds are unaware of their true asset allocation. After all, their home equity is an asset too. Many people have an awful lot of it, and those who bought retirement homes in 2005 know all too well how much of it can disappear.\u201cWe have this idea as human beings that we live at the end of history and all facts are known,\u201d he said. \u201cBut my sense here is that we\u2019re still figuring out how your home is supposed to fit with the rest of your assets.\u201dHer conviction brings her no particular joy. \u201cWhen I look forward, I don\u2019t see how people are going to have enough, I really don\u2019t,\u201d she said. People spend their adult lives paying off their mortgages, and those with pensions were often able to avoid using that home equity in retirement. \u201cOur assessment going forward is that it\u2019s a luxury we\u2019re not going to be able to afford,\u201d Ms. Munnell added. \u201cThey are going to need money, and this is the place where the money is.\u201dMr. Evensky hadn\u2019t given reverse mortgages much thought over the years or wondered how they could help stabilize client portfolios. \u201cLike most practitioners, my attitude was that I thought they were terrible and that the costs were usurious,\u201d he said.Mr. Evensky earns no money from recommending reverse mortgages, and he takes pains to be clear on how people should use the loans. \u201cIt\u2019s strictly as a risk management tool, not as leverage or an investment vehicle,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of allowing investors to have a long-term portfolio and not be forced to sell at the wrong times.\u201dLenders have asked the well-respected Mr. Evensky to use his research in new releases, he said, and are prone to wanting to oversell it or extrapolate it to other uses. The industry, where loan originations have fallen roughly by half in recent years, has a slight whiff of desperation about it.Call the loans and the lenders and the executives who run them all the names you want. But the tool they sell is one whose time is coming, and people who refuse even to consider a reverse mortgage in the coming years may do themselves a disservice.Twitter: @ronlieber Advertisement"}
